This is a wonderfully, beautiful duet!  Has become one of my new favorite love songs.  Actually heard the live version first (thanks to a youtube video) and just had to have a copy.  Unable to find a downloadable version of the live recording, however, I chose this one instead and am equally pleased.  Their voices are so amazing together!  Highly recommend. :)	1
Cher is clearly a very talented singer with a unique voice.  I really enjoy this duet.  I have heard it on the radio occasionally for years and was happy to find it available as a single to buy for my Kindle Fire.  A nice romantic song.	1
It's easy to purchase your favorite songs on Amazon. You have the choice of playing them on your Cloud Player or adding them to your MP3 so you can have them with you.	1
Great songs, Great voice. Listen to here almost every evening instead of watching the television. So relaxing and very elegant.	1
i love marsalis and jazz music, his family is quite talented.  listened to it over and over again ... i also got other selections from the marsalis family.	1
I love songs by Sinatra... good price, easy download, quick payment and you get it right away.  What else can you ask for?	1
Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas might just be the very best Christmas song there is. Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. "In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow." Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him "I like your Christmas song" but that he needed that line "jollied up" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said "The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?" And,of course,as Martin put it "You don't say no to Frank Sinatra." The new lyrics in this line became "Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough." Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics. Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down. :)	1
Love this artist and great sounding jazz and album.	1
LOVE IT	1
Only downfall was that I purchased for my uncles funeral memorial and was not able to download it to another place after I purchased it so was really a waste of money.	1
I love this song.  Music is fun, uplifting, and motivating. This song is no exception.  It move me. Listen and judge for yourself.	1
this is probably grover washingtons most played and known hit,it is definatly an old school classic,check it out,you won't be disappointed!!!!!!	1
I like Grover Washington's music, the beat and sometimes I want music with no words. Just great and enjoyable music	1
This is old school music and another great to take away all the stress from your day. Great music..GREAT!!! RELAXING!!!	1
Old school music, jazz that everyone in my age group is looking for.  Bring back that relaxing feeling. Love it!	1
I really enjoy listening to Grover Washington and consider "Mister Magic" to be one of his best.  It's so smooth and makes me feel good.	1
so rightfully named, Mister Magic is a magical groove, funky, soulful, jazzy all in one.  Nice riding music, I love it.	1
This one was okay. It was the one that I was thinking about but I do like it. Its on my Kindle fire	1
You can't go wrong if you're a jazz lover...Grover Washington is the man  definitely he was a great SAX Player.	1
This song has got to be my favorites of all time, of all of Elton Jonn's songs. The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes, if you are in the right frame of mind. The music too matches the lyrics, in that, it too is beautiful. It far outstrips Candle in the Wind, for beauty. It is a song about giving God Thanks, for certain people in his life, that have changed the person's life for the better, no matter what happened to the contrary. It is truly a work of art. Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this. It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list. I would suggest that you buy it. At least, give a good listen. Maybe a second and a third, until you can hear all the words clearly. He sings things like "I know why roses don't grow in New York" and other things like that you probably aren't expecting. Just buy the song and let it enrich your life. The words alone could be a poem to people we love; who make a difference in our lives. A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones. Who could pass up something like that? I know I can't...	1
SPOILERS FOLLOW  I had no idea this song was on Elton John's record "Honky Chateau."  I knew it was an Elton John song, and that it was featured in Cameron Crowe's movie "Almost Famous."  I also knew I loved it.  It is both plaintive and reassuring, talking about the confusion that life can bring about and how it throws a mass of people together in society.  "Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters" is one of Elton John's all-time classic songs.	1
Good stuff!!!!!!!!	1
Great Song!	1
Music is a personal preference and therefore ratings don't see too appropriate.  But, I do like the song.	1
I never really had a clue nor even cared what this song was about for 40 years. You can find out at (where else) wikipedia. It just sounded so pretty. The music & lyrics fit perfectly. I think it's one of Elton & Bernies last "pure" songs before they went hopelessly commercial on the next (and partially on this) album.	1
Who doesn't love this song or for that matter if your over 40 Elton John! Any song he sings is great!	1
For years as a kid I remember Tell me your thoughts on God and am glad I spend the 69 cents to get it, great song, great memories.	1
It's one of those songs that makes you think, and it reminded me of a time when I was on the last semester of my college years, and wondering some of the mysteries of God.  Because honestly, if I didn't like the song, why in the world would I buy it?  The audio quality is just fine.  =)	1
Tell me your thoughts on God, this is a good song and while I purchase a lot of music by the song not eery song makes my list of songs to buy.	1
A must for Animal lovers	1
I don't think I had ever heard the long version of this song until I found it on Amazon. It makes you stop and think about what our young men went through during the Vietnam war.	1
GOOD	1
rec item	1
Apparently, this is a true story about Eminem and one of his fans-unnerving and brilliant-so much talent-incredible event-you never how what we say affects someone else-	1
Great song, long length. Thought provoking. Brings back good memories from the 90s. You'll ask yourself.. where was I when I heard that?	1
Never used the drug itself, but just love the cadence  of the song and the guitar-playing.  An all time favorite.	1
I knew I had to have this song in my kindle fire library. It sounds great on my headphones - I knew it would.	1
This is one of those fine tunes that just sound beautiful, no matter how old it gets. It's got a 1980's time frame written all over it, but for music, that wasn't a bad decade at all. I shall play it "OFTEN", especially while cruising down the highway.	1
Great song	1

One of my all time favorites.	1

I've always liked this tune. Jackson Browne has a good one too	1

I am a huge music fan and listen to all types - mainly pop, R&B, dance, country & hip-hop.  But this song is fantastic!  Such a great, funky feel to it.  Was totally worth buying.	1
Oh Baby, want to get in the mood for old-time rock and roll. This will do it for you. Enjoy.	1
great song	1
Enjoyed.	1
very good music thank again	1
Nice song	1
I loved it in the 70's when our love was new. I still love it, when my Love is gone.	1
It was so fun to hear this song at our 40th Class reunion.  Being able to download song to iPhone was easy.	1
Gorgeous song and well done by Dianna Ross.  She was at the top of her solo career and this song became one of her anthems.  If you are a fan, don't leave this out of your collection.	1
It's music. I needed it for something. What else can I say?	1
I love this Christmas song and had a good time purchasing this and more of my Christmas favorites. Good price too.	1
I love this song.  It really puts me in the Christmas mood.  So festive.  I would recommed this song to anyone who enjoys dancing, singing, and just being merry.  Get this song, you will love it.	1
This song is virtually never played on the radio where I live, and I never knew who sang it.  Now I can hear it anytime I want!	1
I was really impressed with the sound quality of this download. I know this song is from the early 80s but the quality of the production is as good and any today.  Amazing harmonies, excellent guitar playing, etc! I've always loved this song but never seemed to pick it up but for .99 cents sheesh - I've paid $15 for albums that stunk.  Great great song.	1
GREAT SONG.	1

One of the old classic greats!	1

Rare and forgotten classic rock track realeased circa '79 or '80. Great addition to any classic rock playlist. Will bring back great memories for some.	1
A classic!	1
a good album	1
Loved it	1
oldie but goodie	1
i remember listening to this song when i was about 20 years old and still living in florida.	1
Love it! Thank you!	1
this also was a nice addition to my mp3 collection . I  really liked this song from the very beginning . it really rocks .	1
IMHO, the best Donnie Iris ever did.  Solid rock and great vocals.  A classic rock love ballad, and great driving music.  Put the pedal down!	1
"Ah! Leah!" encapsulates the sound of 80's Rock, strong guitar solo, strong electronics/keyboard, and Iris hit those high notes. The lyrics are good, too - it's a song about a man and woman who can't get along long term but who have no problem with conjugal visits ;) Have a listen, you'll love it.	1
Easy Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fast Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Problems what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
in the past you would hear a song on the radio and go Woah!  That was the case when I heard this tune.  I heard it on a DC radio station.  I later learned that this song was mostly popular around Pittsburgh, where Iris was from.  My favorite Iris tunes are this one and 'Love is Like a Rock'.  Both are great tunes.	1
Never had a girlfriend named Leah.....but the song makes you want to go out and get one.  This song Rocks......you have heard it before.....now take it home.	1
Maybe one of my all-time favorite songs!!  The classic "one-hit-wonder" tune if their ever was!  His follow-ups paled by comparison. (Not an indication of other works by him, just that this was so good!)	1
I was in a regular bar in Pittsburgh and Donnie Iris walks in and plays a song or two.  Well you have to respect a performer that remembers his home town.  My good friend even named his daughter Leah because of this song.	1
I heard this song on the radio and really liked it. He should be played more often. I only know one other song by him.	1
Awesome tune!  I have always loved this tune and in fact named my daughter "Aleah" after it.  I have had nothing but great results from Amazon MP3 downloads and prefer them over all those other sites offering them.  Better quality and user friendly as far as getting them onto your computer and/or player.	1
When I was little, my mom used to play this song over and over.  When she became ill, I wanted to find songs from when she was young to try and cheer her up.  This one of the ones that I chose.	1
Diana Ross is one of a kind, and this was one of my favorite songs of hers.  Love it.	1
There are not too many songs that are able to survive with the same character year after year. The song quality is on target.	1
I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.	1
Good MP3 Sound Quaility. Didn't want the entire album, so I downloaded this song from amazon. Sound quaility is very good. Made a cd with my favorites and this song was needed. Would recommend this song ...	1
If you don't know this song already,...... you REALLY need to download it if you like real rock.	1
This young guy shows up. He plugs in his Stratocaster...AND JUST BLEW EVERYONE AWAY. Eric was a true born master. He could write, he could play anything from early progressive, to the blues. He laid the foundation of Rock n Roll, and built a mountain atop it. A mountain, that ALL those to come would aspire to summit. They stand upon his shoulders..even now... Eric was so creative that he was asked, time and again, to come and play alongside some of the most unforgettable musicians, and the most unforgettable bands of all time.  But tragedy struck. The pain was unbearable. A huge piece of Eric disappeared. I know just exactly how he felt, and how he still feels....  And that's all I'm gonna say about that.	1

You can't go wrong with this classic although there is a dramatic difference between Clapton's slow acoustic version and the faster and louder version by the original Derek and the Dominos. Both great.	1

I had forgotten about this song by Elton John. I am a fan of Elton John and this is one of his great ones.	1
Elton John has many great songs and this one is no exception. This man continues to belt them out. Check it out.	1
There is no question that this year marks Elton John's 45th Anniversary since he & Bernie Taupin met and became one of the most definitive songwriting teams in the world. There have been so many classics that have been so strong for both of them. But of all of them from the 80's, the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past. It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well, where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton, because of his abuse and marriage ended, it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony. If you're new to Elton John, this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans, and that is a sacrifice worth taking.  Song: A-	1
The teddy bear loving paw of the piano climbs his way into a song of great emotional rift and feeling. Why don't the great self centered meatballs of music production play this song on the radio or the net. They are wackos that don't know a hit from ahola...that's what... Where the Hell is the music award for this song.   Do you know what I'm doing here I'm bringing this song back from the dead. Do you know why Because I know music and this song never got the respect it deserved. Screw American Idol. Let see them write a song and Play the piano and sing like this Grizzly could. Tell me this song is not underrated, Tell me this song sucks...I dare you too!	1
"A Single Man" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.  "Return to Paradise" might just be; what with those beautiful falsetto vocals, "Georgia" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up "Tumbleweed Connection". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs "Madness", "Reverie" and "Song for Guy", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; "Madness" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; "Reverie" is brief but effective, and "Song for Guy" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.  The other songs aren't bad. "I don't care" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. "Part-time love" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1/4 or 2.25	-1
This is an old time favorite Xmas song from back when I was young had to have it.	1
loved it	1
It's great, make it a part of you mix of Christmas music.	1
I wish I had friends like Eric Clapton sounds like he wants to be friends with a girl in this song. I was about to spend the rest of my life laying on the floor when being a highly medicated individual made the world feel like it was spinning around every time I stood up. I get stiff when I sit for a long time. My body loves this song and listening to Eric Clapton play the guitar. All he asks is:  Don't you think you want someone to talk to?	1
This is a great old tune. It totally grabs my attention in the first few notes. You can't beat Eric Clapton's voice and the guitar is great too. A good tune added to my collection of oldies.	1
I always had a slight fascination with this tune. Just a very simple song by Eric Clapton and almost country like in its execution. Great hit from a talented guitarist.	1
I like most things Eric Clapton sings	1

Love the song.	1
love it	1
I have this song on a record, but wanted it in an MP3 format. It's a great oldies song and I enjoy listening to it on my computer.	1
I just recently heard this song on an oldies station and decided I must have it.  Amazon has a wonderful library of songs and I enjoy finding them.	1
Heard it on the Michael Berry Show... A great song! It will stick with you for a long, long time!	1
a ok	1
Love this song!! Great to have it in my Workout list!	1
Tells the story of old folks as well as young lovers!  Excellent.	1
always good listen'n	1
When I first heard it I thought it said dust on the Bible which would have been fitting too.  Great song.	1
Great country song with very meaningful lyrics.  Many people would classify this as an oldie, but the style is definitly contemporary.	1
i love david lee muphy! he has a great voice and always makes me smile at his music. try him. you won't be disappointed!	1
I Shot the Sheriff is true Eric Clapton.  It is one of those songs where you can close your eyes and visualize the song and lyrics.	1
This is the best  cover done by Eric (Slowhand) Clapton. You'll never get tired of hearing this song. I don't.	1
My wife loved this song because it sticks in her mind like glue once you hear it.  Good Mp3  download  Choice	1
The price of the song was reasonable. Song sound was clean and untampered with. I appreciate the product. Love this song.	1
I usually have a hard time with such senitmental songs.  I lost my dad to cancer in 2003 near Christmas.  This song somehow makes me stay positive when I think about him and everything I wish I could say to him and show him (especially his grandson who was born in 2005).  Such a wonderful, inspirational song.	1
Now truthfully, who DOESN'T love this song? It is the most romantic date night song in history! Play this one guys and she will melt in your arms. ;)	1
A good slow dance to dance with your wife / girlfriend too.  Nice slow riffs from Clapton, takes us how a husband had a bit too much to drink, and his devoted wife helps him home.	1
Great!	1
I like this song.	1
prime member don't understand why I pay for each song?	1
Pure Eric Clapton!	1
I have always been a fan of Eric Clapton, ever since he was with the British band 'Cream', starting back in 1966. This is one of his iconic songs. It was released in several versions.  I chose this one because, in my opinion, it really expresses the deep felt emotion of the song. It is my favorite. The MP3 sound quality is quite satisfactory.	1
love the song	1
A very lovely song by Eric	1

Who doesn't love Clapton or anything he's done? LOVE this song.	1
Probably one of my top five songs of all time. Wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton is a beautiful song. I love listening to it when I'm in a sad type mood. I had no problems finding, downloading or listening to this song through Amazon digital music.  I also have Amazon's music app on my phone for easy listening to all and any songs that I have purchased through Amazon. I highly highly recommend this song to everyone who has hearing! Everyone should hear this song!	1

Wonderful by Eric Clapton is a heartfelt classic love rock song that covers what it feels like to be with someone who sees the inner and outer beauty of you.  Yes, I understand that the singer is actually singing about his love interest who turns many heads at the party they attend.  However, I think that it can also be  a positive love song about two people who are in a relationship together who also keep on the rose-colored glasses (metaphorically speaking) even after they have been together for a long time.	1
Blast from the past!!!	1
Allways LOVED it, still do	1
I must say that Amazon has the best selection for Classic Rock, which will be here for all times. No music will ever compare to the music of that era. I have so far purchased 688 songs from Amazon over the years. Not all Classic Rock, for I do like Christian Hymns very much. But they always have a great selection no matter what genre you are looking for.	1
Great for our party playlist...	1

My favorite song from Eric Clapton. Both the vocal and musical arrangements blow me away. I Never get tired listening to it.	1
This is very soothing and loving.  Just great!	1
It's always been my favorite song. It was my first dance as a new bride with my first husband. My new hubby always turns it off everytime it comes on, now I can hear it anytime I want lol	1

What a song! This is a song that you can listen to over & over.	1
Great melody to add to my collection. If you need a slow, easy melody to put you to sleep or lighten your mood, Wonderful Tonight is your ticket to snooze.  Love it.	1
you cannot go wrong with Eric Clapton.  Wonderful Tonight is how every one wants to be seen by their love or even just the one night date.	1
This is a classic song that I have played many times at weddings.  This is the original and it is well done by a performer who is a legend.	1
There are a lot of various performances of Clapton's version of Wonderful tonight and this is pretty good, but does not quite have the punch that Pegatha Sue's version of the sax solo has. Otherwise OK.	1
Love this song!  Can picture the scene as it plays out.  A favorite every time I hear it!  Thank you!	1
Awesome track awesome album awesome artist. Nothing bad to say.  Love Eric Clapton and all of his music. Would recommend	1
This downloaded easily and sounds great when played on my Kindle Fire.  This has been a long time favorite of mine.	1
This is one of those songs that when you hear it, you can't wait to hear it again and again.  Eric Clapton's delivery of this song is unique but so very beautiful.	1
Excellent song. Love It much!!  Would recommend it to R&B lovers everywhere.  Really good price for for one great song.	1
This is perhaps EDDIE KENDRICK'S signature solo jam after the TEMPTATIONS. I call it his express jam, because it is such a jam, when you hear it driving, you tend to want to speed up to the beat! Back in the day, if you were walking, you wanted to speed up a little and walk your cool walk. The extended version is most satifying.	1
It's Eric Clapton and a greatest hit album so you have many of hit greatest songs all on one album. The digital quality is fantastic.  Highly recommend.	1
How wonderful to hear such a talented man and wonderful voice sing a love song to his wife......It is one that brings all couples of all ages onto the dance floor everytime. It doesn't get much better than this.	1
Such a sweet and tender love song.  Reminds me of an old flame.  The way Mr. Clapton controls his voice makes the song that much better.	1
Happened across this cut while listening to Pandora, had to purchase being an old Clapton fan.  Gotta love it !	1
Great to play every Friday at 5PM	1
Good one	1
I have always loved this song! This isn't the remix with the commentary but, great "base" version of the song. If anyone knows where I could get the version with the commentary, please let me know. Thanks!!	1
I love this song and it fits for what usually happens on Friday's and the weekend with friends and family	1
Great tune with an awesome meaning! TGIF all the way! I could listen to this song over and over cranked up. Sing it, George! 5 stars and beyond.:)	1
I am not a rap fan that much, but listening to this song was like WOW. The lyrics are strong, the background music ROX, and the background vocals I love. It's a tough song that even those that hate rap will change there mind. To me I really don't consider this a true rap song it's more of a rock/rap if that makes sense. I would recommend this song to anyone, it's truly not your typical Eminem song, if you liked Lose Yourself by him you will love this one. If you haven't heard of this song, try the Amazon MP3 sample you will not be disappointed.  THX, Kris L. CocKayne	1
Eminem you either like him or hate him but he has some great music with great beats that are great to workout to.	1
The dude is way talented. Any white man who can pull off the hip hop stuff/image that he has done is pretty darn amazing. Till I Collapse is a great song about basically working your tail off. Enough said.	1
we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)	1
Great song by Eminem. I'm glad hes back and rocking out the songs!! If your feeling down then listen to the song and it will pick you back up.	1

Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. "Just send for me, oh baby."  "Remember the day I set you free I told you you could always count on me From that day on, I made a vow, I'll be there when you want me, Some way, some how.  'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough, Ain't no valley low enough, Ain't no river wide enough To keep me from getting to you babe.  My love is alive Way down in my heart Although we are miles apart If you ever need a helping hand, I'll be there on the double As fast as I can. Don't you know that there  Ain't no mountain high enough, Ain't no valley low enough, Ain't no river wide enough To keep me from getting to you babe."	1

I remember first hearing this song in the 1960's (originally put out by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell) and have always loved it. Diana Ross did 2 covers of it and I liked them both. 5 stars from me, but listen to the audio clip before you buy it.	1
Yep another grunger that did not keep it intact. Very sad, this kid had a very cool voice as in this song. I feel in love with it. Yep a utube special. The voice is unique in so many ways. From his living in Washington, as did eddie Vedder. The pronouncing of words that just sounds so cool when they sing.  It is different and u can hear it. And you gotta have a very good voice. I believe if this kid lived and got his crap together he would be singing stuff people would buy today.	1
This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.	1
Oldies but goodies	1
I ordered this song because i liked it. this is my obligated review. At least you get to sample the music like at the Virgin record store before you buy so i'm not sure if I could have a complaint...unless it's rap music, modern day rap then i wouldn't be purchasing it...just complaining	1
great	1
I listened to several versions of this song, once I discovered the joy of buying just one song on the internet. The sample wasn't enough to hear if it was the version I wanted, and I also downloaded another one, but it wasn't "the one." This is the one I've been looking for.	1
had to buy this tune even as a single purchase.  it brings back so many great memories.  so easy to transact and transport these single tunes from Amazon.	1
Diana wowed us when she sang this.  I will always love Marvin and Tammy's version as well, but the arrangement that was done for Diana, they literally helped her to make this song her own.	1
In 1966 These Beautiful Ladies Ruled the radio...REFLECTIONS  was their last recording as a group,with Diana The Boss"Ross branching out to do her own thing solo .....Great Song ...1966 was the first time I heard synthesized music "REFLECTIONS" Yea .....	1
Great.	1
I'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual.  I'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome.  "Reflections" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released.  This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years, and I wouldn't mind listening to it a million times myself.  Here we go!  It starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery-type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I've heard the song so many times, I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind.  Then Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!  Then we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense-building "ooooo, oo-oo-oo" behind Diana's powerful vocals.  Listen to the perfectly executed way the "oooo" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line "Through the mirrors of my mind, through these tears I am crying".  With the Supremes providing back-up, now this song takes on a whole new meaning.  Without the Supremes Diana's vocals would have been great as it is, but WITH the Supremes?  Now it's just insanely good!  What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line "I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.  It took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.  The song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings "Reflections of, the way life used to be" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future.  The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and won't dare repeat the same mistakes again.  And just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- "In the UFO!"  No Diana is actually saying "In the you and I" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line "happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories" and the line near the end "I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.  So what is it about "Reflections" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing.	1
Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!	1
I honestly believe this is going to play over and over on the oldies station in a few years because it is a classic song of the time. It is fun, upbeat, and clean. Can't ask for much more.	1
I've always loved this song. It reminds me of college and college songs. I'll never stop loving it.	1
Never gets old.  Love it.	1
I heard the song on the radio the other day.  I had it stuck in my head all day, and decided to buy it.  It's mostly for nostalgia.	1
I love this song! It may be old to some, but this song has a great beat to it! Love!	1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	1
No, it wouldn't be the same without you!	1
One of my favorite Eminem songs.	1
The stars say it all, don't know what else I could put other than I love it.	1
Our whole family loves Eminem; I've put in several reviews on him, and if you read them you'll know my thought on censored vs. Explicit; I won't exhaust the opinion here.  It's a great song, I'm glad we could get it without having to buy a whole CD, and Eminem is consistently awesome!!!	1
Because I only bought the song as an Mp3 download, the only thing I can say is that the Amazon download process is a bit of a pain.	1
I just love Eminem ANYWAY, and this particular song is one of my favorites.  Even though he's touted to be vulgar or nasty, I don't agree with that.  Yes he does need censored sometimes for the younger peeps, but his sense of humor is awesome and I always get a kick out of his songs that are funny.	1
Love 90's music	1
Feeling Nostalgic!  Used to yell at my daughter 15 years ago for paying this over and over.  Now I sometimes do!!  LOL	1
The stars say it all, don't know what else I could put other than I love it.	1
This is a good product.  Filled the need for which i was searching.  I give it four stars as my rating.	1
I love the fact that I can find old music I grew up with on the mp3 format. It is a great song with a lot of meaning for me so getting it was wonderful.	1
Great!	1
Beautiful song!	1
I love this song,and Ms. Adams' interpretation. The song has a great deal of meaning to me,and I use it as a background to days when "getting here" isn't possible.	1
only they had him says when is the most beautiful voices in banks have different I hope you enjoy it cuz I do	1
One of my all time favorite songs.	1
Great song.	1
Wrote already	1
Thank You	1
very nice	1
Heard this song on "The Voice" and loved it.  I had no idea who sung it, but I knew I needed it to be part of my collection.	1
These days it is much harder to actually find singers that have shown simplicity in song where it is actually worthwhile in heart. That is something today's divas have taken for granted in song. But there are some that haven't been given that credit, past being labeled as a one-hit wonder. Oleta Adams is one of those singers that had made that mark beautifully with one glimmer on the charts with her rendition of the Piano In The Dark Singer, Brenda Russell's song Get Here. The song is definitely one of those that shows strength and beauty with age like a fine wine after years of heart. I still love listening to this song each and every time this comes into heart. If you have never even heard a Oleta Adams song before, this is absolutely the one song to go to. So say you're going to get there to this beauty.  Song: B+	1
This song never gets old or boring. So beautifully written and well performed. Tank's version is great as well! Thank you.	1
I love her voice. She can just break out in song. She can play the piano well. The daughter of a minister. Talented lady.	1
Nice to be able to pick up a single hit off of a CD for a good price.  I don't bu very many CD's anymore becuase of the price, and the fact that there are usually only a couple of songs on the CD that I really like to begin with.  Buying a single makes it easy to improve the audio library without spending a lot.  Thanks!	1
I bought this song to go on my son's wedding DVD.  This is the song I picked for the son and mother dance.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.  Love that I can buy just one song instead of the whole dvd.	1
It is really a promise of dedicated parenting.  I love the song and wanted to use it on some of my family videos.	1
This song reveals the wonders we all have about the unborn and the Love they will have in the future.	1
The song is absolutely beautiful -- this particular recording is clear and crisp -- sounds awesome on my iRiver -- highly recommend this download!	1
Who doesn't love mp3's	1
downloaded this song on my laptop and it is a very clear and good download. burnt it to a disc and I listen to it all the time.	1
Its a song. You either like it or you don't. Obviously I did. That would be why I bought it.	1
we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)	1
Awesome!	1
Kurt Cobain does this old blues song justice. Not one to miss.	1
It's one of the most beautiful yet heart-wrenching songs he's ever done. The lyrics are so moving it nearly brings you to tears.	1
When it has came down to Elton John, musically the 90's definitely brought out the best in Elton's voice, after getting his life back together from vices, and fallout from the media in England, he reemerged brilliantly with his music, and the music from his 1992 album The One definitely showed that in a melodic way. The Last Song definitely still shows that. It is still as beautiful and simple from Elton's talent, singing about A.I.D.S. after losing his friends and loved ones from Freddie Mercury of Queen to Ryan White, he definitely still knows that even after 20 years after this song came out, it still clicks very well and intimately with Elton's voice and sonnet. If you've haven't heard any of Elton John's songs from the 90's, this is absolutely one worth checking out.  Song: A	1
This song seems like it was written for me. Like in the song My Father came to see me at the lowest point in my life and I really did misjudge the love between a Father and his son. My Father passed away and I'm 42 years old now and every time I hear this song I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes.  Elton John puts alot of heart and soul in the songs he creates and nearly every one in my opinion is a classic, this one included.	1
This has a great beat, the music is so good and the lyrics are heart felt, I enjoy this song and this singer.	1
loved this song of course. this is a good song while on the elliptical machine at the gym.  I love a variety music to listen to on my MP3 player, because of the hours I spend at the gym .  Great song. You will like it too..	1
had to get this one for my husband, he likes most of the Eminem songs. and it's cheaper to buy one song here and there than it is to buy the whole album. thnx amazon.	1
I love this song. Of all the slow songs Elton John has done this one has to be the most unique of the bunch. It has that 80's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places; making a melody that is both complex and familiar. Elton's singing is at its best here. The song takes me to places when I hear it. He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner, giving a little edge just where the song needs it. I am baffled this track wasn't included in any of the greatest hits collections. It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S.  If you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes.	1
Great Music	1
Serious music. Dark and full of portent. Superb Arrangement!	1
Trouble Man Marvin Gaye  SAY NO MORE!	1
Just Perfect :}	1
Just listen to this. I don't really know what else to say. I picked it up off Falcon's suggest to Captain America in Winter Soldier and it was worth it.  It's a great song.	1
Great comical song from Denis Leary.	1
Aren't we all ?	1
A classic song, that I enjoy every time.	1
Regular somewhat racist, no holds bars Denis Leary. Mainly purchased for the chorus to make fun of people I know. Good fun song if you can handle Leary's unique voice (at times his general tone does bug me).	1
The Fox is one of Elton's least known outputs in his entire catalouge.  It justed missed the top 20 (in the US) upon its release in May, 1981.  It also marked a transitional period in his career, coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero.  Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33, due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places, it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years.  I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like "Fascist Faces", the beautiful instrumental trio "Carla/Etude/Fanfare" and the more traditional love ballad "Chloe."  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make "the cutting edge" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.  Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While "Just Like Belgium" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and "Heels of the Wind" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks "Heart in the Right Place" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and "Fascist Faces" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.  In the end, The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road, but it is one of the most interesting in Elton's now 35 + year solo career.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become "I'm Still Standing" and "Sad Songs" just a few years down the road.	1
You know what to expect from Elton John, some nice, lush ballads, a few uptempo numbers and a little bit of rock. Nice melodies, mot so much passion, but a lyrics sheet that, no matter how one tried, could not find a single reference to his sexuality, except Big Dipper.  And so 'The Fox' goes, his usual servings of pop, still using self-serving metaphors (But 'The Fox' is a long way to plummet from 'Captain Fantastic' don't ya think?) (And who's fault is this anyway, It's not as if Elton writes the lyrics, or does he?? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of 'Captain Fantastic' on Elton, while relegating himself to role of 'Brown dirt cowboy'?)  But The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.  But if you are hoping for a return to his country-rock days; you'll be disappointed, you'll have to wait for the last song and even then you won't get any humility: "And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire You'll never see me slow down, for a while 'Cause I am the fox, like it or not". But who wants humility in their rock music anyway? I DO!! We're a vocal minority but we're growing, yes you'd better be scared!!	1
This collection from 1981 has nearly gone unnoticed, probably due to the lack of input from Bernie Taupin.  It is filled with great uptempo, complex arrangments like, "Breaking Down Barriers" and"Fascist Faces".  "Just Like Belgium" is one of Elton's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid-seventies and "Carla/Etude/Fanfare" (which runs into) "Chloe" is a testament to Elton John's creativity.  However, the best song on the album and the only single, "Nobody Wins" beats out the rest for arrangment, lyrics and heartfelt tearjerking.  Amazingly, this single is omitted from all collections.  I wish someone would explain this mystery to me.	1
Where was I when this first came out ???  I don't know but I like it now ; & probably always will....	1
Smooth	1
Tony,Toni,Tone., is the first group of singers that sound good. I like this song, . It is fun to listen to. And it has a good beat to it.	1
I would hear this song when I was a little girl. And the video reminds me of the 90's especially because of the way they were dress. The world was better back then.	1
Lost the first copy, needed another one.l	1
Great	1
Very good	1
This is one of the more memorable songs by the Spinners that I remember from when I was a kid :) I believe that's a sitar at the beginning of this song and it only adds to the appeal of this performance. Great song by one of the all-time great groups from the '60s-'70s. *I've heard this song on a overseas Internet radio station and their version seems to have the same problem that I encountered with my download: there seems to be a weak spot at the beginning of the song, so I'd check it out if I were in charge of the downloading division of the record label. It's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers. After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel, it's still playable but there's one section that got mangled and doesn't quite sound right. I'm guessing that a master tape from the reel to reel recording days probably suffered this same problem :)Other than that slight flaw, it's still a great song :)	1
Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.	1
If you like to Bop and swing this is the song to get. It's just right.	1
oldie but goodie	1
perfect	1
GOOD	1
Terrific song, great for listening to, singing along, or dancing	1
was looking for this song for a long time and didn't want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didn't want.	1
Old school song with great bass its a must have for any club as it makes a perfect slow dance / grind dancing with your girl	1
Great song atba great price.	1
not a fan of any of his new stuff, i missed his old stuff. so i downloaded this song since it was one of my favorites	1
What else can I say? Even though he's a TV star now, this was one of his smoother tracks from back in the day. :)	1
THIS JOINT JAMS LIKE A MO FO!!! if I had to pick just one song of LL Cool J outta the very many of his real good joints,  it'd be this one for shizzie my nizzie!	1
love everything he makes!!! LL is too cool. remember dancing to this. this song really showed his sexy-ness( if that's a word)	1
This is one song that is seldom included in greatest hits albums.  I could only get this song on this album.  Truely classic Haggard	1
This is officially the first rap love song. I was in L.A. when this came out and every time I hear it now, it takes me back.	1
A classic recording of a great song. This is the one you've heard on the radio or in the movies.	1
This song is a classic. It's old but but timeless. Beat sounds nice in the car to. Knocks pretty hard on the subs.	1
We LOVE Dave Grohl BECAUSE HE ISN'T a Saduccee dealing diamonds!  When Dave declares, "Go and tell the Angels everything's alright!" you know where his heart is!	1
good song, grew up listening to this group and glad to find it here. Amazon is my choice of finding music i like.	1
Oh yeah, if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear, this is the one! I have heralded only one track/song by the Queens as the ultimate new age piece destined to become the fashion of the new generation in 2013 and beyond (actually it came out on the airwaves years earlier) and it is one of the two and only two (so far) pieces they were able to write and play that I really love and enjoy hearing it over and over again so much that I would buy the album. The superior details of my pick as the new age tune of the coming age are; first the subject which carries a universal message that everything they tell you or feed to you isn't true. There is a mystical truth that no one knows but you can know if you want to. Simple, right? Nothing earth shattering about that, but I find such deeper nuances and openings to a deeper or higher truth in it every time I hear it.   Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying "avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee..." but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent.	1
Good Song	1
I was very pleased with this music down load purchase for my MP3 player and play it all the time.	1
LL has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Love a lot of his songs and I will buy more soon	1
I loved this song in years past and bought it here and downloaded to my mp3.  Definitely brings back memories.	1
I was a little girl when LL was at the top of his game, and yes I had a crush on him.  Can you believe this guy still made hits when I got to high school?  I realize whenever I see this music video, it makes me feel good, and so does this song.  Therefore, I will say it takes me back to the old days and good memories.  The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  "Merry-go-round,"  "Around" the way.."  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.  Flirting with ladies while they do everyday things like sucking on a "blow pop."  I bought that brand lollipop all the time where I went to elementary and junior high school in Crown Heights.  The rhythm and harmonies in this song are soft, and not too hard.	-1
very nice song.  addictive sound	1
I love this song and the band, you can always count on this band to put out great music. Great price and great song.	1
I really liked this song, so much that I bought it. I hate reviewing music, who am I Rolling stone magazine? but this reviow your purchases keeps coming up, so to clear it I wrote a review.	1
Queens of the stone age rock intelligent lyrics and strong rock beat. Great song but be aware that at least the version I bought had the explicit lyrics so if you're worried about what your kids hear try the radio edit.	1
Excellent band and definitely worth listening to. I am very pleased with my purchase from Amazon and would recommend this service to my friends and family.	1
I realized there was another QOTSA song I wanted. I just couldn't remember the name (let alone what album it was on). I then thought about where I was at that point in my life to narrow it down. (Poor memory) Love it! Hard but not thrashy.	1
LOVE this song! I actually first heard it on an old nhl video game. Great beat and awesome song to tap along to.	1
A fun rocking song with a slight retro sound.  The main guitar riff is very catchy.  It will stick in your head.	1
I love Kanye the artist, not that big a fan of Kanye the person.  Flashing Lights is the perfect tune for a late night drive on a clear night out in the city.	1
HOT - check out his homie Devin the Dude&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Smoke-Sessions-Vol-1/dp/B00142RX4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1</a>- track 3 getting high is something to smoke to - whoah - this is the first album since Rapalot Days and the first album of Devin's to hit the Billboard Charts - Congrats	1
I'm not one for the modern STUFF they try to call music. Growing up in the 70's as a teenager as I did. But, this song is GREAT, funny, and that's why I bought it. You should to!	1
Been looking for this for awhile and finally found the version I like and play it a bunch in the car or at home..	1
I was a bit concerned with the preview provided by Amazon. No worry, this is the song you want. This is the version from 1968 that reached number 10 on the Pop charts. Amazon did us good as the mp3 is at 256 kpbs. This song was so popular that I remember a DJ in Pittsburgh who called himself "The Mighty Quinn" to exploit the popularity of this song. Enjoy.	1
i hate his new music but i miss his old stuff so i downloaded this song and i love it.	1
If this song doesn't get you going for working out, I'm not sure what will. I downloaded it to my Fire for working out with my kettlebells and dumbells and it's impossible to not feel pumped up.	1
Good.	1
Cool song!	1
I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.	1
it'a kick ass song and I liked the lyrics. I'm 48 yrs old but i still like good music. it's better than listening to some crazy mess and that sad ass country music.	1
Where his carrier started. This song as classic as Rap can get, and still something my kids can enjoy and listen to.	1
Just wanted to go old school. And what better way to do it than LL Cool J and Mama Said Knock You Out, especially to my two boys while driving in the car to their awful music. LOL way to get back at them.	1
the sound quality could be better to hear it as loud as I hear other songs I have to jack it all the way up	1
Disgusting song!	-1
Bought this because I already liked it.	1
great song	1
I love it!	1
This song is beautiful. I heard it on a t.v. show and it took me forever to find it! Thankfully Amazon had it!	1
I do not care for live	-1
As described	1
great album - one of my favorite past time easy listening records	1
Sucky song	-1
One song that I always enjoy, bought it on my kindle after i watched a girl dance a solo ballet for her senior dance.  Who would have thought...	1
Love this song!	1
I love this song.  I would recommend anyone to purchase this song.  What' great is on the Kindle you can listen to the song before you buy it.  I,also, like that the Kindle shows the lyrics on most songs.	1
It's tough to write reviews of music.  I like it, I buy it.  It's mine, I'm happy.  Oh, and yes, I am happy with the song.	1
Finally was able to find the name through Sound Hound application on my phone.  Ordered right away to play on my Amazon cloud or device.	1
Some of the best music is from alternative artists, like this one, and are therefore not always forefront in the public eye.	1
A classic one hit wonder, it makes a great addition to other singular classics on my iPod. It's a shame they didn't workup some intelligent lyrics.	1
GREAT SONG! Love this song! I feel it in my soul when I hear it! I love music that moves me, this moves me! The louder, the better!	1
I like this song.  I love that I can download music easier to my phone than it use to be.	1
After this song popped into my head, at first I could only remember the artist, Live. I soon had the title, and ordered it as quickly as I could get to the computer.	1
It's a song. If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it. --- Apparently I need seven more words to reach the minimum for a review.	1
Seems to have been well received. The selection came off of their wish list so I expected them to enjoy it and they did.	-1
Awesome old school!	1
I love this music, makes me feel like dancing and partying. "music is my mind and soul, it's better than gold" don't think life would be as enjoyable without it.  Louis SQUAD PRODUCTIONS	1
I Have This CD At Home. Mark Chesnutt Is One Of The Best Country Singers Today. He Also Has Talent In Songs Like The Ballads: "I'll Think Of Something", "Bubba Shut The Jukebox", And "Ol'  Country", And The Two-Stepping Dance Song "Old Flames Have New  Names". This Guy Is The Real Deal.	1
I bought this song as it is a part of the Cristian Grey books.  It makes the reading that much better to relate the songs that they are talking about in the book.	1
Dis "Fifty Shades" all you want, yet this series had introduced artists to a wider audience, from Trouton in graphic arts to Nelly Furtado in the auditory realm.  The video on YouTube is rather powerful.  I guess that clinched the purchase of this item for me.  Nelly's ethereal voice inspires me to "try" -- to try to live my goals, to make the effort to work out the details of my expectations.  Nearly every time I listen to this song, I cry.  Sometimes when I sing along, I say "cry" instead of "try" but ... methinks... those words are linked beyond rhyme.	1
great cd every song is great	1
A mellow, infectious, romantic love song, Not only for the female species, but most definitely for guys who are truly in love.	1
This song brought back memories. I loved this song then and I still do now. I play it when I am listening to old school music.	1
I listen to this song when I need that extra boost of energy when I'm running.  I love LL Cool J!	1
Then this is exactly the type of humor you'll enjoy. Lily is a modern marvel and you'll be stunned by the quality of this recording. I can't really put my finger in it, but she's got this kind of understated quality that's refreshing and unusual because successful comedians couldn't pull it off. Lily's humor doesn't hit you over the head, in fact it's so subtle that you'll frequently ask yourself, "what was funny about that?" I had completely forgotten about Lily until I saw her on this year's Oscars award show with Meryl Streep. Now that was a funny bit! Though I did have to ask my mum what was actually supposed to be funny about it. Lily brought me full circle!	1
Love it.....I was watching Black Caesar on TV and I just had to get this song..............This Oldie still sounds great.....As usual JB rocked it !!!!!!	1
This song will always have it's place in the "Playlist". Old school will never die with tunes like this.  Squad Productions	1
. . .especially the one that sounds (sorta) like a mandolin (Italian-style)  Terrific and classic! Never get tired of listening to this one!	1
one of the best funk songs ever and most sampled love the guitar riff and the horns really fit the soundtrack and movie setting hail black caesar.	1
Love this version of the song. I think it was a live version. This sounds like the studio version which I have. They were great musicians.	1
r&b ,funk,jazz, all rolled into one ,can't stop listening	1
You can't get more smooth than this, old school gold	1
THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.	1
This was not the version of summer madness I had intended to download.  I'll try again next year to correct.	-1
This is the official Summer Time Anthem song. Everyone loves this song other artist has added their own special touch to the SummerTime song. If you have not purchase this yet please do so. I believe that have other songs Kool and the Gang wrote is very interesting too. Enjoy	1
Great song.	1
great	1
I don't like to rate music because it may be one star to one person and five stars to another. I don't normally listen to this type of music, I normally listed to hip-hop or rhythm & blues, but I do enjoy this song. It is great for workouts. Keeps the energy flowing. It is also great for chair dancing and strip teases.	1
The song that opened a whole new music genre to me back in the day	1
wow	1
What can I say.......	1
The mp3 download sounds great! Just as I remembered when this first debuted!	1
Awsome	1
I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?	1
A song that has stood the test of time. It sounds just as good now as it did when it first came out in the 90's.	1
You have to buy it separately if you want the big MMxxl songs	1
I never heard of this gem until I saw Magic Mike XXL  I instantly fell in love with it.	1
Thank you Magic Mike XXL!!!	1
Excellent song	1
it is what it is	1
Great song	1
Very explicit language, but great song. Love the beat and creativity. I'm very open minded and the vibes you get from this song are intense. Nine Inch Nails has been a very imaginative band. Their sound is uniquely theirs. For me, this song's rythem and unique sounds make it ear candy, even more so than the lyrics do.	1
Love it, its my guilty pleasure	1
great song!	1
This has always been one of the best songs of all time.	1
Want to go back to the 90"'s and love Nine Inch Nails. This is one of there very best early albums	1
x rated	1
What can I say. Another rock classic	1
Awesome song.	1
It's a good song, and I wouldn't have bothered buying it if I didn't like it. It was a cheap buy, so really, why not?	1
This song epitomizes a mans feeling for his woman when she is not around him, when he's in love and cant think of anything else but her. every guy has his breaking point when in love and this song says it	1
classic, great song	1
great and easy download	1
yes :)	1
Nine Inch Nails has great music. If you like awesome alternative music you will love this song. It's great to get in a mood of cleaning or dancing.	1
I know that this is a really naughty song and I shouldn't listen to it.. but I cant help the way it makes me feel.. The quality is really good to.. sounds great.. would recommend to anyone who loves Nine inch nails..	1
CAN NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE CHEAPER. i TAKE THIS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE DAILY. I COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE	1
awesome track. its very explicit and sexual but thats what makes their music awesome. grunge music is where its at and always.	1
This is an oldie but goodie and I lost my original CD when I moved a while back.  I missed it and thought I'd get an MP3 version and I'm back in the mix.	1
I can get lost in listening to Nine Inch Nails music for hours, even today. It brings back so mant wonderful memories of me and my teenage son bonding over "his" music! We would spend hours on weekends/evenings listening to the music that was really touching his heart at the time, and talking about what it meant to him. I came to love the music every bit as much as he did!	1
it's nin. trent is awesome and he's older than I am. he's been in the game a long ass time and this is an old classic. 1 of my favs.	1
I've like NIN for awhile and somehow never came across this song. Awesome lyrics and beat. You can get lost in it.	1
It's Excellent and one of my favorite songs. I really enjoy 80's music when I was growing up and going to High School.	1
Great song. I heard this on a You Tube video and just had to have it in my music collection.	1
Bought this because it is one of my favorite songs which I now have the pleasure of owning  with only $.99	1
Great to listen to, deep, rocking cool music. great beat. This was my first full cd I have bought from NIN and I love it	1
This song rocks in spades. It hits real hard when the system is crancked up. The beat is my favorite, cool for the drums.	1
This is an old song, but still a great tune.  It is easy to download from Amazon and the price is right.	1
I definitely agree as well that this song is an instant classic. This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way. Like many others, I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager. I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting. Obviously, this is also a good song to add to a collection of makeout session/you know what session songs.	1
Ultimate party song! Heard this on XM radio recently and I just had to add it to my collection.	1
Good tune	1
I rate the stars on the originality of the recording. Many times it is not the original release of the record.	1
I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?	1
NEVER GOT DOWNLOADED	-1
As expected	1
great song at a great price	1
Good music	1
Thx	1
I love this song. This was one of the songs that I chose for my wedding day. I love how it sounds on my kindle fire,  it is very clear and crisp.	1
Excellent song	1
Great song. Our favorite song. Been married for 18 years	1
A good song! JoJo has range!	1
Great music	1
I always love this song.  I have raised two boys on my own, this song reminds me of my hard work and dedication as a single black woman..	1
I love this song. Thank You!	1
great product had no problems with the product i would recommend to my friends and family 5 stars thank you	1
I had this on tape, but I only needed a couple of songs off of it. So I just bought what I needed.	1
This is a great song by a great group cant beat the price of .99 download for my mp3 player.	1
At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease. On the other hand it's both historic and great music. The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come.  Listen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album. I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you, but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album.  While I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well. So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me.  The album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.	1
Excellent performance and sound quality	1
There are melodies and movements on this album reminiscent of Miles Davis' masterpiece 'Kind of Blue', but with vibes and without, of course, the trumpets/saxes; so thoroughly unique, but in a similar Jazz vein.  This swings hard, but subtle and is incredibly attractive to the ears, with Oscar Peterson's piano tinkling masterfully.  One of my favorite Jazz albums; highly recommended.	1
Oscar Peterson Trio with Milt Jackson / Very Tall:  Personnel: Oscar Peterson - piano Ray Brown - bass Ed Thigpen - drums Milt Jackson - vibes  This is an excellent and enjoyable album.  Five Stars	1
cool	1
K-Ci & JoJo great slow song	1
Love this song  Quick download.	1
No comment	1
This beautiful song is a perennial. With its tight harmonies and lush orchestration, it will be the soundtrack to many a wedding montage for decades to come. The composition itself, by Joel "JoJo" Hailey and Rory Bennettt, pays homage to classic pop composers David Foster and  Paul Anka (hear "Hold Me Til the Morning.")	1
Good	1
these guys came along way with each other but their life is so different and i like this song because its very deep and have so many different meanings and understandings for so many people who hear it different ways	1
This song has so much meaning when you are in love with the special someone in your life not many more of these.	1
Good song they should come back but isn't going to happen they made some good music one of the good ones here	1
The reunion of the "very tall band" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, "On Green Dolphin Street," Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out "Bags and Trane.")  One caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of "stereophonic sound" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly "canned" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)	1
This is a Jazz album that everyone should have in their collection. The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together.  Recorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.  Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.  Sadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing. This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase.	1
When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, "Green Dolphin Street" is relaxed, but "Heartstrings" and "Work Song" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on "John Brown's Body" that soars. The final two cuts, "A Wonderful Guy" and "Reunion Blues" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category.	1
Just a perfect record.  There is so much swing in this LP, and it comes out of a handful of instruments. The vibes rule the record, but it is Peterson's piano that holds down the fort from beginning to end.  Tasty bass, economic drums, and a sharp choice of tunes. The soft intro will fool you.  Two minutes in you will find yourself ready to move with it, and it doesn't let go. I have gone through 3 copies of this record--2 vinyl and 1 CD--over the past 20 years, and I never get tired of it. This ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book.	1
One of the good songs to just kick back and enjoy the music and the words, it's like a ballard.	1
This is a song I downloaded to add to my personal "Love songs" collection for my upcoming wedding...to the one I have been waiting "all my life" for!	1
Ah, the 70s and 80s were great for producing songs like this, with a huge ensemble of a band, a terrific beat, and lyrics that are fun to sing along with.  Play this at a party to take your guests back to the good old days.	1
i like iti like it	1
P FUNK SAW THEM IN D.C. IN 75/76 .......I WILL ALWAYS GIVE UP DA FUNK !!!!!!..SHOUT OUT TO BOOTSY COLLINS ...THE FRIENDLY GHOST !!!!!	1
The funkiest of the funk.	1
I really liked this version of this song.  I first heard part of it in the movie "Undercover Brother".  This is not my style of music but, every once in a while it doesn't hurt to try something different.	1
another great James Brown Classic	1
a classic hit, I needed this for a performance, once again amazon made it possible for me to access music quickly	1
great song. Sandra K.	1
Good song great beat.  I wanted it for my mp3	1

Great song to play along with on the drums. :^)	1
I love Kool and the Gang summer madness the summer theme song. It was swinging in the 70s and it still sounds good today. TB	1
Of course anything that I download online is going to be something that I like. I've always enjoyed this song and love the horn section especially. You don't hear music like this anymore	1
Great	1
Great old school music!	1
Classic and worth every cent	1
nice	1
love that song to make to make love to my wife	1
Good version!!1	1
Great Song...This song is great and has a great melody. Chorus is powerful and full! Jimmy Eat World is an awesome group!	1
"The Middle" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:  It just takes some time Little Girl You're in the middle of the ride Everything, everything will be just fine Everything, everything will be alright, alright    "The Middle" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the "little girl" metaphor into account. I suggest this song (with absolute self-confidence) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner, but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder (in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you)	1
Love finding classic songs that take me back to my childhood and remind me of family car trips and vacations.	1
this group made very few jazz(instrumental)cuts,this is ridding and chilling music at its best,the smoothest most laid back cut of all time,check it out ,you won't regret it!!	1
Great song!	1
I love this song.  Love the beat and love the music.  I heard it on a tv show and had to get it.  Glad I did.	1
I love this song, even now.  It came out in high school.  When I learned he wrote it for his sister it made more sense.  Great song	1
I have been trying to find this song for years. I really like it. I would reccomend it to those who listen to Stacys Mom and other songs like that. :)	1
Enjoyable, relaxing jazz like music to be able just to go outside and have a glass of wine.  You have to like music without singing and just listen to the music and what it means.  If you like this music try Paul Hardcastle	1
Have loved this song since I heard it for someone's first dance at their wedding it's a beautiful song.	1
This song takes me back to when the music and great vocals for recording artists was expected. Listen and enjoy!	1
Musiq always seems to come up with something that not only catches your attention but holds you until the very end.	1
This is such a beautiful song.  The first time I heard it was performed by a promising new artist, and being so, I had to hear the original voice that brought it together.  Simply beautiful and so very true.	1
Good	1
An old school fav of mine, its got such a perfect melody, beat, and tempo.. calming and soothing I love music soul childs early work.	1

I can't figure out why this song was so popular in the first place? Only thing I can tell you is stay away from this one. worst song in the 90's period.	-1

this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.	-1
I bought this CD for the one song "Blurry", the only way to describe the meaning behind it is to "Listen" and hopefully get the meaning.	-1

When you call Enterprise now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight! i have nothing against Rusted Root but, this is a prime example of how overplaying a song can totally ruin it for you! I guess the guys in Rusted Root had to wedge their bets and use the money they're making off of this for their kids' college funds. Who can blame em?	-1
Dont get me wrong its hard to get or hear a bad performance of Soundgarden, but I was displeased with this live version. But I guess bands cant be perfect all the time. Still love Soundgarden though.	-1
this is actually a horrible remake of a much better song by them called Walking In The Sun	-1

I think CeCe Peniston's material represents the 90's decade well.  I like that black turtle neck outfit she wears in "Finally."  I guess "Keep on Walking" is funky as far as rhythm, instruments, and beats go, culminating into a well put together song from the 90's.  "I thought that what we had would never end.."  is obviously a song about a romantic relationship.  Beyonce's "De Ja Vu" and Teena Marie's "Square Biz" are similar to this song's style.	-1
I downloaded this one but to tell you the truth most of the times I just fastforward past this one...I really have to be in a certain mood to sit and listen to this one.	-1
If you ever go to a country music bar, you'll probably hear this song, a real classic!  Love this song!	-1
Easy to use no mus no fuss. I would recommend this product to anyone. A great value for the money.	-1
i don't listen to music at all. i rather be in a quiet room than listen to music at all.	-1
It is a really anointing repetitive song that says the same thing over and over again  the beat is terrible	-1
Johnny Gill is One of the Best Vocalists I've heard over the past 20 plus Years but alot of the time the Words&Music don't match His overall presentation. I dig the cut with Him&Roger Troutman&also R.Kelly's "Someone to Love".but the up-tempo cuts don't move me at all.this Album though isn't balanced out with much else that matches some of the better material&this set suffers from that.but if Johnny Gill ever got the right Stuff to work with He would Be scary.	-1
After the multiplatinum success of "Acoustic Soul", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup "Voyage To India". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on "Voyage" as this album is severely so-so. First off the production is weaker than on "Acoustic" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either. Tired duds like "Little Things" and the predictably titled "God Is Love" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for "deep" when they come off like Hallmark card messages. Bland "folk"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead "Voyage" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. "Good Man" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record. Fortunately, "Voyage" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. "The Truth" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. "Headed In The Right Direction" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired "love yourself" retreads.  Look, "Voyage To India" makes India to be more of a "Black-girl" version of bland, "folk" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being "bootylicious" or partying or "her man" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on "Voyage" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not "deep". India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.	-1
I admired them so much when they debuted.  Courtney Love is the frontwoman.  It's pretty fast for grunge, yet hard.  My favorite parts are when the bass completely stops and she sings.  Ultimately, I think she's really cool.	-1
i don't listen to music because music sucks and i don't like it. music doent appeal to me at all	-1
I was disappointed in the music.  I had never heard some the songs on the album and most of these weren't very good.  I only recognized 5 of the songs.	-1
I am a Lucinda Williams fan and have been for a long time, but this CD is not her best.  Many of the songs sound the same to me -- sad, slow, boring.  Buy it if you're a long time fan and want to follow her career, otherwise I'd skip it.	-1
This would have been a GREAT song if this idiot didn't overstep the bounds of decency and have the unmitigated GALL to mention the name of Jesus in this song in such a horrible manner. This was completely unnecessary and completely ruins what would otherwise be a really hot song. Makes you wonder why someone talented enough to record this can be so callus and stupid as to WAY overstep the bounds of decency.	-1
I have analyzed the Rush track "Subdivisions" with digital audio workstation software and have determined that this version has been altered from its original sound.  Hold on to your original "Signals" CD for the best sound!	-1
2 1/2  It was nice to see SY expanded their limitedly frenzied vocabulary a little further with some experimenting, but the sum still equals a mighty uneven album with very few songs that will end up standing the test of time.	-1
This was a replacement CD and made the same error at the same time.  This time asking for a refund. Bad stack of CDs was made.	-1
My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies. The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects. After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent. Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.	-1
I love the band and the music so much that I had to download this song. However, like so many times in the past, Amazon can't deliver good/quality mp3's to me. Half (about 20) of the mp3's I've downloaded from Amazon have audio artifacts/defects and glitches. I report them to Amazon and they refund money to me and say they will fix the problem. Weeks later I'll attempt to download the song again and it will still be defective. I've grown tired of this and have decided to avoid Amazon mp3's all together and will take my business to Itunes instead. Also, I thought it might be my system, but it hasn't failed with any other mp3 provider or download service - plus I recently installed a new, state of the art router. FIX YOUR PROBLEMS AMAZON!	-1
This is the song from the movie FEAR with Reese Witherspoon in case you were looking it up for that reason.	-1
Evil satanic garbage.	-1
Ever wonder what Sting is singing about at the end of the song? ("Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo") The spanish translation of the word "Piojo" is  " flea" or may refer to  a pain, a bothersome person. So, every little thing she did may have been magic but A. Either this chick had fleas in her hair or B: she may have been considered a bothersome person...or C: Maybe this wasn't about a girl at all and Sting wrote it for his Cocker Spaniel. So the story behind the song is even more intruiging than the song itself, no thanks to the stereotypical FM playlists put together by the unimaginitive program directors at the 'so-called' classic rock stations.	-1
I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?  To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.  After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.  On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.  A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):  I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.  If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as "You're just jealous!" or "I'd like to see you do better!" or "How is it in your parents' basement?" or "You must jerk off to your computer!" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:  "Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!"  FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!  If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me "pretentious" or "music snob" or "self-righteous" or "self-absorbed," you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "simple," (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  "Devil's Night Out" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones "Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols" by The Sex Pistols "The Essential Heart" by Heart "Highway To Hell" by AC/DC "Meat Is Murder" by The Smiths "The Strange Case Of..." by Halestorm "Greatest Hits" by Tom Petty "Complete Greatest Hits" by The Cars "Ugly" by Life of Agony "Remain In Light" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as "Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!" or "You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)	-1
disappointed. Waste of my money as I only like it the way Sixpence does it.  Why so many versions of the same song?	-1
this is not original recording. very disapointed. should tell you that before you buy the song, not happy at all	-1
This song was an anthem to all them cool ass white chicks in the early 2000s (in fact, it was played in the Wayans Brothers classic movie White Chicks. I originally gave it one star but bumped it up to two for comedic value. I picture a bunch of really white chicks snap dancing Carlton Banks style to this tune!	-1
What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?  She's all over the place.  I think everyone is kinda over it.  She has a great career - nothing to be dissapointed with.  It's just time to retire.  For example - I dind't even know this was released.  Never heard anything about it.  It was never promoted - probably because there's nothing to promote.	-1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
this Club Nouveau/Timex Social Club greatest hits on Thump records is all rerecorded vocals by a different front man. Sounds awful. AVOID.	-1
Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average.  "I'll Make Love to You" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions "On Bended Knee."  Only on "Water Runs Dry" do things get a bit interesting.  It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality?  Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more.  Is that supposed to be progress?	-1
It was ok.	-1
I thought it couldn't get any worse when I heard some of Lil Waynes stuff, but then I listened to Soulja Boy. My god what garbage. Can you imagine if the collaborated? Horrible horrible song.	-1
About half of the songs were either remakes or by the wrong artists, one of the songs I wanted the most Sleep walk sucked big time, it just barely resembled the original. Stupid Cupid was by Connie Francis not Wanda Jackson . If you want the original versions forget this album only about half are the originals.	-1
ChaCha question and answer puts it in the  "Pop" category.  Definitely not a lazy tune.  Pretty up and peppy.  Articulated words are present which is excellent.  ...."if I could just crash here tonight?"...cool lyrics.	-1
Wow, talk about zero originality! What do you do when you can't come up with anything original to save your life? Ripoff an old surf instrumental~ what else!	-1

This song is meant for the trash of the world and I'm so sorry I purchased this. It was a dare from a friend; a dumb friend.  If you listen to the lyrics, 'Chris' just repeats the same trite theme over and over again. In his 'acting' debut, he sounded like a high school play. Stop 'reading your lines Chris'.	-1
Too slow, I didn't like it.	-1
This album is horrid.  When we have lyrics like "life can be just like a game boy, full of frustration and joy, pressing A or B make a choice....Game over game over...". Yeah no kidding GAME OVER. That portly written song also has the best opening riff sadly.  Once again the songs are so poorly written is ruins the whole thing and not a decent riff here or there can save this.	-1
Has that garage/grunge band sound.  Just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s I have collected, and forgettable.  Nice cover though.	-1
Love the old traditional Christmas carols!  This one wasn't as good as I was hoping for.  I do enjoy the band, but thought they could have done better.	-1
I am a big Marie fan (since 1976!) but this christmas album is just plain BAD. She scoops the notes all over the place and well, YUK. She's never sounded more like Kathie Lee Gifford than on this CD. I want my $ back because I'll never listen to this again.	-1
I was very disappointed with this release.  The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.  The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie "Wedding Singer". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.  Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.  The Dream really is dead.	-1
Not my style but that's okay.  M-I-L loves Anne Murray.	-1

How I expected this double cd!!! but I should have known that tributes  these days are three a penny and very rarely they seem to convince. It  seems that many famous people were invited to this party and when they came  not really dressed as they should and not really in the mood nobody could  tell them to leave. Such is the cover of Springsteen, almost to make you  weep. A bizarre reggae song by Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt (Did Seeger  write that?) and many etcetera. Not all is lost, Greg Brown, John Gorka and  Anni difranco give some good songs, but even these songs would be  considered fillers in any of their albums. Before you buy this cd try to  listen to it at a friends. I consider it the disappointement of the year.	-1
I got this album last year because I used to like Mary J. Blige in the early 90's when she was at the height of her popularity.  Her albums from the early 90's a lot better than her most recent albums.  The only album by her I somewhat liked from recent years is "No More Drama" and even still it wasn't a perfect album.  Mary's first three albums are her best and her best being "What's The 411?"  For long time Mary J. Blige fans you may be disappointed.  If I were you I would just stick to her earlier albums.	-1
My kid love this song	-1
The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought "Cool...this just might work!" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's "I'm Not In Love." I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the "Big boys don't cry" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the "I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with "Under The Milky Way", "Life In A Northern Town" and "Broken Wings." Oh, sure, "Under...." has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on "....Town" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for "Town", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for "Wing"). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal "Human." Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. "Holding On To Yesterday" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. "Baker Street" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! "Waiting For A Girl Like You" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. "Let's Go Out Tonight" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on "For The One." Much like "Human", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to "Miss You Nights" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! "Blue Rose" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. "Cry" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics ("You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb"), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with "Imagine", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).	-1
I truly did not want to believe that this was one of my beloved favorites, Rick Springfield murdering each and every song on this album, but a person can only go so far on denial. In my case delusion didn't even make it through the first track, and by the time I trudged on through to the end I only got really, really sad.  I didn't know that Rick could suck.  This album is a massacre. It should be taken away, hidden, and hopefully forgotten.	-1
This is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said. The only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80s CD. It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.	-1
i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.. they were not good of line dancing.	-1

when the Bangles first came out in the 80's that had a cool vibe about them.they were if you will a Poor Maid's version of the Go-Go Girls.and over time they never quite shook that tag.the Bangles never wrote songs that took off was the big knock against them then&still.some of the Instrumentation is alright in spots but Vocally not much has changed.	-1
NOTHING LIKE iTunes reliability	-1
I didn't like the explicit version at all, the song didn't have the same smooth flow as the non explicit verion did, seemed kind of herky jerky to me.	-1
Not only did this track have a lot of static but it plays with a drag, in other word its like playing an old-fashioned 45 record and the speed is too slow.	-1
Have you ever thought what would happen if you told your parrot to write a song, that sounded like a love song, but actually had a dark meaning, then told the parrot to sing the song, put it on an album? Neither have I, but that logic is what drives this song. Really folks, this song has all the quality of you're parrot doing. Especially the singing, oh gosh the singing...  Overall, a pathetic effort, from a guy that doesn't deserve to see the light of the music world day.	-1
The four letter words were terrible, ruined the whole song for me. I bought the wrong version.	-1

Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.  Overall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.	-1

I was a cashier on Junior's 4th floor shoes at Macy's Herald Square in Manhattan.  I had mad fun, actually working at my favorite department store.  There was this playlist that played nonstop.  This was one of the tunes on it. Sean Paul is mad fine.  A spanish guy from Jamaica.  Dancehall had come in style since I was a high school student.  One of the names mentioned in the song is "Rebekah," that's me, which is why I love it.  "Rebekah, Joanna, Donna, Annabella, and Jodi."  These are the names of the sexy women he mentions in "Get Busy."  I don't know if "Kana Kana" counts as a name. The beats in "Get Busy" are pretty fast, terribly abrupt, and choppy. There is that syncopated constant short clap beat throughout the song in addition to that daydream um....sound.  He rhymes pretty fast.  Jamaican patwa is quick.  He says, "it's all good girl," making it a feel good song.  Sean Paul is good peoples!	-1
Great song, but after downloading this song I noticed that there was background noise on this particular download. (Tried the download 2 different times)  I called Amazon and they gave me a credit and said they would notify me when the problem was fixed.  Two months and I have not heard anything yet.	-1

Stone Sour really surprised me when they did their own version for this song.it just doesn't feel like stone sour,because they are a hard rock band and this is a pop song. Its a decent cover,but wicked game doesn't need to be redone by stone sour. Stone sour isn't good with acoustic songs in my opinion.they should stick to their guns and make good hard rock. I wouldn't waste my money on this single.it really has nothing to offer to fans of stone sour.	-1
This is a song I could kill someone too, it's so annoying, stupid, pathetic and repeats!!!!  This sucks so badly.	-1

I never liked this song. I never understood how the boy was just like the dad. He related to his dad with the same lack of attention his dad had shown him. But he sounded attentive and concerned about his own kids (they had the flu), so to me the boy turned out better that the dad, not just like him. This song is just one big blah.	-1
Yuk...	-1
This mp3 sounds great so my complaint is not about sound quality. However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other.	-1

A few months ago I went to a Tantric concert in Louisville, KY because my friend likes them. A band called Silvertide was opening for them, and let me just say Tantric was pahetic compared to them. The crowd sucked, that's why I hate modern alternative rock bands like this...the fan base is as boring as the music. All the people did was stand and watch. At the beginning of one song the Tantric's singer said "This is for all you headbangers and moshers out there" as if he expected someone to actually make a big movement like that, and I hope he didn't, 'cause if he did, he was disappointed. Simply put: the opening band blow the headliners away. How sad is that?	-1

I like the song. Something changed at the store and as I bought this song, I "continued shopping". I got one of the 3 songs I was charged for. I did not get this song. I'll try again at some point. I bought another song a few days ago, so it seems to me that as long as you buy 1 song at a time there isn't a problem.	-1

I don't see what people see in this album. I couldn't rate it a 3 even. There are about 3 songs toward the end that are worth having. It's a long way from Olias or Change We Must.

Alice was far too lost by this point to make a comeback record, and it shows. Aside from "We Are The Future," there really isn't a decent song here. Since you can get "Future" on the Box Set, you can take a pass on this one.	-1
That this song downloads as a separate from 'The Load Out'. Your promoter don't mind, the union don't mind, the roadies don't mind. The verses are specific for this 'Stay' version and is part of 'The Load Out/Stay' compile. Its one song!	-1
Why were they so many late fifties early sixties covers during this period? And how come these lackluster cover versions charted so high? This cover of an early sixties tune reeks of "I am so coked out that I can't think of anything original to record" Syndrome- alot of artists suffered from this in the late seventies, with the advent of cocaine as the drug of choice. Coke hampers creativity, but , i guess a lot of these Laurel Canyon artists bought the hype peddled by Jann Wenner in his music rag, Rolling Stone, which by this time had become more mainstream. Jackson Browne has written some great songs (These Days comes to mind) but this Stay cover, with it's overtly "white cracker" falsetto by some female singer, is a disgrace! This God-forsaken cover gets played more frequently than any of the better JB songs out there...blame it on the lame-arsed playlists on these "classic rock" format stations out there these days, boy do they suck huevos!	-1
This is one of those "let's all get up and dance, because he's telling us what to do" type songs like The Electric Slide or Cotton-Eyed Joe. It's annoying and stupid but everyone wants to get up and dance to it. It's a gateway song. So I have to appreciate it for that, but otherwise it's absolutely terrible.	-1
When Uncle Kracker decided to go solo after a long association with rap/rocker, Kid Rock, you would have expected some of the same edginess that characterized Rock's music.  Instead, "Follow Me" resulted.  This is a piece of soft-rock swill that belongs as a track on one of those laughable "AM Gold" albums that used to be sold in informercials late at night, instead of on the top of the pop/rock charts.  However, this sappy love song no doubt appealed to fans who are suckers for this type of music.  In addition, I think there was another group of fans who were wary of another Kid Rock-style singer and embraced Uncle Kracker when they realized exactly how soft his music was.  Really not a fan of this song and I change the radio whenever it comes on.	-1
Not at all my type of music, so take my review from that Perspective. I do the occasional DJ party , and needed ( tripe like this to suit the younger crowd. Normally I wouldnt DARE, waste my money on this Juvenile, Pop, Garbage. But There MANY out there that Like it.	-1
Because it is important to help companys know that there product is good,and that the people than will enjoy it and buy it.	-1
My bad I guess but when I ordered this song from Amazon either I didn't read the info correctly or mistook it as the live version that Jackson Browne did with "Stay" as part of the medley. So, if  you're looking for that live cut this ain't it. Otherwise the song is part of one of Browne's best albums.	-1
At the End when he sings well be scheduled to appear 1000 miles away from here, the song stops. But other than that it's ok, Amazon Gave me my money back.	-1
Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice, problem is the lyrical content and the fact he doesn't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys. he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass/Luther Vandross, Johnny Gill  of his Generation, but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range,but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks. I like the R.Kelly Produced "Hush" and a Jaheim vocally brings it, but the material he gets is hurting him and he seems to be headed toward the same path as Dave Holister another strong Voice Soul Brother who never got the right songs to compliment his overall range.	-1
I mean, doesn't Savatage as a band name and members ONLY deserve the credit! Why does it have to be TSO under the spot lights and Savatage left in the dark? Is it fair?  Don't get me wrong but hey whats fair is fair, i mean i know Savatage members are still in TSO. But let's review; 1. Al petrilli left Savatage in the middle of Poets and Madmen album to join Megadeth then Dave Mustaine kicked him out, why take him back Paul O'neil? 2. Zak stevens (Sang only in Beethoven's last night) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help! Come on!  Overall, I say since Savatage members are happy we should be happy that at least they got the attention they deserve even under TSO name.	-1
It's okay if artists want to change their sound sometimes, if they didn't they might get bored. But this album is awful. Notice how she never did pop again?	-1
Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.	-1
poor mis-guided jewel...she had it all. the looks, the voice, the songs, and the money.  i guess she decided she had enough when she put together this crap all album.  the only good song on it is "Run to You"  and a couple others but VERY few.  this cd might be good if she stuck with her original sound. if u wanna check out the real Jewel check out Pieces of You, Spirit, or This Way.  they're better than this cd in sooooo many ways.  but this cd DOES have potential.  if she kept away from the techno and dance sh** than this woulda  been a really good cd probly.  she's still got the writing ability.  but anyways.  hopefully this phase of hers won't last too long.	-1
I am mainly a fan of non-commercial types of music: heavy metal, bluegrass, western, rockabilly, etc. But when I am in the car with my wife I am stuck listening to the dreaded top 40. How a station can be profitable by spinning the 40 newest rancid pieces of excrement I will never know. So it was to my surprise about six years ago when I finally heard somebody different: a unique voice singing intelligent lyrics with acoustic accompanyment. The first thing I thought was how did this get through the commercial radio filter system that strains out quality and lets only contaminated by-product through? The second thing was - who is this? It was Jewel of the Pieces of You era. Fast forward five years. "Intuition" is on the radio. I can understand selling out if you are pushing 40, working temp office jobs for $9.00 an hour, and playing the coffee house circuit every weekend. But if you have made it big doing what you like to do, why do you sell out to the vacuous fads of today's fleeting pop scene? I guess once you get money, all you want is more money and you forget what the ultimate purpose of making music was. What a pity.	-1
so i read the reviews on here, which i rarely trust anyways, and i decided to get the cd.  (even though i HATE intuition) Lyrically, this IS a bit like her previous albums.  They COMPLETELY butchured her voice though, and made most of it a Dance album...that's what REALLY pissed me off about this album.  Jewel was PERFECT the way she was. and she sounds WAY better on her previous albums, and live.  what was ORIGINAL about her was how u could hear her putting feel into her songs with her vocal capacity.  this all sounds the same and no vocal range at all.  PLEASE all you newcomer jewel fans, pick up one of her EARLIER albums and you will see why us REAL jewel fans hate this cd so much.  she's throwing away good talent, and good looks.  i liked her look before, now she just looks like a hooker. but all in all let's pray that jewel went through a phase, and will go back to her original stuff on her next album.  She is still the same old Jewel in concert though, which is good. so maybe there's hope after all!	-1
this cd is PURE garbage.  stand was an ok song, so i thought i'd download the album, even though i hate Intuition.  there are only about 3 or 4 cuts that are GOOD on this album. the rest sounds like the latest britney spears album!! URGH! i can't believe it!! WHY JEWEL WHY. even the songs that sound like her older stuff, her voice still sounds more computerish. maybe her next album will be better	-1
liked her better before she discovered the wonderful world of hip hop.	-1
It's not so much Jewel sold out but Jewel shows on this CD that she has aristically sold-out.  This is simply a dull, lukewarm collection of machine generated songs that offer no reason to listen to again.  Where's that edgy young artist who said Bukowski was one of her major influences?  Her and Liz Phair should start a support group for aging thirty-something female pop stars who think they should be Avril.(Oh, Jewel isn't that old?  She sure acts like it...)  I have to re-evaluate her old stuff.   "If I could tell the world just one thing...that you're okay...."   I think Jewel proves on this CD the true depth of her previous stuff.	-1
Let me just get this out of the way: I was never really a fan of Jewel. I never went out and bought her albums. Still, though, I gave her credit for playing her own instrument and writing her own songs, and being individualistic (at least more so than most of what has been plaguing the radio since the mid-1990's). BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE??? This really depresses me. And this is coming from someone who was never into Jewel in the first place. Has the music industry really come to this? Where a fairly original artist has to sacrifice all integrity and brains he/she ever had and make meaningless pop drivel just to sell RECORDS!?!?! Talk about a sad state of affairs. I hate to throw around the word "sellout", but... SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! If you must hear this album, just download it and burn it. Yes, it is possible - we're living in the future, my friends! Remember, we, the consumers, speak with our money. Don't waste it on this, and perhaps, just perhaps, the record companies will wise up. (*scoff* yeah, like that will ever happen...)	-1
I loved "Intuition" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan!  So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this.  Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop.  It's mostly folk with a rock edge.  Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences.  Really, "Intuition" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!	-1
I've never been that Big on Jewel&sure didn't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set. Vocally She is still the same. I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now.but the Music here&vibe feels like it passed Her by. Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound&Vibe just ain't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance.but, Usher style Album titles just ain't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul.	-1
For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304. I have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include "Run 2 U" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish "Intuition". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example. And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. "Becoming" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with "Haunted". "2 Find U" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called "Standing Still" (or the second time, when it was called "This Way"). Another problem here is the lyrics. Songs like "Fragile Heart" and especially "U & Me = Love" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but "Yes U Can" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of "Stand"? I don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album.	-1
never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-  had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!  close to $100 worth of music never received!!	-1
While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B.	-1
Cher is back with "Living Proof", after the highly successful "Believe" which catapulted Cher into superstardom once again with the single "Believe" going all the way to No. 1 in 1998 and making it the biggest single of 1998 according to Billboard. So Cher shows in "Living Proof" that you don't mess with success and use the same formula as "Believe".  Though "Believe" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does "Living Proof". The songs are good dance songs my favorite is "A Different Kind of Love Song" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before "Song for the Lonely". However all the songs sound like the same vain of "Believe", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over. I don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, "Living Proof" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs. The other strong cuts include "Rain, Rain" and "Love One Another" which sounds a lot like "A Different Kind of Love Song" which is a faster version of "Song for the Lonely" which is a slower version of "Believe"....Get the picture? There is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however "Living Proof" is just the same old "Beliefs". Cher does dance good, however if you want a really good dance album get Kylie Minoques "Fever" which is sizzling hot.	-1
Cher is at it again.  Now nearly 56 years of age, Cher is still fighting the inevitable tide of time.  This time, as with her last "effort" "Believe", Cher (with platinum hair--will it translate to platinum sales?  I doubt it) continues her foray into the world of trippy dance beats and nuevo-disco stylings as the listener is bombarded with studio wizardry and up-to-date technology (and Cher's unique voice).  The songs (as is usually the case with Cher) are penned by songwriters (i.e., not Cher herself although she did have a hand (ha!) in writing the first "tune") and Cher is backed by a slew of competent studio musicians and masterful, clinical, overproduction.  To me, this sounds like technology for technology sake and not for the sake of the music.  On the bright side, it does tend to obscure Cher's questionable "talent" somewhat and that can't be all bad.  If you go for dance music, stick with the experts and not some "artist" trying to stave off irrelevance.  If you're someone who digs Cher, you'll buy this anyway (and maybe even dance to it--ha ha ha!!!).  The bottom line:  Overproduced dance music that's been done better by many others.  Hippity Hop Dop!!!	-1

For such a "much anticipated" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic "90 Degrees and Freezing", a Motown-inspired, horn driven "Come to Me Do" and a catchy and powerful pop gem "Feel" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears. I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite "King of Might Have Been" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range. I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on "XXX". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on "XXX". Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance. "Chicago XXX" "could have been a contender" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for "Chicago XXXI".	-1
I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song "Caroline" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.	-1
It won't play this song on my mp3 player! frustrating! I never would have bought it anyway, at least it was free. but still it is frustrating. I ended up just deleting it from my player, it simply wouldn't work. :(	-1
(2 & 1/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like "Questions 67 and 68."  I even enjoyed their more "lite rock" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new "XXX" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, "King of Might Have Been."  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of "You're The Inspiration."  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  "Inspiration" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); "King" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); "Inspiration" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  "King" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; "Inspiration" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.  A couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., "Chicago Love Songs") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of "XXX" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.	-1
Great  song great band love their music cant say enough bout chicago wish there were more bands with this type music today.	-1
I haven't seen "Rhythm of the Rain" in the oldies collections hawked on TV and this CD seemed the only way to get that song. The rest of the music on this CD is forgettable.	-1
Should have only downloaded the song one time.  Don't like it that you couldn't sample the music first.	-1
This was a second song that I wasted my money on because there was too much static on this mp3 track.	-1
It's terrible when FM radio plays out a song that was average to begin with. it makes it even more lackluster to the discerning listener	-1
It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.	-1
I understand the urge of trying to make kids music into classical music but this kinda takes away the kid friendliness. My two year old daughter gets bored by this music very quickly.	-1
It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.	-1
This has to be one of the worst versions of the song I have ever heard. Even my two year old Wheels on the bus expert had issues signing along	-1
It's alright	-1
I think I got this album for free. I thought my nephew would enjoy, but he doesn't listen to it much. Now it just sits around on my computer....  This is my least favourite track on the disk...	-1
even as a freebie, this was a total & complete waste of my time to listen to. fit only for the trash.	-1
It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.	-1
good concept however the song turned out rather boring and my kids do not enjoy listening to it at all.	-1
My two year old was very unimpressed with this song. I think they could have made the songs more child friendly	-1
This is the worst sleep music I have purchased from Amazon. It is just the same 5 minutes of music, cycled a dozen times. And the music is too intense for a sleep aid.	-1
this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.	-1
There are a lot of versions of this song out there. This is not the right one to download. It's taken from a compilation album and starts and ends ubruptly because it was very sloply hacked from the original album.	-1
I assumed this would have some variance in it, but it is the same bowl being tapped over and over, no overlapping or changes throughout the whole, very long piece. I wonder if they just recorded one gap, then repeated it again and again. There must be better meditational "music" (and I use the term loosely there as it is nothing but the ringing of the bowl -- no other instruments, no melody, no chanting, ... nada) than this. I was very disappointed.	-1
Okay song	-1
Where have all the flowers gone? Hmm I would say they wilted and died from this boring song. Why I purchased this one will always amaze me? I guess it was just a blue day and this song certainly did not lift my spirits.	-1
I just don't like this song. She sings weird in a few parts where she gets real loud and when you're getting into it, she scares you with her loud parts.	-1
What were they smoking when they wrote this? Probably the same thing I was smoking when I bought it.! This song should have been put out before it started. The only thing I liked about it was... nothing.	-1
500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles. Didn't take a rocket scientist to write this song. I'm just happy I was not with her on the 500 mile journey. I think I would have been forced to stick my fingers in my ears so I could not hear her singing, otherwise she would have put me to sleep. Depressing song.	-1
Yeah give me a hammer so I can smash this song. Oiy Vey! I use to listen to this song when I was a punk but now I am an old lady and this song just nauseated me...	-1
Madonna's "Who's That Girl" sets a much faster pace than her "La Isla Bonita" which goes at a slow pace.  The song is marked by spanish motifs and words, obviously her favorite culture.  This song makes me feel good to be a girl.  This song has intrinsic value in my life.	-1
This was some useless version with a bunch of crap that had nothing to do with the original song. Frankly I was cheated!	-1
When I was 11 years old(1967) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour,and certainly,these 4 concerts are true to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes,I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4-track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile,Alabama recorded by one of the group's roadies. The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen. Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass,electric piano.organ) & Davy Jones(tambourine) had been better players,they were in a no-win situation,trying to play songs from the first 2 albums,which featured up to 10 instruments per song. Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's "Live 1967" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on "Live 1967".I suspect that on "Live 1967",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub/correct the recordings. What you'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable!) ragged/amateur/garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade. But "Live 1967" is much more listenable.	-1
Ambrosia Anthology had the same songs plus many more so it was a far better deal. I thought I might get a better quality sound but it was the same.	-1
This is supposed to be an accompaniment track (no voices).  However, it's the original song.  I previously purchased the original, and was looking for the version without voices for a memorial DVD.  Ended up with an adequate version from another company (Christian Rock, the Best of. . .).	-1
i don't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of Dolly Parton's song. She oversang and it's just kind of an annoying song to sit through...what a drag...	-1
I can not download this music to my Media player.  Had I known I could download, I would not have purchased.	-1
I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off. No; I would not recommend this to my friend.	-1
I remember this song be a lot better then it actually is. Maybe because I was pretty young when it came out.	-1
dont listen to music because music bores me and i don't even listen to music at all to begin with	-1
song was great BUT Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again. IF YOUR gonna download this song do it but not from AMAZON.	-1
What a con, I should have looked harder, but Amazon shows an Ablum cover, and expecting to get it all for .69 cents, you get one song.  Its deceptive, but  probably not illegal. But I don't like it, and probably will never use this site angain.	-1
I know 'It's Five O'clock Somewhere' is a good song because I've heard it done well at many square dances.  But I was very disappointed with this version.  I know a local square dance caller who does it much, much better.	-1
I downloaded the CD and still haven't been able to listen to the whole CD so I deleted it from my Library	-1
I'm sorry, but I cannot extend any tolerance towards a blatantly ripped off song. This song's verses sound EXACTLY like that Dobie Gray song "Drift Away". I don't ever want to hear this song in a store, or anywhere, ever again. I don't like writing negative reviews on this website anymore, but I'm sorry, this song is garbage, and I need to say something about it. It is one of those pieces of music that is every negative term I can think of. It's unoriginal, generic, and has a lackadaisical reason for existing. I like this style of music, but this is a song that infuriates me because it is so terrible.	-1
I bought this song to add to a road trip playlist. I personally hate country music, but my buddy is a huge fan so I added it for him	-1
bought this song a on accident thinking it was a different one. it's ok but kinda slow	-1

heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping. it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review. i guess it's perfect for a furniture store: bland, generic, and soporific	-1
If I was having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in Anytown, USA and this came on mid movement, i'd committ Hari Kari. it's that terrible. this makes Shania Twain sound like Mozart.	-1
I will be completely honest with you, I am not a Kelly Clarkson fan!  This was a purchase for my wife who loves this song so...	-1
Alright, listen to the lyrics for this one. First of all, I can't tell whether this is about a boy she has serious anger issues with, or whether this is about a child-abuser. The latter would make the song more powerful in a lyrical sense, the former on the other hand, would just make the song wrong all the world around. But, in either case, Clarkson does a poor vocal performance here, and somebody totally messed up on giving this song a tune. It's so bad, it verges on mind-numbing, and annoying. And after you've heard the song ten times on radio, in the same morning, you'll verge on convulsions and other serious medical and mental issues. Yes, it's that bad.  Oh by the way, Reba didn't help the song any. In fact, she just made it worse, as if that was even possible. In fact, that version could be the worst excuse for a duet I've ever heard. In either case, with either song, don't buy it. Keep your sanity, and keep your ears.	-1
This song is boring, unenergetic, and as generic as you can get. Just overproduced crap made to cater to boring-a$$ FM radio easy-listening for doctor's offices format.	-1
The only solid foundation with you!!!	-1
Where is Pressure?  You kidding me?  Only my favorite Billy Joel song ever!  Can't believe they left that off - glaring omission.  I'll pass.	-1
Awful. I think this is the worse wiil smith song ever.	-1
Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.	-1
"Oh Sherrie" was Journey lead singer Steve Perry's first solo release.  No one can deny the strength of Mr. Perry's voice, but he is too bombastic on this track.  He goes for the sledgehammer right over your head, when a little more subtleness would have better for a love song written for his girlfriend at the time.  The guitar work sounds a little too much like a knock off of Neal Schoen.  The song was a massive hit in early 1984, peaking at number 3.  It would be his only solo song to crack the top ten.	-1
After listening to our choir sing it, I rushed to purchase the original, Big mistake.  Oh well.	-1
How should I put this song? Painful, as in whenever it's on the radio, you have the sudden urge to bash your head into something. The song is one we've heard a million times before, when your lover is gone, you're sad, yes, we know, we get the picture. Stick to being in love with the boyfriend, or hating him, or being jealous over him, or losing him, just not, pining over him being more than ten feet away from you. And good gosh, can this song be any more overplayed on the radio? I mean, if this and "Keep Holding On" were the only songs you knew of her, you'd think she's the worst artist since SoljaBoy.  And read my review of "Keep Holding On," most of it also applies here. So overall, Avril needs to stick to "Girlfriend" and "Sk8tr Boi." Stick with the punk, not the ballads and uplifting inspiration garbage, please.	-1
this song is soooo played out!! it wasn't all that to begin with! but it only annoys me more b/c it is played tirelessly	-1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
I gave this download only one star because, even though it did download into iTunes on my p.c., I could not get it to sync into my mp3 player as I did with two other songs I purchased from Amazon.com:  'I Can Only Imagine' by MercyMe, and 'All of Creation', also by MercyMe.  If your tech support team can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.	-1
I cannot like it even less.  It is not a good rendition of the beautiful song that we are used to.  Awful	-1
It's a great song sung by one of my favorite country gentleman singers. Reminds me of all my good memories.	-1
I think I out grew babyface, hes a good singer but the songs just don't hit me like they once did.	-1

I couldn't open the file the first time so I even downloaded twice and it still wouldn't  open.  Left me frustrated and unsatisfied.	-1
First of all, can we get over the craze of inspirational and uplifting music, quickly? Thank you. The song has great lyrics, but the musical and vocal elements to the song all seem overdone, overcooked, and trying too hard. In fact, somebody tried too hard to make this song a hit, which never really caught on, but you hear it on radio constantly, to the point where you cringe every time you hear this song.  And by the way, does anybody else think that an inspirational song from somebody like Avril Lavigne, who is not the best of role models, is just plain wrong? In either case, the song doesn't work, except on a lyrical level, and even that's been done before.	-1
this is an overproduced piece of dung. just cos u can wail & sing real good don't mean u don't have to b original. Originality still accounts for a lot & u just playin Kneegrowz like chumps when u release overproduced pablum like dis	-1

Sony Music shortchanges Lauper by only giving her one disc (and 14 tracks only!!!!) She deserves much better, and this is what it should look like:  Disc One:  1. Money Changes Everything  2. Girls Just Want To Have Fun  3. When You Were Mine  4. Time After Time  5. She Bop  6. All Through The Night  7. Witness  8. The Goonies 'R' Good Enough  9. Change Of Heart  10. Boy Blue  11. True Colors  12. What's Going On  13. Iko Iko  14. The Faraway Nearby  15. Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)  16. I Drove All Night  17. Like A Cat  18. A Night To Remember  19. I Don't Want To Be Your Friend  Disc Two:  1. That's What I Think  2. Who Let In The Rain  3. Sally's Pigeons  4. A Part Hate  5. Hat Full Of Stars  6. Come On Home  7. Sisters Of Avalon  8. Ballad Of Cleo + Joe  9. You Don't Know  10. Fearless  11. Brimstone And Fire  12. Shine  13. Madonna Whore  14. This Kind Of Love  15. Waters Edge  16. I Miss My Baby  17. Stay  18. Makin' Whoopee (Duet With Tony Bennett)  19. You've Really Got A Hold On Me  They took 6 tracks from her debut, then they strangely take two from her second album, one from her third, two from her fourth, two from her fifth and none from her sixth! What?!! Sure it's nice to have Goonies, but no Hole In My Heart???!! Don't buy this, make your own compilation or wait until they get it right.	-1
Tell me, what doctor's office or elevator hasn't been playing this overrated turd constantly. as if we weren't tortured enough with it in the eighties. WHY OH WHY? won't this sucky-azz song, overplayed song  just die a dignified death already!!	-1
This probably isn't the version of this song you want. You want the one with the wierd picture of George with the funky mustache/soul patch thing.	-1
My band decided to start covering this ridiculous pseudo disco excuse for a song so I bought the long version. Big mistake, I should have bought the radio edit and prevented myself from having to sing the whole thing.	-1

I remember first hearing this song on American Idol by the contestant that sang it and I heard wrote it, Bo Bice.  I remember first hearing it on the radio, it just debuted or something.  I guess it was too new for me to get the singers name, because later on that week, Bo Bice sang it, and I thought oh, he's singing that new song on the radio.  Then American Idol said Bo Bice wrote the song.  Now Gavin Degraw sings it, but that is way after hearing it on Season 4 of American Idol, with Bo Bice, Constatine, and Carrie Underwood, who won American Idol season 4. Ok, Bo Bice sang the song, which had a much harder edge.  Gavin Degraw actually did pretty well with it!	-1

It's a song, how much can you say about that?	-1
Doesn't play after download. Waste of money. Shame because I like to workout to this song.	-1
I didn't screen the lyrics carefully enough before I bought it.  I like the reggae rhythm and the instrumentation is fairly good.  Wyclef Jean's vocals are good; Shakira's are a little week.  The lyrics are sexually suggestive, so I have to be careful not to play this song for younger audiences.	-1
It was an odd song...	-1
the song is good but the picture is inappropriate and i don't really know spanish but it is still a good song	-1
I don't like this song.	-1

The song is great. However the post mastering of the song left a high pitch screech in certain areas of the song starting with "Miami beach..." then "I've seen....", fancy, limousines, etc. Too many places to list. I tried a new download and it still is wrong. This would make me hate a song I so enjoy.	-1
this song is horrible! how is this chick so famous?? it's a big corporate push & a lot of money and financial interests @ stake, invested in her career. The suits who are pushing this would sell ya a turd sandwich if it would make them  a lot of moolah!	-1

Last year's American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks, really hasn't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her debut. While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.  Song: D+	-1

This song is very aggressive and not easy on my ears.  I absolutely adore Jennifer Lopez, but when I was buying this song, I did not get to hear preview - my bad.  There is another super-wonderful song on this album "Di me porque lloras... De felicidad" - I wish I purchased that one, instead.  That other song is brilliant, sensual and touching.  I love Jennifer Lopez.  I am very much like her, just not Puerto Rican :)	-1
Aerosmith hired songsmith-for-hire Diane Warren (she was like the Max Martin of the late eighties/early nineties and wrote songs for a lot of chart topping pop crap. I mean, you hire DW to write song poop drivel, you might as well hire Michael Bolton as your singer.	-1
There is an old-fashioned album advertisement for the band at the end of the song. It is very annoying.	-1
song was great Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again.	-1
Well I love this song, and it was my husband's and my song "OUR SONG" but this particular version is UBER long.  It has all that extra on and on forever ending that feels like it will NEVER end.  The radio version cuts all of that out.  Get the radio edit version.	-1
How annoying is this song? He says shake about 50x and it gets so damn repetitive.  2 stars.	-1
i bought but it never download to my kindle.. very upset about that.. and i really want this sone to listen to	-1
this is not only a horrible song. it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the advent of recorded music. what a wretched piece of dung! i have about 274 different downloads on my special download wishlist on amazon, so there's about 274 things i could recommend you download before downloading this piece of crap song. i can't stand these record industry manufactured pop princess garbage. she doesn't even write her own songs for chrissakes! the pitbull song 'give me everything' probably comes close to this as far as 'worst song' but this is indisputably the worst	-1
early nineties pop cheese hasn't dated well b/c the arrangements and the production sounds like that overproduced, cold sounding late eighties early nineties sound that hasn't dated too well. Whitney was looking fine in the video though, back when everyone thought she was a wholesome role model type.	-1
rerst in peace whit nevber liked your bubblegum material but you had a cool voice anyway since everybody wanna think abouit the good times this tune brought this will make you remember the voice and remember kids crack is wack.	-1

I bought this c.d. for the title track. I thought it was Earth Wind & Fire and found out it was Ramsey Lewis. If I had heard the album first I would have only downloaded the title track.	-1

When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.  While her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.  Overall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.	-1
And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).  Altogether, I just don't appreciate either of them ripping the Irreplaceable beat off though.  Come on! We heard it ENOUGH in 2006/2007!!!  Second. I will never forget you/You're in everything I do/  (Later)  Just like a tattoo/I'll always have you  blah, blah, blah, blah, Jordin. Start writing your own songs and maybe you'll get some attention!  2.25 stars.  End note: Beautiful voice but get a new producer who isn't afraid to try something new and different! I know it can be hard being original these days in the studio because it seems like everyone has nearly tried everything BUT (and that's a B I G but) copying a song's beat that has previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do! The lyrics are trite and super-elementary and nothing (I mean NOTHING) besides the vocal work stands out!!	-1

Sara Groves is a great singer-songwriter, and has written some absolutely fabulous songs.  Unfortunately, this CD misses the mark, and is by far the weakest of her releases.  The CD is lacking the lyrical and melodic depth of her better songs, and, as noted in other reviews, has a mass-produced CCM sound that does not serve her well.  For Sara's best, check out "Other Side of Something", "Conversations", and her most recent release, "Fireflies and Songs".  Each of these CD's include songs that are as good as any music produced in the last 10 years.  Nobody's perfect . . .	-1
THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.  Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.  There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.  This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.  To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.  John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.  It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.  The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.  But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.  The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.  If you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.	-1
Starts off great, gets bad real quick. Some of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her "Mama's Gun" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, "Don't You Forget It", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track. The only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, "Butterfly"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough. The rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy. The tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on her next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.	-1
So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on. Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI).	-1

If you are a fan of those great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to get these, the 1993 Razor & Tie versions and not the recent re-masters of 2000 and 2003. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie CD's sound like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!	-1
After "Getz/Gilberto" the second best selling Jazz album of all time behind "Kind of Blue", the record companies were anxious for another golden egg.  However this is one of the worst periods in Stan Getz life, the 70's. Personal problems, and he was locked in the the bitterest divorce case in history, went to the Supreme Court! Things added to his orange juice...  Joao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.  For better Getz, pick any other decade or his life. For some reason all of the Getz Columia recordings are really bass thin and harsh. This one is less so, but no exception.  See my list for many better Getz recordings.	-1
This is the most God-awful piece of dung i have ever heard. How in tarnation was this song so popular?? I'll tell ya how...The general public has bad musical taste! No...wait...it's the God-forsaken mainstream media...they control what gets played on the radio and provide their puppet/dj with a "playlist" of whatever the powers that be want them to play. Production-wise, the dreadful,un-original horn sample used in this song sounds like a Puff Daddy ripoff sample. It's very 1996 and sound like a Kool and the Gang wanna be horn riff.	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03. It isn't a good song, because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband. Still, there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love.  Song: D+	-1
If this is the best song in the 2000's you are sadly mistaken. Anything from this "artist" should not be bought. Avoid beyonce at all cost. Instead buy my albums on itunes you'll thank me later.	-1
It's got a very familiar sound throughout and if your cool w it...you'll survive. For me, there was a moment of "okay, it's done playing." I didn't want to re listen. Price, bargain though.	-1
If you liked simple plan's last two records, prepare to be disappointed. There are only two songs here that sound anything like what the band has done in the past, and one of them is a JP bonus track. So really, there's only one good song on the whole 12 track effort! Pop-punk is supposed to be fun, and simple plan used to do it as well if not better than everyone else, but there's nothing fun about waiting three plus years for such a terrible record.	-1
Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not "punk." And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls "unchartered musical territory." Perhaps "UnCHARTED" musical territory is more like it. This one is headed to a bargain bin near you, right next to all those old LFO albums.	-1

First off, what is the point of this "duet?" Because from my viewpoint it is at best a vehicle for Beyonce, and a god-awful one at that. How bad is this song? In the original version, where the song was treated like art, not a marketing tool, Justin Timberlake gave his best vocal performance yet with a 5-star croon. Here, with the shoving of Timberlake, and the addition of Beyonce, she sounds more like the cat whose tail has just been stepped on. To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a "duet," but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.  Overall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song. It's one of the flat-out worst quality of song in 2007, Period.	-1
I'll admit I am Beyonce fan and somewhat of a Justin fan but this remix, yes REMIX is terrible. Now, While Beyonce's Vocals are great and on point, Justin's remain the same as his original which for me, throws me off since they called it a "Duet". My opinion : if it was really a duet, Justin's vocals would be new, also. So, it's more of a remix than a duet. I Think if Justin had new vocals for the song, it would be more enjoyable.  This would have been a lot better, in my opinion had it contained new vocals from JT	-1

I love the two singles, Spin and Out of Breath, so I thought I'd download this first and give it a try.  As much as I hate to give an album with meaningful lyrics such a low rating, I have no other choice.  Sorry to all you hardcore fans, but this didn't cut it!  I tried to like this album and I still couldn't get into a lot of these songs!  There's too many slow, sleep  inducing tracks!  I can get the same thing from my relaxation CD!!  Not even the bonus track How Long is worth the extra money!  I gave this two stars for the five songs I like:  Spin, Sky Is Falling, Am I Ever Gonna Find Out, Out Of Breath, and Take Me Away.  My advice:  Go ahead, if you're a hardcore fan!  If you're just a casual fan like me, just download it or borrow it from a friend!  And while you're at it, try No Name Face instead!  So far, I've only heard sound clips, but it still seems like a better album than this!	-1
oh the Guest Album's how they have changed the Game? Quincy Jones did this Concept for many a Moon but it was Carlos Santana that has gotten all the Juice from it in Big term sales.so Willie Nelson is next in line for the Big Cash Out.but like with Santana the Best Material here just as there to me was when the Artist themselves were showcased.overall you don't get the guest adding anything to the mix instead just a cool Pressence&very Little overall Substance to me. Willie Nelson has created some Great Stuff but this Set is basically going thru the Motions for a Album as to adding any depth to it.	-1

Alright, Daughtry is definitely not as good as I thought he was. In fact, he might be the most unoriginal guy in modern rock to come around in quite awhile, and that's saying something. However, this time he doesn't sound like another artist, he sounds like his bad self, or more specifically, "Over You" which was his previous single. Anybody else see something wrong with this picture? And yet, he rules rock radio.  The verses are mediocre at best, and the chorus on its short run on radio is already annoying the heck out of me. It just doesn't seem real, like it's a half-hearted effort or something; something to please the record labels. Chris's vocals are stellar as always, but contrary to popular belief, the song itself makes for most of its success, and this one is made, but it's in pieces taped together in a quick effort to please a record executive.  So overall, on if, if not Daughtry's worse in a rather short career so far. Hopefully he'll come out his sophomore album rather soon, so the rest of the musical skeletons in his compact disc closet will stay where they belong: hidden.	-1
Song does not sound anything like the original recording. Had to find and download the original. Can not recommend this version of the song at all.	-1
This version is quiet different from the original.  Not as good, in my opinion.  Wish I purchase the original.  I recommend that you pass on this version.	-1
I had to buy this giant album to get a few songs that weren't available on other albums. Some of the songs are worth it, but most are just repetitive and annoying.	-1

This song sucks.	-1
It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting "Fourteen" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's "Fall For You."  This piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.  So overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.	-1

I'M A BIG 8BALL & MJG FAN. BUT THIS ALBUM DIDN'T REALLY IMPRESS ME THAT MUCH. THE ONLY SONGS THAT I REALLY LIKED WERE ''YOU DON'T WANT DRAMA'', ''FOREVER'', ''MEMPHIS CITY BLUES'', AND ''TRYING TO GET AT YOU''. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE. I REALLY THINK THESE GUYS SHOULDN'VE WENT TO BAD BOY. CAUSE AFTER ALL, THESE GUYS DON'T FIT IN AT BAD BOY! THEY SHOULD'VE STAYED WITH SUAVE HOUSE. HIP HOP SEEMS TO BE HAVING ANOTHER MEDIOCRE YEAR. RAP HAS BEEN TOTALLY F***ED UP SINCE 2002, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANY BETTER.	-1
I swear, the beat is Irreplaceable Pt. 2, with the extra, "Hey's" thrown in there. We just can't be original anymore. It's like we'd rather bite someone else's style, and saying it's our own!!  The voice saves the song though. Nothing else. The lyrics are stale, "I'll always have you." Whatever, Jordin. Can we have a little depth, please?!!!!  The music industry is wrong in so many ways.  This is one of them!!  2.4 stars and nothing more for this "music". Melinda or Lakisha could've mopped the floor with her, if only America voted for talent, instead of a pretty face and an overrated beat-boxing wannabe!!!	-1

Highly indulgent release of ambient industrial instrumentals prove that not everyone should be completely free from label restraints. Reznor completely plays into the fanbase with this one, rarely constructing a track out of 36 that rises above mere NIN production exercise.	-1
I have been loyal to Trent Reznor and his NIN projects, but this is by far a big dissapointment.  Thank goodness it was reasonably priced. I just don't find this groundbreaking at all. More canned music.  If your strapped for cash, skip this album.  Get a good one like the downward spital, or broken	-1
Trina as ran the last course of her career and this album made me not listen to anymore of the past to now present Trina music. Just like Lil'Kim, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, Nicki Trashji, Khia, Jacki-O, and all those played out wack rappers the music doesn't last for long.	-1
Believe it or not, this was my first time purchasing a Trina album. It's not that I haven't liked any of her songs in the past, because I have. I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists. I immediately took notice of her, though, with her 2000 (or maybe 1999) debut single, "Da Baddest Chick." I actually liked the song initially--although it sounds a bit dated today--and the video, which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat, was pretty amusing, too. The next single was the summer-anthem, "Pull Over," which had my head bobbing for quite awhile. I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles, including "Told Y'All," the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott, and of course "Single Again." I've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out, but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples. They just didn't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub-par. However, the samples for this album sounded much better, and with her initial success with this album--debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever--I decided to finally give one of Trina's album a try.  The album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro, which is just here to take up an extra minute. The smarter choice would've been to just begin the album with the first full-length track, "Still Da Baddest." The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant, a perfect canvas for Trina's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business. (Believe it or not, this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade). The first single, "Single Again," is also one of the best tracks from this set; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies' anthem. I really can't understand why the song wasn't very successful. "Look Back At Me" should definitely be a future single, with its simplistic, dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals. "I Got A Bottle," which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott, is a fun and playful club song. On "Clear It Out," Trina gives us a piece of her mind, stating how she is fed up with haters, critics, and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy. And "Hot Commodity" is a great closing track; it's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song. Unfortunately, those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with. The rest are pretty unexciting. "I Got A Thang For You" and "Wish I Never Met You" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date, "Here We Go Again." (Which I didn't think was that great in the first place). The production isn't great, and Trina's rhymes are way too laid-back and lazy. "Killing You..." is bland and very repetitve and "Phone" is simply here for shock value, nothing more. Last, "Stop Traffic" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook. (Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know green means "go" and red means "stop." That's not clever!)  The bottom line: So... I've finally bought a Trina album. While it's a bit better than I was expectting, Still Da Baddest is far from flawless. It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is no medium on here. It's either really good, or really bad, and there are just as many bad songs as there are good. Most of the time Trina's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great (except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads). What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production, hooks, or song ideas. If you're a Trina fan, buy it. If not, I wouldn't really recommend it. Sure there are some good tracks here, but they are barely worth it for me.  Key tracks: Single Again, Look Back At Me, Still Da Baddest, Hot Commodity.	-1

By adding Daughtry to an album you are asking for some radio airplay,why???a band that for more than 10 years hasn't cared for that has had album go platinum,gold etc. and now going radio????I DON'T GET IT!!!,this album is by far their worst. Such songs as Inside and Prodigal Son take charge and show how they have been on every album,then all other songs start slow and have like this interlude of sorts that pretty much stink the album and even adding Tremonti and Kennedy from Alter Bridge can't help either,hopefully they put this album behind them,they are much better than what this album made out to be.	-1
This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones "Coming Down Again" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.  This album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. "Hot Stuff" is funky; reggae is evident with "Cherry Oh Baby"; and "Melody" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).  No, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say  "I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!"  The resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being "Bad Boys."  One last thing....  Just wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment "Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording"  Technically incorrect.  -- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., "Revolution" from the White Album).  -- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune "Yer Blues" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.  More technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:  -- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single "Let it Be." The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called "You Know My Name (look up the number)." Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.  -- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune "Yer Blues" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.  -- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release "All You Need is Love."  -- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release "Sing This All Together."	-1
This song has the same problem as "Who Says You Can't Go Home" by Bon Jovi has. It is an already terrible song that overplayed on the radio way too much. "Who Says You Can't Go Home" and this song aren't different from bad lyric placement. The reason why THIS song is bad because of the line "Two days in hell just ain't gonna do". Like I said in the Bon Jovi/Jennifer Nettles song review, songs AREN'T good when they do this. A descent song that does this becomes horrible, and this song was actually already horrible. James Otto isn't a bad artist at all, in fact, he does better with anything other than this song. "Sunset Man", which is the album that features this song, is actually not at all bad. Reviewed, the album would get a 3/5. This song isn't good at all, in fact it is very bad, but at least James Otto's other songs have passion.	-1
Never got this	-1
the title of this song sums it all up. bye bye bye as in good riddance to n suck ! You will not be missed.	-1

This band must have grown up on New York Dolls, or Buster Poindexter music. Nothing really new here, but then, what is?	-1
not good	-1
This version is quiet different from the original.  Not as good, in my opinion.  Wish I purchase the original.  I recommend that you pass on this version.	-1
very disappointed in this version and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song	-1
This is really awful.  Really I can't understand the acclaim this band gets.  In truth the only people that like this are critics that champion stuff like this that no one will care for so that they can feel important within  their little club of like-minded associates.  Sad.  Husker Don't!!!	-1
This artist is apparently very popular in the Christian world, but he just seems to be on some superstar stuff to me.  Most covers for Christian singers are reverent and less flashy.  He is all about the bling. I don't know about this dude.	-1
there is no reason for me to listen to music. it just sucks really bad and has no love in it.	-1
I didn't want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase.	-1
This is one of my favorite songs, but the sound quality is HORRIBLE!!!  Save your money & buy this song from another source.	-1
just OK	-1
The copy is ok, but this is a pretty boring version of this song, if you ask me.... which you kind of inadvertantly did by reading my review.  Im jusssayin' :p	-1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
send it back for a refund	-1
Really, "Beautiful" is the only song that bears repeated listens.  Nothing wrong with the rest...but a band as derivative as this one needs stronger songs to stand out.	-1
I don't like a  "live version" of a song on my computer. After I realized I did purchase a "live" song, I deleted it.  This is no reflection on the song itself.	-1
It's okay.	-1
The song is complete trash and very overrated. Zero stars.	-1
Katy Perry's second hit song, is very......catchy but it's annoying.  It's one of those songs you can't help but hum certain parts to and the video is just....well, it's just there. I thought the ladies dancing with the umbrellas or whatever was kinda cool the first time I saw it but I was wrong.  This song is just the flavor of the week and when I first heard it I didn't like it. It's gotten a bit better since then but don't expect this to win any grammies, LOL  2.5 stars.	-1
For those who think of Katy Perry was really just a poor wannabe artist, that seems what it feels like. Her sound has been more like the depth of Pink had shown with So What. Unfortunately, after I Kissed A Girl, she hasn't really shown herself enough to be a credible singer. Her second single Hot N' Cold, from her debut album One Of The Boys doesn't really feel like it clicks to the listeners' ear. I wasn't really impressed with the strength of the song. It actually felt more like it was a glass of near rancid milk, mixed in with a steaming cup of coffee. She really needs to find catchier songs than this one. Katy really feels like a cold shoulder, and hopefully her next song can really feel more like it is a better bag of tricks.  Song: D-	-1
There honestly is no question about the lack of really good msuci. For Katy Perry whom had scored with I Kissed A Girl a year ago from her debut record, One Of The Boys, her latest single doesn't seem to shine any better. Waking Up in Vegas, the 4th single from that album doesn't make you feel as driven either. I really wasn't impressed with the song at all. While the beat might seem catchy, the strength of the song gets a bit tiring after awhile. Katy really needs to honestly find better material to make her music feel like the worth is all her own much more strong-felt. Hopefully, the next single she makes will make you feel like you're waking up in heaven rather thhan the loss of being in Las Vegas.  Song: D+	-1
There honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential, but others who just haven't made any good songs ata all. For Katy Perry, whom last year was really a bit overdubbed as the I Kissed A Girl vixen, has yet to really make the soul shine as her own. For her latest single, Thinking Of You, the third single from her debut album One Of The Boys, shows that she is trying to grow up quickly from being a wannabe artist, to a rock diva. Sadly, I didn't feel the chemistry here either matched for her either. She might have the appeal, but for Katy Perry herself, she needs to find much better songs to think of. Thinking Of You just wasn't at all a thought in the dark.  Song: D	-1
Sex doesn't sell with this horrible trash.  This is nothing more than a lyrical attempt to sell lesbianism AGAIN.  Been there,  done that!!!!!!!  Tila Tequila is a major crowd pleaser on MTV.  Can we PLEASE move on as a human race?  The songwriting is so horrid,  it can't be classified as campy.  Camp is fun,  this is not.  The music/composition is just another cookie cutter piece of trash as well.  Even a turd can float,  but you can't polish it.  I'm ashamed that this single/LP was released,  ashamed that the recording industry will dive to whatever depths it takes to bring in a dollar.  The vocal is dull and lackluster.  Don't bother.  Move on.  Be silent.	-1
katy perry has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my throat. pure crap	-1
Really this song became popular? She's not a lesbian. Nothing but hype and that's all it is. Too bad I can't give it a zero star. This is just awful.	-1
Back in 1995, Jill Sobule had a hit single called "I Kissed A Girl", which had the catchy chorus: "I Kissed a girl, her lips were sweet, it was just like kissing me, but better." It was a catchy and damn fun to listen to. Now 13 years later, a no-talent named Katy Perry releases a damn song with the same song, just less catchy and a scheme to get attention. This is seriously the worst song ever recorded. Not only does Katy Perry have a HORRIBLE voice (Why is she yelling?), but WHO CARES IF YOU KISSED A GIRL? Besides, what's next, I Got It On With A Chicken (And I Liked It)?	-1
As a shopper of the new Met Fresh Super Center, I actually hear this song played a lot. For newcomer, Katy Perry, she really doesn't seem to actuall have the appeal to really rock out loud. Her debut single, I Kissed A Girl from her debut album One Of The Boys, is one of the most displeasing songs I've ever heard this past year. She really feels like she is trying to be more like flavor of the moment, and sadly she wrecks her chance at the beginning. I really think she needs to really reinvent herself, if she wants to as good as acts like K.T. Tunstall, or even the tabloid drama Queen, Amy Winehouse. If she really wants to win people over, she'd better stop kissing all the wrong girls.  Song: F	-1
Using my free downloads or should I say wasting my free downloads. Coldplay is ok in an elevator but I can't imagine choosing to listen to it.	-1
This latin singer has an outstanding show of emotions that open your heart. Just as great sounding in his latin version.	-1
When it comes down to great young role models, there are few and far between like Miley Cyrus from Hannah Montana. Sadly, though even though she does make a good example for young women, she can make a song or two that feels like it is just a walk that wonders away. That is the case with her first single under her regular name, Miley Cirus, 7 Things. When I first heard the song, I was hoping she'd do something completely different to seperate herself from other younger divas who've made poor songs like Vanessa Hudgens from High School Musical with her latest Sneakernight, or Ashanti with The Way That I Love You. I really was dissapointed in Miley with this song, because it is one of the 7 songs released this year that I really hate out right now.  Song: D-	-1
Cyrus is not a vocalist,  nor is she an entertainer for anyone beyond the age of 10.  This song writing is an Alanis Morissette rip-off,  done poorly I might add.  The vocals are a blemish on an already vulgar face.	-1
Unfortunately vice has crept into music although its a real toe tapper we have had to forbid the children from rhiana due to her immoral lifestyle.	-1
Honestly, 2008 has proven to be the year of the wannabe divas in the music industry, and out of all of those divas, nobody has been more overexposed than Rihanna. While she may feel like she is the greatest thing since sliced bread, the feeling of the songs has a lot more that could be desired. Her latest single, Disturbia, the latest single from her revised A Good Girl Gone Bad album, doesn't feel like it captures a message. The melody of bringing in the dance beats, feels a lot more shallow and doesn't show like it is worth listening. I really feel a bit disturbed with this song, because it isn't worth the soul. The trouble with Rihanna, is that she is not choosing the right notes, and that is why the song stinks.  Song: D	-1
After I listened to this album I realized that I hate Rihanna.  wish I could get my money back.	-1
And the video is just as bad. I mean Rihanna looks OK, but what's up with that blond wig?  I was expecting a great song since its rated so high up on iTunes and what not. But a good song I didn't get.  It wasn't even average. It was poor. I never wanna hear the song again as long as I live.  1.8 stars.  end note: completely forgettable.	-1
Had to suffer through it at the department store today. Just a painful, awful song to have to listen to. I'd rather go hear a symphony of flatulence.	-1
There is no doubt about why I named Rihanna the most Overexposed artist of 2008. she has had so many single and videos that have felt like they've been flimsy and lacking a lot of heart. After the lackluster and less than meaningful Disturbia, is is hard to believe she would make a 9th single, yes that is right a 9th single from the album A Good Girl Gone Bad. Rehab, the latest single from that album, feels more like a waste of soul. While the video shows her trying to seduce Justin Timberlake, the song itself doesn't seem to deliver in tune with her voice. It just feels like it is another waste of pop trash. I'd rather recommend Beyonce's recent single If I Were A Boy as a MP3 download for your player over this song. Rihanna just needs to go away for awhile. Not only that, but if you're looking a real rehab song, choose Amy Winehouse's soul-driven Rehab instead.  Song: F	-1
This new album by Helloween comes with a gorgeous packaging, featuring two CD's, full lyrics, great cover and booklet art. But the music (that's what matters, by the way) is incredible poor, making this another lackluster album in Helloween's discograhpy.  Don't get me wrong, I like the band a lot, but let's face it: with Andi Deris they began to sunk ever more, and their last albums were not great. This new "Keeper" is another disappointment.	-1
Let me lay the backstory on you first, and Ill begin with the albums title Wednesday Morning, 3AM, debuting in 1964, coming from the fact that on a Wednesday night, our dashing duo had just finished their last song at 3AM in a Greenwich Village folk club, and were homeward bound to their digs in Queens  or perhaps it all had to do with the song Wednesday Morning, 3AM.  Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.  Its not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.  The release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers / Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.  Im trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.

what a simple sweet beginning! too bad as an orthodox Jew who spent 15 yeas of his life in forest hills that I can't really relate to simon's little obsession with Catholicism. it's meshuga, that's all. the title song is a song of the night for lovers and a parting is looming. bleecker st is one of those rare postcard songs. in the song, you will find THE bleecker st. PAUL, what the hell are you using Christian imagery here? AND, do you really know what "canaan" is? Sounds of silence is s&g's signature song. In folk mode, it is far more evocative than the folk-rock dressing it attained later.	-1
music is n good nowadays in the sense that it is just plain garbage nowadays. only lonny tunes garbage crap	-1
John Mayer is a decidedly `hit or miss' kind of artist.  He's a soft-rocker who would be more at home on the Adult Contemporary charts.  But, his sex appeal makes him a mainstream darling.  The tradeoff with that is that he has some songs that are too slow and plodding to be properly enjoyed by some.    "Waiting on the World to Change" is just such a song.  It wants to inspire people as one of those socially conscious songs about current events.  Some people view this song that way.  However, the music is just too dull for me to care much about the message.	-1
Annoying. I'd hear this song on the radio every couple of years and be like "Oh cool. Turn it up." Now that I own it I wish I'd kept it to the once or twice a year thing. It's a bit annoying and obnoxious to the ears.	-1
such a waste. foreigner never had a chance after Agent P. Success and internal strife pulled the teeth out of these hard rockers. A healthy Lou G and a humbled Mick J should make one last old school hard rock album... even an EP to make up for this travesty and go out with a bang....	-1
Great being able to buy old music via MP3, and the price was excellent.  Love the cloud player options for downloading purchased music to phone or computer.	-1
Nothing special from what I hear on the 30 second clip. Could be anybody. Rather generic.	-1
never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-  had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!  close to $100 worth of music never received!!	-1
Ok	-1
"Let It Rock" is basically what a good Jonas Brothers would sound like with it's brand of 'tween rock.' It's good to play up loud, and the music keeps you interested. Sure it's not very original, but it's at least fun for a small period of time. On it's own, the Kevin Rudolf part of the song gets 4-stars.  However, like when Andy Dick walks into a room, when Lil' Wayne raps on a song, everybody seems to run out of the room screaming "CRAP-ALEART!" All those however forced to listen to the party killer are forced to endure annoying torture not seen since the days of "MmmBop." Hopefully, if Barack has to dismantle Gitmo, he'll take Andy Dick, Lil' Wayne and "MmmBop" with it. Lil' Wayne = -2-stars.  Overall, a potentially 4-star effort downgraded to 2-star, which is probably what the whole song would deserve in a month or two. Either way, for a party or two, it might be ok, but listened to in large amounts would probably be very unfortunate. Listen at your own risk with every new listen.	-1
None of the songs on this record interested me when I decided to listen to this album after a hiatus of doing so. The only songs that are somewhat descent are "Boondocks" (except for the ending), some flaws of "Welcome to the Family", and "Fine With Me" which is a rather okay song. Little Big Town actually has the balls to make better music after this record, especially with the album after this. I hate every other song on this record, but the worst are "Bones", "Bring it on Home", "A Little More You", and especially "Stay". If you want any Little Big Town music, try not to remember this horrible album and buy anything released from them afterwards while looking for Little Big Town CDs.	-1
For David Arculeta, the runner-up from American Idol this year who lost to David Cook, he hasn't actually been able to really deliver well, from the show, or on his own. Even a few years after he appeared on the short-lived revival on Star Search with Arsenio Hall, his feeling of his songs needs to be more than just a bubblegum pop sound. That is unfortunate with his latest single, Crush. The first post-American Idol single from David Archuleta, really doesn't feel like it sticks from the heart. I really didn't think it was a well-driven song, unlike former American Idol alumini Jennifer Hudson, who actually delivered well with Spotlight. Hopefully, when David does deliver his album, he can break out in a better position than flavor of the moment.  Song: D	-1
The vocals are well produced on this track.  The instrumentation and composition leave so much to be desired for the pop music fan.  The song is lyrically poor and lacks any hook to grab the listener.  Poor,  most poor:  Though I've heard worse from Cook.	-1
Not my favorite.	-1
It's alright	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1

I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.	-1

Although the beat and rhythm are cool, the words trash the song. I dumped it. Next time I'll read the lyrics before purchasing a song like this. Hated it!!!!!!    Kevin J.	-1
Tha Carter III Volume 1 Vinyl only has 8 songs.  I was looking to play let the beat build and it is not on this one.  WTF mane??  How can you sell a vinyl with half of the album and not have that somewhere on the description??  A Milli is bangin	-1
Yet another abomination by the pop rapper Lil Wayne. This is kiddie rap, mainstream filth for the masses of morons. No wonder this is 5 bucks at Best Buy.	-1
This sucks so bad, the videos and Lil wayne look so pathetic.  Rap sucks and this album proves it.  Not only that but if rap fans think this clown who wares 10 year old's jeans is a great rapper then it proves rap sucks.  Even the rap aside....some 80's rap is ok but this stuff is just so obviously stupid and talentless....who the hell buys this stuff!	-1
i respect Weezy's hustle skills and the fact he is Prolific and Productive,but musically when it comes to what he puts out on himself, there is alot to desired. the tracks feel like they are just tossed together and nothing feels tied together. his flows are lazy and just kinda are there. he has a pressence but it never comes all the way out musically and this album is overhyped and getting way more attention than it merits,but I give Wayne His dude for being on the Grind and pushing himself to sell when you hear all the time about file sharing this, downloading this,etc... excuses for not putting your best foot forward. wayne didn't bring it musically on this,but he did give the people what they wanted with hard work. but he needs better tracks to match the Hype.	-1
Lil Wayne is a joke. The cover pic of him as a toddler with gang symbols and bling is wrong. Role model he ain't. Crimminal he is. Lil Wayne better save his money while he is hot. Truth be told, this no-talent thuggette is straight out of the ghetto. If he keeps ___ing , spending and partying hard, he'll end up broke like MC Hammer. Why he even sells says alot about today's sagging generation.	-1
After numerous delays and lots of hype, Lil Wayne finally gives us The Carter 3 and I must it's a huge disappointment. Lil Wayne raps lazy through half the tracks and the hunger he displays on his numerous guest appearances is only present on two or three tracks while the rest of the tracks are mediocre at best which is surprising since the CD features production from Cool & Dre and Kanye West. Lil Wayne is no where near being the best rapper alive and after this mess of a CD he needs to back to the drawing board. If you want real hip hop then check out Kidz In The Hall or Little Brother and not this trite garbage.	-1
This album is not Sepultura album. if you are waiting for another Chaos ad or Arise or any other good album Sepultura had with Max then forget it. This is a bad album. All the songs are the same. There is no good rhythm and the music sounds monotonic and without inspiration. Only to very huge fans of Sepultura	-1
This isn't a terrible album, but when you look at the work of Max's work with Sepultura, this just doesn't really hit a nerve. There are some very good tracks here, but some of the tracks are just plain awful, and Bleed would have been so much better without Fred Durst (hey I don't hate Limp Biskit, I do like a handful of songs, but Fred just doesn't belong with Soulfly) but there things do get better for Soulfly as their music gets better as the albums go on...	-1
another dime a dozen singers.  nothing to brag about with his music.	-1
I love Terrance and his acting is superb.  He just can not sing but he can really play the guitar.  I paid 13.00 for the CD and there were only 2 songs i played a little.  I enjoyed the spanish type song.  Maybe if he was able to sing more soulful. Anyway don't pay the CD, but I love you Terrance you are one of my fav actors.	-1
The actor Terence Howard has ventured into the music form, with this, his debut album. According to the man himself, music is his first love, and if it came to having to choose between acting & music, music would always win out. So, what does he offer us, as a way to see if he is as talented a musician, as he is a actor. Well, firstly there's his voice. On many reviews I have read around the web, he has been castigated for his singing voice, which I think is a little harsh. Bob Dylan and Lou Reed are two artists that, to my ears, haven't got the greatest voices in the world, but that doesn't stop them from having success and award selling albums. To these ears his voice suits the music on offer. And to me that is the problem, the music on offer. Whilst not awful, there's not much here that stands out. Whilst it's pleasant sounding, it all kind of blends into a much ness. The exception to this rule and my favourite track on offer here is 'Spanish Love Guitar' in which Terence show cases his skills on said guitar. This is a lovely moment that I kept on repeat for a while, enjoying the soothing sound.  I do hope that this isn't Mr. Howard one & only shot at a musical and that Sony back him with the means to produce a sophomore album. This CD hints at more to come.	-1
god!!!... ummm.....where to begin? This cd was horrible his voice, the music everything. Wow!!!...I don't know what I expected, but it was damn sure not this mess...I want my $9.99 dollars back ....wow!!!!! this cd is a hot mess....Please Terence just act and leave the singing to the professionals.....God!!!! just awful	-1
pitiful attempt cher techno or whatever you're trying to do is not your thing baby.	-1
Cher's vocal talents are marginal at best, maybe its all that plastic surgery. There is NOTHING on this CD worth listening to, pure garbage. If I hear "Believe" one more time.....	-1
call this singing? sounds more like a dog getting attacked by a cat.the music is weak 3rd rate disco.how does she still have hits with such a flat voice? you have to be tone deaf to respect that so-called singing  voice.it's always been bad.she&Jennifer Lopez are in the same boat.both  should stick to acting.	-1
Another victim of the loudness war.  Compression & distortion ruin what would otherwise be a fine CD.  Here's a suggestion: Deaf recording engineers are really baaaaad for the end product.  If I wanted to listen to compressed & distorted, --I could always turn on the radio. OverCompression puts a turd in the proverbial punchbowl of fine art.	-1
I do not let this song.  This song does not included L.L Cool J, Snoop Doggie Dog and other rappers at the end.	-1
I thought I was buing something other than the theme song for a movie	-1
Why people like this band is beyond me.  Every album they release is the same exact annoying thing.	-1
Nickelback churn out release after release of poor derived pop rock dribble. There is nothing new from the band, no new angle, no change. It's precisely the same monotonous punchy chord guitar playing, grainy whiney vocals and horribly clichd lyrics that featured on previous albums.  What makes Nickelback all the more insulting is the undeserved popularity. I was over in Canada a little while ago and on one of their rock stations a poll took place, their `rock world cup', this match up was Nickelback vs Pearl Jam, and you guessed it, Nickelback stormed it. Such an insult to Pearl Jam, an original band that Nickelback completely rip the sh*t off.  Quite simply Nickelback's music is mediocre, there's nothing worth listening to. Do yourself a favour and listen to some original guitar driven rock, par example `Soundgarden', `Alice In Chains' or `Pearl Jam'.	-1
Nobody gets on the radio without the backing of a major label who spend on average $300,000 per song per "artist".  ALL music heard on commercial radio has been extensively market researched using focus groups.  So the music you hear on radio is deliberately chosen, if not designed, to appeal to the most people in the demographic that is being marketed to.  Because so much money is at stake both in terms of profit and promotion, major record companies are interested not in music, but in moving product.  Art and integrity don't matter, only sales.  That is why we have bland, musical junkfood like Nickleback's The Long Road clogging up the airwaves.  And it's only going to get worse as more and more radio stations or marketing outlets are owned by fewer and fewer corporations.  Art by committee sucks folks.  As a marketing device Nickleback are brilliant, as music they stink on ice.  This is about as mindlessly commercial as it gets.	-1
Nickelback's The Long Road, the follow up to their previous hit album Silver Side Up, sounds as if it came to soon. The Long Road does have its highlights with the radio staples "Someday" and the raunchy Figured YOu Out,but when it comes to the rest of the album there's nothing there. Most of The Long Road sounds like their using the same song over and over, most of the performances are unispired and dual. A major disappointment when compared to Silver Side Up.	-1
listening to a Nickelback cd is not unlike having a maniac dismember you with a rusty, dull blade. It is a horrifying, brutal experience and the best part is when it is over. Shame on anyone who likes this band.	-1
If you want to blow chucks for over 60 minutes, get this album.  Crappy modern-rock with a cocky lead singer who can't sing if he had to save his life.  This is an insult to rock music.  I shudder at the thought that this is not their first album ... ugh, and we all though Creed was bad...this is by far the worst rock band ever.  Save your money and buy a CD worth while like Pearl Jam's 'Ten' or Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' because this is garbage.	-1
Nickelback is subhuman. Quite literally, this is music by cavemen for cavemen. I was going to compare Nickelback's songs to "Bah Bah Black Sheep" but I think that would be a misrepresentation -- "Bah Bah Black Sleep" is far more musically sophisticated. Actually, if you give a caveman an electric guitar, he will probably write better songs than the Nickelback guy because he is not chained to the modern Zeitgeist of three-chord gorilla-rock, three-note vocal melodies, and pathetic drummers that barely navigate an eighth-note rock beat (and even then with zero variation). It's not even a matter of the music being pathetically basic (it's a contingent relationship rather than a necessary one) -- the music is just flat-out crappy. The lyrics approach new standards of verbal diarrhea, and yet with the way certain lines are emphasized you just KNOW they *think* they write really clever lyrics. There is probably a praxeological axiom that states Nickelback is the worst band in the world.	-1
Barlow Girl is known for their rock harmonies. For Christmas songs from popular artists I'm looking for the sound of the artist and a fresh take on a classic. In this case, we get another classic sung by a band singing like they sing classics. There is nothing here that reminds of Barlow Girl or the kind of music that Barlow Girl fans would enjoy. There isn't anything new in this song. There isn't any reason to recommend it over any other version.  This song is not a Barlow Girl song, which is too bad.	-1
had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!! 17 other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!	-1
Seemed like the best collection of Beatles songs, but can't give it anything but 1 star because of the packaging.  There are 2 discs in cardboard/paper sleeves.  I assume to keep them in, there is some kind of sticky stuff ON THE CD!!  One, I was able to get it off because it was only on the edge.  But the other, the sticky stuff runs across the CD.  It is not usable.	-1
So you want a Beatles greatest hits album. You see two old and one new compilations on the racks -- the much toted BEATLES 1 or the RED and BLUE ALBUMS respectively. Reasoning it out, you see both are double discs whereas BEATLES 1 is only a single disc. You want to know the sad part? BEATLES 1 is longer than both individually. Why? Because they want to stick to the original format supposedly. Yeah, whatever. I think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting Beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rock'n'roll history (you mean there are actually people who don't know The Beatles' entire body of work by heart?? For shame!) Both of them clock in about 70 minutes, whereas BEATLES 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes. Either they need to do one of two things:  1. Expand the RED and BLUE albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection (the White Album is woefully underrepresented, whereas seven of Magical Mystery Tour's 11 songs are on there).  2. Add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively, getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can, and slap them onto a double disc set. That way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs. The only problem here that will undoubtedly crop up is the tendency to slaughter the cover art on Beatles records, and these make nice contrasting pictures, although the Red is from PLEASE PLEASE ME.  As far as the music goes, so much has been written about The Beatles what more is there to say. Its all great stuff of course.	-1

I don't know why, but since I heard "Rehab" from Amy Winehouse, the first thing that came to my mind was, "Gosh, she sounds as a prefab-recycled product from the Record Industry"!  Therefore, you may like or dislike her musical style. In my very humble opinion, I don't like this singer at all. Her music is a well-made 'collage' of other musical styles. Nothing new. She pretends to sound like... Etta James?? Her image of the 'New Bad Girl in the Music Scene' appears completely false and empty. Lots of dirty language in her songs, add nothing better to her music and image.  Then I say: AW is a NO-NO-NO choice for serious music listeners! Don't spend your money buying music from this artist. Period!	-1
Well after all the buzz, I expected something new, fresh, different and exciting.  But what I experienced was a instant replay of the Motown sound and on the first tune of what sounded like Dancing in the streets for the musical support for the song Rehab.  As I continued to listen, I encountered much of the same sounds and lyrics that emulate the sounds and bite off of the song title "Me & Mrs. Jones, Billy Paul from back in the day.  Later in the CD, I could have sworn I heard the music from 60's Supreme Diva's "Baby Love".  Now wait just one minute, I thought what is this? and before I knew it the CD had ended, just as fast as it began.  Like getting to the creshindo and letting the song drop.  But now as I look at the reviews I think the fasination is the fact that this British, artist is mimicing the Black Motown era experience to some level of their expectations, of course I grimaced.  You see some people just don't get it but if you really want to hear a current artist who has truly created the essence of an old school generation you should listen to Chrisette Michelle, who really bring the best of lessons taught by Ella, Billie, Aretha, and Natalie.  And most importantly she brings her own unique style and music along the way.  I didn't see any mention or credits given to any of those artist that Amy mimics which it a bigger DISGRACE.  To add insult to injury she named this "Back to Black".  Rehab is what your Daddy should advise. Lastly the reference some reviewer made to Erykah Badu,LISTEN UP.... THERE IS NO COMPARISON.  She AIN'T got NO-THING on DAT!	-1
Amy Winehouse is so freakin' ugly, how does she sell albums? A total druggie, alcoholic, and god how much does she weigh, 45 pounds? She is a terrible role model, she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan. Winehouse can't sing, she thinks she is some rockin' soul singer from the 1960's but she isn't, she is just a wannabe. Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album, but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now, then this album should make you happy.	-1
The production value of this disc left me cold.  Great songs, but did the producers skimp on the budget or what?  Get a drummer with some real chops to liven this up.	-1
i have heard this album and I don't get all the hype. AMy Winehouse is creative to a extent,but she sounds like Ronnie Spector trying to channel Lauyren Hill and it has a mixed reaction. the retro Girl Group style and sound of the 60's is charming for a while and then it starts to wear then and feels gimmicky after a while. Production and Musicianship is solid, and the writing has some moments,but the overall vibe doesn't knock me out.	-1
This might seem counterintuitive to my video review:  I think the music is great and fun - though I'm not sure how good as a stand-alone without the video.  My big beef?  $11.99 for 22 minutes worth of music?  Really?	-1
I didn't realize that there were two versions when I bought this one. In my opinion the acoustic version is much, much better! This one she sings quicker and it just doesn't have the same feel.	-1
There is no question about the hype around American Idol. It is so sad that a lot of the artists who've won American Idol haven't really delivered with quality songs the past few years, like Jordin Sparks with No Air, or Kelly Clarkson a few years ago with Never Again, which felt like it was another Since You've Been Gone. That feels the same with David Cook, who won this year. His latest single Light On from his debut album, felels like it lacks a lot of heart. I really felt that the song just has weighed down in the feeling of the singer. I deeply wasn't impressed with the song, and just felt like I've really been let down with so many of the American Idol contendors, as dissapointements. Let's see if David can actually improve with the next single, and hopefully see if the light is on.  Song: D+	-1
This single's negative traits aren't the artist's fault. "Light On" is an ATTEMPT to create "music".  This artist's voice doesn't need overt production.  The industry needs to realize that when one wins American Idol,  it wasn't because of ANYTHING that needed changing (ie: his hair, face, make-up, voice, stage ability).  Cook won on his OWN merit with his voice.  Let the music you HELP him produce focus on his voice,  not this 80's type-Daughteresque, over produced muck.  Sad for Cook,  he is a great vocalist.	-1
I just heard "Light On" for the first time...My first thought was "OH NO"!!!  This CAN'T be your first real single.  So I played it again and again...and again.  Nothing changed...no chills of excitement...nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was...he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit...  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song...complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes??  Let's just hope the rest of the album is MUCH better...it has to be!	-1
ok	-1
I don't particularly like this version of the song, but I had a need for "Joy to the World", and this one just so happened to be free. I'll be looking for something more substantial next Christmas season.	-1
Never heard this song, wife must have bought it.  She doesn't leave reviews however, so hope this works for whoever's reading it.	-1
just ok	-1
hello,   this was not up to our standards for a different xmas version of the song.  it was free, but not worth it.	-1
Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol	-1
Just not my type of music. If you like metal you might like this! Music is all a personal choice and mine isn't metal.	-1
You really have to be very young or love HARD METAL and I am neither. Not recommended for traditionalist. Highly recommended for hard medal lovers.	-1
$1.29 is a THIRTY PERCENT increase in the price of music.  REFUSE TO PAY for these over-priced songs!  There are plenty still available at $0.99.  Tell the record companies WE WILL NOT PAY MORE!	-1
Older version	-1
The people impressed with this must not have heard New Beginnings, her last cd. This new one is so monotone and go nowhere it's a mystery as to what the heck happened. New Beginnings is one of my favorite cd's, and  Telling Stories would be my least favorite if it weren't for the title  track. This cd has no zip, zing, or pizzazz. Would someone please wake her  up?	-1
This track is fascinating because the singers stay in this awkward high note.  This group riddled the early to mid-90's.  If you worked at the time it came on whole yuo were working and shoppers shopped.  You become fond of Ace of Base.	-1
I TRULEY LOVE Jennifer Hudson,  and her Voice is Amazing!! But I did purchase her New 20011 CD (Remember ME) I am So Disappointed, I truly wasted my money.  I was so unhappy With it!!	-1
This CD is very disappointing. For all of the hype around Jennifer Hudson, I expected a stellar debut on par with Whitney Houston's classic. Jennifer's CD suffers from mediocre, lazy material and ill-conceived collaborations. The song with T-Pain is beyond terrible, and the "Pocketbook" song with Ludacris is equally bad. "I'm His Only Woman" would have been a decent song, but it is such a blatant rip-off of Shirley Brown's soul classic "Woman To Woman" that I can't even take it seriously. I'm thoroughly disappointed with this CD.	-1
I like Jennifer Hudson, but was not feeling this cd at all except for a couple of songs the rest was just ....blah...adds nothing new to the table..oh well maybe next time	-1
Jennifer is a great success story. It seems hard to believe that its almost been 2 years since Dreamgirls came out and a fan like me was wondering when is she ever going to release her debut CD. In the end i realized that perhaps her heart just wasn't to into the MUSIC. Finally Spotlight gets released and its a cute single. It took a bit to grow on me but it has a great chorus and nice background vocals. Other then that after spinning this album a few times i still haven't found any redeeming tracks that i love or tracks that stand out enough to be a winner. This album seemed very directionless and if any artist takes 2 years to churn out an album you should either have a masterpiece or an album done half azz job. Unfortunately thats what we get here, something half done. I guess over the course of 2 years she just sang track to track when she had free time or nothing to do. Jennifer already has a very soulful voice so adding a church choir to some of the background vocals only sends the song to ethnic over drive. "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going" shouldnt even be on this album. I felt like the producers were doing everything they can to provide fans with as little new material as possible. Adding that song was trying so hard to make this release have over 10 songs. The song from the Sex & The City soundtrack isn't even on here. The last song about Jesus is ridiculous!!! What does Jennifer know about a Jewish Rabbi whose mother claimed she had her son without intercourse. There's only really 1 good song on this entire album and thats the Diane Warren written song. None of the tracks here seem interesting, relevant, or addictive enough to keep me interested. Here's hoping that her next album will have better producers.  Stand out tracks are: You Pulled Me Through (Best Song on the Album 10/10) Spotlight (Good 08/10) If This Isnt Love (Good 08/10)	-1
When it comes down to new artists, they either have it, or they just don't. For newcomer Lady Gaga, who made a breakthrough with Just Dance, she doesn't seem to hit that nail on the head with her latest effort. Poker Face, the second single from her debut record, feels like it has a mismatch within the beats. It really isn't a song that doesn't feel as catchy, or something that just drives like it did before. I just wasn't impressed with the song at all. It didn't feel like you could easily get up and dance to it, and just makes your mind think like it should've dealt out a royal flush, than a pair of deuces. I hope for Lady Gaga, she can deliver better the next time around.  Song: D	-1
I don't hate all of Gaga's work but this song is lame as heck. Rather go with another song by her.	-1
This is good listening music for the young; dancing too I guess. Too young for me but I still recommend it.	-1
Way too many  songs of this artist on the radio, I don't find her particularly talented. What we don't do to keep our kids happy.	-1
this is not a good song thought id like it but it is not would not recamend it to anyone	-1
This is one of the originals and it is OK. Rarely heard anymore but good listening for easy music time.	-1
After two great singles, Lady GaGa originality is flushed with this song, which is terrible since she's such a talent, and her stage personality is one of the most entertaining today. What's the problem with LoveGame? It's incredibly unoriginal, so much so I couldn't even distinguish it was her singing, because it sounds like every other song on radio. It's also unmemorable, not catchy, and certainly not fun.  So hopefully no love will be shown to a song that's clearly trying to game its audience so we can move on to true Lady GaGa music. Great job here, producers...	-1
There sometimes can be an artist that feels like an imitation of something else, or just make so many songs that feel like they are absolutely a waste of time. For Lady Gaga, she really hasn't done enough to seperate herself from the wannabe image. For her latest single, LoveGame from her debut album The Fame, feels like a bigger waste of time to listen to than her previous songs. It honestly felt like she was trying to catch a more upbeat vibe that felt like an imitation of songs that Britney Spears and others were already known for. I wasn't very impressed with the song it all. It felt like there was absolutely not enough pizazz for this love. I think she needs to find better songs than this particular game.  Song: D	-1
Why does Amazon.com insult music lovers with anything from KTel?  Any person who knows anything about music could never appreciate, let alone listen to remakes.  These are an insult to the original hits.  Why can't KTel use original hit recordings.  The sound quality is there, and I can't understand why they even waste that on something that isn't original.  I would have rated this even lower if I could.  Please save your money, and avoid anything done by KTel.	-1
K-Tel released their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/first-volume/dp/B0000DD78F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">first volume</a>&nbsp;of remakes of one hit wonders in 2003, and apparently they were able to corral another batch of original stars to re-record their seminal hit singles. Like the previous collection, these remakes generally follow the arrangements and sound of the originals, but anyone familiar with the hit recordings will quickly notice differences. Most notably the vocalists haven't the youthful tone of their earlier years, and though the productions are of good quality, these simply haven't the magic of hit singles.  Worse for this second helping, the producers have loosened their grip on the concept of "one hit wonder." B.J. Thomas had two #1s and a dozen Top 40s, and the Diamonds had fifteen charting singles, including a second #1 with "The Stroll." Lynn Anderson and Faron Young were major country music stars whose limited crossover hits might quality them as pop one-hit wonders, except that Anderson had six singles on the pop chart, and Young scored much higher with "Hello Walls" (#12) than "It's Four in the Morning," which stalled at #72 on the pop chart.  There are some bona fide one-hit wonders here in Eddie Holman, Bob Lind, Jewel Akens, Sheb Wooley, Ned Miller, Caravelles, and Bob Luman, but for the most part their hit recordings weren't licensed. Akens' "The Birds and the Bees" could be the real thing, as might be a few others, but without a trusted copy of the originals at hand, it's hard to really know. And that's exactly the problem with a collection like this: re-makes blur the historical record and leave listeners wondering if they're hearing the actual artifact or a smartly produced copy. Or in the case of Joe South's "Games People Play," Mary Wells' "My Guy" and Santo & Johnny's "Sleep Walk," not-so-smartly-produced copies. With most the original recordings of these hits readily available, there's no reason to accept substitutes.

Since some 'highly confused' folks gave this dog of an album five stars, I thought I should add a new review in to warn anybody who is even thinking of buying this sham that is it nothing but a collection of crappy remakes. Pathetic!  (Sad: Remember when K-Tel put out some good collections of original hits?!?)	-1
The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.	-1
Old but I remember it well. Jimmy Dean. Its More Poem than Song. Good sound and clear as a bell	-1
First of all lets correct the misinformation here Keith was not a one hit wonder after 98.6 he came back even stronger with Ain't Gonna Lie which went higher on the charts,second K-tel in the 70,s was a wonderful company who presented only original hits and I do mean original but with the advent of cd,s K-tel no longer could get the rights to release the original songs on cd so they went and got the original artists to redo the songs,this is a poor way to try and get more money from the customer by shamming them into believing these are the originals and they put in very very very small print redone by the original artists,get the original hits on Amazon there not that much more and you,ll be three times as pleased. Shame on you K-tel you were once the leadre in compilations by original artists and now this is how far you have fallen..	-1
I'm OK with someone changing their sound a bit just to liven things up. However, there is about 80% less piano here and about 80% of the tunes are so lifeless here. He sings with next to no feeling. And the choruses are repeated too much. "Satisfaction" and "Take Me Away" are said painful songs to endure. Also this 3rd effort is way, WAY too upbeat. It gives the whole album an emptier vibe than I think John really wanted. "Green Light" is the only upbeat track here that I like. He steps out from the piano here and this song lights up the room. It just works. "Everybody Knows" and especially "This Time" are also really good tracks. "Quickly" featuring Brandy is OK but gets old. "No Other Love" featuring Estelle fairs a bit better and is a song you can get through without cringing. There is depth to be heard in some of the lyrics to the songs. In fact I really like when John is talking about not having love anymore cause here, like on "Everybody Knows" it really works. I felt his pain on that track. But most of the hooks here fall flat. I was shocked that I hated the majority of the album as much as I did. I honestly wouldn't care if I never heard this album again in my life. Yes, it's that bad, John. To put it bluntly he will only have to half try on his next CD to come up with better material than this because he's talented. But this is a mess. Seriously.  So average it's painful. Skip it altogether.  2.5 stars.	-1
This album is sooooooo boring. I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing. His vocals are solid, but he didn't to anything remotely interesting. Their is no entertainment value if you are into vocal performance.	-1
Unfortunately, listening to rain for this long does not calm me. It makes me want to check all of my windows to see if the rain comes in and it makes me want to pee!	-1
I would not write this artist off completely- but this is not exactly what I had in mind.   Not a lot of thunder in this cd.  Anyone considering this for de-sensitization on dogs afraid of thunderstorms pass on this one.  It is a relaxation cd but some people preferred more thunder - and  while this is *not* promoted for helping dogs over come thunder, I don't think it had enough thunder to be effective if someone has chosen the product for this purpose.	-1
This is not the original Fallin' In Love we remember from Frank & Hamilton!  Do some research and bring back the recording done in the mid-70s!	-1
