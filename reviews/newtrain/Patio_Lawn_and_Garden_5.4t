These really work!	1
Man do these things work! Horse flys love them. Not sure about house flys. I use them in the yard.  My neighbor has like six horses. Never had problems tell they moved it.	1
works very well. after a few weeks it smells awful, but the smell does a super job of attracting flies.	1
This really gets the job done. But, I wouldn't suggest putting it near the house or outdoor areas close to entrances. This will kill all the flies around for sure, but the smell will also attract more flies from far or further away so be prepared.	1
It is odd to us that we get flies at our apartment on the third floor. We put one of these out and it works great. Within one week we already have about ten flies trapped and this has prevented them from coming in our apartment. We only wish some sort of a string or hanging device would have come with the package. We ended up using zip plastic lines to hold it up.	1
Good tool for controlling flies	1
I have a major house fly problem with those stupid black flies. I bought 2 of these and 1 of the Victor M380 fly traps. I set up both traps in the same place. After 1 day, 1 of the sterling traps caught 1 bug and the other caught no bugs. The Victor trap caught at least 10 flies.  I thought these traps were no good but left them up for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the Sterling trap had around a million flies in it while the Victor one had 100 flies. I'd say these are equal to or better than the victor ones.	1
This fly trap works very well to catch those pesky flies that come after your food in your yard. This is a trap that works with a sugar and egg protein solution. You must use a knife or razor to cut a circle as directed. You also need some string to hang it (I used trussing string). It takes a few hours prior to the trap to start working but it does.	1
The Rescue FTD Non-Toxic Disposable Fly Trap is great for attracting flies and keeping them away from your house.  You have to pour water in and mix it with the included powder to activate the chemical fly lure, which smells pretty rank.  Note:  the odor is NOT pleasant.  The flies love this stuff, though, and will be drawn to it rather than your BBQ or deck.  Just make sure to place it a good 75+ feet from your house, though, because as the flies enter it, die and rot, the smell becomes unspeakable.  When it comes time to take it down and throw it out, make sure you have latex gloves, multiple plastic bags, a protective suit, and Vics Vapor Rub for under your nose. It really does work and it will draw the flies away from your house all summer.	1
works but the smell is sooo disgusting.  need to hang it far from people	1
stinky	1
These work so well that it seems unfair to the flys. Thank you.	1
Sure does work.  Be ready to change them out often unless there are somewhere you cannot smell the stench.	1
This product does a great job. I have 2 large dogs and when they do their business it can be quite the attractor for flies if not picked up right away. I placed this behind my shed which is a favorite drop site and I don't see flies in my yard anymore. It can be quite the smell so place away from a spot you'll be frequenting.	1
These need to be sturdier and work better.  One split open and the contents spilled out when my son dropped it only 2-3 feet while trying to hang it (you should include wire or string, too) and the other hasn't caught many flies at all.  About 5 in a whole week.  It's hanging in a stable!	-1
We built a chicken coop in our backyard earlier this year and noticed that we started getting more flies as the weather got warmer. Since the coop isn't too far away from our deck and grill, it became increasingly annoying to do anything near our favorite spots. We purchased this product after reading many reviews and are certainly glad we did.  We hung the trap with butcher's twine after filling with water as instructed. We decided to place the trap behind our shed and closer to our compost bin rather than hanging directly onto the coop itself. The smell that emits after a few days is quite strong with the right wind. We didn't notice any smells otherwise, I'd say because of its placement behind the shed. Whatever was wafting from this trap seemed very effective, as within a week the thing was full with crawling flies. We've used two so far this season and haven't had many flies around our backyard since.	1
strong odor	1
These things work, but boy do the STINK!  I guess that's why they are so effective.	1
I had no idea we had so many flies!  One trap lasted most of the summer before I tossed it.  Just replace the water periodically.  This really works.	1
Wow. wow. WOW.  I just moved to a new house in the country, and my neighbor owns a horse. At first I was happy that this beautiful animal was outside my window when I woke up.... that all went down the drain after I noticed the flies!  I literally have purchased 5 or 6 different styles of fly traps to see which one works best. The raid fly strips had 20-30 flies on them, the weird sticky aluminum foil colored tube had 5-10, and the others had almost none.  THIS PRODUCT ROCKS!  This thing has not only flies, but HORSE FLIES, and fruit flies! It has easily over 100 flies!!!  My only complaint is the smell it puts off, but throw it in a well ventilated area and forget about it.	1
Work well, smell horrible. Highly recommend these, just make sure to put a safe distance away from where you like to be because when the sun hit them, it makes the area smell like a dirty porta potty.	1
Yes it works . . . .	1
It is effective, it works (you will get a whole bag of flies) and flying insects.  I use them in my garage in the summer time.  They work and get the job done!	1
Update:  I've moved the traps away from the shelter.  The site where I buy fly predators said to not put them in the barn.  I kept wondering if I was attracting more flies and that seems to be the case.  After taking the fly trap away from the horse shelter, the trap is still attracting large numbers of flies and there are fewer in the shelter.  The second trap was moved so it wasn't in direct sun.  It has more flies, too.  Update 9/26/2016:  One of the traps is already full.  The bag filled to the point that new flies couldn't get in.  Flies were still attacted and gathered around the opening, but the hole at the end of the funnel was blocked.  This design really works.  It still stinks, too.  -8-8-8-8-8-8-  It's hard to believe something so disgusting could be so fascinating.  I take morbid delight in watching the flies land on the yellow plastic and crawl down into the funnel and get trapped.  I put the first trap inside a 3-sided  horse run-in shelter.  The flies get bad toward the end of summer even with picking up manure every day and using fly predators.  We live in a rural area and neighbors have goats, chickens, turkeys, sheep, dogs and cows all around us.  It seemed to take a while for the trap to start working, but once it did, there is always lots of action in and around the trap.  Even though one side of the shelter is completely open, the smell gets intense some days.  It doesn't seem to bother the horses, though.  I hung the other trap on an outside location hanging on the side  of an old, white trailer we use for hay storage.  That seems to be a better location.  The flies started crawling in within minutes.  Flies seem to find the attractant easily.  I'm tempted to move the trap from the shelter.  Setup was easy.  Cut along a line on the top, pull out the yellow plastic part, tie something to the hole in the top to hang the trap, add water to the line and hang somewhere you don't have to smell it.  For people overwhelmed by the stinky smell, a little Vick's Vaporub under the nose will mask the smell long enough to discard the trap.  Menthol smell helps a lot.	1
expensive but worth it.  will fill up in a couple weeks.  i do it twice every spring and i'm good for the summer	1
2 nd  Purchase. They are amazing, the way they draw and catch flies. Could Not be better Pleased.	1
" Works, Wow does it ! , Just about solved our dumpster fly problem @ our Senior Citizens Center.  This one filled up 3/4, put out another.  Takes a week to get going;  now both are like a bee hive. Rained some, the 1st one seemed to go down, and made more space. Still drawing flies. This past week, they were flying circles, trying to land and get in.	1
These are amazing, AND, they keep bees, horseflies, greenheads and every other nasty biting flying thing away.  But, there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?  The smell.  Ugh, the smell is awful.  I place these in my woods that surround my pool and the smell is less nauseating while in the pool.  Initially I placed them 30' or so away but that's not enough.  I had to relocate them - yes, I needed a clothesline clip to pinch my nose.  So I practiced breathing out of my mouth so that I could approach these nasty smelling things and successfully relocated them further into my woods and it worked.  NO more bee stings, welts from bites, green headed flies biting and swarming us!  We also have a natural honey beehive nearby and they were using our pool as their water source.  No more since these stinky fly traps were installed.  We were reluctantly killing 30+ bees a day.  Thanks to our fly traps, we no longer killed the very important honey bees.  They get their water from a nearby lake now instead of our pool and I no longer feel guilty about killing bees that were stinging my family.  These things work amazing!	1
Works unbelievably well - a 2 pack gets me through the summer	1
these work so well!! I live in Northern NH and we had an unusually warm winter so the bugs (all bugs) were bad this summer especially black flies.  We put these up around the perimeter of our yard and it is amazing how many flies it has caught!! I actually have ordered 4 all together and they have all filled up! The only thing is they smell horrible to attract the flies but we put them on the other side of the yard so it isn't a big deal.	1
We were having fly problems near our pool. I put one of these up and it works great. We still see an occasional fly but the problem has been reduced by 90%.	1
Great product, it has diminished the fly population in my yard dramatically. Just hang it in a way that bears can't get at it. Mine consider the full bag a delicacy.	1
There is nothing that does a better job of catching flies around my chickens than this product. Flies get trapped in it. No poison. You just close it up and toss when full. Tip: hang in the shade.	1
Great product. Very happy. Thanks!	1
These things are great. If you hate flies as much as I do they literally improve the quality of your life. This is late August and the last 2 bags filled up in less than a week. The flies can't wait to get in but they can't get out.	1

We used to be attacked by flies on our patio and put this up about 30 hours ago. We were able to sit out on the patio with only a few fly visitors thanks to this, which is chock full of flies (see video).	1
They work, the flies in the summer don't seem so annoying, satisfied with the product.	1
I have used one so far as directed.  I placed in a sunny spot near my chicken coop.  I caught flies until it filled so full no more could get in.  It did smell a bit, but that was expected.	1
Flies love this bag, i didn't notice any smells but it certainly filled up quickly in my backyard.	1
This stuff smells (literally) like something died. It is awful. It was semi full of flow when we chucked it after a week (and then even after triple bagging it had to Clorox our dumpster) but we didn't feel that there were less flies around. This stuff is DISGUSTING. We bought 2 and I threw the other one away without using it. We couldn't go in our back yard all week but figured if got rid of the flies it was worth it for a week..nope still had flies and a NASTY smelling back yard.	-1
These bags are amazing. Be sure to mount away from area that you are in. 30ft is a good idea. I say, cut my fly's by 98% after 2nd replacement (1st bag was full).	1
Helps cut down on our fly problem alot.  I used to get flies in the house all the time if my daughter accidentally left the back door open (even just for a couple minutes), I'd tried fly paper and that didn't seem to help, but this does the trick.  The other reviews are right, it does stick, but unless theres a breeze, as long as your 4-5 feet away you won't smell it.	1
These are really effective in high fly areas. Most people think something died when they come in close proximity to it because the odor is rather foul--I suppose that is what attracts the flies. It will fill up in no time. I don't enjoy harming any animal or insect so I have to not look at it when I walk by as the flies get trapped inside. On the flip side, when they are too many and all over my animals, I've got to take action. It says it takes a while for it to start working, but every time I hang one, it's almost immediately attracting flies. Be mindful of how you hang it--you'll have to get it down to throw it away and you will not want that water to splash on you!	1
Some people say these have a really strong odor.  I can barely smell them even when I'm close. Kills an amazing number of flies. Works great.	1
This fly trap really works. The instructions are simple - cut along the dotted line at top and add water. The pouch inside the bag will dissolve and the attractant gets released. I had flies clamoring to get inside within 30 minutes. They fly in through the opening up top, but once in they can't figure out how to get out. Brilliant!  The only drawback is the odor. It is strong and offensive. You may get a faint hint of it initially, but in 2 days it will be very obvious as to where the source of this odor is from. You have to strategically place this in an area where you can't smell it. An occasional whiff is okay, but you won't be liking it on a regular basis.  It's been a month and a half since I started using this and flies are still accumulating inside. The odor has definitely lessened, so the attractant must be close to its shelf life. I won't hesitate in ordering more. Outdoor activities are definitely more enjoyable now!	1
Just ordered more...works great	1
This tray is so good it a tracked flies that were not in my yard....	1
Flies didn't seem to care about this thing at all. Smell isn't great, but not horrible. You don't want to be sitting anywhere close to it though.	-1
Don't know why I waited to long to purchase these. We're amazed how quickly fly's are attracted and 'take the bait'. We will never be without these traps during spring, summer and fall. A 10 Star product!	1
My husband bought two of these outdoor disposable fly traps.  We also have one of the Black Flag disposable fly traps.  Needless to say, the Sterling Rescue Fly Trap has collect far more flies than the Black Flag!  As soon as the outdoor temperature hit the high 80s, this fly trap started pulling in the flies.  It doesn't smell very nice so be sure to hang it somewhere that the smell won't bother you.  Unfortunately, one of our little hummingbirds is attracted to the yellow top of this bag but so far hasn't tried to find nectar in the bag.	1
These work GREAT, just don't hang them close. The smell is really bad, but if there is a fly on my land, it flys right in the bag. Love these	1
Unreal how many bugs these things caught. The bag was completely full. Kind of sad how many it killed!	1
These work well. Best fly trap that I have ever used and price effective.	1
Used 1 to fight the fly issue at the house for the season and filled it up and won the war this season.	1
This trap delivers as advertised--catching a phenomenal number of flies.  No hesitation to recommend.	1
These are the best!  I have tried other brands, but this brand is the best at catching all the flies.	1
We put in a pool this year and were being pestered by flies when we floated around.  I ordered these to see if they would help and they did!  They took them completely away from us!  I hung them on our fence away from the pool and we really were not bothered after that.  I am ordering more to take us through the end of pool season!	1
I've been using these for 3 years since we built a compost pile and became "chicken parents".  One of these hanging over the compost keeps the flies WAY down in the yard.  Just be sure to hang it where you won't be hanging out. Peeeeuuuu, but how else to attract the flies??  It takes a few days to get "ripe" and then, boy does it fill up!  I leave the full one up while the new one gets ripe, so we're never without.  We're high in the Rocky Mountains, so our fly season is only a few months.  I top it off often & squeeze it to trap the babies that are hatched, then start flying around within the bag. Yes, you can see maggots, but it all goes tightly into a trash bag and out with the garbage on trash pick up day.  Wouldn't have chickens & compost without one of these to help!	1
These things are the greatest thing EVER! I don't have to be nearly as careful/worried opening my door to go out or come in. There aren't flies swarming all over the place. This may be the greatest thing I've ever bought - - - besides the chips for my pets!	1
This trap works wonders. I've used multiple fly tapes and haven't caught a single one and I used this for two weeks and caught dozens of flies. The only downfall is that I live in Arizona and the water dries out quick.	1
Read the directions for opening the package before you tear or cut the bag.  I ruined the first one by not reading the directions!  This is the BEST product I have ever seen, by far, to take care of the many pesky flies we had in our large backyard.  I put the first one up a week ago, and the second up today.  Before I could even finish tying the heavy duty string to the second one, flies were already moving toward it.  I tied one to a tree on the side of our house.  It's around the corner from our patio and back yard, so the horrible smell cannot be detected as we sit outside, and yet it is not too far away, so the flies that liked the patio would go in that direction.  It smells like rotting fish, but works like crazy.  I placed the second one over 100 feet away from our patio in the very back of the backyard.  It is concealed so nobody will have to look at it.  In one week, there must be several hundred flies already dead in the first trap.  I have been able to sit outside with sweetened beverages and no flies bothered my family.  Amazing!  First time that has happened in 10 years of summers here.  These traps appear to be decimating the fly population.  One huge change....when I opened the garbage can to put a bag of trash inside, there were no flies in the can.  That is a first!  If you can place these strategically away from outside living areas, most people will probably have a great result without having to be exposed to the disgusting smell of the activated traps.  I will be putting these traps out in the spring from here on.	1
Awesome product! Works great out here in the marshy country where flies are an issue. It smells terrible tho, so don't put in near a door or any place you're going to encounter it. I will buy these again and again.	1
Exactly as described. Terrible stench draws the flies and traps them. Will continue to purchase this product for outdoor use.	1
OMG, these smell awful but catch an unbelievable amount of flies!	1
I ordered both this and the Victor Magnet fly trap the same time but received the Victor one day earlier. It works great. This one doesn't come close to the Victor. This is disposable and the Victor one is reusable but they are both the same price. This one after more than 24 hours up has maybe a half dozen flies in it whereas the Victor has tons in it and the flies fly around it until they can get into it. This one just is very underwhelming. One note about the Victor VS this one is that the bait smells more and is stinky. Definitely use outdoors.  One note is that they are both hanging from the same hanger on my back patio and this one is about 2 feet lower, not is some different location.	-1
I read all the great reviews and wanted to give it a chance. Been using Black Flag fly traps and the big flies had been crawling back out of them. I have had one of these out in the sun for three days-same place where the above fly trap was. I have about 5 or 6 small dead flies in it. Either I no longer have any flies on my 14 acres or they just don't like the smell/lack of smell from it. I have also put out fly paper next to it. My fly paper catches about 10 small flies each day-with no flies buzzing around/landing on this trap. While I do like the entrance trap on this unit, it is not doing anything for me. I have ordered another different fly trap from Amazon and will give it a try. I'm glad some many other people are happy with it. Update-8/02/2016-After sitting in the sun for over a week, flies are swarming to it. Upgraded from 2 to 5 stars. This thing is really drawing the flies in..	1
work very well but they defininetly have an awful odor which is of course why they attract flies, very few to	1
The first week installed these I maybe saw a couple flies caught inside. After a couple weeks though you start to smell the odor coming from the traps that really stinks for about 10 yards of space. This smell apparently attracts flies really well because now there are tons of flies caught inside. So if you put it far enough away from your house so the smell doesn't affect you then this will definitely help you. Also you will need some type of strong string to hang these up. They don't come with any string which is kind of annoying. They are heavy once filled with water so it has to be strong but skinny enough to get through the tiny opening to hang it from.	1
Working great.	1
I read lots and lots of reviews about these bug traps, prior to purchasing.  So I wasn't surprised when they worked like a charm!  An outdoor June wedding in Maine? LOL. People thought I was crazy.  But our property was the only one around with no horse flies, deer flies, moose flies.....  call them what you want to. They were gone!!  He put them up around our two acre field, about a month ahead of time and it did the trick.  It caught a gazillion flies!  All our guests have begun buying them too.	1
attracted many flies	1
great items work great	1
Stinks to high Heaven but it works. LOTS and LOTS of flies. Definitely want to place it away from major human activity area.	1
I didn't know we had that many flies in the back yard!	1
Love this fly trap.  We have many around our garbage and we have a very small yard.  The flies that are around the garbage pail usually land in our home when we open the slider to go out.  I found by putting this away from the slider and near the garbage on a shepherds hook, it keeps them away from our doors.  Do not put where you plan on eating, after a few days of warm weather it will stink, I mean really what do you want, use common sense where you put them.  I think they are GREAT.	1
Stinks to high heaven and the fly's LOVE IT!	1
I didn't think it was working at first. But after a few days the bags are full of flies.	1
4 days after we hung up 4 of these traps, 2 were completely full of dead flies! We have a one-acre property with 2 dogs,2 cats, 4 chickens and 2 ducks. Plus we have a compost pile and fertilize the flowers and vegetables regularly. All things that flies love! We can't stand how many flies are everywhere and needed to do something about it for our health, sanity, and the health of our animals.  I ordered 4; hung one outside of the barn/chicken coop, one inside the barn away from the chicken coop, one next to the trash cans and one at the end of the pool fence, a few yards from the barn. The fence trap and the one outside the barn are completely full after 4 days! The others are almost full!  There are hardly any flies left in the coop and I'm ordering a bunch more ASAP! I'm going to hang them everywhere I see a fly!	1
Works for me.	1
Follow directions & it is a summer item we don't want to live without!  Ours fill up w/ dead flies w/I days!	1
Very effective	1
These traps work very well! We have 11 Cows and 2 Horses.  Neighbors have about the same.  Needless to say, they attract alot of flies. I place about 6 traps at a time along the fence line (to trap the ones coming over from the neighbors before they get to our herd), and a couple hanging from scattered trees a short distance from the shady areas where the Herd like to lie down. They do smell awful (which is what attracts the flies) so place them a safe distance from any areas you'll want to hang around.	1
These traps have trapped 100's of nasty flies for us and I will never go through a Southern summer without them.  Warning: Place far enough from where you drink/dine outside because they give off an odor.  But that's why the flies are attracted to 'em.	1
These traps are awesome, the best part NO pesticides and they work. We have a rabbit business and you know what happens with rabbits lots of manure and that makes for lots of flies. We use these under the rabbit cages and we use fly parasites as well. NO more flies for us, it works like it's supposed to and super easy to use!	1
Have one up all summer. Catches lots of flies! BUT it does stink. Hang it downwind from where you spend your time, and not too close to thr neighbor's Windows.	1
This WORKS! Flies love it, and it kills them quickly. We have horses all around us and a severe fly problem. These type of traps are the only things that work for us.	1
These are great for getting the flies, they can't get out of the bag.  The down side is the terrible order of the contents in the bag.  We had to move it about 20-25 ft. from the patio.	1
Ok so for whatever reason this summer biting flies have been swarming our dogs and family; I was at a loss. I tried making homemade traps with water bottles and filling with beer, wine, rotting fruit and everything else I read online. I found these at my local Home Depot and decided for ~$5 it was worth a try. Wow, this is amazing!! After only 4 days I have seen a dramatic improvement! Yeah maybe it doesn't smell like roses but this trap has caught hundreds of flies so far while my various home made traps have caught about 4 flies a piece. I did add some fly paper around the bag and it is covered also, much more so than the paper surrounding my homemade traps. I highly recommend this product!	1

I have a small flock of chickens that keep things around my yard interesting. Unfortunately there are certain times of the year when they tend to attract flies no matter how clean I keep their coop. These fly traps work great for attracting and catching flies. The reason they are getting four stars instead of five is because there are better traps out there. The Lowes by me sells a trap that costs a dollar more, but is much better quality. It has a nicer and better attached string to hang the trap by, a closing lid for when the trap is full, and the plastic it is made from is slightly thicker. Not a huge improvement, but still slightly better than these traps. If my Lowes ever quits stocking their traps or I am in a pinch, I would definitely still order and use these traps from Amazon.	1
Did the company change them, or is something wrong with mine?  They used to stink, but now they don't.  They used to work, but now they don't.  They are not the same.	-1
This is my second order of these.  Traps and kills flies on a mass genocide level.	1
Still waiting for that first fly after three weeks. Actually we caught ONE but he flew back out of the trap.	-1
Tried everything. These work the best! Smells like butt so keep it for away from living areas. Can fill these up in two weeks easily buy extras!	1
We use these at the farm and they are unbelievable.	1
These traps work very well and I buy them every "fly season'.  During the hottest times of the Summer though, be prepared to replace them about once a week.  Mine get filled up by then and honestly, it's pretty disgusting.  Do NOT put these near or upwind of anyplace you'll be spending time outdoors.  You don't want to see or smell this thing.  Flies flock to it, which is the whole point.  But they get trapped and drown.  After a week there is a layer several inches thick of dead, rotting flies.  Sometimes maggots too, as the eggs inside the flies hatch.  So, during the heat of the Summer it is not a pretty sight.  I've actually caught a few American carrion beetles (Necrophilia Americana) in this trap because of the smell of rotting flies.  I hang mine by my trash cans, hanging it on a post using butcher's twine, and replace them once a week.  To dispose of them, have a pair of scissors ready and come up beneath it with an opened gallon-size Ziploc bag.  Zip seal the bag and kind of push the yellow top down, and cut the string with the scissors.  I've never spilled the awful contents doing it that way.	1
The absolute best fly catcher out there!	1
It's June in the N.E. and this trap is hanging from a fifty year-old rhododendron about twenty-five feet from the back porch.  It's crawling with filthy, disease-ridden, desperate flies & maggots on death row.  Every time I walk past it, I hold my breath and look the other way. It's UGLY.  Once in awhile, the wind will blow the putrid stench the wrong way. I want to retch.  But still, how I LOVE this fly trap!.  It WORKS. Better than anything else on the market.  I've tried them all but this is the one I buy year after year.  Die Flies Die!	1
I just reordered these. I hang them outside of the goat barn where there have been a stifling amount of flies this year. The trap bait is smelly but they draw and kill tons of flies. When it dries out and is full toss them away and hang some more. They are easy to use. You just snip off the plastic along the dotted lines on the top. Pull up the center post and hang them with some wire or whatever you prefer. Then you fill to the marked line with warm water to active the bait inside. That's all you do and within an hour when the bait is active you begin catching flies. lots of flies.	1
kills generations of flies	1
I installed the trap next to where most of the flies are, instead of far from the house because of its odor (which is significant), and it is filling with flies rapidly. Because we are surrounded by neighbors with dogs, I decided to do something to make it more habitable around here. As observed by other reviewers, it may be attracting flies from next door as well. Which is OK, because now I can make a sport of it by going out with my fly swatter and having a lot of targets to hit!  I expect that I will be able to make a big dent in this generation of flies, hopefully resulting in far fewer flies in the next generation. These flies are small and pesky, and follow us into the house to become a nuisance. But they are fairly stupid and are not hard to kill.	1
Great product	1
It didn't work right away but in a day or two there were a ton of flies in there. I put one inside and one outside at my shop, but I ended up having to move them both outside because everyone was complaining about the smell. It didn't bother me too much but they do stink. (which is expected). They definitely work! Its on the second week and still catching flies daily.	1
Just do not hang it to close to your sitting area	1
Does a good job with catching and containing flies. The only thing is be warned that it does cause a smell. So if you don't want to smell it put it somewhere that it will still catch the flies but far enough away that you don't smell it.	1
These do work.  The older model worked better.  I still have the flies, but not as many.	1
I would have given this 5 stars if my yard was bigger and I could get it further from the house. When you fill it with water let the stink begin. It smells like a dead possum is in your yard. That said, I'm guessing in the 3 weeks it has been up, there are over 300 dead flies in it. We still have a few flies in the yard, with three large dogs that can be expected, but the flies are way down from where we were before this went up. My suggestion, hang it where the sun can hit it. That really helped attract the flies.	1
Bought these for a family member who had a problem with flies near her patio. She states this product really works and has made a huge difference! There's a bit of a smell so don't place it next to an open/screened window or door. She's able to sit out on her patio again!	1
So I got two of these from Home Depot and placed them at the farthest corners of my backyard.  Day 1, 1 or two flies.  Day 2, more flies.  A week later, an almost full bag of flies.  Great right?  Well first of all these things smell, like decomposed bodies, so if you place them anywhere closer than 50 feet away you will smell them.  Secondly, I started noticing more flies on my patio door at night.  That ain't right, those traps are trapping all the flies, how could I be seeing more flies on my patio door, especially at night?  What I think is happening is that (as many have said already), these things attrack flies from your entire neighborhood, and they also breed more flies.  The big flies can't escape but the baby flies can, therefore increasing the overall population of flies in YOUR backyard.	-1
works great and not as stinky as some	1
These fly traps are the best, they work SO well - almost too well, they get gross fast because they fill up really fast.  Be sure to put it in an area where you are not likely to be down wind of it because it stinks like decomp in a very short time.  That being said, if you live in the country like we do (near a cow pasture) nothing keeps flies out of your house like these bags.  I wish they were a bit more affordably priced or sold in bulk packages because we go through them pretty quickly.  Ours fill up in about 2 weeks.	1
Lots of various type flies caught in these...	1
This works the best. I have to get a new on almost every 5 days the bag gets soooo full of flies!!! Like thousands its gross but it works super well	1
These work as advertised.  Flies check in, don't check out.  Do not place them within 150 feet of anyplace you intend to spend time.  As noted, these get quite odoriferous, which helps attract more winged visitors.  However, if you've got a lot of flies, these will lessen the population, but not decimate it.	1
Works well but attracts more. Turned my minor fly problem into a nightmare lol. Would work well moving your fly problem to a different location I'd imagine. But wouldn't recommend for a minor fly problem.	1
Kills flys dead.  Makes me so happy.	1
I have one in my chicken coop and one by the back  door. These traps work great,  but oh boy, do they stink -- the one in the coop is not so bad because it's not in the sun, but I'm moving the one by the back door! My mistake! Instead of carrying in the summer scents of cut grass and flowers, the breeze brings tones of rotting corpse through the back door, ha-ha. On the other hand, we have no flies in the house now, so for sure, they work beautifully, and they are large capacity and can hold a lot of disgusting flies.	1
They work great and catch a lot of flies. However, make sure you don't keep it too long before it becomes extremely stinky.	1
These fly traps are the best option if you are looking for a disposable fly trap. I used these last year by my chicken coop to control flys and the whols bag filled up by the end of a month. There is a mild odor that it has after about 2 weeks but it still continues to work. If it is not near a sitting area it is best. I should have taken a photo last year. I will update with a photo when these new ones fill up!!!  The price on Amazon is half of the major retailers that sell these.	1
Freaking awesome!! I had "cluster flies" invade my home,  HUGE black flies in all my windows. I turned this on yesterday, 24 hours later its FULL of fees flies, i should of ordered replacement sticky pads at the same time.. they will be here Tuesday.  This thing works great,  and is a great nightlight	1
This kill flys outdoors very well. But they do smell. And they look awful. So hide it away and it'll keep the flys away.	1
This product ATTRACTS flies but FAILS TO TRAP larger flies. No wonder some users complained they have more flies instead of fewer they are attracting flies but not trapping them! I'm very disappointed in Rescue's false claims, especially since I bought multiple Rescue products.  I read all the descriptions of products intended for flies, and this "Rescue" product claims it traps house flies among other kinds of flies. It sounded like the perfect solution. But the tiny holes in the trap are TOO SMALL to allow house flies to enter and be trappedl I'd be surprised if anything larger than fruit flies can get in but I don't have fruit flies or other small flies. I have big, annoying house flies. NOT RECOMMENDED.	-1
Kind of pricey and the are cheaper at other large retail stores. I ordered online for convenience and to avoid large shopper crowds. This trap smells horrible, I mean really disgusting but is the Best at catching yard flys! Just hide before company!	1
great!!!	1
Had two hanging up for over a week with no real results, but then they started working wonderfully. Traps smell terrible, but the flies sure seem to like it. Hasn't seemed to make a difference on the amount of flies around, but they are catching tons.	1
Best trap ever. Been buying these for years. Has a faint spoiled smell so only use outside, but it will eliminate your fly problem within a day or two. I live close to a river, and have animals, so flys can get crazy and end up inside as well. I put one of these about 20 feet from my door, and no flys. The bait works so well that they only go for the trap, even with food, animal feces, etc in the area. I just replace once filled with flys, which is usually 2 traps the first week of hot weather, then one left out the rest of Summer to catch any lingerers.	1
Purchase these during the summer months to hang on a tree by the trash cans. Cut the dotted line, pull the plastic funnel through and hang. Pretty simple and within weeks this was fat with flies. There is a small odor so keep it downwind or about 5-10 feet away from your general social areas.	1
Concept wise, this works great.  Unfortunately, it has attracted and became full of different kind of flies which I don't know from where they came from, the green colored flies. The real normal flies that bothered me showed no much interest, just few. The smell was bad after couple of days, but not that bad that's the whole idea behind it.  I'll give it 5 stars for the concept but 3 for the impact, so it's 4	1
These are amazing! Our home uses secondary water for the sprinkler system. This means more than average flies in our backyard. Bought one of these and literally had to have caught over 1000 flies in one summer. Definitely a recurring buy and much more pleasant than thebug zappers that require constant power	1
I don't know what percentage of the fly population is reduced, but these things sure catch an enormous amount of flies!  I do notice that there are fewer flies in the barn too.  Indeed, it is probably unavoidable that you will get a whiff of nasty smell if the wind is just right, but as long as you don't hang them downwind of the prevailing wind or just outside a window you have open, you'll be fine. Good value and easy to hang and dispose of.	1
I didn't know we had so many flies until I used this trap. Reduced considerably the flies in my porch.	1
We have a horse farm with chickens. We've been using these for years along with fly predators. These bags are full of flies by mid season. These bags will not attract horseflies or bees. I swat the horseflies by hand and Maude my draft then smashes them with her hoof (1850 lbs/4). All our horse friends are amazed by our lack of flies.	1
They do the job, well.  It stinks, but how else to attract flies then with a stinky treat....	1
A+++++	1
these work great	1
Best fly trapper out there.  bag is always full (I have chickens which tend to mean I have a lot of flies from all the poop).  This works great!	1
Smells to high heaven so it works like a charm.  Follow the directions as to placement so you don't accidently get a wiff of the fly bait that is included.  It will knock your socks off.  I would give it 5 stars but the whole trap has to be thrown away when full and the only thing biodegradable is the dead flies. In the Spring I will see if they offer a reusable trap.  Much better for Mother Earth.	1
Here is the 100% no BS review of this product.  This thing catches 100% of the flies it attracts.  Granted they don't go in within the first second of smelling this product, it might take a little while but they definitely go in this thing.  Quality wise I would say its built really good.  After adding the recommended amount of water it take a day or so to really make the stench of a rotting body.  Now the ugly!  Your neighbors will love you for buying this product, because it attracts all the flies in the neighborhood.  Seriously ALL THE FLIES.  Here is a rundown of how this product works. Day1- No smell yet Day2- Nice stench of a rotting body begins Day3- Flies start to show up and get caught inside Day4-7- More flys show up and get caught Day8-30- Now the real fun begins.  By this time all the flies within the surrounding area know where you live, and are inviting all of their cousins to come over.  At this time the dead decaying flies make Maggots in the bag.  Next thing you know their is a butt load of tiny flies and big flies swarming around this trap.  I will never buy this trap again. I ended up buying a Bug-A-Salt and love it.  Kills flies plus you get to have the fun of shooting them.	-1
Did it catch flies...absolutely. after a week there was a layer of dead flies 4" thick, easily a 1,000 flies.  Did it make a difference in the number of flies around the deck....didn't seem to!  I put it 30 feet from the deck and there were swarms of flies around all the time.	1
Works, aromatic! Heavy to hang, appears to work well after two days.	1
Best outdoor fly traps I've used. Can't believe the amount of flyers they catch	1
Waiting for fly season....	1
These will definitely catch a lot of fly's but make sure you put it down wind. What a stink on a hot day.	1
These work great. They do stink, especially after a month. Then you toss em. They catch a ton of flies tho. I have horses chickens, cats, dogs.	1
They work.  They stink in about a 12 foot radius, so don't put them too close to the front door and you will be fine	1
Wow this bag traps flies like crazy. It's like a fly magnet. Make sure to hang it away from where you lounge because it really really stinks.	1
These are by far the best fly traps I have ever used. They last for around 3 weeks. They stink HORRIBLE but that is what makes them so effective! I make sure to hang them away from the house and in a spot that gets quite a bit of sun, the hotter the bag... the stinker they get and the better they work!	1
Works great! But after a few days smells pretty bad like dead fish...but work!!!!	1
These are good one time use items.  I know some people say you can refill and re-use them, but I never figured it out.  They definitely killed a ton of flies.	1
Catches a lot of flies but after about a week it begins to smell. Great product.	1
Caught this many flies in 2 days! I hung them above my trash cans and they worked like a charm.	1
I used several types of traps and this one was the very best, lasted for about 7 weeks. Nearly filled with flies. Fantastic.	1
expect it to be full in a week it works that well	1
Works really well.	1
maybe not meant for homeowner use.  I hung outside garage in side alley yard near trashcans.  within a few hours I go check and it is like a horror movie.  flies covering the ground, wall, house, cans etc none in the trap.  I gave it time but still none went in trap it was horrible horrible.  maybe it works in open fields or stables better, but this was insane.  attracted way way more flies than I was trying to get rid of in first place.  took weeks to get smell and flies gone after I disposed of it after a couple of days.	-1
They work great but after 2 weeks they stink worse than the animals!	1
These really collect flies. We have a ton of flies and they really helped to cut down the population. Make sure you hang away from seating ares as they attract flies and as the collect they smell a bit.	1
Wow-these little bags are fantastic. Just add water, hang, and watch the flies disappear.	1
not effective	-1
Smells so bad that you cannot be near it.  I threw it the garbage can and after washing the trash can down 3 times so far, I cannot get rid of the smell.	-1
This product works and I love the simplicity of setting it up. I have an electronic zapper in my work shop with fly paper hanging from the zapper. This product does 10x the fly control than the paper and zapper.	1
super price.  This is the absolute BEST fly trap and doesn't take up much room in the trash when I thrown them away.  HOLD YOUR NOST WHEN THEY'RE FILLED!	1
Working well, seems to be good, we'll see what happens in the future	1
I put two of these up by my chicken coop. Finally hung one inside of the coop. After being up about 18 days the only thing we noticed a difference in was the smell. There were not 25 flies in each trap. There were ALOT of flies, but none in the traps. Waste of money. Not sure why such good reviews. I have flies and chickens, but these did nothing to reduce the flies. It was more like some feel in accidently.	-1
Be careful: the bag is the product.  The smell is horrible and attracts but doesn't kill flies as advertised.	-1
I purchased two of these fly traps.  We live out in the country and there are lots of flies around.  I hung one in the shade by the dog pen, under a large tree, and the other in the sun by the pool.  Both were filled with water as directed.  We have our own well so the fill water was non-chlorinated, as suggested by other reviewers.  It takes a few days for these traps to develop their full flagrance.  The odor isn't enough to make you retch and vomit; but you definitely want to hang them a good distance away from where you intend to spend any time.  Those with weaker stomachs or sensitive noses may want to avoid these traps entirely.  After 3 days the trap in the shade was catching lots of flies; but the trap in the sun wasn't catching anything.  So I moved the second trap a few feet so it would also be in the shade.  That worked because now both traps are catching hundreds of flies.  The bodies of the dead flies seem to be decomposing and adding to the bait, thereby attracting more flies.  It's a self-sustaining system, limited only by the capacity of the bag.  I guess flies aren't picky when it comes to cannibalism.  Inside the bag is a fascinating and disgusting putrefied mess of rotting flies.  It's hard to look inside the bag but at the same time it is equally hard not to look.  It takes the flies a while to die and sink so there is always 10-20 live flies buzzing around inside the bag.  I also noticed that the water level doesn't seem to rise as the bag fills with flies.  Maybe evaporation compensates for the volume of dead fly carcasses.  There are another 5-10 flies always queued up on the outside trying to get in.  Since hanging these outside we've noticed far fewer flies hanging around the pool and the dog pen.  Also, the flies aren't getting in our house.  I will definitely be buying these again.	1
I get a ton of flies in my yard every spring. At the beginning of each spring season, I hang a couple of these in my yard for a few weeks. I can't believe how quickly they fill up with flies - thousands and thousands of flies. I take them down after a few weeks, throw them away, and only see a few flies the rest of the spring and summer. The mixture inside of these does smell like a dead body, so I wouldn't hang them near any areas where people will be hanging out.	1
I was pleasantly surprised by how effectively these traps cut down on the fly problem in my horse barn. We had a wet spring/early summer and the flies were out of control in the barn. The horses were stomping in their stalls all day and the flies were even biting me as I did chores. No more! First I put one trap out in a shaded area a little ways away from the barn that had worked well last year, but the flies weren't interested so I moved it right into the barn aisle. Now it is filling up with flies and the horses and I are much less irritated. It took 2-3 days for them to first start going inside though. So, if this doesn't work for you at first, try some different locations and give each a few days. It does smell a little gross but there's enough ventilation in the barn that it doesn't really bother me unless I go right up to it and inhale. I hung it at the far end so I don't have to see/smell it as much. GREAT product!	1
This is a GREAT product!  Since we've had recent, heavy rain, the flies have been terrible.  We hung this in the back yard, and shortly thereafter, flies were in the trap.  In a matter of days, the trap has filled up.  Neighbors have even noticed the reduction of flies around their homes.  I like the fact that it's disposable, too.  I've used a fly trap before, but with little success.  I'm amazed this product works so well.  I highly recommend this fly trap!  Update:  We've followed the directions and replaced this with a new one each month.  We rarely see any flies.  This is truly a great product that is so easy to use.	1
Great idea	1
This thing does smell bad so place it away from doors or where people congregate.  It works great!  On warm days it kills lots of flies and will reduce the number of flies in your home dramatically.  If you have a dog you need this trap.  I am amazed.	1
This product does what it says.  We hang one a them a bit of a distance from our front and back porch and the flies stay away from the porches.  You don't want to hang them too close to where you are sitting, barbecuing, playing, etc.  Because as they fill they will be long on smell.	1
This trap is awesome, put it up in the dog run and the flies could not wait to call it home. It is a bit stinky and the flies swarm around it, just hang it away from the house and watch the magic happen.	1
These traps are the bomb!  I can grill outdoors without being inundated with flies now!  For that matter, I can just enjoy being in my pool without being swarmed by flies all the time. My hubby found these on Amazon and from the first one we've used, our fly population has declined significantly... no, make that drastically!  Virtually no more flies around our yard area.  I think the word has gotten out not to come to our place because you go into the fly condo and never come out.  Heck, we see them lining up on the outside just to get in, only to find out once they are in, it's like Hotel California...  they check in, but they can never leave!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!	1
Live in the country these are a must unless you enjoy swatting	1
Easily a no brainier for flies! I have yet another up now. There are cows across the way. Hence many flies here. Yes this absolutely works! Yes, you need to place it where the wind does not blow the scent towards where you sit because there are tons of carcasses in it and it stinks like rotted fish. That being said, there are virtually NO FLIES by us!!	1
Easy to use.  Smells horrible, so the flies LOVE IT.  Kills hundreds of them.	1
Works great. Very smelly but they really attract and catch the flies and gnats.	1
We have an epidemic of flies here on the property this year. These traps work very well. They may take a few days to "ripen" to produce enough odor to work ideally, but once they do they will trap thousands if flies each. I intend to buy more. The only downside is you have to find a way to suspend them.	1
This fly trap is one of the best we have found so far. Our issue is that we have a chicken coop and we also are surrounded by neighbors with horses. Controlling the flies can be really hard. One thing that helps is these disposable fly traps. Just open then, add water to the line and hang. They do have a bit of an odor so I wouldn't put them in the house or close to the house. I put this right in the chicken coop shed though hanging. The birds can't reach it and it fills with flies over the hot months. Easy to trash and replace though we only need them in the summer months here in Georgia. Using this kind of fly trap makes such a difference! For an average size yard I don't think you need more than one. Be sure to keep it up out of reach of pets!	1
Works very well.  I had a lot flies all over this thing about 30 minutes after I set it up by my garbage can outside.  It's pretty amazing...it attracts all types of flies for me...horse flies, regular flies, etc.  it is very smelly.  It's behind my house by the garbage cans & I can smell it sometimes when I walk out my back door.  Overall,  very satisfied.	1
works super	1
It has reduced our fly population immensely! I replaced it after one week because there was a good 1-2 inches of dead flies in the trap. It's easy to set up and easy to dispose of. It really does stink after a few days, so don't put it near living spaces.	1
Extremely please.  A small odor at times- nothing real bothersome. Able to be in back yard again. Collected hundreds of flies - including mayflies and horseflies. Bought two more bags and replaced as the bag became soooo full. Highly recommend!	1
They work every well. I feed outside cats, so these help so much. By the end of the season we change the bag like 5 times. Received my order before the date stated!	1
No way!! Absolutely disgusting! I picked up one of these traps at Home Depot, set it up according to the instructions and set it outside the back door. The whole area quickly smelled like rotten fish! I honestly think the powdered bait in this trap is fish meal (the same kind used for fertilizer). My wife begged me to throw this thing away less than 12 hours after I set it up. This thing reeks!! It's really awful. There much better ways to attract and kill insects than setting out a bag of rotten fish guts to stink up your patio.	-1
Unbelievably effective!! These traps catch literally thousands of flys within a couple of weeks, thus making our deck nicer to use.  If you have dogs you've got to get these fly traps.....no exaggeration as to effectiveness!!	1
These stink, but they work!	1
ok	1
It is the best fly trap I have found. Effective and not messy.	1
perfect	1
As soon as I received these, I hung one inside my chicken coop where the flies are.  As of today which is the fourth day, not one fly went in the trap even tho it really stinks to high heavens.  Just wasted my money on this non working trap.	-1
It is hard to believe that an electric chainsaw can cut as fast as a gas chainsaw, but this chainsaw does just that.  I have to use a gas chainsaw to ruff cut the logs when I am away from the house but I use an electric chainsaw when I am near home to cut the logs into stove sized pieces, so I don't have to be bothered with the fumes and noise of a gas chainsaw.  I had been using a McCulloch 3.5hp electric chainsaw and it stopped cutting because a plastic drive gear stripped out.  When I contacted Makita, I wanted to know if their chainsaw had any plastic gears in it, they assured me that it was all metal gears and ball bearings through out.  The Makita is supposed to be the same horse power as the McCulloch that I had, but it cuts much faster.  I have gone through two McCulloch chainsaws over the years.  One with a bad commutator  and the other with a bad gear.  After using the Makita, I wish I had bought the Makita first.	1
I fugured an electric chain saw would not have enough torque to do "manly" work so I didn't even consider this tool--but to be sure I rented one from Home Depot for 4 hours yesterday... WOW-- as an alumni user of several gas-powered chain saws--I'm hooked... I just ordered one after that 4-hour experience of taking down 17 trees from 6" to 15" in diameter and turning them all into firewood...  my gas powered saws are goign in the next garage sale! Keith Drury	1
I was really excited to find this product and read the good reviews. I placed these near the doors of my chicken coop expecting the flies to be attracted to it but no such luck! I have had them hanging for two weeks now and there is one fly in each bag. I even changed the height of the bags to see if that made a difference and it didn't. Truthfully, the vanilla scented car fresheners work way better than these do. Sorry to say!	-1
I posted a 1 star review after 4 days of disappointment.  Well.... after 2 weeks the bag has killed well over 300 flies!  Nope... I am not kidding.  But, we still have problems with some flies on our back porch.  Smells really bad, so you need to make sure you hang it at least 15-20 yards away from where you are.	1
The good: They catch flies. We live on a farm so flies are a constant issue. I hung these up by our compost pile and they have collected a large amount of flies already. The amount of flies near our house are noticeably less.  The negatives: They smell. Like a disgusting, rotting dead smell. They do not come with a string or hook to hang them from. I had a string slip off when I was moving it, and getting the string back in with the bag open wasn't easy.	1
After burning out several "big box store" electric saws, I finally decided to spend the money for the Makita.  WOW - what a difference.  The in-line motor makes it much easier to cut close to the ground.  I've used this saw to buck limbs for a solid eight hours with no problems.  The oiler works well and does not leak when the saw is in storage.  After using one at my cabin for a few weeks, I've bought a second one for home.  In summary - it's smoother, quieter, more powerful, and obviously more durable than other "cheaper" electric saws.  Recommend with no reservations.	1
I felt the ease of maintaining the electric would make up for the lack of raw cutting power.  After all, I don't cut trees and logs for a living.  A freind and I tested this thing on a 20' diameter juniper.  We figured we'd play with the electric for a while and then haul out the husqvarna.  The makita electric did the whole tree with no problem.  All the way from felling to making fire pit sized logs.  The gas saw might have been faster, but this one cut fast enough to keep two other guys busy hauling wood.  Perfect.  No gas or fouled plugs or other joys of a gas saw.  Enough power to take down the occasional tree.	1
STINKS! They need to include that. But works	1
Does the job!  They all go here!	1
good	1
work great! And I am not having to empty/touch anything to throw it away!	1
I have used this saw for a couple of weeks now and very pleased with it.  Suffered with a Sears (admittedy $89.00)for several years and when it died I bought this one. Unless you have huge trees to work on or don't have access to electricity I see no reason to own a gas chainsaw. I could never keep the things running. The Makita should get me through many years of firewood.	1

prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.	1
Item as described	1
This is by far the best thing I have found to get rid of bugs!! We have a small backyard and 3 dogs. The first day I put it out there it was full in hours!	1
works great	1
These work well. We live next to a park where a lot of dog owners bring their dogs. This product helps to keep the flies out of our garage where we sit. Only unpleasant issue is the disposal. I put the used container in a zip-lock bag to dispose of it.	1
This stuff kills flies better than anything, but boy does it stink.  You really cannot have this near a dwelling.	1
Fills up with flies quickly, keeps them under control around the chicken coup.	1
I don't know if it's the climate, but these aren't working too well. On sunny days, the flies like to zoom by and they don't even slow down for the trap. On rainy days, there aren't too many flies around anyway. I've had the traps hanging outside for over a week now and I have only caught a couple of flies per trap. We have tons of flies around here because we live near horses and cattle. I put the traps in areas that I regularly see flies swarming. Maybe as the weather gets warmer, we'll see more flies floating around in the trap? I've used these before, and they used to work very well so I am guessing that they changed the formula for the attractant. Either that, or the flies around here are becoming too clever.  ***A few weeks later*** The weather has been drier and brighter, and the traps have been given time to marinate in the sun. The smell coming from the traps is an unholy stench. There are several flies buzzing around in the traps, and there are also a few dead bodies floating around in the liquid. I am still convinced that the formula is different because these traps have not caught nearly as many flies as the ones I bought in the past. There are less flies inside the traps than the amount printed on the outside of the bag. They're all swarming around the traps, but not going inside. I think the flies are too smart--- or maybe too stupid to go inside.  ***A few months later*** It's been very hot and dry, and the smell coming from the trap is just disgusting. There are tons of dead flies inside. I think it's time to buy new traps. These traps work the best after marinating in the sun for a while. They work best in warm, dry weather. I am raising the rating a star because it works, but it took a while.	1
Works As Advertised..	1
These are so easy to use.  Cut around the top on the dotted line, pull up on the little yellow hanger, attach string, fill with water to line, hang up. Just be careful and don't spill or tear container. Boy does it stink. After it is full of flies, push to down and throw in trash. So easy.  I have used them for over 9 years. They work really well. You just don't want to put them upwind from you. I have a shepherds hook I hang mine on.	1
These fly traps work wonders. During peak fly season, we can fill one of these up in a week. They do have somewhat of a foul odor so keep them at at distance from where people are going to be.	1
works great	1
Last spring and fall we had an INDOOR fly problem. It was seriously annoying. It wasn't unusual for every window to have anywhere from 1 to 5 dead flies a day!  I was reall at my wits end. Orkin was useless and the internet was filled with ideas from buying pheremones that kill them, etc.  I Bought one of these bags this spring and put it out on the deck about 15 ft from the back door.  I don't even know how to explain the feeling of looking in a window sill and expecting to find at least one fly and seeing nothing. NOTHING!  The bag is hopping with flies and I am hopping with joy!  I live in the country so maybe it's not unusual to have this kind of activity but I will continue to keep these on hand for the price and what they do - it's just indespensible.	1
My girlfriend moved in and brought her two dogs with her.  I've never noticed many flies around my house until then.  She cleans up after them maybe once a week, but in the meantime, the poo really attracts lots of flies.  I've worked at a few camps that have used these traps so I decided to go with what the pros use.  I'm very pleased.  After two weeks there has been a dramatic reduction in the flies I see around the yard.  The trap, however, is jam packed!  It's like a fly party in there.  Yes, it does stink a bit, but not too bad.  I have a small back yard (maybe 20x30 feet) and I put it in the far corner.  Don't really notice the smell unless I walk back there.	1
Flies were in 30 minutes after putting it up and they keep coming. WOW this really works. I am in AZ and does not seem a problem the flies until you try to eat outside in the spring. But this will work for you!!!!	1
Good product. Does what it says it will do. Puts off a terrible odor. Must be to attract flies.	1
Excellent product; although, smells bad so put far away from people.	1
Mid summer in Vermont brings out flies that my Mother-in-law calls dive bombers which inflict vicious bites. We tried lots of thing to get rid of them but nothing worked. I had seen other items like this but friends advised against them because they smelled pretty bad. It came time to make a decision between the misery the flies inflicted on my Mother-in-law or a bad smell on part of our property. We chose getting rid of the flies. Much to our pleasure the flies were gone in about two weeks (never to come back), and the smell was not offensive at all. A word of warning, hang them fairly high  because the bears love them. We love them and are getting an order ready for this season.	1
I use 3-4 of these every summer. They last long so for us just 3-4 bags gets us through spring, summer and fall. We have a neighbor with 5-6 horses so you can imagine the fly problem they bring. Fill the bag with water and hang it somewhere you see them around and in 2-3 days it will start to attract any fly that goes near it. It's quite disgusting to see that bag fill up but it works and really reduces the chance of fly's getting into the house.	1
This will be the 4th year I've used this trap. On a good day you might see around 100 flies buzzing around inside the trap. Eventually they tire and fall into the stinky soup and drown.  Make sure you hang this far from where you breath. It uses a horrible odor to attract flies. As hundreds of flies rot, the odor gets unbearably worse. Sometimes the odor is so bad I won't even go look at it. My neighbor complained about the odor, but since the flies were coming from their house I didn't take the traps down.	1
Wrote the date we hung it up. After one month to the day it was loaded to capacity with dead flies. Smells a bit.	1
these are awesome.  The first day it caught flies immediately.  I live in the city so it's not a farm but by the end of a month it caught hundreds of flies, maybe even a thousand.  I had not idea there were that many around here.  And can you imagine if they were out mating, ugh.  I will reorder a couple now so I can keep the population down earlier.	1
Trapped not even one fly...and we had tons of them.	-1
This trap was full after a couple of days, must have in the South.	1
Love these. Gets those pesty flies out in the horse corral. just wish they made larger ones	1
Caught a lot of flys.  I have it kinda close to the back door so you can smell it sometimes.  But doesn't bother me.  Its been hanging awhile and I still see new flies inside.  I have noticed there are way less flies in the house.	1
Works great inside outbuildings if they have ventilation.	1
My uncle used the outdoor disposable fly trap at his farm for many years. the rescue brand worked well .a competitor company makes the same type of fly trap but did not work.	1
I don't think this works very well  & the smell is rather aweful, , plus handling & hanging a  bag of fluid is not really great..	-1
works well, no fly's around with bag used.	1
bye bye flies	1
product works well	1
Bought these for the backyard. We have dogs and the number of flies sometimes is overwhelming in the summer. Put these up and they work. Will be using these for a long time to come.	1
best	1
These work immediately and entrap millions of flies!	1
These things are amazing.....work great. You won't believe how many flies will be in this thing after a few days.  Lasts for 6 weeks or more.	1
Works great in our chicken run	1
The bag had a hole in it and didn't hold water. Waste of money.	-1
The only one that works (outside only!).  When you discard this, make sure you do not spill it! It is smelly stuff.	1
Works well.  Place away from entrances as attracts flies before trapping them.  It also has an odor, but it really works and is my product of choice	1
The best fly trap out of all tried, it's stinks but it really really works	1
They smell terrible but it's like a train wreck.  It's terrible to look at but you can't look away.  It's disgusting, how many flies this baby catches but it's just so amazing!	1
Really works! But beware....after several days it can really stink. Just place it away from people and it's great!	1
Man do these traps attract flies !!! Just make sure to wear a hazmat suit so you don`t get any liquid on you and don`t even think of reusing .Hundreds of rotting carcasses will be in the bag very quickly and  stink to high heaven	1
These work great! Period! I keep these in stock at our house in the spring and summer. It catches hundreds of flies that might have otherwise gotten in the house. The best fly catching product, bar none. Just be sure you put it somewhere away from you door because it will start stinking after a while (That's when it really attracts the flies) and also because a lot of flies congregate around it.	1
These things are working very well for me.  So much so that I think its creating my house as a hangout!	1
Wow!  Bought it doubting this ... so much so that I puchased only one instead of the 2 pack to try it first. I am not kidding when I tell you that fly's were gathering on my hand, preparing their death chamber!  It is so effective.  I must have caught over 25+ over the course of two days.  I have noticed no fly's near my rear door of my house, one did get in (fly) but was quickly swatted.  I have noticed that fly population around my house is very in control and this thing is still catching them to this day (9/30/2014).  It does smell, but it is quick, a wiff and then its gone.  Place it away from the house and where there is good ventilation and it shouldn't be a problem.  The stink will increase as it collects dead fly's in the trap.  I am running this thing until the wheels fall off it is so effective.  In my case, I placed it hanging from my fuji apple tree where I noticed they gathered and man .. what a relief its been.  Very happy with it thus far.	1
Works great smells awful.  Just don't sit down wind of it.	1
Because of our 3 dogs, we hung this by the yard to minimize flies and it worked great. We wanted something safe and easy to use and it claims to not contain any poisons or insecticides so it was the perfect product.	1
This stuff works	1
Yes they do work.  Put outside where the neighbors trash cans sit.  A breeding ground for flies.  These caught quite a few flies - - but I did not notice any difference in the fly population.  Still quite a bit.	1
I have horses next to my property, lots of flies. These things work great	1
I put this trap out at county fairs - count the flies to get an award!	1

1. First and foremost: cut the hole very, very carefully! You definitely don't want it to be any larger than the dotted lines indicate.  2. Attach your hanger securely to the bag & hang it up BEFORE filling it with water. The filled bag can be very slippery and hard to carry.  3. Hang it far away from areas where people will be sitting, since the putrid smell is overpowering. We've had the best luck by hanging where it will get some sunshine.  4. Give the bag some time to work; it's taken anywhere from a day, to over a week, for it to accumulate flies for us, depending on the time of year and the temperature.  5. Be careful when taking the bag down, too; I like to tie a garbage bag around the trap securely, before removing the hanger, to avoid spills.  The awkwardness of cutting the hole, as well as the lack of hanging hardware is why I would've given it only three stars, but they really, really work, so I'm giving it 4 stars.	1

Amazing results. Works like no other.	1
stinks like death itself.....but works great.....takes a couple of days for it to reach full effect!	1
It fell and broke.  My chickens ate the inside stuffy.  Luckily, the ingredients only attract flies and aren't poisonous to chickens/dogs.  It's suppose to be equivalent to eating hot peppers.  What a scare!  I now use vanilla pine trees meant for a car.  They keep the flies away and I don't have to mess with dead flies.	-1
They are gross, but that's because they work!  We live on the edge of town near farms so the flies in the summer are out of control in our area.  Place one of these away from the house where they remain down wind and they fill up very quickly.  Changing them out stinks (literally nasty) but they do the job!	1
These work but they are a bit nasty.  I probably collected 1000 flies in each bag over a 1 week period.  I was starting to think it may actually have attracted flies, it's doesn't smell to bad but what ever bait they use smells like rotting seafood and it seriously has the flies going crazy.  A little nasty to handle and dispose of, but it does work.	1
This product is amazing. It smells really, really bad when you get a whiff of it, but it is worth it. The smelly stuff attracts the flies that get in and can't get out.  There is no poison -- they just drown. Our bag was literally full of deal flies in about three weeks. Thousands of dead flies. It was fascinating to watch. The best part is that there were virtually no flies in the house (maybe one) since we put this up outside.	1
Wow. This works at least for me. It was out in the yard for less than two days when it was almost filled with dead flies. Although my sense of smell isn't what it used to be, I didn't have any problems with the smell others had noticed but it's hanging in the back of my yard in an area that gets a lot of wind.	1
This really does it's job.  The smell of it isn't at all good for humans so try to hang it where it's not near outside doorways or windows that open into your house.  ANYTHING is better than a housefull of flies!	1
I had a definite problem in the courtyard when a dead bird or squirrel was dragged into the area. The next thing I knew there were hundreds of flies with some getting inside the house. On Saturday I hung one of these bags in the immediate area where the dead animal had been and within a few days the bags contained hundreds of dead flies. It does attract and retain the flies however you must be willing to put up with the smell. The chemicals put off a distinct smell and then the dead files make the smell a hundreds times worse. The bag is so full I could not even guess at the number of flies it contains. I plan on leaving it for a couple of days longer and then wrap in a plastic bag and dispose of it. I will hang a new replacement bag in the area to see if I have any remaining flies that can be caught. The unit is easy to hang. Just carefully cut the center hole out and raise the piece of plastic to the top where you can attach a sting or wire. Then fill the bag with water to the marked line. That is it and you definitely will have a "killer' on your hands.	1
Arrived quickly. What else to say? If your looking for these, 'cuz they DO work..... These are them.	1
Works great and catches 100's of flies - but it stinks - try to keep it away from the house and downwind. My neighbors have even complained of the smell at times - that's when I usually replace it.	1
These are unbelievable.  My son has an Organic dairy farm in New York.  We have a small country summer home within a mile of his farm.  This is the second year that we have taken some of his young calves and pastured them at our home on 5 acres.  I thought I would try these fly catchers.  I have four out there now.    Always cut the hole precisely as you could ruin the trap if you mess up.  Then put small string threw top and attach to whatever you are planning to hang them on.  Then Put the water in to the line on package.  and just wait - within 48 hours , 3 days max - these things start to work.  I put a new one out last week and threw  the old one out (double bag it and tie the top - stinky and wear gloves -  Anyway, the new one in less than 7 days is over half full.  They must hold about 5,000 flies at least.  -  TRY THESE, YOU WILL BE HAPPY.  Do not put them on your deck, or near the neighbors fence line, or near your home, they need to be at least 40 ft. from where you walk. I also bought the permanent one this past week, $8.00+ and they are very small, this is not going to work for us, but I will continue to buy the 2 pack disposable - very satisfied.	1
No matter where you hang these the flies will definitely find them.  Buy extra because they fill up fast.  The product is great to work with.  Easy to open, easy to put water in, easy to close when the fly trap is filled.  I have them in my barn since they will not harm the critters.  I buy them every year and will continue to do so.  I used to buy them from "-------" store, but AMAZON price is great, delivery fast and I don't use gas.  jawjab	1
This works. Under fill the bag to allow for rain. It will gradually smell worse as time progresses. Will catch tons of stuff and is a mess to dispose of.	1
I have been using these at spots where I leave food for feral cats. The trap is full of flies and there are no flies on the cat food!  Some chemist deserves an award because these things smell just like a latrine or outhouse. The flies must think that they have found paradise!  I attached some to a friend's home and they really stinked up the inside of the house.  Some finesse is required to set up a trap. You need to cut out a precise circle in the top plastic bag. I start it with an X-Acto knife and then finish with small scissors. Then you extend the inner yellow plastic thing. The only way to attach it is through a small hole in the top of the plastic thing. You can make a loop with string and staple the loop to wood or use a cable tie.  Attach the trap to its final position before adding water. That's when the stench begins. Because of the top disk, adding water can be difficult. I use a plastic watering can with a long neck with a 1/4 inch outlet. This is perfect for the job. If you use something else, you are going to spill some of the water. This is no big deal because it is just water. On the other hand, if you spill the contents of a used trap on your clothes, you are going to have a bad day.  I am using them in the hottest part of the summer. I visit the traps every week or two to add water. (You could probably get away with less than that.)  The small size has been fine for me. If you need the large size, maybe you should move.	1
i had flies in the house, it seemed like they were waiting by the front door to let them in. i thought i would be smart and buy this product. i set it by the counter and left the house to run errands. came back in about an hour, the whole downstairs reeked of sh#@.  i immediately tossed in garage. later, same effect for the garage. the product is kinda pointless cause any place you put this you won't want to be anywhere near. the smell is worse than the flies by far.	-1
Best fly trap on the market - smelly but works like a charm!!!	1
Works well but really has an attractant odor	1
Very Happy.....!!!	1
They stink to high heaven, but they work. Make sure you can locate these a good distance from your house unless you enjoy walking out in your yard and smelling the stench of death warmed over. They do catch a lot of flies though, and would be perfect near a barn where flies like to congregate.	1
It has been several years since I used these fly traps and have forgotten just how effective they are.  In the past I used them because I had (dog) show kennels and summer flies were a major nuisance.  Now, I just want to keep the flies away from my back door. The old traps used to have a small capsule inside that had to be crushed to release the "stuff"- the attractant.  This dissolving pack  is really nice!  I have NO desire for a reusable trap, that needs to be emptied -no thanks!  I put the trap out about half an hour ago and it has already attracted flies!! Good DEAL!!!	1
Just can't praise this product enough. Make sure you put away from your patio or porch. Fills up with those nays flies & you just throw away!  Wonderful!	1
This is the best thing ...We are amazed.  Our porch ceiling and picnic area used to be covered with flies because of the Horse corrals very near. This is hung out between our patio area and the fence.  We cannot believe it....No flies on the ceiling or patio area, even when grilling, because they are so busy trying to get into that disgusting smelling bag!  All we can say is thank you to the creators of these things.  The well known name brand has one also that is hanging next to it...It did not attract as many where as the Rescue bag is like a Rock Concert.  LOL....good name for all the action going on outside and inside the bag! RESCUE is the one you HAVE to buy.  LOVE IT!	1
They really get smelly fast...and they were outdoors!  It really works though!	-1
these things really work -- you will be amazed at the number of flies they catch -- cuts way down on the fly population	1
Very disappointed in this product when I filled it with water the water just poured out of it because the seams were not sealed	-1
We live on over one acre of land and put these on the four corners of the property and they last 3 months with no flies in our home.  So two times a year I buy these to keep "them dam flies" away.  Put these away from your home not near your home.  When I see a fly in my home I know it is time to buy 4 more catchers.	1
Works well but had to throw away due to its strong odor.	1
We bought a house out in the country and were being bombarded by flies.  Leaving the screen door open for the dogs to go in and out resulted in tons of flies in the house every day.  We were getting really good with a fly swatter.  I saw this on Amazon and bought it due to all the good reviews.  We hung it on the outside of our front porch, high up on a decorative wrought iron support.  It's only about 8 feet from the front door and we haven't smelled a thing.  99.5% of the flies are drawn to the trap instead of the front door and we are so happy with it we just ordered two more.  We recommend this to anyone who is suffering from flies invading their living space.	1
These work well. I've used them before but purchased them locally. The local store was out so I bought them on Amazon. They were a little more expensive, but not enough to keep me from buying them. Great product.	1
HAVEN;T USED THESE YET, CAUSE I BOUGHT OTHER ONES, BUT DIFFERENT. WILL WRITE WHEN I USE THEM. DEE	1
works, but is stinky!	1
I've been using these for several years. My first experience with this trap was during a camping trip. I hung a trap in a tree just out of camp. The trap filled up with flies over the 5 day camp out, not even one fly bothered us while we were eating at the camp. I set another up this year outside of my house and within a week it was full of flies. I mean these things attract thousands of the little critters. They work like magic. They do smell bad , so don't put them to close to your living area.	1
This trap really works.  It takes about two days for the flies to find it, but once they do they will go right in.  The smell?  Yes, it's like something rotten.  That's the key to its success.  We take these camping with us.  You should place the trap a good distance from the area you want to clear of flies.  This will draw them away from you and to the trap.  Yes it attracts flies.  That's the key.  But, they are all away from you so they don't bother you when you are eating outside or otherwise enjoying the outdoors.  We have been using these for three years now and are still amazed at how well they work.  They even capture smaller flies.  Buy these with confidence.  You will be reordering on a regular basis.	1
These are the best!!!  When they are full dispose of the complete unit.  You never knew how many flies you had around you!!!  Flies are filth carriers. Please keep them out of the house or restaurant!  Thanks to Amazon for doing their usual great job of making me aware these traps exist.	1
I use these every summer from May to October. They really work well, but hang them down-wind because they stink!	1
This smells like a combination of a rotting corpse and a overfilled outhouse.  I had this in the front of my house as far away on my lawn as I could go.  My little guy goes poo there so, I thought I wasn't cleaning the lawn properly so I hosed it down everyday and scrubbed the bricks in front of my house.  There were also a lot of flies coming into our house.  A problem I have never has.  Finally in desperation I threw this trap away.  I realized that this was the source of the odor and the flies!  There are no more flies in our house.	-1
These work far better than I ever thought they would. I had some VERY aggressive black flies and horse flies near my pool, and it got to be that I couldn't even walk on my lawn without several of them aggressively attacking and biting me. This called for all-out war.  I came across these traps while doing a search, and the reviews convinced me they were worth a try. I carefully followed instructions, and hung two traps out on a Saturday. On Saturday night, I noticed zero flies in the traps. It didn't look promising.  The next day, however, I saw maybe 20 flies in each trap. Each day the number grew, and now I can see over 100 flies in each one, with several trapped flies wandering around with no way to get out.  Mission accomplished. I'm amazed that I can now walk around in my yard with zero fly attacks.  By all means buy these if you're considering them. They work incredibly well. I will be buying more as these fill up. I don't hate the smell of them as much as others seems to, but the smell is only detectable a few feet away from the traps, and that I can easily live with.  I give these my highest recommendation. They simply work. I hope this review helped you in your purchasing decision.	1
I put one outside and the number of flies it attracted was unbelievable. I had no idea that there were so many in the area. I have never seen anything like it. For the first time I feel I have a handle on getting the nasty things out of my yard. I bought two and they are jam packed of dead flies, I'm going to buy 6 more. I highly recommend this product.	1
Yes, these do smell, but they work fabulously...  Stupid flies go into it while I'm trying to hang it.  I yell at them to wait a minute until I finish hanging it to die :)  Bags fill up fast with flies - easy to use and dispose of.  Highly recommend!	1
I put these by the chicken coop, the edge of the property that is past our pool, and another past the fenceline that is closest to our deck.  Draws flies like crazy.  Can't have close to the house because it's pretty stinky!  All you do is add some water and hang the bag out..let it get full and toss it.	1
They work very well and catch a lot of flies. I like the smaller size best. The large one holds so much water the plastic seams leak.	1
These traps work!  Unfortunately they get really stinky.  The more they stink, the better they work.  After a while, they get full of maggots and are really gross but then the flys really flock to it.	1
I hung this by the chicken coop and in 2 days, the bad is black  from flies. Yes, it is gross, but it catches them and they die soon. Bzzbzz	1
Pretty gross but gets the job done.  We use it in the barn and I will be purchasing more of them.	1
I know fly catchers of this type have been around a long time but it really works. We went to the Salton Sea State park for a few days and the flies were terrible. I Put this up and flies started to amass almost immediately. It did it's job and was effective in reducing the flies in the area, I say reduced because there are seemingly billions of flies out there. Good product.	1
We live on the edge of a wood land / creek area.  Flies keep scampering through our back door when we open it up to let our dogs in or out.  The flies sneak in without our seeing them.  We don't see them outdoors but they sure know where our door is.  We decided that we needed to do more than chase flies around with a fly swatter all day.  After an extensive search we found a couple "like" fly traps.  We choose this one and purchased several of these as they were much less expensive as the other similar offerings.  I was a bit skeptical but other reviews indicated that they worked.  I put one up at the edge of the woods upon arrival and only caught a few small flies the first day (it was cool that day).  Two days later it warmed up to 70+.  Late in the day, I checked up on the action and there were at least  a 1" thick pile of dead large flies floating and a handful scampering to get in on the action.  We have not seen a fly since this was installed.  While they're advertised to last a month, I suspect that at the current rate we'll be using one every 7 - 10 days.  Nature always has the uncanny ability to adapt.	1
This product was effective at catching and attracting flies. However, the smell was horrible. It smells like rotting fish from at least 50 ft away you can smell it.	-1
These fly catchers are unbelievably efficient, and they do not have the noxious odor of most fly traps.  You never have to touch the flies and no yechy sticky paper.  These products work best outdoors, placed slightly adjacent to the location you want to rid of flies.  simple installation and easy-to-follow instructions.	1
I can't believe how many flies these traps catch!  They are easy to assemble too, and they work for months.  BUT, BEWARE, THEY STINK!  You don't want them anywhere near your entryways or patios/decks.  One complaint would be that they don't come with a hook or string or anything to hang them from.  You have to cut some string or use a twist tie or something like that.  It would be nice if they came with everything necessary.	1
This fly trap is a necessity for me because I have two dogs and a big fenced in yard. I use a doggie door and the dogs can come and go at will. Of course they do their business out in the yard. If I didn't have this fly trap, I'd really have a fly problem. I use two of the bags at once on either side of the fence. Using picture hanging wire, the bags are easy to hang and flies are absolutely attracted to the odor of the chemical inside the bag. The bag lasts for quite a time. Just a warning; when you have to take d the bag down, carefully drop the bag into a large garbage bag. The odor of the chemical inside the bag in unpleasant and I hang the bags a distance from the house. I recommend this fly trap.	1
This works extremely well.  It fills up quickly during the summer.  I recommend that you put it far away from your patio & doors because it will attract the flies to the area that you have it.	1
According to the reviews, this was suppose to work great. I ordered it and all it did was attract more flies. The flies didn't go inside just flew all over the place. After the first week, I moved it to a different location. Again for the second week. After 3 weeks and only catching 3 flies, I just threw it away.	-1
Be prepared for the smell of rotting meat.  It doesn't work very well in cold weather -- flies 6 ft. away were ignoring it. And in warm weather, it works, but you can smell the strong rotting meat odor from many feet away. (Much further downwind.)  These are great for areas that are far away from people.	1
had a fly problem in my backyard last summer, and this pretty much too care of it. hang it far from your house though, these things smell BAD and are not pleasant to see once they fill up.	1
this item works like a charm, but beware that you have to through it away with in a month or it smells like death around your house.	1
This summer was really bad for flies and yellow jackets for some reason but this took care of the (fly)problem!!! I actually bought 2 of the fly traps AND 2 of the yellow jacket traps. I purchased them late August and we just had our first FREEZE so I'm taking them down and throwing them away now finally. I want to take pictures to post but it's pretty gross. They are all LOADED to the rim. These worked for me and made my time outside this summer a lot more enjoyable.	1
This is the best fly trap ever. It does the job and is so easy to throw away. Just toss it in the trash no touch no mess.	1
The small black flies along the Maine coast are usually very bad in the summer so I decided that I would try the Rescue FTD-BB24 Disposable Fly Traps. This trap only caught a few files in the whole week that we were there and I was disappointed that it did not work well. Its possible that this trap only catches certain types of flies. I would not recommend this trap for the Maine coastal black flies..	-1
Back patio was not a fun place to be with all the flies that seemed to congregate there.  The first day I set this up, several flies were caught.  Everyday afterward, there have been new flies trapped in the bag.  Such a cool idea, as I hate the idea of flies sticking to a piece of sticky tape seemed so unappealing.  Dead flies cannot even be seen in this bag.  Will be purchasing more!	1
I reordered this to give as gifts. For three weeks my two original traps have been doing a great job. I wrote a previous review as soon as I saw them start to work. Looks like they will continue for a month until the get full, but they are really, really stinky. It is the design and the stinky bait that makes them work. Probably have trapped and killed 1000 flies in three weeks. There will be far less flies next season.	1
Just reordered four! This stinky fly trap for outdoors is the best fly killer I have ever seen or used for home use. It takes a couple of days to stink, but once it does, flies can't resist it. I hang one near the garbage cans and also one on my outside back patio. Sure beats fly paper or diligent use of a fly swatter. Definitely not for inside use, the smell is really bad. For every fly you kill this month there will be hundreds less next month and millions less next year.	1
Unlike Japanese beetle traps that seem to lure more and more beetles to your house every year, these traps seem to eradicate flies all around my property.  My wife and I were both commenting how so much fewer flies there seems to be around our house in general.  These work well. Be sure to fill them to the line as indicated.  But be forewarned, they stink. They smell like rotting meat, so be sure to place them someplace where the odor won't bother you.  (By the way, this is our 6th trap!)	1
I filled a couple of these up to help with the flies. I live in a coastal area that gets waves of flies.  These were full in just about two weeks. They did the job better then the others I have tried. Will buy again.	1
I think these bags are great. I've been using them every summer on a rural property with animals, so I use quite a few of them, plus two other methods of fly control. I couldn't ask for a better product, but since flies travel up to a mile and a half looking for icky stuff, how many of my neighbor's flies do I take out? There are goats, horses, alpacas, dogs, cats, etc around here.  One tip: While it's still hanging up, put a plastic grocery bag around it, holding it closed at the top. Unfasten it, then while holding the bag closed, push the top of the trap down, tie the bag and put it in two more plastic bags, tying each one as you go. No spills, and no flies all over your arms.	1
They stink like an old outhouse but work great trapping fly's and hornets; very smelly but they DO catch hornets. The hornets go in to catch a fly or maggot and can't get out. There is usually a sentry hornet that hangs out at the opening (it keeps flies away and other hornets, and tries to get fly's from outside the bag, or it goes in after them. Once that hornet is gone, another arrives and watch for live bait. Hornets only want live bait. I love these things but do not set near where you eat as they really stink. I personally would rather not have flies and use food tents.  Warning: Do not use or fill it indoors!! If you fill it in the kitchen or inside your house, do not spill any in the sink, floor, trash, or your hands, as it really reeks, as it is supposed to to attract fly's, like to an outhouse. Some bags do leak from manufacturing defects (heat sealed), so don't risk it in the house. Yuck!! It does not wash off easily. Do not use warm or hot water in the bags as you will dissolve the smelly contents too quickly and not attract fly's to the heat. Once hung, refill it there with a plastic pitcher and a drop of non smelling soap, regularly, only to the line (it gives them space to crawl in and get stuck inside, and drown quickly), and towards the end of the season add some apple-juice to attract more flys and hornets, and yellow jackets. Adding a drop of non-smelling dish detergent helps them drown quickly, by breaking the surface tension, and to sink to the bottom. If you fill it too full, or the dead fly's stack up, the others will crawl out easily. Keep a space between the yellow plastic and the fly's and water. Once full of fly's just unhook it and set it on the ground to dry out then toss the whole bag in the trash; it will stink. Be sure once you have opened it that the yellow top seals in the open position from the weight so fly's do not crawl back out. Be careful not to get stung while refilling if a stinger creature is close; you encroach on their hunting territory. These really work well.  These have worked well for me for many years and I prefer The Big Bag model since they hold more and need less refilling. Highly recommended!! These can stink up an eating, playing, or relaxing area but gets flies like crazy, and some hornets and YJ's. My wife cannot stand the smell so I get the job.	1
love to sit on the deck, but can't stand pesky flies. This really seems to get the job done. It is 'smelly' so position well away from the areas you regularly use.. I'll go thru one every 3 - 4 weeks... yep, they fill up and dry out	1
I was skeptical at first buying these due to bad results with other fly traps.  I'm glad I did buy them!  They REALLY catch flies.  Tons of them!  But, beware that they definitely have a strong, unpleasant odor and should be placed outdoors, far away from windows, or decks/patios.  There were hundreds of flies caught in each trap within the first couple days.	1
We have several of these up in our barn, and it makes a huge difference in the fly population around our animals.  We've placed them high enough where the smell doesn't bother us, and they catch flies by the thousands.	1
Works great.  But put it away from your outdoor living areas, because it smells like rotting meat to attract the flies.  Then you just throw it away!	1
I used to buy the large bag version of this, but it held so many flies that the smell was just too much. This smaller version obviously holds less flies and so I can dispose of it more often and have a sweet smelling back yard at least for a while. It is amazing how many flies these attract.	1
We had a problem with some kind of biting flies out near our pool.  My neighbor recommended these bags, so we tried them.  They work great, took care of the problem.  I'm just going to reiterate what other reviews  have said.  The only problem is that they smell really bad.  They smell just like a dead body.  Obviously, thats why they attract the flies so well.  So, the trick is to get them close enough to where your problem area is, but far enough away that you won't smell them.  And, it gets grosser as time goes on.  The flies and magots pile up in the bag, but that shows that they're really working.  Also, as other reviewers said, don't be careless cutting along the dotted line.  It has to pretty precise.	1
The product works but where to hang it. We put it out by the pool and grandkids complained of the odor. I put in the shop with 9 foot ceilings and my husband complained of the odor. I put it by the back door and I cut down on the amount of flies in the house but fewer people walked in the back door because of the odor. I guess it depends how much you hate flies. I now hang them out by the compost and I pleased how full of dead flies they are!	1
These little bags will catch more flies than you can count. Have to change them every other day as they are full. By at least 12 because if placed correctly they fill up fast here in Florida	1
Works extremely well. Once filled I would recommend touching it with gloves only. Whatever the pouch contains stinks and will not come off your hands easily.	1
the best thing i have ever come across for catching flies. AWESOME product. I will buy many now I know where to find them.	1
This unit is better than I thought it could be attracting the flys plus catching them .I have replaced them several times had no idea they could catch so many.	1
Read the instructions! Again!  YOU will need to supply string or line of some sort to tie onto the trap in order to hang it.  Be CAREFUL cutting the top, I would choose a sharp blade over scissors. Once filled (to the fill line!!) with water, handle CAREFULLY and hang OUTSIDE.  I hung this thing on my front porch (open air).  The stink is POWERFUL.  Works exceptionally well, larger flies were able to get in through holes that I thought would be too small.  My uncle stopped by, didn't see the trap, and commented that there must be something dead underneath my porch.  I pointed the trap out, and he said that I had might as well just hang up a dead opossum.  The smell really is that bad.  But it works.... oh man, does it work.  After only two weeks this summer, the bag was half full of drowned flies, maggots, etc... which, of course, made the smell worse.	1
Within hours of hanging in the backyard, there were some flies trapped.  It seems to work better for larger flies.  Even if we don't get rid of all of them, I feel this traps will cut-down the population of these pesky insects.  Will probably re-order. UPDATE:  These bags are working like nothing we have EVER seen!!!!  No flies around any more.  Lots and lots of trapped flies!!!!!!  It used to be hell to sit in our back yard; no more.  These things are WONDERFUL...I will re-order when they get near-full, which won't be too long....Thank you, Sterling Rescue!!!!	1
I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents, none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%, not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon, my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys, you should too.	1
captures all the flys.  the bag was full and i thought it was time to remove, then i noticed the bugs started to disintegrate and its still still works.  I reccomend putting it a place where you won't be able to smell, or see it. i highly recommend using this product.	1
beware -- do NOT have in enclosed spaces....even just walking by it makes me want to gag!!  but the flies love it.  they have such bad taste	1
These are great to catch flies, filled bag up within 2 weeks, but you need to dispose of because of the smell  I wouldn't want it around a patio or deck.  Only type to buy are the DISPOSABLE fly catcher.  Just sooo nasty	1
. . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii, not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still, the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.  FWIW, this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree, no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week, then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.  FWIW, take two, I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick.	1
I use this product in Phoenix Arizona and it has caught a lot of flys.  I hung it at rear of our backyard as it does smell.  I only notice the smell when I am about 10 to 15 feet from the fly trap.	1
I CAN'T STAND a fly.  When one of those little suckers gets in my house all other work cease until its DEAD. Unfortunately I live in an area that is a breeding haven for flies and the amount of frogs and toads I have can vouch for it. Plus feeding my animals raw meat doesn't help.  I would kill as many as 20+ more a day outside/inside....  I got so sick of killing these things that I finally I remembered my dad using these around the home, so I went a brought two bags.  Followed the directions and hung them around my "fly areas."  It wasn't even 5 minutes and already I had flies crawling and drowning in the bags. I've only had the bags for about 3 days now but it has made quite an obvious "dent" in the fly population around my home.  Normally I would be killing flies left and right inside my screen porch. Now I hardly see any! Less flies in the home too :)  It does stink, but hey that's what flies like.  And removing the bags can be a little nauseating, but its a small price to pay to enjoy peace of mind around the home.  Best $5 bucks I've ever spent.  They also sell these at Walmart too if you need the item fast.	1
I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week, this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies, it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped, and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day, the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product.	1
I feel with the number of flies that we have caught, I am trying to rid the neighborhood of all of the flies.	1
This fly trap catches a lot of flies and so far we can't smell anything from it.  It is hanging outside suspended on a string tied to our garage.  Perhaps its because of our trade wind weather...but so far no smell and it has been hanging out for a week.  It's actually fun to see all those trap flies inside.	1
I cannot believe how effective this fly catcher is. I live around a river and get flies constantly. I hung one of these up somewhat near the sliding door and I have not had a fly in my house since. Agreed - it is the most foul smelling thing ever - but the flies love it. I can only smell it when I'm right by it and WORTH a fly-free existence. Highly recommend. BE SURE the string you tie on the end is secure... my first one wasn't and it dropped <yes> IN the house. Oh my Lord... so gross. ALSO - I took manufacturers advice and used "distilled" water. Works like a charm.	1
Easy product to set up. I like the fact that this product is self-contained. No need to touch checmicals or dead flies.	1
This product works exceedingly well.  I use it near my animal pens and around the orchard.  Much more effective than sticky strips and I don't have to use chemicals.	1
I placed this in the area of my yard where the dogs poo. I pick up the poop every day but this time of year we have a big fly problem (republic of panama). check out the customer image i uploaded.. after 4 days it is chock full of flies. The package says discard when full or after 30 days, whichever comes first... i'm going to have to throw it out after a week i think. But there's no way i'm dealing with emptying the reusable ones so I am sticking to these disposable ones for sure.	1
Not only did this thing not catch more than about 5 flies. It stunk up my entire back deck. A skunk smells better than this thing does. It uses some sort of dead animal technology that really carries when the wind is blowing. And when the wind is blowing it usually blows it on the ground spilling the stinky water all over the place. This was a complete hassle and waste of money not to mention a malodorous nightmare. AVOID.	-1
It works! It is a bit stinky but who cares. I hung them in the trees out back. I was constantly swatting flys that came in when I let the dogs in and out and in and out and...well, you know. Since hanging these up 3 weeks ago I have only had to swat 3 flys in my house! No kidding. I used to run around the house chasing 3 or 4 a day. I am going to order 2 more.  I love this product!	1
I was disappoint to read that this product is designed for use outside or in well ventilated area. I have an indoor fly infestation and would hesitate using it indoors because of the foul smell. It was not clearly spelled out in the advertising or I would never have bought this product.	-1
I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.  WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.  YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture. Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!  Find a different solution.	-1
These actually work. It does seem to take a day or three to finally start really attracting flies. Word of caution. Put them well away from the patio, front, or porch doors or the area where you spend time. They do smell like, uh, well, like fly attractant if you know what I mean;-) They reek! Also remember, they attract those pesky flies in your area, but I think they can attract them from miles away also, LOL. Worked for me.	1
We use these around the yard and they can fill up fast.  I wish they were a little less expensive as sometimes we go through a bag every other day.  They do trap a lot of flies.	1
Works like a charm to cut down the fly population in my paddock. I like how easy they set up and all I do is drop them into a baggie and toss them in the garbage. They DO smell in the summer, but they're hanging on two corners of my loafing barn, so it's not a problem. Not sure I'd want to hang them outside of my kitchen window or patio though!	1
The Sterling Rescue (2 Pack) Outdoor Disposable Fly Catcher, Control Trap with Attractant, Insecticide Free, is an amazing product. It traps pesky flies and kills them with zero insecticide. It simply works. When opening the trap be careful to trim the bag just inside, or on the dotted line at the yellow plunger. Once trimmed, pull out the plunger and add water to the "Fill Line" on the bag. This trap attracts flies by emitting a foul odor. I noticed a faint odor after the bag was filled with water but nothing too overwhelming. After a day or two, the trap has a definite stench. Shortly after hanging this trap I noticed several flies inside the bag within a couple of hours. As each day passes I notice even more flies attracted to the trap. After it's been prepared and hung up in an out of the way location, flies attracted by the odor then enter the trap through the top, become trapped and then drown.  Even though this trap is insecticide free, the manufacturer recommends washing your hands after handling this product.  Please rate this review if you found it helpful.  Update... 2/27/2013  I've had one of these traps hanging up just outside my door since I wrote the first review. A single trap is still catching hundreds of flies. Depending on outside weather conditions, some days it stinks worse than others but this trap definitely reeks. My first trap is about half full of fly carcasses and it's still going strong. With time the water level tends to evaporate but just add a little occasionally and you're good to go. You don't have to touch the trap to add water. I can't speak highly enough about this product.	1
These things are disgustingly good.  U cant help but look as it fills up with disgusting flys.  YUCKY but sure works.  I tried another brand and it didn't attract not one stinking fly.  Stick to these.	1
I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.  I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain, and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay.	1
This beautiful mostly black large cat decided to make my backyard home! Plus few other cats that wander in and out. The only serious problem is the fly that they attract from their waste. It is a challenge for me in a lot of ways I will not bother you with but I will not turn my back on the this or any animal! So I tried aerosol sprays also a few other things explicitly designed for flying insects with very poor results. This product is a black hole for fly.	1
Didn't have this item long enough to see how well it worked- My German Shepard got a whiff of it, jumped up (I had it hanging about 5.5 feet off the ground), tore it down and began to devour it.  She then decided to trot into the house and stink up our house.  I'm sure it'll work great (I plan to order another), just know that you should hang it high enough that large dogs cannot jump up and grab it.	1
The trap hangs in the shade in our hot weather.  As we have horses all around us, the relief of attrcting the flies away from our patio has been most appreciated.	1
Seldom does a product live up to its' advertising, but this one does. It has made our summer months much more enjoyable here in Florida.	1
I've been using this brand of fly trap for about 5  years now and it's never disappointed me. It will catch all the nasty types of flies you normally find during the summer time. This is perfect for pet owners like myself, in case the dog dumps its love bundles and I don't see it, which can atrack flies.  A couple of things you should know about this product:  First, it will probably not catch any flies the first day, and let me explain why, the material in the trap and water that you add need to mix for about a day, at which type, a very strong smell will start to come out of the trap, which means it is now working. After the first day, and during the hot ones, trust me, it will be gross, yet amazing thing what this trap can do.  Second, you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag, specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light. This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.  Third, when hanging it, place it away from your doors and windows, or be ready for some nasty smells. The trap has a mixture of eggs(dried) and other products to create a strong odor that flies can't resist.  In conclusion, this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all, it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species; it won't let you down. It works.	1
I use mine for clearing leaves and other debris from in bushs and around plants.  It is great for those purposes. The idea of using it for a yard rake is totally rediculous.  $16!!!! I just (2010) bought a new one at a pricey garden center for under $8.	1
This is way better than those dumb hanging flytraps that i always end up getting my hair stuck in.  Love how simple and effective this product is at keeping the fly population down.  Well Worth it, Get a bunch you won't be sorry.	1
The trap is fine but for the love of all that is holy, do not use it in your house. The odor is just awful. It doesn't smell bad at first, but after a while, you just cannot get the smell out of your nose.  I accidentally spilled this in my house and it has been stinking for weeks now.  The instructions clearly state that this is to be used outdoors, but I can't figure out why you would want to trap flies outside.	-1
Great tool for working around small shrubs and tight spaces along buildings walls etc.  The extendable feature gives the extra reach for behind and under larger shrubs.	1
Great idea with the adjustable length,But then make it long enough to be usable for adults. Also the tines are too small...this may work as an accessory to a a garden gnome,but will not work comfortably or do any real cultivating. Only gave it 2 stars cause of the telescoping handle,made well but not practical	-1
Perfectly described	1
I initially bought the reusable fly trap from the same manufacturer but because the 4 holes on top are about the same diameter as drinking straws, I saw many flies hesitate about going in and then fly away. I saw my neighbor had this disposable fly trap and it was full of flies. I wanted to get one that would sit on the ground and be easily moved to where it was needed.  I saw from the manufacturer's web site that they do sell a version made from a 2L soda bottle but I couldn't find any store around me that sold it. I wasn't about to mail order it because shipping would double the price of the trap.  Then I decided to make my own soda bottle trap. I bought the disposable trap from a big box home improvement store and removed the plastic top. Since it's made to be hung it doesn't stay open on its own. I used my hot melt glue gun so that it always stayed open.  I then cut off the top of a 2 liter soda bottle at first making a small hole and then enlarging it until it was a good fit with the yellow plastic. Then I hot melt glued it together.  Initially I used the lure that came with the trap but I didn't want to keep buying those once a month so I did a web search and found someone who said just add water and sugar and distilled white vinegar together. It takes a few days sitting in the sun for it to start working but it does a good job. I keep refilling the bottle from the top and it can hold a lot of flies! It also has a side benefit of catching roaches that fall in. When the bottle filled up I let it dry out and then threw it away in a plastic bag and made another one!  I also put the plastic bag of the disposable trap around the soda bottle. I pulled the bag down so that about an inch of the bottle below the yellow plastic was showing. The flies in the trap spend most of their time walking around the inside of the bottle in this clear area looking for a way out.  I also found that the soda bottle was not very stable so I put it in a heavy plant pot.  Works great!!!!	1
so after mounting the fly trap in my patio where the annoying fly problem is, i'm sitting there and thinking to myself, "whoa... that thing sure is catching a lot of flies! but it sure does smell, and there's even more flies than before!"  apparently in my haste, i hung the trap without fully reading the instructions, which says to hang it somewhere near a fly source to "DRAW THE FLIES AWAY."  d'oh!  my neigbors were probably wondering where all their flies went.	1
These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up, then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio, under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there, and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio, even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap, we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall, they are a little stinky, I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away, but since it's not close to our 'living space', it's no problem.	1
I bought one of these traps 3 years ago. No, they could not keep them in stock in the stores. This year I got smart, and decided to try Amazon. Yippy!!! This thing has to go out in the yard though; it smells like rotting flesh; no kidding. Hung it in the tree at least 25 feet away from my deck, and it it fabulous. I put it up maybe one month ago, and the bag is 3 inches deep in flies, approx 3 thousand or more. Fly eggs have nestled at the bottom of the bag also, about 1/2 inch thick. Disgusting, but wonderful. Now my family can eat on the deck without constantly swatting flies.   May 2012: Decided to replace the nasty fly trap with a fresh one. Easy disposal: Close the lid back down on the used trap, put it in a Ziplock Freezer baggie, then seal it. Then put that one inside of another, and seal it. If not, you will be sorry!!!!	1
This tool seems to be very sturdy and well made. Not having to do weeding on my knees was a real treat. Although I did have to bend over to pick up the offending weed This tool when extended made the overall task much more pleasant and made my joints happy campers.	1
Good product	1
Exactly what I needed to repair the lawn where the dogs have been digging.  Very nice, high quality rake.	1
Purchase my trap from Walmart because I was sick of nasty flies biting my dogs. I placed the trap in a spot close by my dogs to lure them away......it catches about 60 flies a day. My trap is in partial shade but when the sun shines directly on it, those flies go crazy.	1
very handy little rake	1
It's very sturdy in my opinion.  Have used it for weeding and for breaking up Michigan clay that's like bricks.  The rake is perfect for working in between plantings to get at weeds that are just forming - just takes a minute and you're done (until next week!).  I've had no issue with the telescoping of it and seems to lock solidly in place. Very happy I purchased the Corona Cultivator and would definitely recommend.	1
Great Product	1
I bought two kinds of fly traps - this and another one.  They both were great at catching flies and I plan to keep them around and buy new ones as needed.  The odor from this one seems to be stronger so you will have to keep it a good 20 feet from any outdoor eating areas.	1
This thing is perfect for me. I need to sit while working in the garden and with this, I have a great reach. It's narrow enough to get in between bushes and sturdy enough to scrape along the edge of the grass to keep a nice clean edge. Use the tool extended or shortened... it's great.	1
Out of the box this rake feels very sturdy and heavy duty. The adjustable length handle is a definite bonus, and the rake itself worked perfectly for what I needed it for, which was dethatching my lawn. Would highly recommend this rake and definitely purchase again.	1
STURDY. Easy to extend. Gets into small spaces. I love it.	1
Made to last a lifetime and great for small jobs.	1
I'm very happy with the telescoping handle on this.  Yard work can be a pain in the back (literally), so getting a good length is crucial.  I deducted 1 star because it is just not as wide as I had hoped or expected.  I used it to spread mulch this weekend and the small size was an advantage to getting around tight bushes, but a pain in the larger areas.  I think ultimately it might be good to have this one as a secondary to a wider cultivator.  This one is great to pull out when you need to work in smaller or tight spaces.	1
My wife's favorite pastime is shelling on the beach and this is perfect for that purpose...just the right length and lightweight...perfect for looking through the beach debris left behind by high tide.	1
Lightweight, durable, great size head for working with plants.	1
I weeded my 3 gardens with this and it held up nicely. Tough material. I can't bend over and weed one by one, so this worked well for my arthritis. The 4 prongs grabbed more unwanted vegetation.	1
I misjudged it; thought it was larger.  Turns out it's just fine for what I need.  Not what I thought but very pleased nonetheless.	1
I live close to the woods, have two dogs, and spend a lot of time outdoors. Needless to say, flys love our patio area and yard. I decided that I needed to find a fly trap that would work well, so I ordered three types. I ordered this one, another bag one that was much larger, and one of the ones that look to be a cup. I set all three up in my yard at different locations (but similar proximity to my house) to see which one was better. The results were easily seen! The cup fly trap came in second place, but was easily knocked over and my dog seemed to like to get into it. It caught some flys, but not the most. The larger fly trap had a stench that started to come from it after about 4 or 5 days... so bad that I moved it back further from my house. However, it caught the least amount of flys (still a lot, but a lot less). Now, on to this fly trap:  I was literally amazed by this product. Within one week the trap was full to the top with flys. It was so full, that there was no more room for flys. It was pretty gross, but that's what I expect it to do. There wasn't the nasty smell as there was with the other bagged product and the end results were simply amazing. I don't think that a fly trap can do better than this one, so I highly recommend this one as opposed to the others. The only downsides are that you have to partially assemble it (but that only takes 1 or 2 minutes) and that it doesn't come with a string to hang it. However, I will gladly assemble it and attach a string for how effective it was!  I actually bought this through Amazon (see the label), so you know that this isn't an auto-review. This product is just that good! For the price, it can't be beat!	1
The only thing wrong with my order is that I did not order more! The trap was working within 30 minutes of setting it up.  I want to thank the reviewer who said he had an issue with cutting the plastic at the top of the trap. Had I not read his review I would have had the same issue. I avoided it by using an exacto type cutting tool to cut the circle out.  When setting it up I did spill some of the attractant on the side of the trap. The flies were all over it within 15 minutes and 30 minutes later they were in the trap. Be sure to hang this trap up of the reach of pets. This trap not only attracts flies it also attracts dogs too. Never underestimate the intelligence and leaping ability of a miniature dachshund. She immediately found where I had spilled it on the ground and soon figured out the source. I distracted her, hung it higher, and washed away what spilled on the ground. I mention this only because we mini dachshund owners tend to be very protective of our little heart stealing dogs.  A possible mistake I made when setting this out was to hang it in direct sunlight. We have a heat wave at this time and during the hottest part of the day I did not see any flies around the unit. Today I am going to hang it in a shade tree. I'm sure that will work and if it does not I will update this review within a short period of time.  I feel that this trap is well worth what I paid for it and as soon as I am done with this review I am going to order at least one more maybe two. One for the front yard and one for the back. I have a fly problem because I have fruit trees, compost piles, a garden, and I live in a tiny town surrounded by farms. The flies in the front yard are a bad problem because when I mow the yard they come out and pester me when I am trying to concentrate on safely mowing the part of my yard where it has steep slopes. You can easily turn your mower over while trying to swat a biting fly. If the yard does not get mowed I wind up with thousands of mosquitoes and dozens of snakes.  All in all I am happy with this purchase and I wish I had found this item many years sooner.  UPDATE. JULY 28,2011.  I'm glad I ordered more. My trap is already full. One more thing I need to mention. Don't hang the bag too close to where you sit or eat outside. The bag has an odor and without that odor the trap will not work. I would experiment by hanging it in different locations. The perfect spot would be close enough to attract flies away from you but far enough that you don't smell it. It also helps to remove things that attract flies away from the trap. Mine hangs in a fruit tree. I had some rotten fruit on the ground that was attracting the flies more than the trap. I raked them up and got rid of them. The next day the flies were swarming the trap even more than they had been.	1
It is as advertised.  The head is small for big jobs, but it retracts nicely.	1
Great tool!	1
Handle is a bit hard to extend with older hands.  Other than that,miss great.	1
I have used this product for two years and it has worked great.  I think it is attracting and catching all the flies in the neighborhood (community service?)  I just cannot imaging that my backyard has that many flies! As some of the reviews mentioned, it would take a few days for the attractant to "ripe" before the flies would come. And after that flood gate would open.  By holding your nose and standing close to the trap, you can watch the flies get trapped, maggots crawling in the bag ... very disgusting but entertaining at the same time. Revenge is sweet.  When the bags were full, I disposed of the plastic bags (carefully), but kept the yellow funnels, which is the key components of the trap.  I reused the funnels for my homemade traps made out of jars with plastic lids.  You would want plastic lids because you will need to cut a circle that has a smaller diameter than the funnel on the lid, insert the yellow funnel to lid, and voila, you have a reusable trap.  All you will need now is attractant that you can buy from Amazon.  I used shrimp heads, crawfish heads, or a dead minnow ... the homemade attractants would be as stinky and effective as store bought stuffs.  Yes, it is just disgusting so you will need to hang the traps at the far end of your yards.  They will continue to catch flies.	1
smells terrible but who cares you hang it up outside away from the windows and porch then come back in a week or 3 to take it down and throw away the couple hundred dead flies.	1
These are an absolute essential.  We also live in an area where neighbors have chickens, horses, etc., and consequently, there is a high fly population.  Put these fly traps up and you'll be amazed at how well they work.  I think we only used two of these last season (but not at the same time) and had no problems with flies.  They are about a buck and a half cheaper at Lowe's though.	1
My all time favorite garden tool!  I gave one to my son for Christmas too!  It saves your back and makes it easy to rake your soil before planting and around plants all season long.  Very handy!	1
This is a wonderful tool for the garden.  It eliminates bending for those who have arthritis.	1
Great product for the garden.  Like the telescoping handle	1
It was broke	-1
Very nice and good length; adjustable; seems to get the job done.	1
Made strong and works well.  It extends easily and is easy to handle while digging.  Good product with no problems.	1
My sister was looking for a narrow rake to get behind bushes and between plants in her flower bed. I got this and was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy and well-made it was, especially given the price. Seems like a very versatile tool. Very impressed.	1
Exactly what we wanted, a small rake to cultivate around shrubs and bushes.  Very well made, sturdy.  Perfect for getting to tight spots to pull back mulch.	1
This is a good product.  I have used it for years.  The problem is that purchasing it is a problem.  In some places it is about $4 and in other places it is double. I would just suggest you shop around or pay double.	1
I've always had a tough time getting leaves out from under shrubs. A full size rake just gets in the way, and the half-size ones never seem to work all that well. This rake is an excellent performer - you can shorten the handle for working in close quarters, or extend it to keep from stooping down. The handle extends and retracts in any position, and locks in tightly. Just turn, extend, and turn again to lock it in.  The tines are spring steel and seem sturdy enough to last for several years. The handle is metal, again of sturdy construction. Nice oversized grip that is very comfortable even without gloves on.  Also has a metal loop to hang it in the garage.  One point - you can also find this at big box stores (the one that is the plural of "low") for about half of what Amazon is presently charging.  Corona makes several tools with the same handle design, including hedge clippers that are fantastic (those I did purchase from Amazon, and will be posting a review). Good to see that there are still some well thought-out and well-built hand tools available without having to spend a whole lot.	1
for extremly light purpose only, this I use to clean up flower beds and so on, not even qualify as a garden rake, it's a flower bed rake, fiber grass shaft are very light and extension pole keeps my foot dry.	1
I wouldn't waste your time or you money on this.  There are some home made fly catchers that work much better and a lot less expensive.  I just didn't find this to be nearly the solution I was hoping for.	-1
We always have a fly problem in our backyard during the hottest parts of the summer probably due to our two dogs as well as the neighbor's.  I've been using these traps for several years off and on. They have always had a nasty odor, but this year it seems worse than ever! After a couple of days the trap literally smells like a dead deer or other large animal. When I arrive home, I can actually smell the trap when I get out of my car on the opposite side of the house about 30 yards away. For that reason, I think I am going to have to look for another solution for the fly issue. It's getting to the point in the last couple of weeks that it's negatively affecting the quality of our time spent outside in the garden or grilling (same goes for my neighbors, I'm sure).  They DO work well...it's amazing that in a short period of time the trap is filled with hundreds of flies.  At times I have had to add water because there are so many flies that the live ones are crawling over the dead ones floating on the top (admittedly not a pleasant thought).  At $5 a pop, though, it would be expensive to replace these traps several times a week, which is what I'd probably need to do to keep the odor down. (I'm not sure how bad this odor would be in a more mild climate. I live in the hot, humid south, which I think is the major problem).  They are recommended for outdoors and barns, which I'm sure would be a great place for them.  DO NOT use them inside. (Even if you have a problem with your sense of smell like another reviewer).  But, they WORK which is why I must give this four stars!	1
These traps are very effective in attracting and capturing flys. My first one was full within a few days, so I disposed of it by sealing it in a gallon sized zip lock bag and placing it in the trash. A second one filled within a week, and now I have a third up and have very few flys in my patio area (and most of them are in the trap).	1
I LIVE IN CT AND WISH I FOUND THIS PRODUCT SOONER!!!, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  WE HAVE CHICKENS AND IN 2 WEEKS OF PUTTING THIS BAG UP ATTACHED TO A TREE IT WAS FILLED TO THE TOP WITH DEAD FLIES--I HAVE NOTICED A GREAT DIFFERENCE WHEN SITTING ON MY DECK IN THE SUMMER THERE ARE HARDLY ANY FLIES BUZZING AROUND THE FOOD.  I ALSO HAVE A HORSE FARM NEXT DOOR THE OWNER DOES A GREAT JOB IN CONTROLLING THE FLIES ON THE FARM BUT I PURCHASED ONE FOR HIM TO USE HOPEFULLY IT WILL HELP EVEN MORE..THANKS KIM	1
We had a fly problem a few years ago, so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation, so I tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rescue-Reuseable-Fly-Trap-with-Attractant-FTA-SF4/dp/B00004TBKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4</a>&nbsp;and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell, however, is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.  The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime, when flies are active, unlike an electronic trap like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Flowtron-Model-BK-40D-Electronic-Insect-Killer-One-Acre-Coverage/dp/B00004R9VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Flowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)</a>&nbsp;(which I also purchased).  The irony, I found, in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard, away from the house, and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)	1
These loppers are indeed super duty!  Have been using them for two years on a lot of tough jobs and they are holding up great.  Very sharp blades, hide them from the kids!!!Highly recommended for serious clearing.	1
Not much to say about it really, it's a big lopper ! Corona loppers are more than high quality enough for my needs. And this is simply a jumbo version of a regular lopper, great when a branch is to big for a standard lopper, but there aren't enough of them to justify getting the chainsaw ready. It's the .44 magnum on loppers, if Arnold needed a lopper he'd keep this one in the back seat of his Hummer, Hasta La Vista branchy !!! See you in hell ! Lol.	1
This is the Big Daddy of loppers. I mostly use these loppers to cut up palm fronds. The large cutting capacity saves me a lot of time in the garden. It eliminates a lot of hand sawing. The cutting head is heavy duty like most other Corona products. Before I purchased these loppers I made sure that Corona sold replacement parts. They do. The spring bumper is a great innovation. It should last a long time before requiring replacement. My Felco looper has a rubber bumper which needs replacement each year. The wooden handles have adequate strength but are a little heavy. I use these loppers hours at a time, so I do notice the additional weight. I'm not sure that these loppers could cut through a 3 inch hardwood branch. I doubt anyone would have the upper body strength to do that anyway. These loppers have become my favored tool of choice.	1
Perfect fit for my Poulan chainsaw.  Another bar that is very well manufactured with tight tolerances.	1
Repair Clinic and E-Replacement Parts have parts. E Replacement Parts has exploded views of equipment. Amazon has parts in bulk. Stens has a FULL-LINE catalog for ALL kinds of 2 and 4 cycle equipment. It is a VERY good catalog! It has diaphrams in bulk. Get the 12" hemostat pliers or the 45 degree hemostat pliers from Amazon to replace fuel lines and filters. Cut lines at a slant to ease installation. Check the carb. make and model to get the right kit. Check if it's a Zama or a Walbro. Sometimes carbs. can look-alike but the kit is different.	1
good price and quick delivery	1
Great replacement item as required by Pooulan.	1
great product and price	1
It's a chain bar that fits my Poulan Wild Thing chainsaw.	1
Ordered this bar for the poulan wild thing saw. It is a perfect fit and made the saw as good as new. Also ordered chain along with bar and am back using this saw every time I need to cut wood. Good product and good price.	1
Amazon beats all the dept. store prices.	1
Fits my Poulan Wild Thing perfectly.  Matches in color too.  This review is just for those who want to confirm that this bar fits the Poulan Wild Thing --- this bar fits the Poulan Wild Thing.	1
perfect	1
works	1
I finally had to break down a buy a replacement bar for my poulan pro chainsaw.  This fills the bill. What can I say it is a chainsaw bar and fits my chainsaw. Considering I have had the chainsaw now for 8 years I would say that is not a bad return on my initial investment of I believe $120 at the time.	1
This chain gets the job done when placed in the right chain saw.  Fire wood and a good fire ensures survival and comfort during my youngest son's annual hunting trip. The original chain was abused and destroyed. This was the back-up replacement and got the job done.  Highly recommended and at a very good price.  Make sure you have the right chain to match your saw and exercise all recommended safety precautions. This is an essential but very dangerous tool.	1
This Chainsaw chain was purchased to replace an original chainsaw chain that came with a new Chain Saw. This product is far superior than the original and i am sure that it will last much longer.	1
I have used this style of feeder for years.  They work great, attracting many hummingbirds.  They have a classy/quality design, unlike many plastic feeders I've seen.  Well made, with glass bottle and wood top & base.  Also easy to clean.	1
Easy to use and seems quite sturdy. It is clearly hand made and shipped VERY quickly. Was an instant hit among the hummingbirds. Saw it used at least a dozen times its first day out. They are also able to perch on its base. Just wish the chain was longer.	1
Such a beautiful feeder.  Just hung it this morning - the little guys seemed cautious at first - maybe from reflections or the shiny base.  My big hope is that the bees won't crawl in the holes and drown like in my cheap plastic feeder.  I think the holes are too small for the bees to get in.	1
This is a very pretty hummingbird feeder made with red glass so you don't need to color the solution.  The etchings on the glass are pretty and it's easy to refill the feeder, which comes with instructions.  It's expensive for a feeder but the quality is very good and I am happy with the purchase.	1
This no longer available from Weber, and Amazon.com is the BEST source for this and other grill parts!!!	1
Accurate & cheap. This is an exact replacement for my Weber thermometer that broke after many years. It is a top-rated thermometer by America's Test Kitchen.	1
A good replacement.	1
Installed, works great..	1
Fantastic product to replace our broken one on our Weber grill.  Love that it can be used to check the temperature of the food without running into the kitchen to get one.	1
Now we are cooking!!	1
Works perfectly	1
My original Weber thermometer gave out after 16 years, just wish they lasted longer. (Kidding). Very satisfied with the replacement.	1
Works and fits just like the old one. Hope it lasts a little longer though.	1
Works great	1

Perfect replacement part, just like the original.  Temperature seems accurate.	1
Yup, It's a Thermometer.	1
It is not just a compatible part, it is a weber thermometer.  Came in  a bulk type plastic bag, not a retail box.  It fits perfectly!	1
I can't cook without some idea of the temperature.  This was the perfect solution when the original thermometer expired.	1
Prefect and exact replacement	1

Works as advertised! Replaces my old Weber one that finally gave up the ghost.	1
This does the job.  Just position it through the vent on top of the grill and it will give you an accurate reading	1
Very easy to install. Great to find it on Amazon.	1
Not much to say.  It's a genuine Weber product that you can't find at Home Depot or Lowes any more.  Decent price, quickly shipped.  When the old one died after 15-20 years I was very happy to find this genuine Weber replacement.	1
fits our new sink perfect but I must say ,it was pricy but I guess you get what you pay for. also top quality stainless steel	1
Made my Weber Genesis overhaul a success	1

Works very well.	1
good product	1
Perfect replacement for my 20 yr old Weber Genesis Gas grill.	1
Replaced a broken thermometer, this one works perfectly.	1
One of the great things about a Weber grill.........  you can easily find parts when it is 12 years old.	1
I purchased on of these on Amazon before and it worked well.  This new one is off by 20 degrees so I don't know if I purchased a reject or what the problem is.  At least if it remains consistently off then I can deal with it.	-1
has worked great so far and I use it a lot for BBQ	1
Broke the first time I used it.	-1
The dial moves when it gets hot :)  Without another thermometer to guage it against, I can't tell how accurate it is.	1
Works like it should	1
Orig. gave out, replacement working real well.	1
OEM replacement for Genysis gas BBQ.  Same fit and installs easily.	1
Awesome	1
Works as described.	1
Item as described. Works as should	1
Am buying one for my Performer.  Now, if I can only find the correct igniter and wire which I am finding hard to find,  PS:  OK, I'm bad. I found the correct igniter. Can't figure why I missed it before.	1
Works great.  Fits my Weber Genesis perfectly.	1
Does what its supposed to do	1
Works well, tossed it in the oven and the temperatures agreed.	1
The only place I could find an exact replacement for the one that came on my grill.	1
Spot on, appears to be an exact replacement of my original Weber.  Hope it lasts as long as my original!	1
It is good and fits the grill well but they don't last very long and have been discontinued by Weber.  What now when I need one?	1
Perfect replacement item.	1
Great replacement item.	1
Works as designed. Nocomplaints.	1
very satisfied	1
Perfect replacement for original equipment.  Same quality as original.	1
Fit perfectly on my Weber 1999 Genesis 2000 barbeque.  Item was bent and damaged when delivered.  I complained and they refunded w/o a requirement to return.  I straightened it and installed.  I think but am not sure that it is recording the correct temp in its damaged condition.  I'll probably buy another just to make sure it is working properly or put another thermometer in the grill to test the damaged item.	1
Easy to install.  Works great.	1
works well	1
Works exactly like the original one that came with the grill	1
Fit our Genesis 1000 perfectly.  Including this we completely replaced all worn components for around $150.  What was odd was the old thermometer worked fine up until the day before we started our rebuild project.  How did it know? (cue Twilight Zone music)	1
Just as described	1
Fit my grill perfectly. Is exactly what I was looking for due to the factory part breaking after 17 years of use. Now I know how hot my grill is instesd of guessing!!!	1
Its a thermometer. I hope it lasts longer than 2 years like the last one did. Update: I was not expecting a replacement for my thermometer that just died, but seller contacted me and asked if I wanted a replacement. I took it and fingers crossed so far so good. This is an A+ seller folks and I will surely be doing business with him in the future.	1
My 15 year old Genesis Silver B loves it.  I bought the Weber 7536 Flavorizer Bars, the 7525 Grates, a new igniter kit (7510) and the 9815 Replacement Thermometer.  My Weber is good to go for another 10 years.  This grills are amazingly well put together and these parts make the grill come back to a life as it was meant to live.	1
Arrived in a timely manner, just in time to use it at a Special Event!  Thanks............	1
Item as described.  Fast shipping.	1
Works great	1
parts went it the grill ok	1
Temperature readings were way off.  Unable to judge temperature inside the grill accurately.	-1
Bought as a replacement and didn't like the price at the local hardware store. No complaints or issues. Good quality.	1
Works great	1
Works great, fits perfectly.  If you need one for your Weber, buy this one. I have tried imitations and even modified the lid to accept them, all to just be disappointed.  Don't screw around, just buy this.	1
Perfect, hard to find Weber OEM replacement part.	1
Wore out the old one.	1
was quite happy to finally find the proper replacement thermometer for our older weber grill.	1
Glad Weber still makes parts for my 15 year old Genesis Gold C.	1
This is the same thermometer that fits into the lid of most 1990's to early 2000's weber grills.  When the original breaks you can get this one to fit the same.	1
Weber really needs to rethink this thermometer.  It stopped working after one grill session.  That isn't a great thing for the money.	-1
Probably nothing wrong with the thermometer itself, but as Weber has it mounted in the grill hood it's useless.  The temp it reads has nothing to do with the temp where your food is cooking.  Watch this thermometer and you'll cook it wrong.  Save your money.	-1
Not like the original parts didn't fit properly in a genesis silver though the add said it would. I probably should have returned it.	-1
I purchased (2) of these Weber 9815's to replace my Big Green Egg (BGE) Thermometer.  Both thermometers registered 212 exactly when tested with boiling water (boiling water = 212).  I have used one Weber 9815 on my BGE and the temperature exceeded the maximum of 550 degrees F.  The Thermometer's accuracy is now off by 35-40 degrees.  There is no adjustment nut for recalibration on the Weber 9815's so it's shot to #$%.  I am disappointed because I have used these same thermometers in my Medium Big Green Egg I owned 10-12 years ago and they never lost their accuracy at any temp.  BGE oven temperatures can quickly exceed 750 degrees F so I bit the bullet and ordered a Thermoworks thermometer that can handle high temperatures. BTW: Thermoworks is the same company that make the famous "Thermapen". [...]  Ordered: 1 Thermoworks Mini Handheld Thermocouple Meter and a Type K and a Plug Mounted MI Liquid/General Probe K (Range: -58 to 2012F) to go with it.	-1
The smoker came with the procelain coating flaking off on the middle section. Although the customer service people promised to send a replacement part; they forgot to mention that the part is on back order.  Also, while the lid and the bottom part of the smoker feel solid, the middle section, the front door and the legs on this smoker are flimsy - very flimsy. The front door does not fit too well either. It looks like I'll have to wait quite a bit before I can even try this thing out. This smoker cost about 3 time more then the competitors and I expect better then this.  A follow-up:  The replacement part came after a week. The procelain is chipped as well, although at a different place.  At least Weber seems to stand behind their product. I was told another replacement will be send. Then again I was told two days later that the part is on back order.  I would give this product less then one star if it is an option.	-1
But the 2820 is much cheaper!  Buy the 2820 from Amazon and save.	-1
First, I should point out that I've lived the past 25 years in the heart of BBQ country and, as any BBQ afficionado knows, Kansas City-area inhabitants are <em>very</em> exacting when it comes to smoked meats.  Second, although I love eating a good brisket, I've always left the smoking/grilling up to my husband. Unfortunately, a near-bloody disagreement over whether <em>every</em> meat must be cooked with mesquite [Note: the answer is <strong>No!</strong>] led me to purchase this Weber smoker for my own mesquite-free use.  Therein lies the problem. I'm not a tall, strapping guy and so I found it extremely difficult to keep adding wet wood chips and coal to this thing since it requires lifting off the top half AND  lifting the extremely hot bowl filled with extremely hot water.  To make a long story short: after nearly dropping the heavy top half of the smoker on my foot the first time I tried adding more wood chips, I then sloshed extremely hot water over my shoes whilst removing the pan so I could add more wood chips. Luckily, my husband was home to help out by returning the hot water pan and the top half to the smoker once the wood chips and coal had been restocked. That was quite fortunate, since it kept the smoker going during the 90 minutes we spent at the ER so the doctor could treat the burns on my feet.  Although I would never, EVER recommend this to anyone not interested in taking their own lives in their hands in the pursuit of a good piece of BBQ, I do have to admit the brisket turned out quite well. Although that was the one and only time I've used this smoker myself, my husband has had repeated success with it...even though he <em>still</em> uses mesquite on everything.	-1
I didn't get the one in the picture! It didn't have the tabs to stabilize it and so it wobbles... now I have to pack it up and ship it back.	-1
I purchased this based on Weber's good reputation & the positive reviews.  I'm afraid it doesn't live up to it's publicity.  Several individuals indicated it was much improved over the last version, but I feel it still needs work.  The quality of the materials is pretty good although the motor is a little under powered.  When the ring is placed on the performer grill and the notches are properly aligned with the lid holder screws, the entire assembly is unstable & the holder for the lid is blocked.  I turned it 90 degrees So the ring rests on the lid holder screws and it was somewhat more stable, but it did almost fall into the fire when I tries to check the temperature of the meat.  The  directions do not cover how the assembly is installed on the grill & there are two screws that don't have a home, & are not referenced in the directions.  It looks like these screws are supposed to be installed on the grill somehow to stabilize the ring.  At the end of the day I had to drill two HOLES in my BRAND NEW grill so the BRAND NEW rotisserie wasn't unsafe to use.  A swing & a miss Weber.  This was a gift, & 'm still embarrassed with the obvious issues.  At the very least the directions should cover proper installation of the ring on the bottom of the grill, and the reason the screws were included.  Very disappointed!!  The replacement will be one of the knockoffs that fit a 22" grill.  If I have to make changes anyway I might as well save the $50 extra I paid for the Weber name.	-1
Way overpriced for what it is. Thought we were meant American quality but half of it made in China the other half in Taiwan, and no idea where the ring was made. Should have made my own is plenty of videos on the net how	-1
way overpriced, not that great. just buy a grill	-1
I love the flavorizor however, I believe Weber is gouging us customers because we have no other alternative. Get the price down, it's just a piece of tin.	-1
The electric cord control keeps melting and burning.  I have had to replace this three times in less than a year.  The company will not replace.  Next step is to throw this out and find a better and more reputable brand.	-1
Talk about Cheesy! It's cheaply built. Don't waste your money.	-1
The top handle would not attach. We could not get the screw to bite.  Unable to use the lid without it.  Pretty disappointed overall.	-1
No - just like a counter top gill.  No favor unless you really prepare the meat.	-1
Initially it was a great grill for a small patio... but after using it (no abuse) to cook fish, chicken etc.  the Teflon started to stick and became progressively worse.. 11 weeks of use and I could not get the grill clean... this is not acceptable at all.	-1
I bought the previous version of this elsewhere. They are similar in all respects except for the cover holder on the grill. I wanted to like this grill, but it's just not as clean as I would have hoped. There is alot of grease splattering, the cooking is rather time consuming, and the clean-up is also more time consuming than I would like. My small indoor pancake/egg griddle is cleaner than this, faster, and steaks actually taste better too. I did the experiment and actually moved the George Foreman steak onto the small indoor flat pan griddle to finish it up.  I had a brand new expensive propane grill that broke when it flew off my deck with a straight line wind and so I tried this grill as an alternative for this season since it was rather cheap. I also noticed that my electric bill went up by about $10.00. I grill almost every day and because this is really not faster than grilling, it is reflected in the bill.  I like propane grilling because after I grill, I can turn up the heat and burn off the crud. With this foreman grill, I need to clean it, the power adapter, and even the legs. Everything gets super greasy. Next year, I''ll probably buy another propane grill.	-1
I was so tired of lugging those propane tanks around to get filled blah blah blah.  We were on the market for a new grill and when I saw this, it was a no brainer.  We have used it 4 times now and are extremely pleased with ease of use with great results.  It cooks more evenly than the regular kind of grill too which make it super simple to use.  So easy to plug in and then just wait a few minutes for it to heat.  Love it and will never go back to the propane or charcoal means of cooking outdoors.  Also the cooking surface is roomy and would easily allow 5-6 steaks to cook at the same time.  Cleaning is a breeze too.  All in all, perfect and just what we were hoping for! UPDATE: 5-18-2013 OK.  I guess I was hasty to write such a rave review.  After using this grill now for about a month, we are not liking it so much.  IT IS SO MESSY!  Grease gets all over the top dome and is very hard to clean.  Plus, we are finding that because it doesn't have the good grill flavor, we are avoiding it.  It does cook evenly and if you were to use chicken more than beef you would probably be satisfied with this grill.  We like chicken and beef so it really isn't working for us.  I think my husband put it toward the back of garage now...oh well. We may try to cook some cornish hens on it or bake cookies on it???  It would sure beat heating up the oven in the summer.  I will update again if we have any success with that.	-1
I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for!  The unit is not as sturdy as I had thought, and the  plate is a real pain to clean.  But, it does cook food as advertised, but the actual cooking space is limited.	-1
It really is nothing more than a bulky non stick pan, you could do the same thing with a stove top grill pan. Why bother? Go for a propane or charcoal grill to get the real thing!  After a year of not very good grilling I gave it to the garbage pick folks!	-1
Root Vue Farm is a child's toy designed to educate kids on one of the wonders of nature. It is planting device that allows children a chance to watch vegetables grow and see what they look like below the surface of the ground.  When I purchased Root Vue Farm, I intended it to be a good educational lesson and in some ways, it does offer some educational value. It succeeds at getting kids to think more about plants and from a different perspective than usual. Kids and adults are all accustomed to looking at plants above the ground, but not below the surface where the edible parts of many vegetables are found. In this regard, Root Vue Farm is a good addition to a child's toy chest and it seemed like a good purchase.  The problems with Root Vue Farm, however, become evident when you put it together and plant the seeds. Taking it from the box, the first thing I didn't like was the construction. It is very cheaply made, using styrofoam to form the box that holds the soil and seeds. There is an acrylic viewing window, which is fine, but I couldn't believe the manufacturer made the main part of the toy from styrofoam. The use of plastic would have been better, but it appears the manufacturer was trying to cut costs in any way possible.  Next, we added the seeds and soil, watered it down, and waited for the seeds to grow. The first problem we encountered was with mold. The excessive moisture leads to mold growth and since the farm is made from styrofoam, you cannot easily keep it clean. At least with a plastic box, the mold could be wiped off. But you cannot clean this very easily and it stinks.  Waiting for the seeds to sprout also proved frustrating. The seeds do sprout in a matter of days, but they did not reach the point where the vegetables could be viewed through the viewing window. I also noticed weed- like growth on the top of the soil. I don't know where it came from, but there it was, covering the top of the soil.  Educational toys are great and the concept of growing vegetables and observing their growth progress and root network still has some appeal. I may look for another toy with the same concept and better construction, but I will not bother with Root Vue Farm again. Nasty mold growth, styrofoam, and other annoyances make this an educational experience to forget.	-1
I bought these chimes because of the beautiful tone they produce.  However, it takes a very strong wind to make the chimes sound.  It appears that the wooden center piece is set too far away from the tubes (i.e. it's too small) and the sail is a little small.  I've seen other Woodstock chimes at Lowes recently, and those had different wooden parts that created a sound with a smaller wind.	-1
We bought a larger one of the Woodstock chimes and absolutely love it so we thought we would try another one with a higher tone to harmonize.  Didn't work that way.  This one just doesn't sound.  The breeze will make the alto one sound so lovely, and you can see this one blowing too...but no sound.  Very disappointing.  Should have left well enough alone.  I may have to return it.	-1
I bought this chime somewhere else but it is the same one.  I loved it for a couple years but then the strings broke.  I fixed it twice, but it really doesn't withstand the weather over time.  It was in an enclosed courtyard and didn't get strong wind or too much sun so I thought it should have lasted longer.	-1
Very poor design....in my opinion. The wind catcher (the wooden part at the bottom of the chime) is way too small and light to cause the wooden part, above, to actually hit the chimes and produce a sound. The chime sound is very nice when the catcher is shaken. I returned it for Woodstock Alto Silver Gregorian Chimes- Inspirational Collection.	-1
Thanks	-1
tiny	-1
Very poor quality.  Only lasted a few year before it fell apart.  Contacted Woodstock, repair cost is near the price of a new chime!	-1
Purchased the Baritone Gregorian which I loved and wanted a second.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews about the size of this one.  I kept it anyhow but it's not the same standard as the Gregorian Baritone.	-1
These are flimsy containers. The door came off removing it from the box it came in, wasn't able to reattach it. Tried to return it but was denied. Thinking it was a bulky shipment and they wouldn't retrieve it. DON'T BUY!!!!	-1
In my opinion these are a waste of money. If you need to actually stack them that is. They keep crushing each other when stacked as the plastic seems to be too flimsy on top to hold the weight of the containers above. Sadly I bought three of these things. Next time I'll build a storage unit myself with wood. I definitely do not recommend :(  About 2 hrs after I wrote this up, timber, 50 lbs of quail feed on the kitchen floor... I'm pissed!	-1
not a tight closure.  animals open these easily.  bugs and water can get in.	-1
Woodstock Chimes laid off all of their artisans in America, raised their prices and sent their manufacturing to China. UPS is taking this back tomorrow, Ill find one made in the USA by a company that still cares about Americans.	-1
Bought two of these for my horse's food. It's nice that they're stackable, and they arrived on time. The plastic seems to be a bit thin, but holds up okay with one stacked on top of the other and full of horse food. Haven't seen any sign of them collapsing or crumpling under the weight, but I don't think I would trust it with more than two stacked. Not a tight seal, wouldn't keep bugs out, no rubber gasket around the opening to keep it tight. Easy to access both bins when full, but filling them required I take them out of my tack room and turn them up on the end. Fit a new 50 pound bag of horse feed just fine.  Edit: I had to reduce my rating. Unfortunately, the plastic is so thin that the bottom bin started to sag, and a mouse chewed right through the side of it to get to the horse feed inside. 25 dollars down the drain, and I have to find something else to put the feed in. I'm moving the second one into the house before it gets chewed up, maybe I can use it for dog food without mice getting into it, but I'm very disappointed.	-1
Price is good but quality not so much. Was disappointed to find my dog could bust into it when it wants. Due to shabby door construction. It doesn't close properly yes you can lock it with a small cheap lock but I feel any large animal would still be able to bust in.	-1
Funky design, door wouldn't close, and it fills up awkwardly to where you can't fill it anymore past the bottom of the door, while there's still tons of unused space above it.  Terrible design.  I returned it and spent some extra money on a Vittles vault and have been happy with them.	-1
Works as described plastick could be thioker.	-1
This is advertised as able to hold up to 40 pounds of dog food.  I could only fit about 3/4 of a 32 pound bag of dog food. Go with the "60" model if you want to fit a whole bag.	-1
Sorry, but this product is very misleading to me in how much cat/dog food the container can hold. It states 40 pounds, but clearly does not hold that much.	-1
I bought 2 because they stack but cannot stack them because they buckle. They are very weak and flimsy. The doors on them do not shut the way they should. The material they are made of is not very thick or strong.	-1
Older models would last for years. The present Little Giant pumps just do not last. First off, you may not use any kind of anti-algae chemicals or bleach as the seals surrounding the impeller are destroyed and the pumps stop working. These newer manufactured pumps last one season, if your lucky. To get any warranty service, you are required to first pack up and ship the pump back to the company you purchased it from (at your expense) and provide them with a check for $12 for return shipping. That company will "test" your broken pump and then decide if they will honor the warranty. Good luck there!  By the time all this takes place, one is better off simply buying a new pump, like the manufacturer didn't think this one through?	-1
These pumps last about a year.  The manufacturer no longer covers any warranty on their pumps.  Warranty issues must be handled through the seller of the pump and they are free to shorten the warranty period to as little as 90-days.  Even while under warranty, considering the costs of shipping each way, and potential "handling charges", one is better off buying a new pump and preferrably from a company that still provides their own warranty.	-1
Ripped the first day i used it, now it has ripped in two more places near the holes	-1
It doesn't fit like the picture, it lands on the water and gets all wet and we have to dry it every day while we have the sun bubble warming blanket on the pool	-1
the drain holes DO NOT prevent water accumulation.......fills with water and is impossible to take off without dumping all the water on top in the pool.......not a snug enough fit	-1
Don't buy this. It does not work. The picture makes it look like a cap,when all it is, is a flat cover with a drawstring.	-1
ended up returning it, it arrived punctured.	-1
I sent it back. It is definitely not 8 foot in diameter. I measured it at more like 7' 2" and needed to cover an 8 foot stock-tank pool. Poor item description.	-1
Would work perfectly if there weren't "safety" holes poked in the cover to prevent kids from drowning. Because of those holes the cover is rendered useless.  It gets 2 instead of 1 star only because it works great as a solar heater for the pool and it does keep large debris out of the pool. Other than that its totally worthless. Just buy a tarp.	-1
1. The tie broke as soon as we put it on the pool 2. The holes in the cover allow everything you'd want to cover your pool from, inside, with no way of draining or taking the top off without getting inside the pool. 3. Cheaply made 4. Would not purchase again.	-1
Split at the seam within a month	-1
Flimsy. Ripped along a seam on my first use. UV light bleaches color within a couple weeks. It has a few intentional holes in it (for rainwater drainage?)  Figure on max one season (or less) and you're done...It does cover the Intex Pool	-1
Would not stay on our pool! If you live in a area where it gets any wind, it might not work!	-1
It comes with ventilation holes in it!  There's about a dozen 1" round holes (primarily in the center).  It's great if you like insects and the desert floor on the bottom of your pool.  By the way, the water comes up through the holes and fills the cover.  It's the dumbest thing I ever saw.  Straight to the trash can!	-1
Does not fit, wrong type! Intex 16X42 round frame pool is what it was needed for. Had to buy another type A from a pool store for twice the cost after ordering these. These are for the somer pool but not mine.	-1
One a month filters only. They worked though	-1
don't need it...it fit horribly	-1
the draw string ripped out first time i put it on pool, not well made	-1
From what I have read many people with swimming pools of all kinds have problems with fine particles passing straight through these types of filters. Expect them to trap bugs and little else. It became very frustrating watching dirt that I had just vacuumed coming back into the pool even with new filters. It must be the filter paper because I tried sealing the ends with petroleum jelly. Most likely the product is a compromise so that flow rate is not restricted by microfiltration. I finally resorted to what some others seem to be doing, vacuuming VERY quickly while dumping the waste water. Others are purchasing what is called "slime bag" however reviewers noted some negatives.	-1
Did not fit my filter pump. This filter is NOT "type A", the picture that is posted is "Type A" and the description is "Type A" filter but I received type "A or C" filter, which is different and does not fit my filter pump.	-1
This cover is of poor quality.  When pulling on the draw strings to tighten the cover to fit snugly around the pool, the seam ripped exposing the draw string and rendering it useless.  I have only had this for 3 weeks and am going to return it.  There is nothing to keep the cover from blowing away on a windy day.	-1
Pros: Easy to put on with just one person, which was a pleasant surprise.  Despite a major storm the day after I set up the pool and added the cover, it stayed on - without the strings tightened (storm wasn't in forecast).  Cons: There are numerous little round holes in the cover.  So, small pieces of debris go into the water and dirty rainwater does too.  Then, when trying to take the cover off the day after a storm, there was still a lot of standing water on top of the cover.  No instructions for how to deal with that.  I attempted to carefully remove the cover to pull the standing water off of the pool and dump it out, but it was too heavy.  There were tons of leaves and sticks floating in the standing water on the cover, and all of it went down into the pool along with the standing dirty water.  There must be a better design to prevent this!  I would think that a cover in more of a domed shape would be best to rainwater would run off of the top.  If all of the debris ends up in the water anyway, what's the point??  Would have been one star because of horrible design, but ease of use gives it an extra one.  If there were no rain, it's possible I could have removed the cover without all of the debris going in the water but not certain.	-1
Thin plastic......tore the first time I put it on ? Really ! It tore around the cord you tighten to keep it on the pool rim I was gentle it's just cheap...	-1
I got this to keep the pool clean. I put it on. It doesn't cover well. We have a 10' pool and I ordered the 10' cover. I pulled the drawstring as tight as I could and it still is too big for the pool. There are rather large holes in, which is great incase of rain, however, it also means that any leaves that land on top of the cover just go straight into the pool when you remove the cover. Unless you want to spend an hour or so fishing the leaves off the top of the cover and siphoning the water to get the rest of the gunk off.  Only reason it didn't get one star is because it held up to a marble sized hail storm that set car alarms off. I thought for sure it would have been shredded. The trees definitely were!	-1
I gave 5 of these for Christmas, one for each of my nieces & nephews.  They were very excited.  But they don't work. I'm very unhappy about this purchase.	-1
Product shows in black and I thought it would be in black to help solar heat water it is blue	-1
I bought the wrong size and returned it.  My fault.	-1
The cover have several drainage holes. When there is ANY water accumulation on top of the cover, the drainage holes allow the pool to fill with dirty water as you remove the cover. Next year I am going to attempt to modify the cover and make it more umbrella like so that dirty water does not accumulate and ruin my pool water.	-1
i bought one of these locally. Was hoping that the version online didn't have the holes. I understand why they put them - to avoid the pooling. However, the whole point of a cover is to keep the dirt (not just leaves) out! The holes just provide a direct access to the pool for all the dirty water that accumulates from the yard/trees. If I didn't have trees/etc I wouldn't need a cover like this. Pretty stupid if you ask me. I returned it. Not sure what I am going to do. Using my old cover for now. Sad sad sad.	-1
Not not what is in this photo ugly green that is going to look great on our blue pool	-1
Unpacked the cover and carefully installed it over my 10ft Intex pool. Easy to do. Went to slowly tighten the rope to hold it down and the rope ripped right out of the eyelets, I hadn't even removed all the slack that was in the line yet. Garbage. product. They really should have charged an extra buck or two and put metal eyelets in rather then "beefed up" plastic. Attempted to contact Intex like they request rather than returning the item from where you purchase and still have yet to get a response. Figure I probably wont. Good luck!	-1
Laid the cover over our 10' pool, grabbed the two draw strings and as soon as I pulled, the thing ripped.  Pretty much junk.  Still holding for now, but will look for something better quality.	-1
had holes in it---on purpose --that's a cover?	-1
There are holes in the top of this pool cover which allow bird poo to filter through and into the pool water.... So really what is the point of this cover?  It also allows leaves and sand to filter into the pool water so once again what is the point of this cover!?!?  Wish I had known before purchasing....	-1
I don't have an Intex pool but a built in spa with concrete ledge. I was looking for a cover for a wile and this one fits. I had a bit of a hard time putting it on, but my wife somehow managed to fit it perfectly. It does what it's designed for: keeping the leaves away. I found there weren't enough holes to let the water through, so when it rains the cover gets covered by the water. But after the first winter, it got so moldy that we decided to throw it away instead of using gallons of bleach.	-1
It keeps coming off.......don't like it	-1
Liner is really thin and it has a bunch of holes in the top for ventilation which makes sense, but then all the dirt and leaves  just ends up coming through them anyway.	-1
I think it's more than 10ft in dia., doesn't fit well at all	-1
Oh geez, again I feel terrible for Intex...2 bad reviews from me but the cover sucks.  You pull the strings and they tear the plastic, you don't pull the strings and it falls into the water, once it falls into the water so does all the debris... it's a mess.  I'd like to see a very very fine net as a pool cover to keep out trash but not get weighed down with rainwater or water from the pool.	-1
May send it back or put into trash.  The way the pool is set up there is no way this thing will work.  Be careful, the whole set up is a disaster	-1
If you're buying this for any other 8 foot pool aside from the Intex Easy Set, please know that the easy set pools are measured at their largest part (the bottom) so the top is not 8 feet.  As such, this will not cover any other 8 foot pool as it only measures slightly over 7 feet.  For the price, it's too big a hassle to return it.	-1
didn't stay on the pool even tightening the pull string didn't help, the pool cover kept on sinking in the water, does not keep a pool clean, a waste of my money,made very cheaply	-1
The fit and construction was really good but there were holes designed into it.  I'm guessing for ventilation purposes.  I wanted the cover to keep dirt and leaves out but this one fell short.	-1
This pool cover came with a multitude of little holes in the cover for some reason, it just kept filling up with water when it rained or wind blew then got the pool water dirty. I would not recommend this specific product.	-1
Well, I admit, I really should have read the reviews on this one before purchasing.  It did not fit my pool.  I have a 12' frame pool, but when I called Intex the lady there assured me that it would indeed fit.  Wrongo!  Oh well.  The company was awesome with returning it.  Thanks:)	-1
This pool cover keeps sinking. It has little holes in it and the water comes in and the cover sinks.  I tried making the edge rope tight and also putting a few little rafts around to keep it floating but it does not help much.  Update 8/24/2013 - I found that if you seal the holes with duck tape it no longer sinks.	-1
What is with the holes? I should have read the other reviews first. But I have always been a big fan of Intex products, just this one is useless. The holes let the dirty rain water and junk into the pool. with the solid cover I had last year, I would empty the water, with a bucket, after a rain and the pool was always fresh.	-1
Doesn't really work for us. It gets pretty windy here and within a few minutes of being secured to the pool it starts to come off. After a few more minutes its halfway into the pool. And eventually at the bottom of the pool.  Yes, there's a draw string to try to keep it tight around the intex inflated ring, but it won't get tight enough. My husband tried to make it tighter but it just ripped through the cheap plastic that it is.  In the end, I still have bugs and dirt in the pool. This was a waste of money.	-1
This piece of Chinese dung has holes in it!!!  Worthless.  Run away from this one, folks.  My first single star having made dozens of purchases via Amazon.	-1
I cannot get this small piece of flimsy film on my 8 foot pool because it is too small.  Also, this is not a solid cover - another point of contention about appropriate advertising.	-1
The cover that I was sent has several holes (1/2") in the middle. That may be for safety?? but I am not sure why they put them in the cover.  The cover doesn't fit snug like the picture. It could hang half way down the side of the 36" pool but is designed to fit snuggly under the inflated portion of the pool. It is just too large even though it is labeled for the 12' pool. Even pulling the draw strings to the max only allows more  of the cover to sink down INTO the pool.  When the cover is put on, it lays right on top of the water. So, water seeps on top of the cover and eventually has a LARGE pool of water on top of it. Dirt and debris is then blown onto the the top and in the water which then enters the water in the pool under the cover and when the cover is removed even more gets into the pool. Even with the cover not being removed for several days, dirt etc settles down on the water-covered cover and in time gets drawn down into the pool.  I thought of leaving the cover off because it was difficult for 1 me to put on by myself and because it didn't do much to keep the pool clean. However, it does help a little bit to keep the water warmer than if the cover is left off at night.  Heat DOES escape through the holes though so it isn't that great at conserving heat, only a little better than without the cover.  The cover with the holes in it IS NOT VERY GOOD in my opinion.	-1
I have a very nice carved slate table and I wanted a clear cover to use, so the table itself could be seen underneath. Don't waste your time on these cheap covers. I figured for only $8 I would try it and see, but it is not a cover at all. It is more like a large piece of clear raincoat you see tourists wearing. It is completely flat with no corners shaped for the table, so the edges just drape over the sides and pockets. The tip of each "corner" has what looks like a coin about the size of a nickel sewn in it to weigh the edges down over the sides. I threw it in my garage to use as a rain cover instead if I ever need one. Save your time and $8, and buy one of the real table covers for $20-$30.	-1
Just received it in the mail an hour ago, I was happy it arrived quickly. But as I opened the shipping box I noticed the box for the product wasn't just right. Slightly man handled. So taking all the parts out I noticed my hands are covered in grease (thread sealant) and it was missing to boot. then I see the bag inside that should have been holding the sealant and smaller fittings is torn open (it's a zip lock,,, duh). Then all the parts appear to have been coated with the thread sealant and semi put together. Clearly this was not a new item being shipped to me, I was not satisfied. But and here's the kicker... It does not fit my 20lb propane tank, (one from lowes) and also doesn't fit my Propane appliance either.  I guess the one star rating fits this appropriately...  be aware with this product, I hope my review helps you.	-1
received item in two days as requested  amazon package was sealed very well  the product in side box was making loose sounds  the hose box was opened , parts inside amazon box was loose ,  had to use , was missing valve that connected to propane tank  no time to return items  needed for party  stay away from red draagon  hoses shows red in ad but was just another black hose	-1
When I received this product, the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program, I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.  We gerryrigged the baffler, but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.  Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!	-1
not that great	-1
To clean hummingbird feeder holes use a prox-a-brush by Butler-it's a little dental tool also sold on Amazon. I have included a photo-nice and soft.	-1
I was looking for brushes to clean ALL of the feeder parts. Not just the ports. Good ONLY for the hummer-feeder ports. And they are so stiff and short, I just don't like them for that either. Much better using an old toothbrush! That really does the job. And for the rest of the feeder, use Casabella 20530 Soft Tip Brushes, Set of 3. You can copy that name into the search bar. They are a little more expensive but longer, more pliable and really do the job! You can even clean the insides of the bottles just bending them accordingly.  Now there is actually, finally, a feeder that you can open the bottom to clean and has a wide mouth! So easy! Not glass, but a good size and price.  I guess these little brushes might be useful for other things, as others say. Not for my hummers tho.	-1
No step for birds toperch	-1
The humming birds could not find the openings.	-1
Very attractive feeder, however not attractive to the humming birds. No birds have used this feeder. I have other feeder the birds use. However, I like the Perky-Pet 10 Ounce Glass feeder as an ornament. The feeder leaks. Will keep. The birds should learn to use it' in time.	-1
Is not bee proof at all!  It's much more of a bee attractant.  Within one hour of hanging it, there were at least 12 - 20 bees flying around it and 6-8 feeding via feeder access.  Very disappointed!	-1
Hummingbirds won't use it.	-1
Very pretty but hummingbirds get confused where the feeding ports are. If it was not for that I would have given it 5 stars.	-1
It's hot and windy here, so it leaks a lot.	-1
Never saw a hummer around it.  Also it drips when tilted the slightest in a breeze. It's going in the Goodwill box	-1
Update 8/9/17: I broke out my favorite feeder this year, prepared with hooks to prevent ants and...bees! Yellow jackets and hornets literally swarmed this feeder. About 2 weeks after I put it up a crack developed. Disappointed I didn't get more use out of this perfectly sized feeder.  Hummingbirds really love this feeder but so do the ants. The feeder leaks during the day attracting all the neighborhood ants however the hummingbirds prefer this feeder over all the others in my yard.	-1
Pain in the rump to clean, and not well used by the hummingbirds. The base also is not a great design and tends to leak around the base after you have had it for a while.  I have had other styles that were much more appealing to the little creatures.	-1
I love perky pet brand, but this particular feeder design is not working very well for me.  I've had hummingbird feeders for over a decade and I prepare a garden area for them every year. The first issue I've had with this feeder is it drips just as tube feeders tend to do.  This of course attracts ants, which will look to find the source.  The second is the birds just simply refuse to use the feeder. They will fly up to it but seem to have an issue finding where to actually feed from.  If you could rig a small flower piece into the hole I think this would solve that issue.  This time of year (August) I have 6 birds that are active through the entire day.  I've put this feeder next to my main feeder and they won't even touch it.  I've removed my main feeder in an effort to force them into trying this feeder and they just refuse to use it. My advice would be to skip this feeder and purchase one with a base that lets the bird perch.	-1
I really like the feeder.  Well made.  However the hummers don't appear to know where to get the nectar.  I painted yellow flowers around the openings.  Have not seen any action yet but will report that later.  However the feeder design did prevent the finches from getting the nectar by not having an area to perch.  two days later no longer have hummingbirds or finches.  I went back using the old feeder.  After additional three days,  I  have no birds in the yard.  Truly disappointed.	-1
Leaks everywhere which means ants everywhere.	-1
The squirrel got to me again and just few days	-1
After having two of the Garden Jewels feeder up for three day and only having Humming Birds look at it I filled and hung my trusty old one quart plastic feeder. The birds emptied the plastic feeder in about a week, they didn't even go to the Garden Jewels feeder when the plastic feeder was empty. I gave it one star for for being CUTE, it doesn't attract bees and you can't give zero stars May 30 edit, A bear just broke my plastic feeder but did not touch these feeders. So, it does attract humming Birds, Bees or even Bears	-1
I bought this feeder to try because I was having trouble with finches at my hummingbird feeders.  I live in the deep South where it is pretty hot during hummingbird season.  The instructions that came with the feeder have a Special Note that states "Direct sunlight may cause pressure to build up inside the nectar container, forcing nectar out of the feeding ports.  If you notice nectar seeping out, move the feeder into a shaded or semi-shaded location."  Not only direct sunlight, but also just high Southern heat can cause the nectar to seep.  I have the feeder in the shade but the nectar still seeps and I have not seen a hummingbird at this feeder.  I plan to take this feeder to Michigan where my mother has active hummers and will see if the design works better there.  Since nectar seepage in the heat must be an ongoing issue or there would not have been a Special Note at the end of the instructions, I think that information should be prominently included in the product description.	-1
My hummingbirds have ignored this feeder for some reason.  They prefer my window feeders to this one.  I'm sorry I purchased this feeder.	-1
I have a birding/nature store and thought this would be a great feeder to keep birds other than hummingbirds from guzzling the nectar.  Every one I sold was returned because they drip terribly.  When I tried it myself, I had the same experience and on top of that the hummingbirds didn't use it.  I had a huge sticky wet mess underneath the feeder and just gave up on it and have quit selling it.  I see that other reviewers have had better luck and maybe theirs didn't drip, but living in New Mexico with the hot summer sun, I wouldn't recommend it because of the drip factor.  There are far better feeders than this one.	-1
This bird feeder is mostly plastic.  The large round dome cover is copper colored PLASTIC.  The bottom trays are also plastic.  The only copper are the bands around the feeder openings.  I felt that the advertising was false, I returned it for a refund.	-1
After reading the reviews and the product specifications, I was convinced this was a quality product.  Indeed, the unit is attractive, well-made, sturdy, and comes with a lifetime warranty.  Unfortunately, at least in my yard (Florida Gulf Coast), it has been totally ignored by prospective avian customers.  At various places in my yard, I have 2 Brome squirrel busters, plus a couple of generic Home Depot/Lowes-type feeders.  These are filled with black oil sunflower seeds and protected by raccoon baffles (tough luck, squirrels!).  Our usual clientele includes cardinals, titmice, chickadees, Carolina wrens, goldfinches (seasonal), etc.  I loaded up the thistle feeder with Nyger seed --- all these birds totally ignored it.  I tried moving the thistle feeder to each of the other feeding locations.  No interest.  Eventually, I removed the Nyger seed, cleaned the feeder, and tossed it in the attic.  A waste of my money.  One additional minor complaint --- the Nyger seed, intrinsically quite small, tends to slip down between the plastic cylinder and the metal base and is impossible to remove.  This ensures there will be some rotting seed stuck in the feeder, no matter how diligently you clean the unit.	-1
The bird food is not protected from moisture.  Therefore, the seed gets wet and hardens so that the birds can not get to the seeds,	-1
Squirrels ate the plastic ports where the seed comes out and rendered the feeder unusable within two days of use.  Once the ports have been eaten the seed won't stay in the tubes.  This product was designed to fail and I can't say enough bad things about it.  Just a terrible product.	-1
The feeder looks great.  BUT, the birds either don't like it or can't get food from it.  I replaced an old 3 tube feeder w/ clear tubes and a green top and bottom.  The food consumption since installing this feeder has dropped off dramatically.  I have no idea why.	-1
I purchased one of these feeders in late August, 2009 and in less than 3 weeks, one of the cheap plastic flip gates (that control seed delivery at each of the ports) had either broken off or a bird or squirrel had eaten it, and I can now only fill that tube half way (it was an upper port), because the seeds spill out of the open port.  I wrote the company at the address listed in their warranty information and the letter was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable.  Either the address is phony or the company has gone out of business or moved without leaving any forwarding address.  I am now stuck with a feeder that is operational on 2 1/2 tubes, for which I paid nearly $60.  My advice - find another feeder to buy!  Looks good, but if it breaks you are stuck!	-1
I have decided to return this feeder.  The cons are more pronounced than the pros, for me.  Pros:  *Seems durable enough.  *Tubes hold two times the quantity of typical feeders.  Cons:  *The feeder atracted undesirable larger birds such as crows and grackles (at first this was not the case but they made themselves known yesterday)  *The mourning doves, while not necessarily undesirable, were taking a powder by sitting leisurely in the tray!  *There is no barrier between the tray and the tubes, so when I went to clean the tray, all of the seed still in the tubes came with it!  That was quite the sweeping session.  Think about this: if you need to clean the feeder, which you should do as needed in order to prevent mold which could kill the birds, you have to wait for all tubes to be near empty.  Otherwise, you experience what I did, a deluge of bird seed.  And if you're using different seed in each tube, you have to then separate the seeds and re-pour them into their respective tubes once you have finished cleaning the feeder.  *The baffle, which doubles as a general cover for the feeder and is necessary for its use, allowed the birds to sit atop, and collected bird "waste."  *It is too large and cumbersome to handle, especially if you use it as a hanging feeder.	-1
won't stay stuck on window.	-1
Too tight a fit on the suction cups, very hard to take off and refill. Presentation is great and the Hummer's loved it	-1
WAY too heavy to stick the suction cups to the window when first filled.  Then, after wrestling with it, and finally making it happen - it tears the suction cups off the window when trying to take it down to fill it again.  I threw it away.	-1
I followed the instruction to the T and it would not stay on the window. The bottle is very think and heavy too heavy for the purpose intended.	-1
Piece of junk! Will not stick to window, suction cups too short to touch window. So stupid	-1
Designed to fail followed instructions and it fell off the window after about 30 minutes:-(  Dumping the nectar on the deck nice mess! had to sand down the sucktion cup guards to make it work it been on the window for about 48 hours now without a problem if have to buy this a good electric belt sander might also be help full. how can companies sell this kind of junk!!	-1
Glass tank is too heavy for the suction cups. The whole unit fell and the glass tank broke	-1
I could not get it to stick to the window, too heavy	-1
I had this feeder for less than an hour before returning it.  I have dozens of hummingbirds at my location and have used a plethora of feeders over the decades.  Long story short ... I prefer glass feeders to plastic.  Non decorative vs. decorative (decorations are for humans not the birds; birds can get caught in the froufrou decorations).  This feeder, while glass, has its issues.  The glass does not screw into the base.  Like a lens to a camera, you line up the bumps with the opening and turn about 20 degrees to " lock" glass into plastic base.  One of the 2 that I purchased didn't lock properly; hence leaking.  After getting the 2nd feeder properly filled, I attempted to affix it to the window.  I knew immediately it would be a challenge. The suction cups are tucked into a protective circle of hard plastic.  I am assuming this plastic gives the holder more stability on the feeder itself, but it doesn't allow you to push down on the suction cups to create the suction necessary for a proper hold. Putting suction cups on first and then sliding feeder over them wasn't successful either.  I am certain there are a few individuals who have gotten this feeder to hold properly. However, despite my degrees in math and engineering, I am not one of them.  I get great joy out of filling and hanging the feeders. The hummingbirds actually swarm around me when I am hanging them.  You shouldn't have to spend more than a few minutes doing so in addition to wondering whether the feeder will hold or break free (and break).  Perky Pet makes wonderful products; however, in my opinion, this is not one of them.	-1
I have chosen to return this product because I don't like the nonremovable plastic bracket attached to the glass bottle.	-1
over time it always falls off the window, and drains on the ground. junk	-1
the holder broke	-1
It seems one of the suction cups, no matter how I tried, was not adhering to the patio door, fell and broke in pieces...amazon refunded, no questions! It seems it would not stick far enough to grab the window.	-1
I had bought 3 of these units and followed directions on proper mounting, i.e., wash in warm water dry use oil from your fingers to create a smoother bond between mounting bracket and window.  OK did all of that and placed them on the window 2 in shaded areas and 1 in the sun 50% of the time.  I was worried about the mounting plate so I kept my eye on them and would notice them pulling away from the window, so I would again follow directions.  Nevertheless 2 of the 3 purchased fell (due in part to the mounting and also the glass container is heavy) and shattered.  I was told to contact the vendor (BTW I bought direct not through Amazon) who just said I must not followed directions or placed them in the sun, but either way wouldn't do anything to help.  I do have a suggestion though, Perky Pet has a window mounted unit (for less money) that I have used for over 3 years now and have bought 2 from Amazon to replace this style unit.  The old saying buyer beware certainly holds true on this unit.	-1
When I saw the number of rufous hummers that showed up two weeks ago, I bought this feeder as an additional window feeder.  I liked the larger volume (14 oz- vs - 8oz) and thought it would be great considering I refill the smaller feeders every day.  The problem with this feeder is that the birds can empty the bottom of the feeder, but the nectar will not refill it.  Because it has a rather elaborate (but secure) window attachment, you need to remove it from its bracket to tip it to remove the air lock.  The smaller feeders with one suction cup need just a minor tip in place to fill the chamber and that rarely happens.  The bottle has a very narrow opening and will be difficult to fill, unlike the smaller window feeders.  This feeder looks good, is made partly of glass which I like, and the birds still come (when they can get at the nectar).  I am giving it 2 stars because it should work better.	-1
This is a good looking feeder unfortunate the container is glass and is heavy. I filled it stuck it on a window it seemed secure but when I closed the window it slid to the bottom pooped off and shattered on my deck. I would like to find another container and try again.	-1
What you can't see from the pictures is the VERY narrow opening to the bottle making this very difficult to clean. Not recommended.	-1
This is a very poor product.  The glass bottle with liquid is much too heavy for the small suction cups provided.  There was no way that I could keep them on the window.  They slide down as soon as I put them up[.  When I finally got one up, by the time I got back in the house it had fallen to the ground.	-1
This feeder lasted 1/2 hour before the suction cups gave way and the feeder fell to the ground and broke. We have multiple window mounted feeders (suet and seed) which weigh more than this one, and affixed the suction cups correctly. $20 lesson learned - do not buy products from Garden Jewels.	-1
All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects.	-1
Only buy this if you don't want to stick it onto a window with the suction cups. the plastic piece that holds the cups in place prevent the cups from gaining full contact with the glass, so I was unable to stick it to my window!! That said, I can still use it by just setting it on a shelf on my balcony. It works fine this way and the birds still come to drink. I am satisfied with that, but do not buy this if you really want to use it as it is described "suction cupped to window" The design does not allow this type of attachment.	-1
The picture is a close close close up to an area where the bamboo was magically tighter than anywhere on mine. I got it to hide my A/C from my patio and it does do this...it does look cheap, but it is likely more attractive than an A/C so Ill keep it. Others though will be really disappointed. My better half has described it as tacky.	-1
Not well made. Does not look like photo. Splintered easily and began to fray at bottom almost immediately.	-1
So cheaply made.  Yuk.	-1
Pic is a complete fraud! It's raw unfinished pieces loosely tied together. Falls apart easily. Pic color is deceptive advertising	-1
returned	-1
Despite the manufactures claims this unit makes noise.  It has two frequency levels, super high for flying insects and lower for mice.  I had it running for a few days in my kitchen on the lower setting.  My house is having foundation repair right now so is somewhat open to the elements around the basement. I wanted to keep mice setting up home this fall. One day I had a friend over for diner.  Within a few hours of being over, she came down with a headache.  Just a mild one, but enough to make her comment about it.  Later as she came into the kitchen to see what I was doing, she asked me what that high pitched sound was.  I figured she had seen the box for the PestContro machine and was pulling my leg - but she hadn't.  I went over to the box and set it to its highest frequency and she could no longer hear it, but whenever I put it into the lower setting, she would wince with pain. I noticed that I could hear a faint static noise coming from the machine when it was set to the lower frequency too, but nothing like what my friend could hear. I unplugged the device.  Within an hour her headache had gone away. I'm returning my PestContro machine.	-1
As a novice to hydroponics I thought a small, less expensive kit would be a good place to start.  Perhaps, but this was the wrong starting point.  Kit I purchased relies on aeration alone to get water and nutrients to the seedlings.  No drip irrigation was included.  Now I know you really need that.  Clay pebbles were too large to cover the seedling w/o damage and did not absorb water.  Pump was very noisy and the drain worked until you attempted to lower it into a position to drain the water, at which point it leaked.  Can not recommend this product.	-1
its a root soaker not a hydro ponic unit did not like it sent it back i could set planters in a water bowl and have same thing its not a ebb and flood system its just a tank of water with air blowing thru it	-1
Had to retun the product items was missing, the pump assembly was not shipped with the package, bottom tray was damaged in shipping.  Made very flimsy. Not a quality item even for the good price. Took my money back, will explore other options.	-1
I will only feed hummingbirds clear nectar. I ordered these pouches of clear nectar mix because they are easy and very quick to mix up to fill my feeders. Unfortunately, I received a jug of liquid red-colored nectar instead of what I ordered, hence my one-star rating for this transaction. I contacted the seller about the problem, was told they didn't have any of the item I ordered in stock and issued me a prompt refund. Since I feel strongly about how unhealthy it is to feed hummers nectar with red dye, I poured out the jug I received.	-1
The only thing in this that should be there is sugar. The rest is stuff you shouldn't be adding to your feathered friends diet. This stuff is also three times the price of baker's sugar from any old grocery store, four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve. This is a bad buy, bad for the birds and bad for your pocket.	-1
There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds.  This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.  Better yet, just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.  CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.  Sugar Only!	-1
Harmful junk food for hummingbirds!. If you love these little flying jewels, you will not feed them this toxic brew. There is no need to color the fluid red; if your feeder is red or partly red, they'll find it. They've been coming for years to my feeder, which has a red base ... it's all they need to know!. I found this online from Cornell University: "There is absolutely no reason to add any red dyes to hummingbird sugar water. After all, natural flower nectar is clear, and hummingbird feeders have colorful parts that attract hummingbird regardless of the color of the sugar water." There are also warnings published in hummingbird books: "The bottom line is that instant nectar products containing artificial coloring are at best a waste of your hard-earned money and at worst a source of disease, suffering, and premature death in hummingbirds.  Keep things safe and natural for your hummingbirds. Don't harm them by feeding them unnatural food (this stuff has preservatives, too.)	-1
Warning:  Description says "six individual packets....."  It arrives in a  two pound bag!!  Instructions say, "Mix 4 tsps of nectar to three fl. oz. of water until quantity is achieved...."  BS!!  I've used this product for years, comes in individual packets, one packet to a quart of water-done.	-1
Our hummingbirds weren't impressed with this brand, but the ANTS were. A day and a half after we put the nectar up, the feeder was caked with black ants. We accidentally fed an ant colony, which then expanded and promptly attacked our house, looking for more.  But I learned that our hummingbirds love homemade nectar, which is easy, costs a fraction of what this does, and is healthier: 1 part sugar to 4 parts hot water, cooled before serving.  In other words, 1/4 cup sugar + 1 cup clean water = hummingbird nectar. White or brown sugar is fine, but no dyes or gimmicks, just energy for hungry little birds. And that way, we can mix up small quantities as-needed, rather than leaving a box of ant bait hanging around the house.	-1
Tossed it into the garbage!  Do NOT purchase any hummingbird mix that has red dye in it as it is harmful to the hummingbirds' eggs	-1
The product is great.  The vendor sent a different version.  I recommend Perky-Pet, just not the vendor.	-1
The birds all stopped coming around. Switched brands to the one where a reviewer said "its like crack for Hummingbirds" and he was right! Can't keep it filled anymore, and its clear. There's your proof you don't need red!	-1
Our hummingbirds are to prescious, purchase the liquid instead.	-1
The hummingbirds prefer the homemade	-1
Don't bother - use the 1 cup of sugar with 4 cups of water as a guide.  This was a waste of money.	-1
Humming birds flew up, looked it over, then split. Remixed another batch, same effect. Mixed a stronger batch, no effect. Humming birds fly right past it.	-1
I had the same problem,  they came one time and didn't do anything but stick their tongue in it and left and I didn't see one any more until I emptied this and put in sugar water, they like that,  why does companies alter sugar water with all the stuff this has?  Just so they charge more,  this stuff should be dumpted somewhere the birds don't have to see it.	-1
I love Perky-Pet feeders, but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything, especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects.	-1
Hummingbirds are wonderful.  They're amazing, unique birds, but you don't need to buy anything expensive to draw them to your yard.  If you want a feeder, try this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Perky-Pet-Glass-8-Ounce-Hummingbird-Feeder/dp/B0006G51KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Perky-Pet Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder</a>&nbsp;or something similar.  I've used this type for years and you can't beat the fact that it's glass, and that you can buy new bee guards.  (They get moldy.  Don't bleach...replace.  You can get a good feeder for about ten bucks and it will last for years.  As far as food, you can do two things.  Plant plants that hummers and butterflies and bees like; or buy a gallon of distilled water and some quality sugar.  You don't need red dye, and shouldn't use it.  It's bad for the Hummers.  I was going to send a Feeder to my nieces, and when I looked at this product I was appalled to find that Perky Pet is still producing such a formula.  Their bad.  It's cheap to have hummingbirds.  And easy to make your own hummer-chow.  Don't buy this.	-1
I picked up some of this  mix last summer at a local agricultural center.  It's an old brand that is easy to find, and the price was right.  My first outing with it last summer was a total bust.  I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees.  If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back.  Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it.  At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated).  It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you.  But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on.  I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing.  (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands).  I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.  Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth.  I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me.  I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care.  I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it.  In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers.  Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc.  My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it.  It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mills-Brothers-Hummingbird-Food-3-Ounce-Packet-3-Pack/dp/B0037V001I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack</a>	-1
These prewound spools from Toro are bad.  You are better off buying line and respooling it yourself.  Actually, you are better off not buying a Toro trimmer.  The line is wound poorly and does not unwind smoothly. The line gets caught up and you have to take apart your trimmer to get it released.  Also, there are nicks in the line, so that the line breaks inside the spool.  Because of both of these problems, the bump and feed on the trimmer rarely works.  But, they whole bump and feed system on the Toro trimmers is one big design flaw.	-1
Worked fine until used 1/3 of cord then started breaking every time I used!!! What a pain!!	-1
Even at a cheap price, its not worth it, spend a few $$$ more and get a better machine	-1
This Item was advertised for 4.99. I knew it was too good to be true but I went for it anyway. I thought it was a surplus or clearance or something. However when I received a confirmation for Lip gloss and jewelry I knew something was messed up. My credit card has not been charged and the order canceled, but it is still disappointing.	-1
Unsure how the detector works. I ordered from Amazon WH and saved a few bucks for a repackage item, box was damage. I've bought other things off here the same way and all was good. I pulled the detector out and could see that it had been together before, paint worn off the adjustable part that goes to the ground piece. Also looked dirty and took a look a little harder and the small overhang on top of the screen was spotted up from being wet. The plug in for the headphones had copper corrosion growing out of it. I slid it back into the box and shipped it back. Knobs were crusty/dirty.  I will order again when I have other things to buy and will update the review.	-1
I bought this to find metal stakes buried about 1" under dirt. It is unable to find any steel buried, only on top of the soil. Waited too long to get my money back or I would.	-1
This is a total piece of Junk and it is taking for ever to get my refund.	-1
Ok to purchase just not from Amazon.	-1
Took it to the beach and it was trickier than anticipated to use and get good readings. We tested it with coins on and under the sand with mixed results. If the unit is close to the ground, and items are not more than 6-8 inches deep you should get a notification from the speaker. Headphone port is a full 1/4 inch jack as well - it's rare that folks have an adapter or full size headphone jack which was a bummer... Overall, not a great unit. Maybe there are worse units, but I would spend more and get something else if starting over...	-1
Bought this detector to start out my interest in the hobby after using a good friends AT Pro. That was way out of the price range so I settles on this. I must say this was the worst decision. From the start I experienced problems such as falsing often and the lack of detectors functions made it less fun to do. I chalked up my loss and did a lot of research not yet ready to drop the hobby. I spent a little bit more money and bought a new detector. Ever since I have been absolutely hooked. I have dug silver gold and a handful of jewelry! Here is the link to the other detector. Don't let a bad detector ruin your interest in such a great hobby. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KURXKY?ie=UTF8&tag=jrsqe-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B001KURXKY	-1
Just received this and I am not an expert in metal detectors but this seems like a very cheap product. The package did seem to get damaged a little, but only on the top (the handles side) and no permanent damage seems to have been done. Didn't realize this takes 9v batteries, so have not completely powered this on yet. Hope it works well and lasts a while. Will update this rating after use and if it actually works and holds up at all after use. First opinion though is its pretty cheap	-1
I gave it 2 stars because it did find some coins, but every blind dog finds a bone every once in a while. The Timerange isn't worth the price they have it at, much less the original price. It give false all the time and "grounding" the detector works 1 out of 10 times. The owners manual sucks as much as the machine itself. Spend more money to save some money. This ain't the one.  Ps... Don't even think about bringing this machine to a beach you will get more false readings the never before especially a wet sand. You will want to drown yourself way before you get a good reading.	-1
Bought to Locate Sprinkler Solenoids and wiring. Did not help at all. Sent Back within 30 minutes of putting together.	-1
Stopped working after only using it once.	-1
Product did not work. Cheaply made. Poor quality.	-1
I bought this metal detector to upgrade from a cheaper one. My old one was doing its job great, but I just wanted to be able to have a screen on the detector to make digging easier. I got this baby out of the box and started swinging away. I got many false signals, and ghosting occured a lot. Also, targets were always 5-6 inches to the left or right of where it was telling me. After the first day, I went right back to my old detector, which is a little bit more expensive but works twice as better! Stay away from this detector, just a waste of money.  Here is the link to the detector that I have been using for years, and will continue to use. I have found coins and jewelry with  this, and nothing but garbage, a sore back and a bitter taste in my mouth with the Bounty Hunter Tracker IV https://www.amazon.com/Garrett-Ace-200-Metal-Detector/dp/B01DT5IFPY/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=jrsqe-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=0c8d3b488779d524a6c57f0907d15722&creativeASIN=B01DT5IFPY	-1
I couldn't get the thing to do what it was supposed to do.  It just seemed broken.  Had a buddy try it too and he agreed.	-1
Unfortunately I found a much better price on this metal detector. I returned the metal detector and ordered the Garrett 350.	-1
This product is a waste of your money it gives off nothing but false readings .Got this for the grand kids now I have more holes then a gopher farm. False readings save your money.	-1
Purchased item from Amazon seller  " etailz " and the item was broken. The electronic insert was broken and did not emit a buzzing sound which is what noise repels the underground varmints.	-1
Did not work for us.  Our front yard is truly tiny and we used two of these.  Did not work.  We ended up using Nature's MACE Mole Repellent-5lb Shaker Granular product.	-1
I had two of these and the moles dug up all around them. It does not work and may even attract them.	-1
Returned	-1
I have an active mole trail going two inches from this device.  These vibrating chasers do not work; the audible ones that beep every 30 seconds work much better, they are solar powered and much cheaper.  The only downside is they only last about 4-5 months.	-1
I had been using the eletronic verion but this was advertidsed with more range so i bought two.  i wish i had a picture the mole dug right up to it and around it!	-1
Total waste of time, money and batteries.	-1
Dont bother! They are sleeping right next to it. I have voles and no way does this chase anything away! Jokes on me. haha	-1
On paper they might work, but in reality they seem to attract the moles. This one does have alternating frequencies and I can hear them from several feet away, but I don't think anyone told the moles to flee when they hear these. These mole chasing devices seem to attract more moles than they chase	-1
Just moves them around the yard.  Better off just buying traps and eradicating them.	-1
Save your money, this doesn't work . . . . at least not in NE Florida soil. Get a cat, it will be more effective.	-1
After 6 weeks of use the moles appear to like this device.  Fresh mounds less than 3 feet away.  I mash them down and they reappear. I even saturated the soil to make sure the vibrations are being transmitted through the ground.  In fact, the greatest amount of mole activity in my lawn happens to be within a 30 foot radius of this item.	-1
After having a. couple hundred pounds of sweet potatoes eaten I ordered 2 of these. I have about 1600 sq.feet and should have been overkill/they both operate properly/they loved it/ trapped probably  20/even saw a couple when digging up the potatoes/don,t waste your money	-1
This product seemed like a very good idea.  Annoy the moles and/or gophers and chase them away.  I read the reviews on here with people saying "no, you didn't wait long enough, etc" and so I figured I would give it a shot.  A company wouldn't produce a product that is entirely worthless right?  Wrong....  I have two of these - the one with the motor inside (the vibrasonic) and also the solid state one (the original one I believe).  The vibrasonic one is much louder than the electronic (solid state) model.  The electronic one you can hardly hear, but the vibrasonic is so loud that it makes you and your family consider moving out! :-)  As far as the moles and/or gophers, it doesn't phase them in the least.  I had a mole in my yard for weeks and this did nothing.  The mole happily went on about his business - digging up my yard, etc.  In fact, I put two of these in my yard (the original version and the vibrasonic version), only about 20 feet apart.  Keep in mind, my side yard (where the mole was) is only about 40 feet by 20 feet total, so we aren't talking about a large area.  Still, it didn't have any impact on the mole whatsoever.  He dug holes right near both of them and contrary to the info from the company, it has nothing to do with them being territorial, etc.  They just don't pay any attention to it.  I finally gave up on these silly things and bought a traditional mole trap that runs spikes into the side of the mole.  In one case, I just waited around until the mole went past in a tunnel near the surface and whacked him in the head with a trowel I had sitting nearby.  That made short work of him.  When you factor up the cost of these units, plus the cost of expensive D batteries that they go through, you can buy yourself quite a few gopher/mole traps.  The metal kind that spring shut work great; I called my dad and he said he has been using them for over 40 years and they never fail.  That's good enough for me.  Save your money on this product - it just does not work.  The only solution is to kill the mole and throw his body into the trash.  That works 100% of the time.	-1
Kindly read the other negative reviews before ordering this item. NO way of folding the handle for transport. NO height adjustment on handle. NO padding on handle, just plain black metal. NO reset button on controller in case of overheating of motor with attendant shutdown. Blows fuse in house electric service panel, so you have to trek back to house to restore power. NO way of securely attaching the handle to the body. NO way of getting close to any wall, fencepost etc with the frontwheels extending WAY out from front of  mower, youhave to mow that remainder of vegetation essentially with the mower parallel to the obstruction. Only one of my 14 gauge extension cords could be plugged in since the receptacle on the mower is undersized. There is a very good reason to require 14 gauge wire for powerdelivery but the plug has to be made large enough to fit ALL connectors regardless of manufacturer of the extension cord. The customer service-- when one finally gets connected-- has only one preprogrammed answer/solution: " I will need to refer you to an authorized service center . May I have your Zip code to search for one?" The mower was delivered today, assembled today and a return label was received today	-1
If it cant cut in wet grass, what do you do in late summer when the morning dew doesnt dry up because the days aren't as hot? Im afraid that, like my Push Reel mower, it'll be another waste of money. I bought that but found out that if i don't cut my lawn every two days or so, its too tall for it to cut (pushes the grass over instead of cutting) so I have been using the good old craftsman gas mower again.. what happens if your lawn is damp? will it cut it or will you get shocked? all my plugs are GFI so they would "POP" before I died or anything...I hope..lol Thanks!	-1
they don't work	-1
I wish this one had worked!  I installed it last fall when activity started and it worked....  I went out to check it again as there was still mole activity and it wasn't working.  So I thought the batteries had died.  Nope.  Put in new batteries and it still won't work.  Very annoying as I do think these work when operational but very frustrating that it breaks so easily!	-1
Doesn't seem to be working , I purchased four of these and I don't think they are working at all	-1
I've had this for some time now and I've been using this and an oil repellant to try and drive my gofer away. Still not luck. I think the sound this thing makes annoys me more than it does him. I don't have a very big yard so there is no reason why this shouldn't be working.	-1
After a couple of days the voles were gone and I was doing a happy dance. Then a week or two later they were back, tunneling right by this mole chaser.  Really, the only thing that works is a physical barrier. I'll use these till the batteries die, but I've bought 50 ft of hardware cloth to make cages for next year's garden.	-1
I think if a mole could laugh at me for buying this, I would have a yard full of moles laughing.  I bought three for my tiny yard, placed according to instructions, and waited. The number of tunnels has increased exponentially over the last few months. I replaced the batteries, doesn't matter.  I had to hire an exterminator things are so bad.	-1
Did not work for me.  Had installed in a very isolated flower bed. Mole came back multiple times over a period of months. These may work for some people, but none of the ones I bought did any good.	-1
Maybe it the local moles are smarter in some areas. Not sure, but have two of these in a small-ish area. Fresh batteries. It is beeping away and the moles are unfazed. In fact, one has new, fresh paths right next to it as if the mole wanted to know what it was. Has had absolutely no effect on the little buggers.  Time to go old testament on them ...	-1
Just junk. ..gophers tore up my lawn	-1
junk	-1
Ordered 3, one did not work correctly so I contacted P3 by email. They told me they would not send me a replacement but I could buy a new one with the phone number they provided in email. Buy Sweeney mole chaser because they replace product immediately if there is a problem. P3 sucks! And should not be carried by Amazon!	-1
To be sure I had coverage I installed three in our averaged size front yard.  It seems like they are attracting moles!	-1
Something is still burrowing into my chicken run at night. Isn't working for me.	-1
a very big joke. Do Not buy these. go to any pest control website and they will confirm that these do not work	-1
Looks like a good quality device. Directions were easy to follow. Unfortunately it beeped once and never more. So back it went.	-1
Ordered 2 units.  One of the two was an out-of-box failure.  Returned it and the replacement is still working.  However the second unit only worked about 3 weeks and quit (and yes, I tested for battery failure).  Can't say if moles and gophers are chased off.  They are just now beginning to be really active.	-1
Don't waste your money.  Buy a trap, it is the only way.  It is an ongoing problem because moles like earthworms as well as grubs.  You can solve the grub problem.	-1
No noticeable difference after using.  I don't even know if it's still running.  I placed a planter over top of it to keep it safe and still have moles all over the place.	-1
Waste of money and d cell batteries. Product is absolute waste of time and MONEY. Amazon should include a consumer report on such crap. I wouldn't recomment this crap to anyone  IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I bought 2 of these for a fairly small front yard, about 50ft by 50ft.  Installed the first one 2 weeks ago.  The moles built a new outlet about 12 ft from the mole chaser.  I then installed the second one about 25 ft from the first one last weekend.  The moles built another outlet about 2ft from their other hole and about half way between the 2 mole chasers.  I am going to leave them in operation to see if they will drive the moles off.  Right now, I am skeptical that the mole chasers will do any better than they have done so far.	-1
I purchased several for my first house and I thought they chased the moles to the neighbors yards.  On my second house it had no effect and the moles even dug around it and even dug up a couple.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I ordered two.  One was DOA. Other is in the ground and seems to be doing an adequate job, but it could be that they are flushing the gophers out for my cat, who nailed 3 in one night. "good boy!" I'd like to give this more time and will do follow up in a month.	-1
Nice and lightweight are  about the only thing I can say are positive about this cheaply made mower.  Doesn't do a very good job on thick bladed grass or on dense leaves.  Mowing heights are nice and easy to engage and it is easy to push.  My biggest problem is that if you hit anything such as a limb, it can throw the entire mowing deck out of balance.  This is what happened to mine.  I tried my best to fix it.  I replaced the blade and a couple other parts on under the mower, but to no avail.  After that the motor burned out, it went in the trash.  I really wanted to like this mower, but it is just too cheap to recommend.  Not Recommended!	-1
Update July 07, 2013:  Just slightly under a year since it has been in service, the motor has mostly burned out.  It was on a proper extension cord, so it wasn't a power issue. I keep the lawn regularly cut, so I wasn't straining the motor.  It just gave me a burning smell and puttered out mid-lawn.  Update December 2012: It is working great after its first season of mowing and after mulching fall leaves. I've had to replace the blade due to something completely my own fault. It was very easy, took less than five minutes.  --- Original Review ---  I am pleased with the mower, but here are some instances where I suggest that this mower might not be appropriate for others:  You... 1) let your grass get high between cuttings. The motor is not powerful and strains with tall or damp grass. 2) have trees or delicate plants situated within your lawn, not at the edges. Doing the cord dance and trying to avoid "cording" hastas is not productive. 3) do not have an electric outlet within 100 feet of the furthest point of your lawn. 4) prefer to finish cutting the lawn as quickly as possible. An 18 inch cutting path is relatively narrow, resulting in multiple passes.  This receives four out of five stars for the poor instructions and initial set-up procedure.  You're supposed to add two little plastic plugs that are on rings onto the lower handle bars before snapping them into the mower. Both of them ended up falling inside the mower housing as I was trying to get them attached. They evidently serve no critical purpose.	-1
Don't be fooled by the sturdy look of this product. Pieces fit loosly together and rust began appearing after about 12 weeks of use. If I had to do it all over again, I definately wouldn't stop looking here.	-1
We purchased this cover because of the quality, durability and guarantee claims. This cover last 7 months then fell apart the manufacturer is non responsive. This is good temporary cover, but for the money look elsewhere.	-1
This does not help the pool to stay warm I have solar heater and this and pool is cold was a waste of money I would not recommend this	-1
This piece of junk came apart under the sun and did NOT perform as I wanted The wind blew all the little circles around the yard and I had to throw it out after one season Don't waste you money on this product!	-1
Well I don't know if I like this product or not. What I received was a plain brown box from Amazon. Inside the box was a roll up sheet of bubble wrap. Ummm...that's it. No product packaging. No instructions. Nothing but a big sheet of blue bubble wrap. My main question is WHICH SIDE IS UP? Does it matter which side faces the water? Nice little sheet of paper that stated this information would be nice. I know I can find the information I need by searching the internet. The point is I shouldn't have to do that, it should be included with the product I paid money for. Disappointed in Amazon. UPDATED: Well, as everyone else says, it does indeed warm the top inch or two of the water. I guess that is better than nothing?	-1
Cheap thin, will be surprised if it lasts one season.  Hard to roll up since not rigid at all like previous covers I had bought.	-1
This cover caused me sooo much grief. It only lasted 1 season then the little bubbles flaked off!!! What a mess!	-1
I ordered a pool cover for an in ground rectangle pool I got a cover for an oval pool not to big of deal just not what I ordered don't fit my pool very well	-1
Edit 2016 : last one reviewed did last 2 years and i needed a new one - bought the identical product on Amazon but it is not the same quality.  The one i just received was thinner, had a burn hole in one of the seams and was unfinished at one end where cutting to an oval was unfinished.  This one won't last 5 minutes in the sun.  Returned to Amazon.  Not easy to repack these obviously.  2014 : Brought the temperature up big style. Even if it lasts 2 years its worth it.  And saves water. Cut it yourself - its not that hard.	-1
Didn't keep the water warm at all, even on sunny days--did make a good cover to catch the Pine needles--wouldn't recommend this cover if you are looking to warm up your pool water.	-1
This ground cloth began to disintegrate after 3 weeks in the sun.  It's useless and I would like a refund.  The vinyl tarp I got at the dollar store for 6.00 for the sitting area is holding up well in the same conditions.  And it's SUN damage as no chemicals or water have been splashed on the pad. This is an adults pool.  I cannot return it because it's UNDER the pool, I also cannot replace it till we take the pool down for winter.  Definitely not worth the 19.99.	-1
Is this thing a joke? Cloth? LOL.  It is literally a tarp. Yes a Tarp like the one you buy at your local hardware store to cover your boat or things from the rain.	-1
lol.  its just your standard blue tarp with no gromits.  Just buy a tarp for 5$	-1
Very disappointed it is tissue paper thin,you could go to lowes and buy a paint tarp for $ 6.00 and done as well.	-1
Not what I expected, it is far too thin for my liking!  This is supposed to offer protection from the stuff poking on the ground. I would have done better buying a standard tarp or two	-1
Nothing more than a cheap tarp I can buy at wal mart for 3 bucks	-1
good	-1
Better off buying a tarp from hardware.store	-1
I could have saved myself a little bit of money and just used the plastic tarp I had in the house, or a couple of old blankets we had laying around like we used last year, my back yard has a lot of tiny pebbles in it, so I was looking for something that had a Little cushion it, definitely not a ground cover the thickness of a trash bag.	-1
Too big , extends too much	-1
I bought two of these thinking I might need the extra thickness since I did not know how thick the pool liner itself would be and I was setting it up on an area of pea-gravel. I only used one and that part was fine but any portion of the cover that was exposed was rotted by the sun and water from the pool and rain. Even though it is a reasonable priced item, it's too much for the quality. A person would be money ahead by getting ground cover material like landscapers use which is heavier and not prone to rot.	-1
It is way too thin. I did ad a heavy duty tarp to have on top of it. Also It is too small.	-1
I should have read the reviews but I was in a hurry, and just bought it. It came yesterday and it is so cheap. You can buy the cheapest tarp at walmart and it will be about the same. It's too big for the 12 foot pool too. Wish I had just run across the street instead of waiting on shipping.	-1
I purchased these at my local Orange home improvements store. Fiskars was the only brand available and I though that by getting their top of the line, heavy duty model, I would be okay. Nope.  Playing with them in the store and for the initial 10 minutes of cutting all was good. The 3x power gear mechanism worked well and they cut like a charm. At around the 10 minute mark, one of the blades 'nicked' on a branch, bending the cutting blade inwards towards the other in nearly the center of the shears. Now it catches on that nick and won't close. Their done. They promote them as Titanium, but the reality is that it is a marketing gimick to hamper rust. They are made of cheap aluminum and poorly designed. The sad thing is that the same thing happened to me with another set of Fiskars shears a couple of years ago, but I didn't think it was this model and hoped that it was a fluke. It was not.  Stay away from these, they are a waste of money. We weren't trying to cut through inch thick limbs, just some hedges. These are way too flimsy for a serious (or any) gardener. I'll stick with the manaul Black & Decker (similar to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corona-Forged-Hedge-Shear/dp/B00004R9YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corona Forged Hedge Shear</a>. They may rust, but it holds up and cuts well, even though a little more effort may be required.  UPDATE: 11/25/2014 - Fiskars was kind enough to send me a replacement set of shears. This one hasn't had the issue yet, but I'll withhold final judgement for a while more.  ~ Kort	-1
The blade is nicked after one small bush trimming, made of butter or bad pair ?  Trying a second pair out, we will see, may have to go to another brand, and they are more expensive than others WHY? Lasted a year dull, and damaged..	-1
Cheap price, but also cheap quality.  Hardly made any sound even with decent wind outside.  The central wood piece was not centered with the aluminum sound tubes.  I would not recommend it.	-1
clearly this is not a good chime. when the wind blows, you can BARELY HERE the tones, in fact almost no tones. do not waste your money on this one. it is junk. bill perreault	-1
I retired from teaching about a month ago, and I bought this wind chime to hang in my garden to remind me of the melodic tones of the children I have worked with for the past 35+ years.  I looked forward to relaxing, gardening, reading- all those things that make for a peaceful retirement.  I thought the sound of this wind chime was all that.  It sounded beautiful on-line and IN THE HOUSE, but I just put it outside and 3 hours later it is in pieces.  What is with WIND CHIMES not holding up in the wind?!  I waited to hang this chime until I established my retirement perennial garden, and then I held off again because we were to have a weekend storm.  Finally, peace prevailed in the beautiful, hot Appalachian Plateau, but this wind chime did not hold up its part of the experience.  Now I am out of compliance and will only get partial credit.  So, would I recommend Woodstock chimes...NO NO! NO!  UPDATE:  I called Amazon and explained my concern and was sent a return mailing slip, and I will get a refund.  Amazon came through; they did their part.  It is now up to Woodstock to build a better wind chime.  For now, I am looking at other vendors and hope to find a quality chime.	-1
it worked for 3 months only. Very expensive to be buying every 3 months.	-1
Don't waste your money.  Even in very mild year-round weather it doesn't hold up.  I agree that a trash bag would be better, and you can buy a lot of trash bags for $24.99!	-1
Sad to say, we had this cover on our new grill, for one week, then we had a below zero degree night, and when I went to take it off the grill, it just crumbled. Suffice to say, I would not recommend this this cover for cold climates. My grill now stands naked.	-1
We purchased this because it was a perfect fit for the Char-Broil grill that we got around the same time. We liked it a lot during the time that it stayed intact. It was a good fit, and stayed in place well on the Char-Broil grill. But after less than a year, the cover became brittle and started getting tears in it. At the price point that we got it for, perhaps that is an acceptable life expectancy for a grill cover that is outside year round, but we'd really prefer something that could last longer.	-1
This cover is terrible. The person who said you'd be better off throwing a Hefty bag over the grill was spot on.	-1
Waaaay too thin. Mine ripped  at a seam after one use.	-1
It fits fine on Char Broil tru infrared BBQ pit, but the material is very thin and frankly is disappointing quality. Char broil should consider that consumers see this cover and how thin and flimsy it is and it leaves a thought that there pits have the same quality in them. Char Broil should be embarrassed .	-1
This cover is so thin it blows off the grill and the first time we put it on the grill it tore. Crappy and too thin !!	-1
The cover fits but has a terrible odor. Very strong repulsive chemical odor that does not seem to go away even out doors and after a week. Strong enough to drive you off your patio. Maybe that is why it is so cheap in price. Don't understand why Amazon allows a product like this to be sold on their site.	-1
Ripped first year and I had to throw it away.	-1
impulse buy----- for my "New Grill" LOVE THE GRILL!- but the cover is not neccessary- at all!	-1
I am tempted to replace it with a heavy duty trash bag. The only reason I gave it two stars is it lasted about 12 months.	-1
I had to buy one of these about every 5-6 months.  If it is exposed to the sun, the plastic cover gets "crispy" on top, splits open, disintegrates and then is no good at all.  A canvas tarp would work better.  Not worth it unless you like buying a new one in 6 months.	-1
Had to return this because it blocked the view of the birds when viewed from the side.  The only way you'd be able to see the birds is head on so I don't like the design.	-1
It looks and feels great but to heavy to hang on my deck. would purchase again if I can find better place for it	-1
Not often that I give a 1 star but after testing for 2 months I have to say its absolutely worthless as a bird feeder. Not one bird will go near this thing, not real sure what the problem is but they just will not use it, hornets on the other hand love it and have tried to build nests on it three times in 2 months. Really not happy.	-1
This feeder may stop a squirrel, but it is like an ugly box hanging in the trees.  I returned it.	-1
This is my second Homestead squirrel stop bird feeder. We had to replace one that came with the house (we've lived here 14 years, and the feeder was here when we bought the house ~ attached to the same post, same spot ~ and we could tell it was here looooong before we came!). The one that came with the house was amazing! Heavy duty, a bit of a different design (much better than this design). We had to buy a new one because bears have recently taken to our area and pretty much demolished the old one.  It didn't take very long for the squirrels to figure out how to get into this. There appears to be a space between the "hood" and where the feeder connects, and they can hang and reach in, and grab the food. Having the spring adjustment on the lightest possible setting also does not deter them from getting the seed! They, once again, hang, and take one paw, and just reach into the opening/tray where the seeds are, and pick up pawfuls (is that a word?) of seed and eat while they are hanging on by their rear feet. Since they are not tripping the closing element, it doesn't matter that it's even THERE! They are suspended and can just reach right in. Terrible design flaw with this new Homestead. And with all their clawing and scratching, it took no time (I'm talking within a day or two from the squirrels finding this) for the paint to be worn/chipped/scratched off. Right down to the cheap metal it's made from. It's already starting to rust.  I feed exclusively black oil sunflower seed (I think that's another reason the bear liked the seed. They don't bother other feeders with regular seed mix). The only saving grace with this feeder is that there isn't a huge mess from seed spilling/tipping when the squirrels eat. I guess if I have to deal with the squirrels, I'd rather it be neat eating. But still. I don't really want to deal with them at all. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this Homestead feeder.	-1
The feeder is about 2 months old and showing signs of rust.  The gate that shuts the feed chute keeps bending from the squirrels hanging on it.  For the money paid the quality is very poor.	-1
This feeder will be rusted to a million pieces in high hunidity like Florida.  Plus the squirrels figure out, very fast, that if they stay on top and reach over the front, they can get the food out.  Which they throw all over the ground and make a real mess.  It is easier to just throw the seed on the ground and let the birds eat off the ground.	-1
This is not actually a review of the feeder itself.  I had owned one before and liked it, so I thought I knew what to expect.  I ordered this feeder but what I got was a bag of seed, not the feeder, just an 8 lb bag of bird seed.  I called and complained.  They told me to keep the seed and credited my account for what I had paid.  I never got the feeder.	-1
Updating my review from 5 stars to 1.  Very sad.  I purchased this feeder June 22, 2016.  I thought the birds were eating a lot but just found out today that the new feeder is leaking the nectar from the bottom.  What a waste and disappointment.  Due to the time frame I am unable to exchange or return.	-1
I have had this feeder up for about 3+ weeks and the hummingbirds will not feed from it.  It is hanging next to another feeder (as instructed on the Internet for new feeders) and the hummingbirds always go to the other feeder.  I have yet to see a hummer stop at this feeder and the feeder sits outside my sliding glass door on my deck.  I chose this feeder because it was bee resistant because I have problems with the bees on my other feeder (unless I keep cooking oil on the yellow flowers).  I wasted my money on it and, in the future, will stick with the plain feeders.  The hummingbirds like those the best.  I wanted something a little more attractive, but the hummingbirds don't care.	-1
The feeder was evidently designed by a fashion designer rather than someone who knew anything about hummingbirds.  The flowerets stick up so high that there is a danger of breaking them off each and every time you remove the feed container.  THEN there is the minor detail of the flowerets being the wrong color and the birds not being able to find the food.  The hummers would buzz the feeder and look all around it, but could not locate the feeding ports.  Fortunately for us, the wife had the bottom of an old and cheap feeder that just fit the threads on the container.  Its a red bottom with flat yellow flowerets, but the birds can find the food and are regularly feeding on it.  The  Woodlink NAH6 Audubon Glass Mini Lantern Hummingbird Feeder  is a much better buy.  I bought both, just to give the wife some variety in the feeders and the birds are feeding from it more than any other feeder we have.	-1
I am sorry to say my little hummingbirds didn't like it! They would fly around it as if they were looking for the feeder and then fly off.  I liked the way it looked, but it doesn't matter if they won't use it, disappointing.  I ordered another feeder I have used in the past and they love it and are back filling themselves like they used to.	-1
It is strange that the feeder instructions urges one to use Cardinal food--sunflower seeds--when I don't believe it is large enough for a Cardinal to land on.  "My" Cardinals  have eaten the spillings from Chickadees but haven't ventured to try to land on such a tiny ledge.  It is easy to fill and looks good.  Our local squirrel has leaped upon it but slid off as it is apparently too small for it too.  Even the Chickadees can barely keep their balance.; they pluck the seeds and then eat them off the ground.	-1
Very thin "see through" canopy material. No "aluminized" canopy backing to block UV rays.	-1

One would think that a flag kit would be designed for outdoor use, but not this one. The three-piece pole turns out to be thinly-plated steel that has rusted along its entire length in less than a week of outdoor use.  The eagle at the top turns out to be a...plastic thing that when inserted in the top spins around in the wind...	-1
Like is all rusty after 2 months.....it is a less than 1 season item	-1
The pole is rusting already and looks Sergio. I need to replace after only a few weeks	-1
Love the stars and stripes but the poles are junk. I had to replace the two piece pole with a one piece. The two piece system kept coming apart.	-1
Cheap and poor quality junk	-1
The flagpole is made of very cheap and flimsy metal and it can easily bend or even brake! Total junk!	-1
I was not pleased with this product.  The flag had loose threads hanging everywhere, and the mounting bracket is made in China.....c'mon guys this is flag proclaiming your pride in the USA and part of it's made in China....pretty bad.	-1
This is my 3rd toro blower. My first one lasted about 3 years. The second one, a year and a half. This one burned up in less than 6 months, using it less than once a week. Great while they work... There is one design flaw in terms of sucking things up: the "scoop"is a two piece scoop and it is designed so where the two pieces go together it makes a nice lip for stuff to snag on and get stuck.	-1
Like others have said, the rheostat dial goes out quickly. I resorted to using the plug to turn the power on and off; however, the motor vibrations keep moving the rheostat dial. Eventually, the small rheostat movements caused my switch to go out.  I've owned this for 4 years blowing very light leaf and grass clipping, and to clean out gutters.  I've gone to Toro's website to order a new rheostat dial, and I found that it is not available in their parts listing. What a surprise! Even Toro knows it is bad, and refuses to sell any more of them! So why didn't Toro contact me with a recall notice on this? That was why I sent in my registration card.  More details: The 220 MPH wind this unit makes is great unless you are trying to push a large pile of leaves. The air current is very tight and the overall volume of air moved is still small, so it only punches a hole exactly where you are blowing without moving the pile of leaves. As a result, I don't use this to blow leaves in the yard. It will blow leaves off the driveway or sidewalk just fine, but keep it out of the yard.  For my next blower, I'll get a gas version. Being tied to that chord is a real hassle!	-1
My old Ryobi finally bit the dust after 5 years so I did the research and found many recommending Toro 51598. Consumer Reports rated this at the top. Unfortunately I have been very frustrated with this model. Blowing is just OK. Vacuuming is terrible and the angle of the tube is very awkward. Switching back and forth between the two is frustrating requiring a minor "reconstruction" of the unit. Slinging the bag over the shoulder is also awkward. You've got a lot of hardware swinging around and if you switch between blow and vac, you've got extra parts you need to cart around. I got so frustrated with this unit after 4 months that I am giving it away. I just got my new Troy-Bilt Quickshift Blower-Vac (TB125QS) and I could not be happier. My old Ryobi had a problem with the zipper on the bag but this very similar unit by Troy-Bilt has a redesigned bag. It was so powerful in vac mode it felt like it got stuck on the lawn. It almost sucked the shoes off my feet. I suggest skipping the Toro and getting the Troy-Bilt. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.	-1
I purchased this leaf blower/vacuum in Dec 2002.  I used in moderately that year and in the fall of 2003.  It burned out today, Nov. 18th.  I have three Toro products - this one, a gas powered lawn mower, and a cordless electric string trimmer.  The leaf blower and lawn mower have been unreliable.  The string trimmer is only a year old, so the jury is still out.  The bottom line is that I don't intend to by Toro products again.	-1
I just don't like it.	-1
more junk	-1
3/3 failed within a few months, all in different ways. The end cap blows off, or the plastic explodes and you can't fix it. Waste of money and time.	-1
Pick a different one! If you have it water when you aren't watching it, like at night, you don't realize that it is sticking in one position until your lawn shouts HELP! I knew for the price it wouldn't be anything special but I did hope to get one season out of it. NOT! Also it leaves lines in the lawn between spray heads so you have to move it left and right a foot now and then to even get something like even coverage.	-1
This is very cheaply made and stops working after four or five uses.	-1
The sprinkler literally blew apart the first time I used it.  Cheap construction	-1
very easy to break, buy a medal base	-1
Falls apart easily.	-1
The black plastic stem that connects the hose to the sprinkler is fairly weak and broke after a couple months of use. They should have made that key component more sturdy and strong. Once that breaks the sprinkler is worthless.	-1
I have water leaking at the seal.  I didn't want to water just the base where it attaches; I wanted it to spray water in the pattern shown.	-1
Altho  the  sprinkler  works  okay ,  figuring  out  the  setting  via  that  yellow  knob  is  Not  very  straight  forward . After  prolonged  experimentation ,  I  found  a  setting  that  would  work  for  a  frequent  location  but  will  not  move  it  to  some  where else  that  requires  a  different  setting . Too  much  aggravation  and  waste  of  time  to  reset  it . There  are  other  sprinklers  that  have  better  setting  adjustments .  This  is  a product  update :  Altho this sprinkler was carefully  carried between 2 locations ,  it self exploded  about 5 minutes into  running .  It  was almost a month old . Just  wondering if all Melnor  is  disposable /  dollar store grade  stuff ?  ( but priced a lot higher than dollar store ! )	-1
These are very poorly constructed. Maybe it's the hot TX sun, but all five I purchased broke within just a few uses.  The plastic is cheap and split apart or broken. Not abused as I set them up and left them.  Used no more than 10 times each.  May be good in a cooler climate, but definitely not a product for use in the hot sun.	-1
This sprinkler worked well for two weeks, giving a nice even flow of water. After that, the plastic connector piece to the hose broke off. Based on this experience, I would not buy it again. If you do buy it, be careful with the connection to the hose.	-1
These last a little longer than other oscillating sprinklers made by this manufacturer, but they too will quickly start hanging up. They are better made that the all plastic (green) ones, but have the same unreliable mechanism. If you seek frustration this is the way to go!	-1
I bought this sprinkler to water the yard when the drought started in Florida. At first, this worked like a charm but for some reason now it only goes halfway across then goes back and when it goes back, it goes so far over that it in spraying into the ground directly. I have tried taking the thing apart because it seems that the motor has been turned too far back somehow but I have yet to figure out how to position it back to the original position. So for right now it is only watering halfway across the area it is supposed to water. and yes, i have the yellow tabs set to full area coverage. This sprinkler is so simple to use, I grew up using this exact kind as a kid but it did not come with instructions, only what is on the back of the box, which is very limited to a diagram explaining its features.	-1
Sticking and barely working after less than a year, disappointed in the quality.	-1
Stopped oscillating after a couple of weeks	-1
I thought if I spent more, I'd get more. I was wrong this time. This sprinkler is cheaply made  doesn't oscillate properly and is extremely flimsy. Way too much money for such a piece of junk. The manufacturer should be ashamed. And to those out there considering this sprinkler: DON'T DO IT!!!!! You WILL regret it!	-1
sent back two of them, they just don't work	-1
This is the second sprinkler that I have had. It has the exact same problem that the one I returned had. Unless you have high-pressure water all the way on the arm will swing to the lowest position and hang up. This thing is absolutely useless, it is Junk stay away.	-1
I'm not happy with this product. Worked great about a year. Last year I had some problems but now it is not oscillating well at all and it doesn't seem to matter how I adjust it. Wish I knew of a better one to replace it with.	-1
Stopped oscillating after one season.	-1
Too cheaply made.	-1
Well, it started out working fine. However, now it doesn't oscillate correctly. It only waters one way no matter how I adjust it. :(	-1
It started working great then aftwr a few weeks only 1 side works. I was disappointed.	-1
This worked *great* for 2 weeks, then it no longer worked. The mechanism got stuck, and now it is a stationary sprinkler. Bummer.	-1
used it today for the first time will not ocilate properly cant adjust	-1
Failed	-1
This sprinkler's adjustment is faulty. It will not stay where you place it. So, if you are like me and you have different zones setup, this one will fail to stay with the setting you place. Contacting customer service yielded no reply. I will never buy Melnor again .	-1
This was delivered April 26 and as of yesterday May 11, it no longer works properly.  At first I loved it.  It did a nice job of watering my vegatable garden but now I cannot get it to oscillate any more. It just sprays in one directions only.  Now I have to find another one to replace. This one.  Waste of money for only 16 days of use.	-1
I did not buy this on Amazon but I did get 5 of them from a local store.  At first they seemed heavy and I liked the metal frame vs. the plastic frames on the others in the price range.  For most of the first summer they all worked fine.  Beginning the second summer they began to stop oscillating and started ending up in the garbage.  This is the third year and I just threw away the last one.	-1
Melnor sprinklers break in less than one season. I've owned three different types. Total crap. Oscillation breaks. Don't waste your money.	-1
I have several styles of Melnor's oscillating sprinkles. Total crap. Seriously. They stop oscillating in just a few uses. Don't waste your money or your water.	-1
I thought the thing would last forever because of the name brand but a part broke inside the housing after about three weeks and that was that.	-1
Keep the box and receipts - I have had to return 3 of these.  Exterior is metal but internal gears must be made out of cheapo plastic because mine don't oscillate after a while - lousy design.	-1
I have 2 of these, probably bought at different times from local hardware store. The sturdy looking construction drew me in. The plastic oscillation assembly is actually pretty robust looking, but innards are apparently not up to snuff.  One of them continues to work fine, but the other only travels in one direction and fails to rotate back after reaching the arc limiter.	-1
I bought this sprinkler at Home Depot and used it a few times last year (2011).  It pluged and then stopped moving.  This is really junk! Why can't industry make a good, reliable sprinkler?  For that matter, why does most products now only last a short time?	-1
I've bought three of these 360M's and two of them failed after I made the fatal mistake of touching the area limiter controls--one of them after using it 4 times! The only one I have that is still working is on its 3rd season now, and I'm sure that's because I've never so much as looked hard at the controls.  Don't buy this sprinkler! If you already have one and it's working, don't touch the controls!	-1
It looks good, feels ok, but now the handle and spade broke into two pieces when weeding - unbelievable! I'll avoid Fiskars in the future.	-1
Too heavy.	-1
An ok garden bag but too short for efficient leaf raking use.	-1
I started a project in my backyard where I had two of these to help separate stuff.  They have been outside for 4 months now... and the handles have disintegrated.... I mean literally disintegrated.  I went to move the container over about 10', and the handle just fell apart in my hand.  I had about 5lbs of stuff in the container... so nothing too heavy.  I know that some may say that you shouldn't leave these outside for that long... and I admit that I should have known better... but I just didn't think it would affect them that badly.	-1
The blade just pushed to one side the first time I tried to use it.	-1
Cheap quality.  Expected more from Fiskars.	-1
I have been using Fiskars Pruners for over ten years.  My old 'anvil pruner' was getting dull and I thought warn out so I purchased this one.  The old one is all metal.  The new one is of a plastic like material and boy was I disappointed when using it.  I attempted to prune my black berry patch.  Immediately, when I cut into a stem/stalk 1/2" or bigger, I found that the "ratchet" feature was virtually worthless.  It kept slipping and when it finally did work the blade thru, it failed to cut all the way thru leaving a portion of the stem between the blade and the Anvil.  Then when cutting into anything over 1/4" I found that the "anvil" blade didn't cut all the way thru the stem/stalk.  Lastly, when the blade wouldn't cut thru the stem/stalk I would try to twist the handle to snap the remaining stem/stalk in to like I do with my older ones.  However, the new Pruner simply allowed the blade to slide sideways preventing me from snapping the stem/stalk off.  Overall a great design but the poorest of poor quality.  This is supposed to be a pruner for larger, heavier cutting due to the 'ratchet' design!  But, it's pure junk!  Amazon immediately issued me a complete credit for my purchase price without any questions what so ever.  Think they already knew something I didn't?	-1
I can't believe the first time I used these pruners, they broke! Literally, on the third branch I was cutting! It wasn't even 1/2 inch thick though it states it will go up to 3/4 inch.  I thought by buying a name brand like Fiskars, it would have some quality and integrity. Nope. Cheap China made product. Very disappointed.  I read all the reviews on the ratcheting pruners and thought this was the one. I have a great set of Gerber's, but this had the better review. Maybe I received a defective set, but it broke so quick. The material is not good quality, just cheap plastic.  I would not recommend this product at all.	-1
Was using it to cut my very first branch and the thing snapped! Complete junk. Would not recommend it to anyone. Thankfully Amazon let me return for a complete refund. The manufacturer should not make a tool like this out of plastic!	-1
This was one of the first cutters I bought for the garden and has been the least successful.  The blades easily jam, this is particularly frustrating when trimming suckers at the base of a tree and I pick up a stray wood chip.  Part of the problem maybe due to defective workmanship or faulty design because the blades don't make a tight pass and can become easily clogged. It only worked trouble free for a month before I had to replace it with the Power Gear design from Fiskars, a dramatically better product!  This might be good for medium duty branch trimming and nothing else, but otherwise I would look at the other Fiskar designs for a more trouble-free and versatile trimmer.	-1
I bought these Pruners and after 1 year of use they don't cut clean through thin or slightly thick branches anymore. The make noise when closing and opening them and the rubber handle cover comes off sometimes.  I will need to look for ones that last longer and cut through branches cleanly longer.	-1
I got the 60 cubic foot version, and although it will adequately hold many outdoor garden tools, it is not an impressive product.  First and foremost, although assembly is nominally tool-free, that is only the case if you don't have to disassemble any pieces.  The pieces are labeled for convenience, and the instructions say to attach Part A to Part B, and the parts have the part numbers embossed on the plastic for easy identification - or so it seems.  You see, although there are three sections called 'Part A', which implies they are the same, they are *not* the same.  So if you follow the instructions and use just any old part labeled 'Part A' you may find yourself in the same situation as me, which is having to disassemble and reassemble sections.  There are no instructions given on how to do this, and I used a flat-head screwdriver to pry up the sections that latch together, and came very close to ruining/breaking a couple of pieces.  In retrospect, a close review of the instructions shows that the picture shows that even though the written instructions say to use 'Part A', you are supposed to use 'Part A' that has a notch in it when you place it in a certain position, etc.  If I assembled another one of these I wouldn't make the same mistakes, so my advice is to pay extraordinarily close attention to the directions and accompanying pictures to be sure you're using the right variation of each part with the same label.  Secondly, the pieces do not snap together cleanly, meaning that in many cases the bottom of the top part is supposed to slide down over the top of the bottom part, but due the flexing in the plastic they just hit together at the edges and won't slide together.  I again had to take a screwdriver and run it along these junction points to make sure the parts slid together cleanly.  This was particularly irksome for the pieces on the back wall, because I was assembling it with the back against another building, and I had to pull it out to get back there and assist with the joining.  Which brings me to the third point, which is if you find yourself in a situation where you have to move the piece, you will find that already-assembled pieces will disconnect, causing you incredible grief to reassemble.  Last but not least, when it came time to snap the lid on, I found that the unit again has to be slid away from the any obstructions (like the wall I was assembling it against) by 3-4" to allow room for the top to snap into place before rotating down.  This cause yet another forced move of the partially assembled unit with another round of spontaneous disassembly due to flexing.  When I was finally done with the infuriating assembly, I got to the (supposedly) fun part - loading in the garden tools.  First thing in was a standard leaf rake and...tadaaa...the unit was too short for the rake to stand up in it.  Really, Suncast?  You made a vertical garden shed that won't hold a standard leaf rake?  Bad on me for not taking down the dimensions of the unit and then measuring all my tools, but a rake is a rake and you figure a shed designed to hold rakes would hold a flippin' rake.  Nope.  So now the rake leans across the inside of the unit, conveniently blocking access to everything else every time I get in it.  The bottom line is that if I had to do it again I wouldn't buy this unit, and I would explore other options.  It's not horrible enough for me to try to disassemble it and send it back, but I am not happy with it and will be grumpy every time I use it until it either breaks irreparably or I smash it to bits when one of the doors fall off for the umpteenth time.  NOT recommended.	-1
I bought this horizontal storage shed to fit in a narrow space on the side of my house.  The shed is advertised on Amazon and the Suncast web site as being 26" deep.  The real depth of the storage box is more than 26" and the box says 26-1/2".  However, the hinges take up more room and the shed can only be opened by raising the top.  To keep the top open, you'll need a few more inches to lean the top back.  You should allow 29-30" minimum.  I didn't have that space.  I tried to return the shed to RestockIt.  Although they shipped from Sacramento to my home in Manhattan Beach, they insisted I return the shed at my cost to their Florida location.  That would have cost $70 -- half the value of the shed.  RestockIt said it was my fault because they shipped what I ordered but I ordered a shed to fit in a 26" space.  Another shed I ordered from Amazon was also too big but Amazon was had UPS pick it up without a problem.	-1
Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms.  The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment.  Poor quality control.  Not worth returning the product.  Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised.  I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them.	-1
This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself. The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed. Save your money....not worth the hassel.	-1
Ordered  by mistake.	-1
Cannot discern any extra effectiveness in attracting mosquitoes.  Save your money.	-1
Did not work to help catch mosquitoes in the 1 acre Dynotrap in the CA Santa Cruz Mountains.	-1
It is waste of money.	-1
Totally ineffective.	-1
If this is working, someone is coming in in the wee hours of the morning and stealing all of my dead mosquitoes. I say that because in the morning, I have no dead mosquitoes.	-1
this s*** wouldnt attract a mosquito if my damn life depended on it.	-1
I guess this stuff sort of works.  I'm in Central Florida and the mosquitoes were horrid here this summer.  The system made a tiny dent in our mosquito population, I guess.  Sure didn't end out with a pile of dead bugs under the bug zapper.  The yard remained a no-go zone because the mosquitoes were so awful.	-1
These didn't work at all.	-1
This is to help draw in mosquitoes and sadly, the mosquitoes are less than interested in the light, even with attractant. Your best option is to remove any pooling water on your property and install bat houses. Bats can eat over 1000 insects per meal. With a bug light, you are just killing off beneficial bugs	-1
I didn't see a reduction in the number of mosquitos. We don't even use it anymore.	-1
Sitting not even 50 feet from the Flowtron BK-80S 89-Watt Electronic Insect Killer 1 1/2 Acres and you get bit up alive by mosquitos.  Thinking this lure might not be so good???  Someone help me out here?	-1
not worth the cost	-1
We bought this to put on the lantern for the Mosquitos but see no difference	-1
Does not work. Don't bother.	-1
Does not work as well as it's advertised.	-1
I would say that these don't work on the mosquitoes in my area of Virginia.  There was no detectable drop in population.....ever.  And I used the product as directed.	-1
I just ordered Dynatrap DT2000XL Electronic Insect Eliminator.  I though by adding this cartridge on top, it would help catch more mosquito.  Well, I was WRONG !!!  Through our summer, my dynatrap caught exact 5 mosquito.  May be, it is not supposed to be used with Dynatrap	-1
They don't stick very well to bottom of unit.  If you press to hard you get the serum on your hands and I seem to collect more moths than skeeters.	-1
Zero effectiveness attracting the devilish ATM.  Apparently Lurex is what you need for them.  Know what you are hunting and how to get it.  This product is not for Asian Tiger Mosquitoes over-unning the East Coast.	-1
Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least, Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada, at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not, then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective.	-1
I got this along with the Fly Sex Lure and neither of them seem to work. This has more toxic warning than I see on a can of Raid, but so far, I haven't found a dead mosquito since I put on in. Now, maybe we don't have a lot of mosquito like they do in North Dakota and this thing would work like a god up there, but in New Mexico, unless you live by lots of water, save your money.  The good thing is you seem to get a lot of them for the price, but more doesn't seem to help and they don't smell very good.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Flowtron-MA-1000-6-Octenol-Mosquito-Attractant-Cartridges-6-Pack/dp/B000063XHT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Flowtron MA-1000-6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges, 6-Pack</a>	-1
I purchased a 6 pack of the octenol mosquito repellent cartridges thinking it would help with the mosquitos.  My Flowtron is large enough to manage an acre, and I only have 1/3 acre.  I don't see many moths, but the mosquitos are as bad as ever.  I was thinking of putting up another Flowtron on the other side of the house, but I'm not sure that it would do any good.  I just have to bite the bullet with this purchase!  The best part of this purchase is the way Amazon handled the sale from ordering to delivering - accurate, fast, and complete!	-1
Note this item is supposed to ship via Amazon Prime, but it does not!  So if you need it fast, go elsewhere.	-1
This is not my first spring type hose, however, this particular brand is a genuine piece of JUNK! When another reviewer wrote of the cheap aluminum ends and not being able to tighten it to an outdoor faucet, I dismissed his review for no other reason than the many positive reviews, now I need to go back to see how many of those are "paid" reviews i.e. given a discount for their thoughts. The female end was so poorly made, it would not screw on tight enough by hand to the brass faucet, and blew water all over the place when I attempted to use it.  The reason I purchased this was for space saving convenience on my boat, a regular hose takes up more valuable space. Today, I pulled out both my old spring hose (of another brand) and also removed this new product from its package in order to fill my water tanks (one hose will not reach).  At home, I have another hose rated as "contractor grade", whatever that means, which has heavy, machined aluminum ends. Those ends are much sturdier than the cheap brass sometimes found on hoses. Not this hose, the aluminum is so thin I'm surprised it did not bend when I attempted to screw it onto the brass faucet. There is no place to grip either! All you have is an almost smooth female fitting, no metal extends below it to grip as my other hoses do. The black ends below the fitting look good in the picture, however, they are a cheap hunk of flexible material and slide back onto the hose itself if you attempt to use them as a grip to assist for tightening. They must be for appearance only as they serve no other purpose.  Honestly, the last time I encountered a water hose this poorly made was when I ordered from another vendor, four of those "as seen on TV"  collapsible hoses. Those were so poorly constructed, of the four I purchased, none made it an entire season and in fact a couple of them blew out when pressurized the first time. Live and learn, or so I thought I had! The good part about purchasing from Amazon is that they right the wrong, I printed my return label moments ago. Thank you Amazon!	-1
Like others have said, the connections are of a cheap material.  Most importantly however is that the diamater of the hose greatly reduces(at least 50%) the water pressure from the spigot.  This hose is all right for watering plants but the reduced pressure will frustrate you to no end if you're plans for this hose include washing your car or cleaning off the house.	-1
Low quality materials and design: low quality metal in the fittings, and not much to grab on to when tightening; the male connector is positively stealth. The kink preventers at the ends are just pieces of plastic tube. But once assembled it works without leaks - we'll see how it holds up...  18-month update: The metal connectors have corroded through and broken. For the cost of repairing this, you could buy a better hose, like the Water Right Coil	-1
I have a small courtyard and thought this would work well in that area and be neat and tidy too. It did not reach far enough and was a pain in the neck. I need to buy another hose. Will buy the GaterHyde Drinking Water Safe Garden Hose, which are awesome.	-1
There isn't much water pressure, but it isn't much hose.  It does recoil, but not in a uniform manner, so I found myself unknotting it in order to use it.  They were more trouble then what they were worth, so I replaced them with straight hoses.  However, if you had them on your porch to do light watering, I suspect they would be fine.	-1
I bought 8 of these hoses to connect together to reach the different levels of my garden. I bought several so I would not have to stretch them too much to make them reach. I only used them a few times and two of them pulled apart right away. I have had other brands of coiled hoses in the past with no problems but these are very cheaply made. No doubt made in China. China is becoming well known in the world for cheaply made garbage.	-1
I thought the concept of this hose was great, unfortunately in a real life garden it is not. Don't think because this hose is coiled it will not kink, in fact it kinks more than any hose I have ever had. As long as you keep tension on the hose from the faucet it works good, however loosen the tension or walk back toward the faucet and you have a tangled mess.  A mess that is a real bugger to undo. The coiled hose tense to be a real hazard to your small plants, delicates & pots it reeks havoc on them. All in all, I salute the idea and the only real good I am getting out of this hose now is for tying up my trees. Yes, I cut the hose up into pieces and I am using this for tying trees to stakes for this I give it 5 stars for watering my plants it gets 2 stars.	-1
I previously owned a rubber coil hose for several years which never became kinked. This new coil hose is lightweight as advertised, and as such, it is not very strong. Therefore, it does not recoil very quickly and you have to make it happen somewhat. It tends to twist up each time I recoil it (the plastic kind of sticks) and then I have to take the time to unravel it. Though I am only talking 15 seconds at most, compared to the rubber hose I owned (which I could not find anywhere to purchase) it is annoying. Also, this hose has such a short threaded end that when you twist on a spray nozzle, you may not be able to tighten it enough as you have nothing to grab other than the hose by the time the nozzle gets to the end of the thread. Mine currently drips due to this. I doubt I will even be able to remove the spray nozzle without cutting it off the hose. My advice, find a rubber coil hose then post on Amazon where you found it!	-1
This wheel kit is one of the cheapest-made items I have ever purchased from Hatteras. Product barely supports its own weight...don't even try to add something else to it like a hammock. Save your money and keep looking.	-1
I was shocked when package arrived and was extremely light weight. I had expected something much more substantial.  Wheels installed okay but on first tug of steel framed Hatteras Hammock to a shady spot across the backyard, noticed wheels were spreading out like they were greatly over stressed. I don't expect much use out of this set of wheels before something gives and it becomes broken junk. Should have done this with material from Harbor Freight!	-1
Works ok when there is no wind. The smoke is not strong enough to chase the mosquitos away. Still got bite.	-1
Lit it up on a Canadian fishing trip for about 4 hours with calm winds and it didn't seem to make any difference.	-1
I like that this unit works fairly well. It was a gift, and when I tried to buy refills, I found that you can not buy refills where I live in California! This renders the unit useless, as I tried not only direct from Thermacell, but from many other dealers.	-1
Useless. Got lots of mosquito bites :(	-1
45 minutes with this right next to me and still getting bit up	-1
So,  I thought this would be worth a try as the mosquitoes here in NH can be voracious at times.  First trial was on an overnight camping trip to a local lake campground with the grandkids.  Sitting at the picnic table in the evening with the unit running on the table, mosquitoes flew right in and dined on us.  Tried it again in the morning.  Mosquitoes were less  numerous then but, nevertheless, we got bites.  Bottom line is that the Thermacell doesn't work with our mosquitoes!	-1
Put in new pad and butane lighter. Waited ten minutes with unit 2' from me and watched a misquote land on my arm.	-1
Well, the mosquitoes found me despite that device.	-1
The original was fantastic this model with the turn dial is nowhere near as good. The spring that is used to hold down the gas seems too weak.  A bump will turn off the thermocell without you knowing until the mosquitos take you away.	-1
Because it is not eligible for air travel, it is completely useless for me.	-1
The unit would not light out of the box.  Common problem according to internet forums.  I opted to open up and fix per forum advice, but I must have done somethig wrong as now the on/off switch doesn't work.  So it bled out all the butane... I don't have box anymore so can't return. :/	-1
I bought this because I saw so many positive reviews. Absolute garbage. Seriously, wind or no wind, time of day doesn't change it. Nor does letting this thing warm up before use. New repellant pads didn't help either. The tiny ones, the big ones, all of them biting like crazy. Thanks to this mild winter I might as well just buy the Zika virus and get over it now while I can since this plastic waste of money won't protect me.  How is it working for all these people who reviewed it? Is my CO2 stronger?	-1
Don't buy. Doesn't work.	-1
Don't know if these actually work. Use them often but there are still Mosquitos everywhere. Might make a small difference in how many but can't be sure.	-1
This thing doesn't work and the cost of replacement pads and cartridges is ridiculous - don't buy this - its a waste of money.	-1
This item is advertised as a "mosquito repellent device". Imagine my surprise when I read the fine print on the box---it is actually a heat-release vaporizer dispensing the insecticide Allethrin. That is a synthetic pyrethrin-type insecticide which scrambles nerve signals in insects--causing them to fall down twitching and not bite you. This is NOT a "repellent", this is an insect killer, although its package uses the word "repellent" over and over. I would not have knowingly bought an insecticide fogger. The package has numerous warnings that do not appear on the Amazon sales page, such as "do not contaminate water, food or feed" by use or disposal of the ThermaCell; "harmful if inhaled", and "do not breathe vapors" (good luck avoiding THAT around a vaporizer appliance!) The package also states that the insecticide is toxic to fish and other aquatic life (probably not suitable for use near a garden pond.) Finally, a Wikipedia search revealed that the pyrethrin-type insecticides are highly toxic to cats. Since I bought this thing to ward off mosquitoes on a patio we enjoy with our three cats, it's absolutely NOT acceptable. Sadly, as a butane-burning appliance, it is also NOT RETURNABLE to Amazon, so please, BUYER BEWARE.	-1
So the instructions are clear that you MUST NOT breathe the vapors, but in order for it to work the instructions also say that you have to be within about 7 feet of the device...so you have to be in the vapor cloud, but you cannot breathe it.  Should I run in and out of the bug 'protection' area while holding my breath?  My head hurts because I am so confused...  Oh...and its flimsy and cheap - like I got it out of a gum ball machine or cracker jacks box.	-1
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO BUY ONE OF THESE DEVICES, IN FACT SEVERAL, WHEN I SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT THE REPELLENT PAD HAS TO BE REPLACED EVERY FOUR HOURS!!  DO THE MATH!!!  THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET UP FROM A DEEP SLEEP AT LEAST ONCE TO REFILL THE DAMNED THING, NOT TO MENTION THE BUTANE POWER SOURCE EVERY 12 HOURS.  THAT ONE ISSUE MADE ME STOP MY ORDER IMMEDIATELY.  FIRST, JUST TO OPERATE THIS THING EVERY DAY WILL COST YOU YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT FOR THE MONTH.  COUPLED WITH THE RIDICULOUSLY SHORT ACTIVE LIFE OF THE REPELLENT PAD MAKE THIS PURCHASE A DEFINITE "NO-GO."  WHAT A SHAME, THE PRODUCT SEEMED LIKE IT REALLY WORKS, BUT I HAD TO PASS.  IT'S BACK TO THE BUG SPRAY.	-1
So I live in Montana, at around 4800 feet. The first time I used the Thermocell, we were in Wyoming, pretty low in elevation, over at Devil's Tower. Not sure what the elevation of the campground there is, but I'm sure it's right around 4000 feet.  So we placed a lamp under the Thermocell, lit it up, and it fired up, and worked great. The bugs vanished from underneath the lamp, and we did not get bitten at all. I was pretty happy about it, as the bugs are always bad out there. It was really great.  Then we head home, and up into the mountains we go for some picnicking. It's huckleberry season in Montana right now, so imagine being in a hot, sticky, forest surrounded by mosquitoes and flies, and that's pretty much what berry picking is like, except it's really hot, sweaty, and thorny. The Thermocell did not work at around 6000 feet at all. I could only get the thing lit for a few seconds before the element would darken again. It was really frustrating. Losing time, messing with the thing, we just picked without it, and later picnicked without it. We are used to bugs, so it wasn't too bad, but the Thermocell did not work.  After bringing it home, and testing it out, I came to the conclusion that it was the elevation. To me this makes sense, because the orifices in appliances which run on a gas need to be different at around 4000 feet in elevation due to air pressure. If Thermocell would make an orifice which was smaller for those at higher elevations, I believe there wouldn't be an issue with the Thermocell going out.  Anyway, I give this product two stars for now, and will change depending on customer service and how my return will go. It will either go up to 3 stars if all goes well, or down to one star. I will also edit accordingly. Thin air breathers beware!	-1
Did not work for me in New York City, I used this along with Fresh Cab rodent repellent, Rodent Defense spray and glue traps. Within a few days, mice were back in my apartment. This item was too pricey to not return. They already know to avoid the glue traps. Help!	-1
While I was staying in a barn in Russia, I had to use the Ultrasonic Rodent Repellent for mice and rats. These things don't work with deaf rodents. Since the rodents lived near a munitions factory and bombing range, most, if not all, had lost the use of their hearing. They would infest the barn I slept in, often biting or nibbling me during the night.  Rodents are especially problematic during the hot, sticky summer months, as they breed like rats. They carry fleas (often with plague), urinate and defecate on food crops and are a nuisance.  The traditional Russian method is to sleep with a hammer but with so many rodents, it's impossible (and tiring) to kill them all.	-1

I have the same reel for an airhose that works great.  I don't know if its the bigger line or what, but it doesn't reel in evenly and gets jammed towards the end.  Also the hose end leaked right out of the box.	-1
I have had this hose for two years now and I hate every time I have to use it.  I am finally pulling the plug and tossing this horrible piece of junk in the dump, where it belongs. The hose does not lock in position, it has never properly retracted into the cheesy plastic housing and it is real hassle to use. I positively hate it.  I try to support every American worker that sells American made products but this product is absolutely shameful and the customer support  people are even worse. If you buy this hose you will be sorely disappointed and out a bunch of money. I can't believe that they are still selling this junk.	-1
I have used this mower about 2-3 times. The battery charge lasts about 45 minutes before it goes into yellow region of charge indicator (time to recharge). When cutting grass, the mower leaves some larger blades of grass partially uncut and you have to go back and recut the grass. This is not a big problem if you have a small yard but with a larger yard it can be very frustrating. This problem may be due to the narrow blade on the cordless mower which is much narrower than my gas mower. I have gone back to using my gas mower for most of my mowing since it doesn't choke down nearly as often and I don't have to deal with recharging after 45 min. or going back and recutting grass.	-1
Brinkmann gas grills are junk quality. My 4 burner Brinkmann gas grill is falling apart after just two years of lite use and being covered. The spot welds on the ignitor came apart and all three gas channel crossovers rusted out. The parts to repair the grill cost me over $50. Brinkmann customer service was rude and unsupportive since these parts are not covered in their paltry warranty time frame. Other parts are also rusting out. There are NO utensil hooks provided so you need to drill holes and provide your own. The design shows no fore-thought and is not user friendly when replacing parts. I guess you do get what you pay for. Best advice is to stay away from this brand.	-1
A big disappointment does not work with damp twigs or grass, save your money. I put mine out in my drive for free.	-1
First issue is that of putting the thing together. It definitely takes two people and the materials are really shoddy and flimsy. The threaded plastic stem which connects the knob immediately stripped as I put it together. I essentially had to re-groove the thread to get the knob on. Then, within one hour of non-heavy use, the plastic post holding the spinner burned out leaving me with a useless unit until I figure out how to re-cobble it together.  Worst purchase of garden equipment I've ever made. Can't recommend it at all. Buyer beware. If you do decide to buy it, please be sure that you use it on the lightest,driest material you can, and load it gingerly. Otherwise the post will burn out.  Moral of the story: -Shoddy materials -Hard to put together -Only good for the lightest use	-1
Anything other than soft dry leaves will cause the flimsy string trimmer line (the "blade") to break instantly.  A single twig 1/4" in diameter or a watermelon rind is enough.  It doesn't work well for paper either.  If you want nicely mulched leaves, use a bagging lawnmower instead.  We don't even have any grass, but we use a small electric lawnmower instead to chop up our leaves/sticks/kitchen scraps/paper for composting and it works beautifully.	-1
I bought this unit last fall. It's light and easy to set-up and use, but after one fall it's pretty much shot. I made about 100 cuft of mulch from the leaves in my yard. In processing that many leaves I inevitably put some sticks, bark and small rocks through the unit. After that, the main body of the unit has three holes punched in it and several cracks one of which runs about one third of the way around. I'll need to get a new shredder for this fall.	-1
Purchased the Leaf Mulcher in 2004. Having a small yard, I estimate I ran the machine a maximum of 25 hours. This past winter, it began making an awful racket and refused to run anymore. Upon examination, I found the motor shaft turns in a sleeve bearing. How CHEAP AND JUNKY!!!!!! The sleeve bearing nearest the spinner head had worn considerably, allowing such a wobble as to destroy the motor. I did like shredding the leaves, as they make good mulch for the garden. However, it was a real pain to use. Even the smallest oak twigs could break the line. The funnel never fit together very well. The stand was flimsy and the knobs would not stay tightened. With some improvements, such as high quality motor bearings and the ability to use larger cutting line,Flowtron would have a great product. Unfortunately, after years of people complaining, the company has not seen fit to engineer any improvements into the product.	-1
Do not buy this product.  It worked once for me and then the motor died.  What a waste of money.	-1
I have had this unit for about two seasons on a 1/4-acre lot with a number of mature trees - tulip, oak, elm, and Norway maple. On average, we probably have 50 bags worth of leaves per year here. My motivation for mulching our leaf matter is that it's pretty silly to be buying fertilizer and mulch in the spring, when the garden is making it in the fall for you. I have found that fine-ground mulch is an excellent ground cover for the winter and that it breaks down almost completely by spring.  While the Flowtron 800 has sort of worked, I never was completely happy with the unit because of its numerous shortcomings. The Flowtron consists of a cone inside a cone that feeds leaves to a trimmer head below. On the side of the unit, a handle allows you to adjust the size of the openings on the bottom of the Flowtron, which in turn adjusts the size of the mulch coming out. The Flowtron 800 is a very lightweight unit, which makes carrying it quite easy. However, the bendy legs are short and not very stable.  On the one hand, the low height of the unit makes loading more leaf matter easy, on the other hand it also means that you have to keep moving the unit around as you shred leaf matter so that the mounds of mulch do not come close to the electric motor (housed inside the black cylinder hanging from the bottom of the unit). Otherwise, you'll impair the ability of the motor to cool itself. This fall, my Flowtron finally failed completely after leaf debris bypassed the installed filters and clogged the electric motor, causing it to seize. While the unit has one external filter (easy to clean, on the side by the power switch) there is also an inaccessible internal filter (for a different set of air intake holes on the underside of the unit) which can shift from its installed spot and hence allow unfiltered air into the motor (which is how my motor failed). That the makers of the Flowtron did not restrain this filter in any way is a design defect, IMO.  Unfortunately, even when the Flowtron is working, its performance can only be described as marginal. Only if you use the driest and fluffiest of leaves and drop them in quasi-individually will it produce a fine mulch that does not clog the machine within 5-10 minutes. Any twig thicker than 1/8" and longer than 3" will typically clog inside the machine, preventing the rotating plastic trimmer lines from reaching all plant matter behind them. Thus, get used to turning off the machine periodically to clear any twigs you may have accidentally dropped into the unit. I found it helpful to use the time between dropping new leaf matter in (while the previous set was getting mulched) to search the next leaf batch for twigs. But the rate of progress is slow.  Frequently shutting the machine off to check for over-sized debris is especially important if you value the longevity of the trimmer line that Flowtron encloses - the OEM lines wear very quickly. I had much better luck using non-OEM trimmer line like the 0.095"/2.5mm RinoTech stuff at Home Despot. Cut it to the right length using one of the existing cords as a template, then enjoy 5x longer performance than with the OEM trimmer line. But even the Rino trimmer line was no match for twigs. Replacing the trimmer strings often is key to maximizing performance, whether you use OEM string or not. I even considered going with a bladed trimmer replacement head, but then the early demise of the motor cut that project short.  Also check the underside of the machine to see if something has clogged the exit chutes - it happens quite often - and if so, shut the machine off and clear from below. Watch out for stringy plant matter like Hostas - before the trimmer line can chop them up, their stems will wrap themselves tightly about the trimmer line axle. One upside of the open design of the Flowtron is that clearing blockages is quite easy (i.e. no tools required). Like most shredders, the Flowtron is not a great match for leaves that are wet. But the Flowtron is perhaps more sensitive than the competition, as moist mulch will quickly clog the machine.  I presume that the funnel-in-funnel design of the Flowtron is supposed to prevent the machine from ejecting plant matter from inside trimmer area, but it doesn't stop all of them... so wear good protection around the machine: Kevlar-lined gloves to prevent cuts, safety glasses with a foam face seal, and hearing protection. And tighten the "lock-nut" fasteners on this unit periodically as they come loose with time.  In conclusion, if you own a small yard with no twigs and lots of crispy-dry leaves, this unit may perform as intended. However, between the slow rate of processing leaf matter, frequent cleanings, the poor filtration of motor air, and other design choices, I have been disappointed with this purchase. I have purchased a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Patriot-Products-CSV-2515-1-5-HP-Electric-Wood-Chipper-Leaf-Shredder/dp/B001KMZK3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Patriot Products CSV-2515 1.5 HP Electric Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder</a>&nbsp;as a replacement for the Flowtron.	-1
Make sure when you order this item that you order two.  I ordered this motion activated animal repellent and had in use for about a month, at first thing out of the box one of sprinkler heads did not operate correctly.  I charged both units several days before hooking them up.  I only have one working now.  I had to combine two of them to make a working unit.  I am very disappointed with this item because it was working great for about a month and then stopped all together.  Would not work at all.  I would not recommend anyone waste there money on this item.	-1
Within a month's period it no longer works correctly.  Valve sticks on a regular basis.  Would not buy this again.	-1
This is the worst product I have ever purchased in my adult life! It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner however everything after that was negative. After assembling the parts I connected it to a hose to test it. Every connection leaked a lot of water. After installing an additional hose washer at each connection I was able to stem the leaks except for the one at the standpipe connection to the scarecrow head. Attempting to tighten that caused the female threaded collar to break. After gluing the collar back on I tested it and it worked a few times then the sprinkler head itself blew out of the scarecrow head. I found the pieces and reassembled it and shortly after that the glue joint broke and the unit became totally useless. The couple times it worked it was fun to watch and I believe would be successful at scaring away critters but this device is so poorly designed and made of such cheap fragile materials I cannot possibly recommend it.	-1
Worked for a couple weeks then quit. Does not register motion anymore (no 'click'). A very bad buy on my part.	-1
Did not activate when walked in front of eye!!!	-1
Junk - only last so long then breaks	-1
Tried screw/unscreww the parts... Regardless, it leaked too bad to spray enough water when it sensed the motion. Returned.	-1
Returned it after I and several others tried to get it to work.  The one I had may have been defective,  It worked and then stopped.  Turned the water off; turned the water back on.  It worked and then stopped.  Etc., etc.  I decided it wasn't worth the trouble.	-1
It worked about a week ,a small green part fell off but it was still ok .then it started staying on as soon as I turned the water on .THEN it just stopped. I tried to replace the wierd 4 pack green plug-in battery pack to see if that was the problem and NO ONE makes it.	-1
We found that these were cheaply made. It didn't work for us.	-1
FINAL UPDATE 9/4 I give up. It does not work with a 25psi pressure reducer, only 10. I am stuck (and you will be too) with a stream of water that goes barely 10 feet and would probably not scare a mouse. Junk.  MOST RECENT UPDATE 8/29: 2nd Replacement Scarecrow also failed within a few days. I went through Amazon for the return this time and they sent out a mailing label and a third Scarecrow.  I treated the third one like a baby, being very gentle. The motion detector worked fine..until...I HOOKED UP THE WATER! then it ceased to work. I noticed that when I went to unscrew the water connection, as the pressure released, the Scarecrow activated. I tried this about 5 times and the same thing happened. Not working when water turned on, working when water turned off as I unscrewed hose connection.  ***This morning I dug out an old pressure regulator from my garden tools and attached it at the hose bib, and re-tried the Scarecrow. Lo and behold, now it worked with the water turned on! TRY THIS FOLKS, AND SEE IF IT HELPS...the water pressure regulator (mine is plastic, not brass) can be obtained for under $10 at Amazon, Home Depot, a plumbing supply or drip irrigation supply store. Mine reduces to 10PSI, I am going to try one that is maybe 25PSI to see if it gives a better result. The 10 works, it just doesn't spray very far. Hoping the 25 will not be too much pressure and cause it to stop working again!  I DOWNGRADED MY RATING TO ONE STAR because I shouldn't have to go through all this for such an expensive item! It is built very cheaply, made in China. It looks like there is a defect in the part that is sensitive to water pressure, my original Scarecrow from years ago didn't require a pressure reducer. If you sort the reviews by most recent, you will see I am not alone with problems of the Scarecrow just ceasing to work!  UPDATE 8/17: after a few days of working, the motion detector stopped working. Contech offered me a full refund after I send the battery cover back. I am hoping this was just a bad apple, I really liked my last ScareCrow. Will try another and update after I get it.  ORIGINAL REVIEW 8/7: This is my second ScareCrow, the other one was destroyed by my weed wacker when the battery compartment popped open and I cut through the wiring...oops! That being said, it would be nice if there was some sort of twisting lock on the compartment instead of a snap on cover. The cover worked fine for a couple of years, but then just got loose and kept falling off, so I had to tape it shut. But alas, the tape must have gotten too wet and didn't hold.  I have a large garden consisting of 8 raised beds, and my lot backs a wooded area. I get deer, groundhogs, opossum, rabbits, chipmunks, an occasional coyote etc, all hungry to enjoy my veggies. I have a variety of deterrents, but I believe the ScareCrow is the most effective, once you set it up correctly.  Setup is relatively simple, just thread all the pieces together. I added a "quick connect" where the hose connects so I can quickly disconnect and attach a spray nozzle to my hose if needed. I found I had to tighten everything with a wrench or it leaked, but that may just be that the arthritis in my hands couldn't get a good enough grip.  The key to this device is to have it optimally positioned to detect motion of your particular critter. I believe that smaller animals, like chipmunks, are probably being missed, but they do minimal damage compared to the bigger critters. This device really shoots out water very quickly and startles anything in it's path. I've scared the bejeebers out of myself when I forgot to turn it off and wandered in it's path. Also had a few good laughs when guests unknowingly trigger it.  One thing you need to make sure you do BEFORE you put the water on, is to set the spray arc direction AWAY from you. There is a little wire loop that flips down which indicates the direction of the spray...just adjust the plastic rings so this wire is in the middle. Stand on the opposite side of this wire or you will get sprayed while testing. But if you want to have full circular coverage, you will probably get wet no matter what. My spray direction faces the woods, and covers about a 90 degree arc. The directions that are included are pretty good describing how to adjust the arc. I have not played around with the motion sensitivity control extensively, it seemed to work for me right about in the middle. It is easy to adjust. The adjustment for the angle of the spray (high/low) didn't seem to do a whole lot, not enough to matter. But that being said, I don't think it's necessary to actually hit the critter with water, the abruptness of the sudden noise and action is probably doing most of the deterring.  Something to be careful of, if it's really windy, the wind can blow tall grass or vegetation which will set it off. Keep that in mind when positioning it. Also, keep a good eye on it and test it regularly because there is no low battery indicator, which would be very helpful.  All in all, I am happy with this purchase, and would give it 5 stars if it had a battery indicator. Just a note...in the few days I was without my ScareCrow waiting for the new one, I found a few half eaten tomatoes littered about the garden (probably groundhogs), and deer poo and urine burns on the lawn! A little pricey for sure, but worth it in my situation. But boy the grass grows twice as fast in front of it!  IF YOU FOUND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL, PLEASE CLICK "YES" BELOW	-1
We bought this to scare away blue herons who were poaching our fish in our pond.  Half the pieces were missing and my hubby did manage to put it together, however it did not work and was a piece of junk.	-1
If it worked, it might earn that single star, but on the first one, the top and bottom stake would not even screw together properly. I returned it and got another, and while the threads were slightly improved, the thing would not spray. Bought a pressure regulator and it STILL didn't work. Will be returning this one, too, but tonight I got an Orbit brand pest deterrent, and it worked without a hitch from the start. The difference in quality between the ScareCrow and this is unmistakeable, and the ScareCrow's plastic threads are pure crap.	-1
This product has major design flaws.  The worst is that the three pieces you must assemble by screwing together will NOT seat with amount of effort; the screw "pitch" is far too fine for the poor plastic threading.  If the manufacturer simply used a larger pitch, like a outdoor hose thread it would solve the problem.  I attempted to use a silicone spray;still no luck in seating either of the two joints.  Then after cleaning off the spray I attempted a seal with first Superglue then epoxy, hoping to both seal the water leakage and stabilize the stem-mounted motion detector which, without the stem fully screwed in, flopped around (not good for the motion-sensitive part of the unit!  Finally, when I thought all was well the unit would not spray water - the manual said if this happened you might have too high a water pressure (without telling you what pressure to aim for) and that you might need to buy a pressure-reduction device on the line.  Great product idea; lousy execution and incomplete manual.  AVOID THIS ITEM.	-1
I'm not sure if I just got a bad one or what, but it would work for awhile and then stop working, then start working again until it finally just quit.  And I had it less than a month.  It did seem to help scare the squirrels away when it was working.  I returned it and bought a different brand.	-1
They go into a deep sleep and allow the geese to walk right by them, I go down and wave my hand in front of them 3 or 4 times and they wake up. all 3 perform the same way, they need regular activity to stay awake.	-1
The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it does shoot water when it senses motion. The problem is, it senses it only when something is within 2-3 feet of it. The sensor cannot tilt to match the spray trajectory. The spray is highly adjustable in terms of distance and spread but not height. I've taken a video of me walking directly up the this with the sensor slightly below level (rabbit problem) and it didn't go off until I waved my foot 1 foot in front of it. I approached slowly but with much motion. Also, you have to attach the stickers yourself. Not worth it. It's sitting in the garage now.	-1
First one I ordered was defective and wouldn't work.  The second one I ordered worked okfor about 3 weeks and then completely stopped working.  Plastic is very cheap, battery housing isn't water proof, sensor is cheap.  Item had false detections continuously.	-1
My neighbor recommended this product; he uses it to keep away the zillions of bunnies we have in our neighborhood.  He swears by it.  I followed all the directions and even bought a new battery after trying three at home that I thought were good batteries.  We did the trouble shooting and this product would either spray all the time (too sensitive) or let the bunnies walk right up to it and do nothing.  After about 3 minutes of working (spraying constantly), it stopped working altogether. We took it apart and are shipping it back to Amazon tomorrow.  It's all packaged up and ready to go.  Very disappointed.  Thank God Amazon makes returns simple.	-1
I gave it an honest try but now in process of returning it. First it has thin washers such that it would spray out from those areas that you were screwing together. You had to double up on the washers and where the sprinkler head top that screws on top, you really need to used Teflon plumbing tape to stop from leaking there too.  Put in the battery and connect to my garden hose it was triggering randomly and at time not at all. So I reset as per the instructions and it continued with the random on or off. I even walked past it several time, nothing happens. Then have to reset and it would work then not work. I gave it several chances. But each time I had to go and reset it. This was getting more of an annoyance than convenience. Then I noticed that it had water droplets on the inside of the white sensor screen at the beak mouth, when the instructions said that if problems try wiping that area clean. Why would the sensor compartment allow water inside? Which when you buy solar powered motion sensor light units, they are waterproof, this scarecrow unit is not. It has slits and holes on the bottom of the beak, so when it does spray, residual water either runs down the beak of the unit and gets in via these slit and holes or they seem to also get in via the white sensor screen as that is not sealed water tight.  In any case, it just doesn't work as it claims in my opinion. Too much iffy on if it was working properly and from examining its construction it seemed not watertight for its intended purpose.  Btw it is also no longer made by Contech as others have mentioned. It is now by Ortho.	-1
I set it up, tested it, tried it with a hose and then packed it up and sent it back. If this is what you get for $60, then I need to pay more for something of better quality. It did seem to work and I imagine I could have made adjustments to make it work more precisely. But it leaked. That's because it does not even have a standard hose fitting -- a screw-on sleeve with a gasket. To attach a hose onto the device, you have to turn the device around and around clockwise. And without a gasket, water constantly leaks around the fitting, as you would think it might. I believe it also leaked a little around the sprinkler head. No gasket there, either.  In the instruction booklet, it says it works by detecting the difference between the heat of an animal and the background and then reacts off the motion sensor. I don't know but that seems like a dubious technology for Texas heat, where the background is going to be about animal temperature or higher from June to October.	-1
This product look nice, easy setup. However, the sensor is not great. I followed instructions to set it up couple days ago and tested it by waving my hand to activate. Nice water pray. I thought it would be great to scare uninvited pests away. Next day, I observed it and saw it turn on by itself several times. I thought of the sensitive sensor. I turned sensor down to 4 and it happened the same. Then I turned down to 1, still have the problem. When I turned sensor down, it is not pick up my hands waving! I may get the defective device? I'll call to return	-1
Got this to repel stray cats who were clawing our screen doors at night and peeing on our deck. If you have the sensitivity any higher than 4, birds and bees set it off constantly and the battery drains in less than a day. I've gone through seven 9v batteries in less than a week. I guess this sprinkler would probably work for larger animals that would work with the lower sensitivity settings. Else, you're going to pay $40/week in 9v batteries to keep this thing running. Also, the motion detection doesn't seem to work as good at night. Sadly, other motion sprinkler have even worse reviews than this one so I guess I'm out of luck. I'm thinking about just getting a regular sprinkler and getting a water timer that sets the sprinkler off every 5 minutes or so. Water is cheap here.	-1
We just got it tonight and hooked it up.  So far I am not impressed. I can't get it to shoot the entire distance of the monitoring section. We have it in front of an inground pool to keep ducks away and with it butt up against the pool we can barely shoot across it. Also the stream is not forceful.	-1
Worst $52 I've ever spent. If it didn't leak at every connection I'd keep it in spite of it's poor detection just because now the cats are scared of the garden. I tried plumbers tape and still the thing leaks about a gallon an hour. Terrible product and I'm returning it.	-1
works but slow to activate water once it sense motion	-1
I've tried a lot of these kind of sprinklers. I like the Orbit Yard Enforcer the best.	-1
Stopped working after 9 months. Contech has gone into bankruptcy, sold most assets, their warranty is as worthless as their product.	-1
Love the idea but this thing leaks continuously right out of the box.  Very disappointed because I will not leave it "on" given that it leaks and we are in a drought!  If a water-using motion device leaks continuously and we are in a drought--will anyone want to use it?	-1
We have two of these "defending" our vegetable garden.  This morning I look out the window and there is a big grey squirrel digging up a seedling six feet away and directly in front of one of the Defenders.  And the Defender is doing nothing.  I've been trying to get these Defenders to work for months now.  I did manage to improve their performance somewhat by adding a pressure regulator to the hose that supplies water to them.  It seems that the battery powered solenoid valve is not strong enough to reliably open against standard water pressure.  But the primary problem is that there is no Sensitivity setting that will detect a squirrel and NOT result in the Defender triggering constantly in response to plants swaying in a breeze.  So:  Useless for small pest control.  However, depending on your sense of humor, you may find them well worth the purchase price as you watch the Defenders soak your spouse, friends, gardener,......	-1
for this premium price you think they could use better quality material.  made of the flimsiest plastic you could imagine. trying to adjust my sprinkler hear resulted in some piece snapping off and not it doesnt work	-1
Hard to control the distance of the spray and the amount of dripping around the unit.	-1
I gave them one star because of three problems. First, they leak badly. This is essentially a plumbing fixture and leakage should not be an issue. But every joint is susceptible and despite Teflon tape and washers I still have two leaks that have put the system out of commission. The second problem is NO customer service. I'm waiting TEN business days now after THREE calls and no response. Not good enough after I spent over four hundred dollars on four units. I need to know which specific epoxy I can use to permanently bond these leaky joints. The third issue is that the anchor post is inadequate to the task of keeping it stable during use. The force of the spray moves the unit around. I had to cowboy some posts around each unit and use the hose connector to brace against the motion. Not well designed. Another issue is that the elevation is fixed at an odd angle and you can't adjust the height of the spray. This makes for interesting trips into the garden.  On the upside, they do deter deer but not raccoons. This product could be redesigned and better built. But it isn't so don't waste your money!	-1
I am using in conjunction with a Galcon 9001D Hose End Tap Timer with Programmable LCD Display (also sold on amazon) to keep the deer away from my flowers.  I have tried everything from barbershop hair clippings, deer off, dried blood, but to no avail.  This hose timer allows me to use the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler too keep the deer away.  The reason I use the timer is so that I do not get sprayed by the sprinkler during daylight hours when the deer are hiding and I am likely to be in yard working.  So far this switch is very easy to program and allows me to set it to be on for the entire evening and off for the entire day just like I wanted.  I have not had a deer problem since using this motion sprinkler!  Unintended consequence is that you will have to mow grass or trim nearby bushes more often due to sprinkler going off, but at least your flowers or vegetables do not get eaten!  Edit 09/09/16: after around one year, the thing stopped working correctly.  Now when it senses movement it does a quick sputter of water like it is trying to turn on but does not stay on like it did when working.  I have now noticed my plants getting eaten once again :(  I replaced all batteries so not a power issue.  I suspect a relay issue inside the sprinkler, poor reliability and cannot recommend now.	-1
Sucks	-1
Stopped working. Moondogie	-1
it works, but the rabbits ignore it. and you need to have a hose attached to it all the time. In SO CA. the hose will get hot and the pressure inside will pop the hose.  I stopped using it.	-1
The item came with the sprinkler head broken off and even though there was no protective wrapping it is highly unlikely it broke during shipping. This type plastic used with an item such as this is quite durable and stands up to tough use in lawn and garden applications.	-1
It leaks. I called and they promised to send a new adapter. it never came. My mom got one and it leaked. she returned hers. It did scare away the coon once, but then it figured out how to get around it. bummer. really had high hopes. would probably be great for deer.	-1
doens't work with a hoot	-1
I read all the other reviews before making the purchase.  The warnings were right -- This product is not acceptable as delivered.  I've tried and tried to modify it as a couple of reviewers described but have so far been unsuccessful in getting it to work properly without leaking.	-1
The connection to the water pipe is plastic, water keep on leaking from here; the shooting distance is too short, only about 6 feet to 10 feet. I have to return this product.	-1
