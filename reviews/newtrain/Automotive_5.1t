After I wrote the below review, the manufacturer contacted me and explained how to use this.  Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.  Perhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.  Sorry, I cannot recommend.

It sucks barely picks up anything definitely not for cars or pretty much anything don't waste your money	-1
Well to write a short one, it blew 2 fuses of the car. Apparently this one demands more than 12v.	-1
it ok it does it job	1
Have 3 big dogs. this have been great for my Ford transit connect.	1
I have a 2017 outback and everytime I try to use this I'm blowing fuses .	-1
very good suction will see how it lasts	1
love it,works great ! wow !!	1
Its just not as expected. Maby my expectations were too high. It works just not good enough.  I give it 2 stars because it is built well. It just don't cut it.	-1
Powerful vacuum. Recommend.	1
Junk the lighter part fell apart out of the box	-1
Great vacuum, it really sucks!	1
Excellent suction power for such a small vacuum, unfortunately I noticed that the cord is damaged and coming loose where it connects to the cigarette lighter plug. Quality control is suspected.	-1
I have come to distrust anything that plugs into the 12v car cig outlet. 99% of these small 12v appliances are too weak and too cheap. This vacuum is in the 1% of the items that actually work. We use this vac to clean out my wife's car. She has an all-you-can-eat membership to a car wash near her office, but they only wash her exterior. This vac has made it so simple for her to clean inside. She actually stores it in her car and uses it when she gets a wash during lunch. She's a tough customer, but she absolutely loves it. This is SO MUCH easier than dragging out the shop vac from the garage, and it works much better than a rechargeable dustbuster.	1
So handy to have in my car to clean up the dirt off the car seats and floorboard. This is what I wanted and ordered.	1
PROS: - Easy clean and durable filter (have not even burned through the first one yet) - Good suction (always use it with the car running for best results) - LED light is useful even in midday, because you wouldn't otherwise be able to see near the peddles, behind the seats, etc.) - Variety of tools and convenient carry bag CONS: - Crevice tool could be skinnier or longer	1
Cheap product which may last hopefully few weeks! After switching off the device it produces very strange sounds as if something inside going to fall off.  UPDATE: The HOTOR offered to replace the damaged item and even refund expenditure. For this reason I'm marking up form 1 to 5 stars because the customer service is simply unbeatable !	1
Gets the job done, Car does have to be on in order to use. Was able to get in tight spots that I couldn't get before with shop vacuum. Easy to clean! Attachments are very useful, pretty powerful for how small it is. Great price!	1
This vacuum is ok. With all of the good reviews, I was expecting a little more suction. I also did not realize at the time that it is 12Volt, not a plug in model. It has nice attachments	1
Used this several times now.  NO, the "suck" isn't amazing.  It does its job on light stuff but won't pull dry grass that velcros itself into auto carpet.  Don't expect a shop vac here (and even that doesn't get some of those suckers).  The extension hose becomes almost useless as the vacuum drops significantly at that distance.  However!  I love the longer card and the product itself seems sturdy and well-built and does what it's supposed to do for getting up the dust and similar.  Actually I have to say it even got a couple of pieces of lighter gravel.  Great for light touchups in my RV and easy to dispose of the mess.  Nice carry bag to keep it contained and the bonus filter gets a thumbs up.	1
well made, looks and works great.	1
Perfect little guy for my 2014 Nissan altima	1
Product: 4.5/5 stars Pros: -Various tips and connectors makes getting into the tight crevices an easy job. -Very good suction for a handheld tool. -Power cable is long enough to reach all the way to the trunk easily. -The design makes cleaning the unit a simple job. -Extra filter is a nice perk.  Cons (very small issues): -Be careful when using the long flexible tube. Mine unscrewed halfway during use. But, I realized it was probably mostly because I kept twisting the hose around. Also, it easily screwed back in and can probably be held in place with a little duct/electrical tape. -The storage bag is slightly small, but ONLY by a tiny bit. The current size makes storing all the pieces a bit of a jigsaw challenge to get everything to fit properly. This is only a comment for future upgrade improvements as everything does fit into the included storage bag.  Customer service: 5/5 stars To start, I purchased this product with my own money. I believe a company's customer service and confidence in their product is essential to any purchase, big or small. Hotor is one company that deserves the "Amazon's Choice" banner that it currently has for this product. Reach out to them directly before leaving a negative review--I'm sure they'll do their best to make you a happy customer. I mean their contact information is directly on the box itself!	1
Good	1
works well as advertised.  What I would expect for the price.	1
Wow, was I surprised how well this vacuum works. I didn't expect much, but to my surprise it did a great job in cleaning my vehicle. It left nothing behind. Worth the price.	1
Works good	1
great vac	1
good product.	1
Received. Took it out of the box. Attachment pieces do not fit on the hose. So you can only put the directly on the vacuum which will not allow you to get in between your seats or in areas you need the attachment on the hose. The hose also falls out of the vacuum. The hose is too wide for the attachments to go on.	-1
Horrible! I mean for tiny messes that do need any suction to clean up. I would suggest buying something better and saving the headache and money.	-1
looks great..... but it can't  pickup anything from the car mats	-1
Gets into all the nicks and crannies very good suction exactly what I needed for quick clean up in my car.	1
Suction is "pretty" good but not great.  While it does pickup all the mess, it takes several passes to get the job done. Doesn't matter if you use with or without the hose. Haven't tried the tire pump yet, but was glad that it operates on a separate switch function.  (Doesn't use the same blower)	1
Not super strong but it does the job.	1
Great I love it and it's strong enough to hold at least 3 of my big sets of keys. So cute	1
Updated and shortened review: Had this vac for over a month now and really like it.  There are other vacs with good ratings that are just that.  I really use the light on this one often, and the pump is great for getting some air in bike tires when on the go.  The guage is a big plus too.  I use this weekly or every other week to clean dried mud/sand out of the back & front seats that the dogs drag in when I take them for a walk.  With the brush end it gets the dog hairs pretty well too.  They are short haired but do shed little hairs.  What I like most is I'm not running to the house for the small shop vac, and running a 100' cord from the trailer house to the car in the parking lot.  Plenty of cord for your own car, and with a simple 25' extension you can easily clean a friend's car from your cig lighter. (Saves on gas with a prius as the generator! :))	1
I just received this today as i was cleaning out my truck.  Perfect time to try it out. I was really happy with this vacuum.  Plenty of power to suck up leaves, sand and a few bubble gum wrappers lol. I'm attaching a few pictures of what i got in the package.  The quality is really better than expected.  All the accessories fit tightly  and there is no air leaks anywhere. I like the carrying case and everything fits in it perfectly.  The cord is super long! I give this 5 stars no doubt and highly recommend it if you are looking for one of these.	1
Picks up great. Moves allot of air fast. Cord is really long.  The zipper on the bag didn't work right but I can overlook that. Brush attachment is awesome.	1
* Great design * Light weight * Easy to store, both in car and at home * Easy to clean after use * Really like the reusable filter - NO need to purchase more * Brush tip is very sturdy, which makes me feels like I am really cleaning the interior.  * My only concern is that the suction power is not strong enough.  While vacuuming inside pockets on back of front seats, I had to grab a plastic piece by hand.  Also, while accessories are handy, it is still hard to get into some places, such as between front seats and middle consul.  This vacuum was the one with the strongest Wattage on Amazon.  Perhaps I could have ended with a weaker one.	1
This is a well made iPhone stand that holds my 6S at just the right angle.  It's described as being made of bamboo, but the box states the stand is actually  Basswood/Walnut plywood, and that appears to be correct.  The stand I received had a flat walnut finish and is very stiff and strong.  Although the turned up lip is not very high, it actually does an excellent job of holding the phone.  The packaging included (4) thin, clear [possibly silicone] rubber pads which should be installed to prevent the otherwise slippery wood stand from slipping.  The walnut finish is attractive, and the current photos seen pretty accurate in showing the correct color and finish of the stand.  The anti-radiation claim is obviously based on simply moving the phone away from one's head.  The wood stand does not appear to have any electromagnetic or electrostatic shielding of any type, and if it did would likely affect the phone operation in a negative way anyway.	1
Ended up using it to vacuum Christmas tree needles out of my car the day it showed up. Works great. Love having the little hose for the tip. This is the only unit I've found like that.	1
Excellent product	1
The wet function is wishful thinking. May short the device if used in this way. But the dry function is good. Well designed accesories. Easy to empty.	1
I bought this vacuum so that I wouldn't have to get out the shop vac every time that I needed to clean the vehicles. I was surprised at it's performance and ease of cleaning the filter. My only gripe is the bag that came with it. It's cheap and the zipper broke after only one use.	1
Works good!	1
How this item got 5 stars is beyond me. It had a problem picking up six little quarter inch pieces of dried leaves from the carpet in my vehicle. Calling it a toy is an insult to toys.  Dont waste your money or time!	-1
This review is for a Car Vacuum Cleaner that is DC12-Volt 106W. This portable handheld vacuum can handle both wet & dry  with the 16.4FT(5M) Power Cord that it comes with. It also tucks away into a nice compact blacl carry bag with zipper.  Here are some PROS & CONS: PRO: It can handle both wet & dry dirt. Cord is long enough for inside of the car. It comes with attachment heads. It comes with hose extension.aww It comes with a carry case to keep it contained. CONS: Wish the suction was bit stronger but still gets the job done.  Overall, this will come in handy and having this will get the job done. [...]	1
Looks really cool. Only issue is, I have to turn my iPhone horizontally in order to charge it.  But that's my fault for not figuring that out from the pictures.	1

I ran it through my entire car and it performed well. I was able to vacuum up dust on the dash and steering wheel. But what I liked was that I could get the dust out of the radio buttons and air vents with the brush attachment. I didn't try the air pump capability but this could come in handy if you get a flat on the road. So It will stay in my car for sure. I grabbed some sand and threw in on the floor to demonstrate how well it vacuums for you in case you were wondering too. But overall, I do recommend this vacuum cleaner and I would purchase this again. I will update my review it quits working within a few months. But so far it seems good.	1
I have a fairly new car and unlike my old heavily used mini-van, this one can continue to look new as long as I take good care of it. I like to use the car wash vacuums because they have such good suction. But in between visits, this is fairly good for quick touch ups. I really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down.  The suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet. It is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand-held. It runs off your car battery (convenient) and has a couple of attachments, an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts. Sample provided for review.	1
Well, I am surprised.  Completely and totally and pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  I agreed to test it but I was very skeptical.  Here's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.  It did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You won't have that problem with this vacuum  BOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.  It comes with a little carry bag which fits the vac perfectly and you can even fit the accessories in there.	1
When the manufacturer sent me this in exchange for an honest review, my husband rolled his eyes...he is really particular about his vehicles (has them detailed professionally), but he agreed to give it a shot.  When it first arrived, you could see that he was super skeptical.  First he wondered if they pieces all fit in the bag (they did).  Then he wondered if it could be dismantled for cleaning (it can).  He took it outside and vacuumed his freshly-washed car....and came back with a vacuum that had picked up a bunch of dirt in his squeaky-clean car.  haha.  (see pic) Now he's hooked!  He went from rolling his eyes to telling me to tell you all that this is a great thing to buy, and a must-have if you are totally uptight like he is.  It works great, is easy to empty and clean, and everything fits in the bag. :)  My apologies for how Amazon uploaded my photos.  I'm not sure why this happens from time to time.	1
This a great in between car wash vacuums.  I typically use a shopvac to clean my cars out but that can be a hassle as I need to get extension cords and lug the big vacuum out of the basement. Of course this small vacuum doesn't have the same power as the shopvac but it does do a good job at cleaning up small messes. I like using this small vacuum to clean up small messes as it is very easy to use and I keep this in the trunk. The power cord is fairly long and allows me to reach every part of my car (4 door CTS) without any problems. I have yet to test the wet function of the vacuum, but the dry vacuum works as intended and picks up almost everything in its path. I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.	1
I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.  I find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.  The brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.  That said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.  Everything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.  Initially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.  Ultimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.  I was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.	1
Who doesn't need a little extra help when it comes to cleaning our vehicles?  Before getting this Hotor I was using a little broom and dustpan. Don't judge me. When I was offered this vacuum at a discount in exchange for an honest review I was eager to use it mainly because I NEEDED it, and I was curious as to how well it would do.  I was very impressed with it right out of the box. It is super easy to use. Just plug it into your cigarette lighter and you are ready to go. It has everything you need to be able to your carpeting in the car and even handle spills! Pretty cool, huh? I also was surprised to see the nice carrying case for it, making sure it is protected and easy recognizable when you need it.  This is one of those items you will want to keep close by, because an accident can happen at any time. Great to have something like this in your corner to help you keep your vehicle clean.	1
I was impressed when I took this item out . It has a very nice feel to it, inviting yet sturdy.  I found myself rubbing my hands over it, it felt so good.  It is not too big and not too small but has enough room for you cards or money is you wish. It is perfect size to stick in your  purse or pocked giving you quick access to what you need. Not heavy so it will not feel that way. This is a nice product at a reasonable cost. I'm using mine already. I think you will like this one.  Product received for a honest review.	1
decent price, good quality	1
I would love to see some smother fishing on the product surface	1
I absolutely love this necklace diffuser. I can put different scents on each color and wash them out to switch scents when I want. I don't know yet how long a disc will lasts before it deteriorates but they are a cotton blend sturdy material thats soft to the touch. the aroma from these is very strong with only a few drops needed.  Recommend this to a friend?

I have been looking for an energy-saving aromatherapy lamp. This lamp can function (without oils and light) as a decent humidifier for a smaller room. When I added essential oils, it dispersed them nicely.  That said, the user manual is one of the most confusing and complicated I have encountered -- especially for a fairly simply item. The instructions seem to indicate that you may need to clean this every 24 hours and then let another 24 hours pass to dry out. And there are many thingd that may void any warranty offered.  I really like that you can use this as a small humidifier without any oil. And my experience has been that using essential oils in the amount recommended will do well with a small room -- but not a big room.  I was looking for an efficient (LED) aromatherapy diffuser that could fill the (smaller) spaces I have. It does.  I received this item free and/or at a discount in exchange for using it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback - which I give on ALL items I review, regardless of purchase price.

I have found some reassembly errors in the gearbox section.  The engine section seemed to be ok.	1
Good manual. could use more detailed pics.	1
Good reference and very well written to better understand what to do. A must for working on the MG	1
good price fast shipping  ++++A-1	1
Perfect addition to my workshop manual for my bugeye.  Well worth the modest cost.  As with all Haynes manuals, it is well written such that a klutz like I can work on the car.	1
Covers almost everything required regarding regular maintenance and rebuilding using conventional home mechanic tools. Plenty of useful tips. Highly recommended.	1
must have if you own a bonnie	1
If you have any of these bikes, you need this book. I use it for everything.	1
Great manual. Always fill your library before you fill the garage with Triumphs.	1
This is a fine publication. Well written and the dialogue is presented in a friendly fashion. Many tips to help the novice wrench. Much cheaper than the factory manual. The only beef I have with it, is the pictures are not as good as they should be for a modern publication. The other thing that might bother some, is the measurements are in metric. My feeling is that it is WAY past time for us to not be using metric, in all our systems.	1
Great reference book!	1
Unlike the Clymer KLR manual I reviewed earlier this one sucks. Bad organization, blurry photos, and convoluted text make this the absolute worst manual ever. I gave it to the new owner when I sold my Bonneville and his eyes lit up. It's never been used I told him...little did he know. Delivery from Amazon was quick and for a hard-bound book the price seemed fair. Still I'd say don't waste your money, look for something better.	-1
Manual as described, good info	1
covers the bikes listed in the description, also gives some coverage to older models. a good resource for the DIY, or if you want to start learning about your bike and how to take care and work on it. between this manual and youtube, this is nothing I have wanted to do that I have not been able to very very easily.	1
Great book and a necessity for a well stocked garage. Great photos with plenty of detail and written with clarity.	1
Well written, must have for maintenance.  Includes all torque values, electrical diagrams, etc.  Great for routine maintenance tasks such as oil changes, etc.	1
great map for old school navigation.  Used it often when the Garmin ZUMO was giving strange directions.	1
Great heavy weight material! That GPS might not always work. Great keep sake too. Beautifully designed and easy to read.	1
At first this was a great pen, but the magnet in the cap came out and I had to glue it back in. The pen ran out of ink fairly quickly as the ink cartridge is small. The advertisement says it is a common size, but I have looked everywhere and cannot find 2.3 millimeter pen refills.	-1
This a phenomenal little emergency pen. The build quality is rock solid--it's a little tube of stainless steel. The magnetic cap is plenty strong. I keep it on my key chain, and the pen has never once come loose or fallen off. The magnet is strong enough to give you a very satisfying snap when you insert or remove the pen. Inadvertently detaching the pen is quite unlikely. At under 3 inches long, it fits nicely in my key chain with my car keys. You can use any standard multi-pen refill. I use Fisher Space Pen U1F or U4F universal refills.  ---------------------- EDIT: March 15, 2016  So this is still the best tiny keychain pen. The magnetization on the cap is strong and solid, and the pen is shorter than my car key. However, there are a few changes to the design since I last ordered this pen in late 2014. These details are noted below and in the pictures that I have uploaded.  First, the picopen has increased in length from a bit over 3" to now a bit over 3.25". In addition, the thickness of the pen has increased from what used to be approximately the thickness of a standard USB cable to what is now just shy of the thickness of a 6.35 mm audio jack... or a little bit bigger than the grounding prong of a three-prong electrical plug (sorry, I don't have a caliper handy for better measurements).  Second, the design of the top of the pen has changed slightly. As can be seen in my pictures, the older Picopen had a tiny lip at the top of the pen, where it connected with the cap. The newer design is a smooth cylinder.  Third, the cap design has changed quite substantially. In the older design, a magnet was attached just inside the cap rather shallowly. When you put the cap onto the pen, the magnet inside the cap gripped onto the lip of the pen (see pictures). With the newer design, the cap is nearly twice as long, and the magnet is recessed much deeper within the cap. Because of the recessed design, the newer cap slides down the shaft of the pen nearly a quarter inch more. Also, as far as I can tell, the magnet on the newer pen is a fair bit stronger than on the old pen. These design choices make it much less likely for the pen to accidentally become detached and fall off your keychain (though that never was a problem for me with the old pen).  Fourth, the mechanism for gripping the ink refill has changed on the new pen. On the old pen, the refill just slides in. It's a lightly firm fit, but it feels as though you're just sliding the ink refill into a cylindrical metal tube. You slide the refill in all the way until it hits the back of the pen and stops. The new pen is quite a bit different. Though I am unable to see inside the shaft of the new pen, it feels as though there is a spring that grips the ink refill as you slide it in. The spring resists the ink refill from going into the pen shaft at the very top, but once you have the refill in a little bit, it slides in very firmly. When the ink refill is inserted all the way, pushing on the top of the refill reveals a little bit of springiness. I'm sure everyone has used a retractable pen at some point in their life that, when they press down on a piece of paper, the ink refill has a very small amount of give/springiness. The new Picopen is like that, whereas the refill in the old Picopen is rock solid and has no give. I assume there is probably a small spring underneath of the ink refill that you compress as you push it in which causes this.  Fifth, as mentioned above, I use Fisher Space Pen U1F/U4F pressurized refills for my Picopen. Even though the U1F/U4F are standard multipen sizes and are almost exactly the same size as the ink refill that comes with the Picopen, the refill gripping mechanism in the new Picopen strongly resists accepting the Fisher refills. You have to wiggle and push the Fisher refills pretty hard to get them past the initial resistance of the new Picopen before they will slide in, and as you do so, it feels as though you might break whatever spring is inside of the new Picopen. Perhaps this problem will fade with time as you put some wear and tear on the new Picopen. I suspect that reason for the difficulty in getting the Fisher pen refills into the new Picopen is because the tip of the Fisher refills are capped--since they're pressurized--whereas the ink refill that comes with the Picopen has a hollow end (see pictures).	1
I really like this pen! I wasn't sure it would be useful at first but I've already been through two refills (cross 8518-4). Twice in the past two years the pen has gotten separated from the top while removing it from my pockets but so far I'm 100% lucky in noticing immediately and finding it.	1
This is a great pen for EDC or your bugout bag, combined with waterproof notebook.  The cap is held in place by a magnet, but only at the writing end, so it doesn't hold the cap while writing.  Also, the cap is wider than the barrel of the pen, so it is harder to tuck in a waterproof wallet with your hunting/fishing tags, so it misses on that purpose.	1
So far, after several month on my key chain, all is good. I've used the pen a few times, but mostly I use it to spin my keys around for fun. I did install a Fisher pressurized ink cartridge so I could write upside down under whipped cream.  UPDATE 3/15/2017- Thought I lost the pen, but found it in my car's trunk. The Fisher refill is DEFINITELY the way to go. The original ink cartridge failed a few times too many. The Fisher always works 100%	1
This is a must have if you are working on a car. If you own a car this should be your first investment whether you are going to work on it or not.	1
great tune up for welding skills	1
great	1
This book includes all types of welding and cutting that someone would do. This book is good for the hobby welder.	1
I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a.  I picked it because of the 2000 publication date.  BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it.  The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate.  The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12.  The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers.  Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it.  There is no info on charging from small cans.  There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging.  Very disappointing.  P.S.  I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.	-1
Great manual.  Helped me rebuild the AC system in my truck when I did not really know what I was doing.  This manual is not fully comprehensive.  It assumes you have some knowledge of how to work on AC systems, so I had to go looking for other sources to make sure I understood what the book was talking about.  If you are a complete noob, be brepared you might need to hit the internet or other resources to get all the info you need.	1
this book works great for the home repairman and it is pretty good info and antone can read it and understand it	1
I hadn't worked on old vehicles for a while so this was helpful.  The price was right and it gave me the basics to do a $600 repair job for $50.	1
Great book with a lot of very useful information about the air conditioning system system in general.  And the charts in the last part of the book with specifications where great.	1
I got more than enough info about my 70s era AC system to ID parts and understand what the parts were and how they do what they do. This has made me confident enough now to seek further info on upgrading my system to modern standards and chemicals. Good job haynes. Several people have complained about this manual not having much info about newer ac systems but I found that before I tried to upgrade I had to know what I was upgrading from. UPDATE- I found someone with this same book but their version does not contain the updates mine does on newer ac systems. I imagine that now only the updated versions are sold but who knows. This may be why some people have complained about the book being outdated.	1
Chilton's is a good reference but I think it's suffering due to availability of so much information off the internet.  Great for finding part numbers, but when it comes to installation & removal using internet videos can be better.	1
Everything you need to work on this car	1
Nissan Altima Automotive Repair Manual: Models Covered : All Nissan Altima..., the perfect tech help when you are DIY repairman, I would definitely order from this company again, thank you	1
Accurate book.	1
Haynes always makes great manuals. Easy to read, easy to follow.	1
I started to buy this manual at a local parts store. But instead I purchased this gently used manual,for a great price. It is in excellent condition. Great deal.	1
i bought this for my wifes 01 Pontiac Montana. she hates that car and wants me to buy her a new one. being the good husband that i am, i just won't do it. i just keep fixing it. its the meanest prank that keeps on going. and this manual has helped me through it. so far it has helped me, change the water pump, starter, flush cooling system, change the alternator, replace head gasket, upper intake gasket, exhaust gasket, pretty much you name it, ive fixed it. i couldn't have done it without this book.	1
The seller packed this VERY well, and the condition was better than I had been led to expect.  I received it quickly, and it is a very handy guide to repairs on my Honda Passport.  All in all, this purchase has been well worth it.	1
It covers many Explorer models and is a little less complete than I expected but the price/condition/shipping cost was EXCELLENT!	1
It's the book in the picture	1
as listed	1
Very good!	1
I'll recommend this product to anyone, My advise to those buying expensive gear is "Stop showing off" an grow up. No one cares what you use and how much you spent on it...the bottom line is quality!	1
Owned a Crown Victoria handed down from my grandfather.  I passed the car on to my cousin before really needing the manual.  4 stars gives the book the benefit of the doubt as I know many people who have other manuals like this for other cars.	1
The 2001 Mercury Grand Marquis Shop manual has all of the data and details I have needed to repair brakes and electrical switches. Since Chilton manuals for the full size Fords aren't easily found this was a good buy	1
great	1
A must have...	1
very nice	1
As Described!	1
Good manual	1
Great book. It has more description for the SOHC v6 and v8 not too much for the DOHC. Not for the south american explorer version.	1
Quick service good price	1
good book	1
Everything was great! book was used but in "like new" condition like stated in description.  I gave 4 stars because it took forever and a day to get to me. I don't know if it was in back order or something but it did come before it said it would. That's easy when it's posts that it'll be here a month from now.	1
Yes, there is more to know, but, having this book is a thorough start to saving money, maintaining our Craigslist bargains!!!  Now, we have all the knowledge at hand!  Thanks for great savings, Local parts houses try to charge $30, plus tax!  Sheesh!	1
bought this for my Ford Explorer as my old manual decided to go missing. so i adopted this new manual! Screw you old Manual!	1
The Haynes manuals are good for the DIY'er who enjoys servicing their own vehicles. These manuals will cover about 90% of most peoples needs. If you are a serious at home mechanic or own a repair shop, these will not meet your needs. For that you will need to step up and pay the price ($100.00 to $300.00) for a Factory Service Manual	1
Bought a 2000 Explorer Sport for our son and the owner's manual was missing.  This is a very good substitute - maybe even better than the original manual.	1
From my first reading and study, I find the information very direct and informative.  Can't wait until I get down and start the actual work.	1
This manual covers things that you can not find on the net. I've used Haynes manuals for years and they a very very good.	1
this book did some realy nice job on helping me fix my 01 explorer sport. good to understand and good to use.	1
This book covers most everything garage mechanics would tackle in their garages.  The directions seem well written.  I have referenced it a couple of times, and it helped out.  The instructions can be a bit short though, and they tend to lack some details.  Navigating the book can be really annoying.  Some instructions stop mid-way, and direct you to a different part of the book.  When looking for something specific, I have ended up flipping through the whole book looking for the directions.  With that said, I don't think their is a better book out there.  It is a good reference books to troubleshoot issues.	1
Haynes manuals have gotten better over the years and this manual is no exception. The torque specifications, torque patterns and images of pertinent areas of repair, made this manual very useful. The price point of this manual makes it an exceptional deal.	1
Like all the other haynes manuals i have purchased this one did a decent job of giving recommendations for maintenance and repair work.  However i always seem to find it lacking details where i need it most (basic repair tasks that seem to be identical between manuals), and having way more details for jobs that i don't care about (totaly engine overhauls, etc. ).  Pros: - Affordable Help for repair work - covers most repair topics you might care about - I have purchased several manuals for cars i have owned and found them all to be helpfull.  Cons: - Says it covers multiple varients of the same model, but often has diagrams for only one of them. - Many of the more common repair tasks (brakes, oil change, body work, etc.. ) are heavily coppied between the vairous Haynes manuals for different models, so often lack spesific details that would be helpfull.  You can usually overcome this with some common sense, but i have found several times wishing i new exactly where something was rather then them assuming i know where it is. - Lacks discussion on common problems encountered during repairs.  Ie, would be nice to have advice on what to try if your break rotors are rusted on, etc. .	1
I was very, very disappointed with this manual.  I bought it to change out my fule injectors.  Information is way too technical for beginners or intermediates.  Too many sections assume you have a working knowledge already.  Pass this one over for the Chilton's version which has step by step instructions with pictures.	-1
When purchasing a "manual" for anything the first thing that you expect is a explode drawing of parts and where the belong. I originally purchased this manual to see how to remove the fascia and chrome for a Road King so that I can fix the steering dampener grommets. The book does not even mention it. Steering dampener is a part that you have to replace after 20K miles, so you would think... No I guess not. The pictures are dark, looking as if the pages were copied not printed, the wording is not clear and the book is way too expensive for what you get. I purchased a Harley frame manual and a service manual and spent almost the same amount for two used books. So far I am not impressed with Haynes manuals and would not suggest purchasing one unless you can see it first.	-1
If you own a Harley you need this!! Having the dealer do work on your bike will put you in the poor house in a hurry.	1
Nice product. Shipping lighting fast.	1
If you own a 88 CI or 96 CI this will help you out. This is a great book with lots of pictures for help guides. I would recommend this book to anyone who owns these styles of bikes as this has awesome information for the common person to understand. Thanks Amazon.	1
Once I became the proud owner of a night train, I knew I needed a go-to for maintenance of my bike. great info on simple maintenance, break down of parts, torque specs, fluids ect. This is not my one stop shop, as I use internet A LOT, but very, very useful for a guy who does all of his own maintaining.	1
its a Haynes repair manual . could use some updating on a few things and more pictures . but overall good book	1
insightful repair manual	1
as promised,	1
as expected.	1
Almost exactly the same as the Chilton Repair Manual.  Both the text and pictures are the same.  Buy the one that is the cheapest. they are both the same.	1
Just what the Doctor ordered  Great item  and service	1
Bought this for my brothers (new to him) truck for his birthday (after his water pump wore out)...  I haven't seen it nor used it (he's 2.5 hours away).  Had it delivered direct to him.	1
A common, entry level maintenance and repair manual speaks for itself.  Haynes sells an acceptable book.  The other publishers have modernized their layouts but the Haynes was the first to do so.	1
Typical Haynes manual, decent photographs, excellent text	1
Great product, described correctly.	1
Why buy it new when it will have greasy fingerprints after first use. GREAT PRICE LOVE IT	1
Excellent	1
great book. covered things i cant find on web..saved me money	1
Product as expected,, good value, quick shipping	1
Came well packed sealed brand new. perfect for working on anything i would ever need to and more. Would highly recommend. Came fast.	1
very nice book	1
Purchased by mistake.  I have a 2001 Outback.	1
Book was well worn, and the pages were yellowed but for the price not a bad deal. It's very handy when I need it to refer to.	1
I've always liked Haynes Manuals in the past, but this one does not include any information about the 6 cylinder engine (H6-30) and thus is useless to me since I have the L.L. Bean Outback with the H6 engine.  I'm really shocked by the omission of an entire engine type, it is totally unforgivable and a tremendous oversight by Haynes.	-1
This is a very typical Haynes manual. Great detail about simple things you could figure out on your own, and then it glosses over complex things that leave you clueless and lost.  That said, I used this manual to work on my Legacy wagon for years before I sold it. I gave the manual to the guy who bought the car from me. It is good for describing things that are unique to Subarus and to the Legacy in particular. It is a great time-saver when you haven't done something before on that type of car. But if you are going to be doing serious repairs on the car, get the manufacturer's service manual instead and save yourself some time and frustration.	1
I have owned 3 Subaru Outbacks, 1996, 1998, and 2004, and I have found this manual to be useful with all of them.  I am only doing the home mechanic types of repairs, so for things like changing and bleeding brakes, spark plugs, fuel filters, thermostats, it has saved me a lot of guess work.  Not sure I would want it if I had to do a timing belt or head gaskets, or any other sort of major engine tear down.  Great manual for GENERAL MAINTENANCE.	1
Good book.	1
very good	1
It's OK	1
VW Passats are hard vehicles to work on.  This repair manual has about everything you need to work on your card except wiring.	1
GOOD MONIES WORTH	1
Cheaper here then at advance auto. Had plenty of good info.	1
GOOD	1
Just as expected.	1
truly a heaven send.	1
Great Price and cheaper than local retailers, as well as others that I shopped online. A must have for Passat owners!	1
I've used Haynes manuals for a number of my vehicles over the years - they're hard to beat for the price and cover pretty much everything a shade-tree mechanic will want to tackle.  For completeness (on VWs), I usually also get the Bentley manual, as well, but they are pricier and not as easy to follow, at times.	1
If you own an Audi or WV and you do work on your own car ( I DONT TRUST SHOPS or STEALERSHIPS) than you will need this and you will be thankful you got. It can be a bit confusing to read at first and everything is black and white no color except for the cover but it has ton of info every nook and cranny you need to know about your car.  I use it for my 2001 Audi A4	1
I am finding this book to be very useful. The book provides troubleshooting advice that I have never received from anyone in the auto repair industry. I recently took my car in to a garage because the check engine light came on. They read the trouble code from the computer, saw that it was related to the cooling system, and immediately recommended that I replace the water pump. And since I was replacing the water pump, I might as well replace the timing belt too. Total cost $2000! The book offers several no-cost/low-cost fixes to try first. This book also suggested replacing the valve core, to resolve a slow leak in a tire. I took the tire to two tire repair shops, and neither one suggested that. It might be because the valve cores cost 50 cents, whereas they could sell me another tire for a lot more. I no longer have any faith in the auto repair industry.  Along with this repair manual, I bought the Roadi RDT55 Diagnostic Trouble Code Reader for Volkswagen and Audi Vehicles with OBDII Vehicle Live Data. I'm very happy with that product too.	1
I bought this manual so that I could do routine maintenance on my 2002 Passat GLS.  I've used other Haynes manuals in the past, so I knew what to expect.  Step-by-step instructions for most tasks, with pictures for the more difficult to understand steps.  Also of note is the recommended maintenance schedule in the front.  If you plan on doing any Passat maintenance on your own, buy this manual!	1
I usually do all the maintenance and repairs on my vehicles.  I have purchased one of these manuals for eash of my vehicles at one point of ownership or the other.  This one is just as expected from a Haynes manual.  Very informative, book is based on a complete tear-down and rebuild.  I trust Haynes books, and they have never let me down.	1
Just as I thought...it tells you how to rebuild the transmission, differential and engine (who is going to do that??) it does not tell you how to do some of the things you are actually going to attempt in your garage.	-1
This was exactly what I was looking for. Has all the information I need to make the repairs on my 2004 Honda Accord.	1
There is really no substitute for the factory service manual.  I did get a copy of the factory manual - it runs about 15$ more than this if you get the electronic version (probably preferable to the paper copy actually - easier to search).  The haynes manual is a few hundred pages - factory manual is over 2000 pages!  So, this manual just won't be as complete.  That said - the haynes manual will probably do fine for most repairs.  The factory manual has diagrams, not pictures, so it's easier to see what the instructions want you to do, and where things are.  However, the pictures really aren't that bad in the Haynes manual.  To those that complain about it - get some reading glasses?  They seem perfectly good to me.  I've seen lots of complaints about the paper being too thin in other reviews.  Sure, it's a bit thinner than perhaps the average book (maybe similar to a newspaper), but still perfectly usable.  If you are ripping the pages or pulling them out of the manual - my question to those that say this sort of thing - have you used a book before?  I've done 3 recent services on our hondas  1) Engine mount replacement 2) radiator flush 3) EGR valve replacement  I used the factory manual instructions to do the mount replacement, but I checked the Haynes manual to see if it was what the factory would recommend.  Engine mount replacement details looked spot-on, it is just how I did it (and actually made the suggestion the factory manual did not - which was instead of using a lift, to support the engine with a floor jack under the oil pan - this worked perfectly for me).  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that you only seem to get the general bolt torque guidance in the front of the manual.  Factory manual specifies an exact desired value per-bolt on their diagrams.  Radiator flush is just the same really as factory manual.  EGR valve replacement was a snap - hardly worth mentioning.  So, from the recent work I've done, the Haynes manual is actually quite good, and lines up pretty well with what I see in the factory manual.  Seems to me that you should be able to perform most services to your car with this manual.  But, if you want the best of the best - you may want to go with the factory service manual (available on amazon).  I give this 4/5 stars, as the factory manual isn't that much more, and is simply more complete.  Solid manual from what I can see though.	1
I saved a lot of money in repair expenses for my Honda. In the book, it has step by step instructions for most of the ordinary auto repairs for my Honda.	1
I had high hopes for this wanted a good manual for my used jeep 2000 SE (TJ) and couldn't find one just for that.  This manual has very poor photo's lacks a lot of detail a shade tree mechanic needs.  If you are very experienced mechanic this would be a 4 star (maybe). Hope this helps enjoy the ride and be safe. That's why you bought a jeep	-1
A little short on detail for some operations.	1
Would be perfect except missing key areas. A basic manual for novice or person with medium knowledge. Print is getting smaller as the wiring diagrams are beginning to be a waste of print-too small.	1
awesome!  good info!	1
was  new and  helpful	1
I have had use with CHILTON, but Chilton I think is more domestic base, because when it came to imports it lack the overall of the vehicle you are working on. In other words, Haynes expresses between 4cycl to 6cycl, 4x2 or 4x4 on repairs; where as Chilton is broad when it says Nissan pickup trucks; and doesn't break it down as far as all pickup trucks are the same; which they are not! Haynes in my opinion individualizes your vehicle; such as Xterra time frame to the frontier time, same chassis and engine. Chilton would have never told me about that, and not thinking of looking at Xterras, only specially frontiers. Also, the price is significantly less with Haynes compare to Chilton.	1
It's what you would expect from a Haynes manual: concise, detailed, pictures of the parts and repairs being done, etc. I've been able to keep my 2001 Frontier on the road now with over 164,000 miles on it, no serious repairs, and all the basic maintenance being done in my home garage.  The book is a little light on the front suspension and some of the optional equipment (i.e. cruise control, fog lights), but otherwise it hits the nail on the head.	1
Excellent Jeep Manual. Easy to follow instructions, diagrams, etc. If you own a Jeep, you should own one of these.	1
Good resource manual	1
its good	1
Manual seems very cheap. The book is very generic to most common problems. The electrical diagrams are helpful for diagnosing. As far as troubleshooting most mechanical problems, this manual won't help.	-1
always on hand if needed.	1
good details and pics, good to have in any garage!	1
Manual not as informative as prior books I bought for other vehicles.  Hayes tries to cover to many years resulting in limited details on specific model/year.  In my opinion not worth buying.  More and better information on Internet.	-1
Finally it has arrived ... I have been looking for a shop manual since my car was born ... very useful photo guides on "how to" ....	1
It is a great Reference for the little few who still take time to work on their own vehicles. A must have for the mechanic of the family. Haynes never lets us down, always providing in depth analysis of the systems and detailed reports and pictures.	1
I was very disappointed.  Photos are and illustrations are not clear and sharp, and so many models and years are covered that it's hard to get more than generic instructions for any procedure.  My 2008 Avalon was treated like an afterthought.  For example, I couldn't find a picture that correctly shows the location of the thermostat, which in this car is hidden down near the camshaft pulley.	-1
This book is a very good book to have for everyday repairs, I have always liked and trusted Haynes repair Manuals, they contain just about every conceivable problem solving situation that might arise. Would definitely buy again.	1
4tv2q34vt23	1
new book. good back up, current info will be better to get from internet	1
If you are familiar with other Haynes manual, this one will not disappoint you. Same level of content and quality as other manuals. Covers everything you need to fix your A4 in your shop.	1
Ok	1
Great all around book	1
I purchased this manual to do a head gasket replacement on my 1999 Wrangler. Haynes was always the resource for serious mechanics many years ago but that has obviously changed. Trying to pack to many vehicles in to one manual is a bad idea for starters. My biggest complaint is that once I had my engine back together I put on a new distributor, rotor, wires and plugs. According to the manual the #1 plug is located in the back. That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and didn't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual. After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers. The first thing I found was several references to #1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been. After 2 minutes to switch the wires around the Jeep fired right up and sounds good. How can you publish a manual with a major error like that?	-1
I keep this in my 2006 Jeep Wrangler LJ Rubicon.  It's well written.	1
I purchased both, Chilton's and Haynes Jeep Manuals as well as the Jeep Owner's Bible. All three are excellent, I would recommend them to anyone even thinking about doing the repair work on your Jeep.	1
Good manual, however some details are missing such as when I needed to repair the trunk release lever cable there was not any information on how to do so and resorted to looking online.  A lot of info is available online these days, but it is nice having a manual next to you when doing repairs or looking up torque specs.	1
It is a very good automotive repair guide.	1
I realize there are several self help DIY mechanical literature available for this specific or even somewhat like vehicles available Bentley, Chilton etc. but I would say, without a doubt that this book is all you need period. sure the other manuals are in color and give you 3000 steps to the point of a headache but for 20$ i can say anyone with basic motor skill functions should be able to get 20 times their moneys worth.	1
Indispensable.	1
As expected.	1
As expected.	1
adequate could use more illustrations for specific jobs	1
ok	1
OK, but not always accurate descriptions.	1
Manual is complete, and does it's job.	1
Out of date and inaccurate information.	-1
Seems to cover quite well even my historic 1993 Camry (did let it go for a good price). But keep this manual as a memento.	1
I truly believe that every car owner should purchase a Haynes manual to go with their car. Even the most seasoned DIY owner can be thrown off by the unfamiliar designs of their new car and owner's manuals can often be lacking in certain critical areas (and as seems to be the very bizarre case with Audi A4s of the B6 and B7 generation, the owner's manuals oftentimes seem to just be lacking- as in totally absent from the car. It's a very well known thing... check it out), so something which goes into deeper detail is a must. Having all the torque specs, gap settings, bolt types, fluid levels, OEM part numbers, etc., a book like this is essential. As simple as Google is to use, it can be frustrating to try and look up torque specs on a car that is known for having a gang of gnomes seemingly roaming around stealing the manuals, then you go onto a forum, ask what the torque specs are, and the first reply you get is "Read the manual"  Even in cases where the manual is there, 99% of what is contained within the pages of the Haynes manual isn't there. If you're just looking to change the plugs and belt on your car, this is the manual for you. If you're looking to rebuild the head and you're comfortable with the job- this is the manual for you.	1
I recommend everybody purchasing a repair manual for any vehicle.  Even if you're not mechanically minded and don't intend on doing any repairs yourself, being somewhat familiar with the inner workings of your vehicle will help you to properly maintain your vehicle as well as assist a professional in properly diagnosing and repairing an issue.  This could save you some bucks down the road and potentially protect you from a crooked mechanic that wants to replace your muffler bearings or flush your blinker fluid reservoir.	1
Fast delivery, as expected, great price.	1
Very helpful reference for most of jobs to perform on the car. Good amount of pictures and detailed procedures make it a must for DIY.	1
Haynes manuals help with the basics plus some moderate maintenance and repair - nothing more.  This guide allows me to save money on those chores I could do myself with a little time and effort, and for that it's easily worth the money spent to purchase.  Are there enough diagrams and/or photos of every operation?  No way.  Could they add tips/tricks to avoid the hidden hassles that arise when taking apart something kind of complex?  Definitely.  Should they have their own online forum for follow up questions by manual users?  Absolutely.  But there are other forums that pick up where the knowledge contained in this guides isn't adequate, so I'm not going to expect this rather affordable guide be everything I need.  For what it is and costs, it's just fine...	1
This is a very good book for those who want to understand the dynamics in his/her car. The packaging was good too.	1
Just the book I wanted	1
Necessity for the garage	1
Just as expected.	1
Good overall review, it helped my fix some of my wiring for the tail lights what a previous owner ruined. It isn't model specific but it helps and is great to have on hand.	1
Even though it lists models to 2011, this has very, very few notes on the JK. Do not buy if you have the JK.	-1
Received on time, book sealed great and not damaged. Have no complaints	1
Everything you need to know about a jeep wrangler and how to save money and repair it yourself. A very good book to have/own which will make things easy.	1
i have owned jeep cherokees and now have a wrangler and even though i know how to repair most things it always helps to have help and this is the ticket. a must have for any vehicle you own.	1
I have used Haynes manuals for all of my vehicles.  They are very informative and have helped tremendously in doing repairs at home (I do almost all of my maintenance and repairs).  Anything I cannot find in the manual (and it does not have everything) I can find on the internet.  For the most part it has the information in it. I would recommend this to anyone interested in doing their maintenance and repairs themselves.	1
it don't tell u much any more most of the stuff u can figer out on by ur self if it get in to any thing hard or really just about any thing that is not normal stuff it tells u to take to a shop well if I had that kind of money I won't need the book	-1
I bought this manual to provide instructions on how to replace the rack and pinion on my car. The instructions worked perfectly. The only problems I had were due to my trying to skip or avoid some of the steps (like dropping the sub-frame). If I had followed the recommendations in the manual, I would have saved time. In the end I did the job just as described in the manual and it worked perfectly. I highly recommend this repair manual.	1
This manual is handy to have on hand and has had everything I have needed it for thus far. I am not one who does everything on my vehicles, but try to do at least some basics and it is clear enough for me to understand for the most part.	1
I have had Haynes shop manuals before.  They are good reference material.  The photos are very helpful.  Will get one for my next car.	1
Great price with tons of information.	1
Always buy a Haynes Repair Manual when purchasing a used car.	1
Very  good  information	1
Exactly as advertised.  Easy transaction.	1
I don't think there is another book like it.	1
Supplies most of the information you'll ever need in dealing with a running vehicle.	1
As with most of these manuals they cover several models so everything you want for a particular model may not be there but still a lot of good pics and helpful info. I would recommend to have on hand.	1
Helpful manual and $10 cheaper than the local auto parts stores	1
I wish more details/instructions are provided. Bought it for a radiator replacement job but the book has not provide much details except barely mentioning obvious things such as remove fans before removing the radiator and don't forget to add coolant afterwards. I had to remove a front bar and all of the plastic covers to get access to the radiator fittings and non of that was mentioned in the book. Forget the pictures... I want my money back.	-1
Great to have on hand.  Lots of good basic maintenance information, and as a supplement for big jobs.	1
a concise and informative text	1
excellent book	1
Another coin for the collection	1
really helpful when working on my car	1
It's not as good as a manual made specifically for the Honda crv but it works good enough for me to do maintenance and general repairs on the car.	1
Its ok for a general manual but Haynes should really pick it up with higher quality illustrations.	1
good reading	1
typical Haynes manual - good, but not as detailed as the factory service manuals.  But it is a lot cheaper and easier to get.	1
Provides very useful information for most repairs, particularly interior trim removal without damaging trim parts. I find the books layout a little difficult but manageable.	1
Awesome!! First repair saved me big bucks and lot of guess work..... Money well spent!!	1
Saves time and money of needing to go to the garage to get the car looked at. most fixes are simple enough to do at home	1
I've bought a couple of these manuals for cars before and am familiar with the level of information you get for what is a pretty low price, ... but this particular manual is a new low.  I own an 08 Civic Si and there is very little model specific information.	-1
Not much info on the civic.	-1
:)	1
Mechanics of all skill levels have to love Haynes manuals!	1
Handy reference. Will pay for itself the first time you use it.	1
Looks of good info, the stand alone photos of different parts is very helpful. 1 star off for using too many layman terms.	1
Contains comprehensive instructions and decent photos describing regular jobs and some more complicated ones. Pretty accurate for what I've used it so far. If you work on your car yourself get one it can only help.	1
Everything you need to about your civivc if you want to do your own work. Simple, easy to understand and complete. All torque specs and all repairs you'll ever do are covered.	1
Does what you need it to do.	1
Haynes manuals are always a good choice for car enthusiasts and the DIY crowd.  For this particular edition I wish Haynes would stop combining the CRV and the civic into one book. It is highly unlikely to provide any savings to a customer and it lends itself to less helpful generic work description and potential confusion.  I also use the Chilton guide and find them often comparable or more detailed.	1
Haynes dose it all the time very well writen as it allways is. Very easy to reed & understand as allways	1
I've used Haynes manuals for a long time. I like the notes pages so I can keep track of maintenance and repairs.	1
With factory suggested maintenance of just checking the fluids and changing the oil until 36,000 miles, with just an air filter replacement at that point, I'll do my own maintenance with the guidance offered in this manual.  The paper is very thin (telephone book like).  So be sure to photocopy the pages you need to use as references at the car.	1
The first thing I purchase when I get a new car is the Haynes manual.  While I haven't torn an engine completely apart in years, these manuals have enough information to enable you to do so.  They are usually great for performing almost any job on the car.  Notice on this manual it is for Civic and CR-V.  Most of the manual is dedicated to the CR-V and mentions the Civic is "similar".  Also, my Civic is an EX which has an LED 3rd stop light, which I had to replace.  This manual did not contain information for replacing this light (it is very unlike the light in the other trim models), and I had to get the information through Google.	-1
Covering large ranges of models (In this case two main models and three separate model generations for each) is complex, and shortcuts have to be taken. Haynes always makes a good manual, and this one is no exception. But don't expect hand-holding of a 'youtube video' level. You'll have to be able to think your way through the repairs. But it gives technical details that are hard to find in an authoritative way elsewhere. A good value.  Every car owner should have the Haynes manual for their vehicle.	1
What more can you say, It's a brand new book still sealed ready for your mechanical adventures. Definitely an informative book and could possibly save you thousands of dollars if you are willing to follow simple instructions.	1
I have a Haynes manual for every vehicle I own. These manuals go in depth from top to bottom front to back. They contain wiring diagrams, troubleshooting guides, photos, step by step instructions, etc. If you make repairs yourself or want to diagnose a problem, this manual is for you. The manuals are written based on a complete teardown of the vehicle.	1
These books atre always a good idea since I traveled far and wide and have had problems in small towns and this book has actually helped the mechanic.	1
Very detailed Good choice to use to repair you HHR	1
Must have for HHR owners	1
as stated	1
very detailed book. Love it	1
Product as described. Smooth transaction.	1
if you have the SS model of the HHR, this is not the manual for you.  None of the photos are for the SS and the written descriptions of the SS repair procedures are incomplete (at best), missing steps or just plain wrong	-1
Will cme in very handy...AAAA+++	1
Haynes did a great job on this book. very informative and easy to read and understand.	1
Its a manual manual. What else can i say.	1
As stated well packed	1
i have had haynes or chiltons manuals for every vehicle we've owned for many years now other than for our jaguar and that we just leave to the dealership. when we picked this vehicle, the hhr we got it as a running around vehicle. i assumed it would be simple to find a manual and do all those things i am used to doing so we don't have to drive all the way into town for every little thing. but i was so wrong, checked three different auto parts stores in person and online and none carried haynes or chiltons for the hhr. checked the dealer, no, checked online with the hhr owners forum said none were available. even checked with amazon online granted it was last may but still i hoped but no such luck. then on a whim i checked again two weeks ago and there she was. i didn't hesitate to buy it and literally as soon as had mine ordered the other had been sold as well. i just got the manual in the mail yesterday and could not be happier. i have absolutely no plans to rebuild the engine or tear into the electronics but no i can at least change a headlight bulb, aim the headlights, swap out the oil filter, cabin air filter, the very difficult to figure out access to the engine air filter, capacities and so many other things i don't have to rely on others to do for me now as well as saving a small fortune in labor costs to do things i am perfectly capable of doing now with haynes in hand! unless you have a vehicle like a jaguar or range rover for example you really must have a manual like this. it is the best investment for the dollar you can make in your vehicle imho.	1
If you have the Mazdaspeed 3 this book does NOT have any coverage of this vehicle. There's no mention of turbos, intercoolers, or any model specific items. General maintenance might be ok, but it doesn't show you how to remove the turbo or intercooler to get access to what's underneath.  If you have a Mazda 3, then this book will be just fine like any other Haynes manual.	-1
good	1
I got the factory manuals when I bought my Optima in 2004 since I figured on keeping the car until the wheels fall off.  The problem with the factory manuals is that it assumes I know something, the Haynes doesn't.  Plus the Haynes has lots of pictures, and each one can be worth a thousand words.	1
It must be that they have attempted to cover too many model years and not even one completely.  I bought the book to perform automatic transmission and differential maintenance. The 7B Automatic transmission section is 4 1/2 pages in total. One page is dedicated to leaks, a second to shift linkage and a third to general operation and specifications.  It even says "this Chapter contains only those procedures related to general diagnosis, routine maintenance, adjustment and removal and installation." The book is only slightly more useful than the vehicles Owners Manual.  Older issues actually showed where the differential drain and fill plugs were located. This one does not even do that.	-1
not helpful fir tdi owners as it only covers gas models and has irrelevant verbiage and pics. don't waste ure money	-1
Excellent	1
A handy manual when doing little repairs.	1
Good information and pretty well illustrated. Better than other manuals I have purchased for other vehicles. Invaluable for timing belt service. Worth the $s.	1
Great book for a fraction of the cost of the factory book.  I always try to repair my 2007 GTI myself if at all possible because the VW dealer is SO EXPENSIVE!!	1
Good book for the do it yourselfer. Not an detailed shop manual but detailed enough to accomplish most jobs. I needed OBDII codes and instructions on removing and replacing front axles and I found them in here.	1
good info	1
Easy to read and understand, good IPB's and resonable price.  Pays for itself in one job.	1
Wanted this to do some basic maintenance and repair to my CTS. Standard issue Haynes manual, has all the basics to suit my needs.	1
Something you need if you are set to do your own work on your Mini Cooper it's a must have and it's very detailed!	1
The manual arrived in perfect condition within a week and now I have the information to replace the engine in my daughter's car.	1
awesome	1
its just like new love it	1
This manual PLUS the videos that you can find on Youtube will allow you to perform most tasks on the car. The manual won't stand alone in some cases and needs the additional detail. For simpler tasks it's great.  But the engine compartment is SO tight that vids help a lot.	1
Good Haynes manual. Hope I never have to tear down my engine but if I do, this will weok just fine.	1
very informative,when i have a problem with my mini i now have a reference.glade i bought it.	1
Good general reference.	1
Great information... Already saved me lots of $$$$$$$$	1
awesome	1
lots of info	1
usual Haynes manual	1
The big stuff - I let the dealership deal with as I don't have a hoist & been living in apts with no garages - but small everyday maintenance items I'll gladly jump on - manuals like this are great to have around as a quick reference.	1
The only improvments to be made to Haynes manuals are picture quality, quantity and color.  Other than that they are clear concise and the best read for anyone who loves to love their car!	1
I was not aware that Haynes or anyone else had put out a book on Mini Coopers. I was purchasing oil filters and this showed up. It is essential for any Mini owner as the manufacturer will tell you nothing except take it to a dealer where they will scalp you.	1
This book is simply what everyone need if you like to play with you Mini your self and not leave all the fun to the dealer. Recommended!	1
Pictures are informative and instructions are straight forward. Helps me keep my vehicle in good maintenance. Would recommend.	1
Work Great	1
ok	1
Haynes Manuals used to be good, or so I thought. I found better information on Youtube.  Don't waste you money on this book as I did.	-1
Great manual to have for anyone or any car.	1
Bought this for my son-in-law who has a 4Runner.  From what I can tell he really liked it as he does a lot work done on his 4Runner himself.	1
The photos in this manual are the poorest I've ever seen with fuzzy gray on gray images that don't show much detail. There isn't much technical detail either and the wiring diagrams are hopelessly incomplete. It's not bad as a starter manual but you couldn't use it for any complicated repairs.	-1
Repair book is as advertised, shipped quickly, no problems. The book goes a little deeper into the mechanics of the 4-Runner than I need, but is several steps above the owner's manual for routine servicing.	1
Still wish these would come with a CD that had some sort of program to load on a computer and help better identify items.	1
Not as in depth as required for a beginner diesel owner of a 6.7L Cummins Turbo.  Great for maintenance but will not be your only reference if you are trying to replace ball joints, replace crappy oem interior parts (power seat and window motors), Ccv and erg issues.	-1
It's a great book to have covers most of the entire truck... nearly identical to the Haynes book, except its bigger and the chapter table of contents are listed by section rather than alphabetically based on the subject which makes it more difficult to locate a particular subject within the chapter... also, they use the same pictures in both books.	1
As usual, the Haynes manual is pretty indispensable. Lots of good information here, and as always:  "Installation is the reverse of removal", haha.	1
Lots of information, and a good troubleshooting guide	1
- cheapest of all chevy colorad repair manuals -arrived fast - It has every step for you to completely disassemble and reassemble an entire Chevy Colorado	1
This book has pages like those in a phone book and the images are very hard to make out (all black and white). You could print this all out on your home printer from a digital copy and end up with better quality. Automotive repair manuals need to be able to stand up to dirt, grease and frequent handling. I'm not impressed with it at all. I'd like to see a mechanic under the hood of a car fumbling around with their Kindle, give me a break!	-1
This is a must have manual for any car owner.  Just buy the one the is specific to your vehicle, obviously.  This is very detailed and walks you through how to fix, repair, or replace almost anything on your vehicle.  pictures are black and white, and a little grainy but the explanation is very simple to follow.  Maybe new versions will have better picture quality, but it's not enough for me to deduct a star.	1
Great	1
Good for do=it=yourself	1
Great for any weekend warrior. It would be nice if the pictures were in color but its pretty detailed.	1
just as described good manual	1
I keep my cars forever so it makes sense to purchase these manuals. It isn't a shop manual with pictures and specs for all 20000 parts of the car, but it helps a lot!	1
I had been waiting for this to come out as the online services were a bit out of my price range.  The only thing I can think of that would be a nice addition would be wiring schematics to go with the wiring diagrams	1
Excellent product, I highly recommend it	1
Good price.	1
Product has become so cheap.  I remember when the Haynes Repair Manuals of the past had some weight to them.  You could thumb through the pages and not worry about getting grease or tearing them.  Now the paper is recycled thin sheets.  Not worth the money either for content.  I'm no mechanic, but found a lot better "how to" information online.	-1
I have had one of these for every car I have ever had. They are very helpful for vehicle specific issues.	1
Outrageously bad. **None of the wiring diagram are for the 3rd gen (2010-2012) Prius. They just have 2nd gen diagrams and say "2004 and later".** Some procedures are just wrong. For example, to check the thermostat they say to see the engine temperature displayed on the dash. The 2010 Prius does not display the temp so clearly the authors did not even go through the procedure themselves. Scumbags. F***ing scumbags.	-1
great	1
Great book for my husband to use. Covers a lot of repairs	1
I found this manual to be vague and very general.  The spark plug change procedure isn't applicable to the 2011 Prius.  It make me question the usefulness of the rest of it's procedures.	-1
I bought specifically to help me in changing out both water pumps.  Not as detailed as I would have hoped for.  Pictures are fuzzy and mostly useless.  I looked up a few other tasks that I had planned for the near future and the guide was as equally disappointing for them.  You are better off saving your money and looking stuff up on youtube.	-1
This book claims to be based on "a complete tear down and rebuild," yet the book is silent on the single most important component of the Toyota hybrid system... the hybrid battery. This book was useless for my DIY high voltage battery repair job. I got further with information available online and in the Toyota Prius tech manuals. Avoid this book.	-1
I loved this repair manual, it was really quite helpful. I wish there was a little more detail in some steps, but overall was plenty enough for the job. I will be buying a second one because I had the unfortunate timing of starting a brake pad and rotor replacement as a thunderstorm was setting in, and my manual got soaked by the rain.	1
My bible for getting info about my car never leave home without it.	1
Handy to have for that extra info you need for simple repairs.	1
it tells me every thing to work on my 2010 outback.	1
I was hoping this manual would have more detailed information for repair work but it's more of an overview of everything in the car. It's still a good resource to have on hand.	1
It's a good manual but no comparison with the Subaru factory manual...	1
Learned a few things using this. Lots of good info in this.	1
Arrived as described. The only thing I would suggest is laminated pages to protect it from the tears of having to constantly repair your Subaru.	1
havent really gotten into it yet but from just skimming through the pages, it looks like it will come in handy in the future	1
Nice book.  I have many Haynes manuals and they are very easy to understand.  All the specs you need to overhaul engine and lots of info on the cars.	1
If you do any DIY on your car, a Haynes manual will come in handy. I've bought one for every car I've ever owned and have never regretted the purchase.	1
awesome book since they have no chilton	1
Promptly mailed and expertly packaged. It does not cover the new Impreza model from 2012 to the present, only the WRX and STi version with different sportier components ( 2 very different automobiles). To my knowledge there has yet to be made a repair manual for the modern Impreza from any publisher. Should you have an Older Impreza 2011 and older, you will love this book for the large amount of information printed.	1
I'm glad about this book. I like sometimes do some jobs and this book is a very good gide when you doing something on your car. giorgi	1
I've never been very happy with haynes manuals. I should have known better. Specific repairs to systems such as the parking brake are completely missing. I miss the old chilton books that were twice as thick as these and covered anything you would need to know. I'd probably just stick to google and youtube and skip buying this book.	-1
Haynes Manuals are the way to go. This one is thinner than the others I've received, but still has all the good stuff I need. Planning to replace the radiator first!	1
Haynes manuals are always pretty good.  Yeah, there are a few things missing, and sometimes the descriptions/pictures area  little vague.  But I generally don't start a project on any of my cars without one of these manuals on hand.  Lots of videos online nowadays, but it's good to cross reference those against a good source like this before starting on anything complicated.	1
good to have for every vehicle you own	1
Very handy. Explains in detail.	1
everybody knows Haynes... very good reference.	1
Never thought I'd find one at this price. I would buy again.	1
I prefer Haynes to Chilton's, and I don't even start anything anymore without a manual.	1
New and on time	1
Good car repair manual. Fast delivery.	1
Good information and excellent shape	1
Just what I need for my wife's new used car. Thank you everything was great	1
really lacking detail.  I bought it primarily to help diagnose an intermittent AC control issue and it was pretty much no help.  I found better info (wiring diagrams etc) online	-1
just what I needed.	1
typical Haynes manual.  pretty good.	1
does it's job	1
Many years ago I used to buy repair manuals from Haynes, but at this time I was disappointed with the book. I was looking for a very simple information on spark plug replacement on my 4 cyl. 2010 Tacoma. The spark plugs are comcealed with a plastic cover, but there was no information on how to remove it. The manual also had pictures of worn spark plugs with eroded tips and instructions on gapping the tips. The spark plugs on most new Toyotas are the new type long life  iridium plugs with fine center wire and not recommended for regapping. Some of the black and white pictures in the book are very low quality with hard to see details.	-1
As advertised	1
I had previously only purchased Chilton Manuals but found the Haynes has more detail.  Wish some of the pictures were in color, especially the wiring diagrams but have used the book the way it is.  If I could only find out how to remove or repair my windshield wiper sprayer.  I could not locate the sprayer in the book.  Luckily, the sprayer mysteriously started working once I took out this book within view of the car!!	1
Detailed and easy to follow. If you plan on working on your Yota this manual will help you out	1
Typical, well done Haynes manual	1
Fantastic!	1
Great Product	1
good information update to 2016	1
As always the perfect companion for the home mechanic. I have been able to work on these complicated machines with the help of this manual fearlessly. Highly recommended for DIY owner/mechanic especially if you are far from the protective dealer network.	1
Nice manual and has a surprise section that details the history of the BMW GS Model from inception to current year!!	1
If you are looking for this manual then you should already know why you are buying it. If not, then you should understand that Haynes service manuals are some of the most trusted in the world.	1
Starts with carb basics and ends with EFI systems. A little too deep, no make that a lot too deep, for the casual reader but it does cover all you ever wanted to know on the topic. Even so, I got a better understanding about how fuel systems work and why they got more complicated over time. Now if I can just put that new knowledge to work...	1
The book is full of information, but alittle behind the times. Like everything fuel systems get modern. This book is a great starter book for those who are learning the basic's on older motorcycles.	1
This product seems to work well. Cleaned debris off the cushions before painting them	1
The only way to properly paint your dashboars	1
I bought the prep spray along with the vinyl marine paint to resurface my seats on my boat and I am extremely pleased.  Follow the directions for prepping with this spray and then apply the vinyl paint and you will get coverage that looks like new and it has so far lasted a year with great results.  I has significant mold and other stains on my seats and I restored them to like new condition.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has stained or weathered vinyl seats on their boat.	1
Loved it! First time I have had a rain suit for the Shovel Head. Rained for 400 miles and the only parts that got wet were my face, hands and boots. There was no rain blown up my sleeves or down the neck. Several commented on how well they could see me.	1
Cons: When I opened the package I immediately saw defective stitching on the shoulder.  Not sure how this wasn't caught during quality control.  Cost me $10 in shipping to swap with the manufacturer.  Then, after first use the stitching that attaches the suspenders to the waist came apart.  Not worth another $10 to return.  The cuffs at the wrists are crazy-huge.  When strapped down to their smallest size the cuff is still waaaay bigger than my entire fist. Very unusual fit.  No way to get a tight fit around any wrist.  Pros: Comes with a nice storage pouch.  Bright colored.  Seems water to be tight.  Good venting in back + wide wrist cuffs = good venting.	-1
This rain suit is just what I needed.  The material is breathable and has a mesh inner lining to help airflow.  The pants fit just right and have a reinforced rear end for wear and tear and reinforced inner legs for engine heat.  Here's what I was looking for and this suit had it: A full velcro flap on the front of the jacket. A velcro collar with a corduroy liner and a concealed hood Velcro cuffs A drawstring waist and jacket bottom Highly visible during reduced visibility rain storms The pants come with bootstraps to keep them down and zippers by the cuffs to allow ease in putting on and taking off. 3M reflective striping throughout the top and bottom Suspenders to keep the pant waistband up and under the coat.  If you get a one-piece suit you'll be most protected since there's no break in material.  If you have a two-piece suit you don't want rain coming in between the pants and the coat.  So it was important to me to find a set that had suspenders or a bib on the pants to keep them tucked up under the coat.  These do just that.  As for fit, I'm 5'11" 185lbs.  I wear a medium in most clothing.  I wanted a suit that would fit over my clothes.  So I ordered a large.  A large on my frame fits over my jeans perfectly.  The rain coat fits perfectly over my leather jacket.  If I were to just wear the rain coat over my shirt, I would want a medium.  But because I always use my leather coat when riding, I needed a large size suit to go over my leather jacket.  The collar is the only snug part of the jacket.  It probably should be the only snug part anyway to keep rain from running down your neck.  Mobility is fine in the suit.  I can twist my torso and look over my shoulders with very mild resistance from the material.  Bottom line: This 2-piece suit is a good buy.  It has suspenders to keep the pants up.  It's high-visibility green.  It fits great over clothes and a leather jacket.  The inner mesh liner provides adequate breathability.  The price is reasonable compared to other competitors.  I have NOT rain tested this material.  But I'm familiar with the material in general and believe it will provide acceptable coverage.  The product claims to be seam-sealed so that no water will leak in.  If it ends up leaking one could easily buy some seam sealing glue from your local Camping store.	1
Great fitting, great looking rain Gear. A little thick in package.	1
Used under many heavy rains and never got wet. Works great. It's very comfortable. I would recommend this rain suit to a friend.	1
true to size, great look and price.	1
I was not happy with this rain suit, after inspecting it I didn't think much of the material. The fit was less than desirable. I guess I'm just hard to please. Or do I just want my money's worth.	-1
Thank you	1
looks, fix and feel good, although I have not have the chance to use them, I'm looking forward to see how they work so stay tune	1
XL fit perfectly at 5'10", 205lbs, 46" chest and 32" waist.  Thicker than I anticipated.  A bit harder to stuff into a small space, but I'm sure they will last longer as well.	1
Came Fast, Fits great...needed for the coming storms...got it quick!!! Wore it in a Hugh Downpour and came out of it Bone Dry!!!	1
Just got it so I can only comment on the feel and look...and both are very good. It's not your lightweight, plastic rain gear. I got the 3X so I could wear it over outer heavy clothing but it's a little snug in the waist; I'm hoping there's enough adjustment in the stretchable waist band to let it out.	1
good fit  so far so good though haven't been in a real down pour. that will be ultimate test. have to be cautious of pipes of cost, had a lil melting when i grazed it.  didn't go thru so held it own.	1
Great item	1
This thing keeps me completely dry in the Florida rainstorms. I just wish that A-I could get smaller pants as I'm only 5'4 and B-The pants totally unzipped to make it easier to put on with boots. It does get you warm, but I was surprised at how cool it keeps you while riding. That was a nice plus. I highly recommend and the material is really nice and you will be seen at night in this.	1
The item arrived earlier than expected and was just as described in the product description. I haven't had touse the rain suit and I hope I never have to. It's the type of thing you buy for "just in case." The price was right as well.	1
Great space filler that will impress a lot of people a true double take eye catcher, Great purchase on these decals.	1
Exactly what I wanted	1
Very good quality product.	1
Great Customer Service. Great Product for the Price you pay for. Thanks fellas	1
Looks very sporty on my car	1
Just exact what i want..	1
No	1
Can't beat it for the price... Awesome	1
Hee hee too cute! A gift for my daughter and she loved it!	1
Love the looks I get....fits in with my attitude most days.	1
I can only say the product I received from cloud works were superb. Also I had a little trouble with one of the item and cloudworks took care of the problem at no time. I don't usually writes review, but they deserve this good one from me.	1
Very Nice Decal.. Looks Great on My Accord.. Very sharp.. Well Made, especially for the price.. Would buy again from them..	1
great price fast shipping A+A+A+	1
as advertised	1
Looks great on my Honda civic 2006 color black!, thanks	1
love it on the van looks good	1
WILL ORDER AGAIN	1
Small but okay does the job	1
Awesome but TAKE YOUR TIME I PUT MINE CROOKED HAHA	1
Great price and high quality sticker...	1
I cut off the 'i' because my Accord has plain vtec and it looks like it came from the factory like this ~ vtec just kicked in yo	1
Came ripped in half the first time. I contacted the seller through email and they were amazing. They sent me some more free of charge and I would recommend the decals to anyone with a Honda. The decals are a little tricky to get off the backing but just peel slowly and it'll peel correctly. Looks of great quality	1
Great quality, perfect size, factory look. Highly recommend.	1
what I wanted.	1
one of the letter didint come off had to do it myself other then that good decal	1
looks awesome and the price was great	1
Good quality decals!	1
Looks great thanks!	1
Good adhesion. Makes car stand out.	1
arrived on time. very good product.	1
Looks good	1
Very nice and great adhesion, looks like the real thing!	1
They are just what I wanted. They look great on the car!!!  Thanks'...  Duane	1
great	1
love it	1
Very Happy with this Decal, sticks too the 4wheeler great.	1
The decals are detailed and have crisp lines. I haven't applied them yet, but they look well-made. The vinyl looks like it is good quality.	1
Excellent	1
Was Great	1
High quality sticker. Weather proof, sticks well and the color is as advertised.	1
This is for the 3"x5" sticker, nice quality. I ordered the smaller ones and those were junk, peeled apart after a month.	1
Good quality (thick material and bright colors), good price and fast, free delivery	1
Great quality sticker	1
Great sticker at a great price, shipping was fast and the colors are brilliant, bought multiple stickers and shipping was combined so I am very pleased, thanks again	1
good quality, as described	1
Get off my back Jack.  Great sticker, says what I want.	1
I bought this decal for the back of my Cherokee and it has lasted about four years. It's only now beginning to peel at the edges, but that's a pretty good run for a Jeep parked outside all year in Florida's sunshine and heat. The colors haven't faded at all.	1
Good shipping, packaging and on time. The decal seems of good quality. The South Florida sun will determine as to what quality it really is. As of now I like the detail and quality. I like that it is made in the USA. I would recommend it.	1
I love this bright yellow flag sticker.  It's just large enough for when a Tea Party hating person rides your bumper in traffic to see as you're flashing them "a sign"....  What else to say, it comes off the backing paper easily, it didn't run in the car wash.  Get one, get 100 for family and friends!  You won't find THIS sticker in the vast majority of stores.  Even my local "flag store" is censoring the message and not carrying this......	1
Great sticker	1
Looks way better in person, this display picture is ugly.	1
I really like this Decal great quality it was more than i expected to be and I will get some more soon and yeah i will recommend anyone to purchase from this seller.!! and they do have fast delivery.!	1
Really nice sticker, great color, thick vinyl that should last on my sons car	1
Nice	1
It's pink not red	-1
Great thick sticker.	1
It looks awesome! Colors are bright and the bear is full of detail. Actually, the bear posted on this ad isn't even close to my vinyl decal, because the bear on my vinyl decal looks real lol with full vibrant colors and great detail! Looks sick on my Prius :)	1
So I'm very happy with the quality of Flag It products. Flag It's quality is far and away better then other sticker companies.	1
Love it!	1
Seems like a very durable sticker, looks great on my truck window!	1
Perfect for my truck	1
I am a native Texan and a Texas State employee who grew up in the Austin area and now live in Dallas. My education, college, career, family security, and retirement benefits are all from the Great State of Texas so I proudly display the flag on my vehicle's rear window. Sticker is nice size, well made, and colors are very rich and deep. Good value!	1
Item was exactly as shown and shipped promptly, will use again. THANX!!!	1
Great decal 100% recommend it looks great!	1
Great quality! Once I received it I ordered 3 more to stick on my tool boxes and yeti cooler.	1
Looks awesome I put these on each side of my trailer fenders and they are good size quality and color and they are made in USA. Fast fast shipping specialty emprorium is one of the best sellers I've dealt with on Amazon thanks	1
Good quality.	1
Looks great 5 star perfect size	1
Nice flag decal.	1
Nice shinny, professional looking sticker. I have put this on my jet ski and it has been holding up very well.	1
very nice adhesion, was not difficult to apply and very easily removed bubbles thanks!	1
So Awesome!!! Placed on the rear window of my FJ Cruiser! Speedy Shipping and Easy straightforward application!	1
Very nice stickers!	1
Product has great color and package came with no problem. size was accurate and quality is on point. recommend product	1
Same as it ever was, just like the barrel my grandmother had in her toy box.	1
Seems smaller than I remember as a child, probably because I'm bigger. Just as fun.	1
Yes, the shipping is almost as much as the product itself and Yes, they're are only twelve monkeys in a little barrel, but darn it all, this is the gift that my 2-year-old grand-daughter played with the most at Christmas.	1
than the traditional barrel of monkeys and they are blue rather than red. My daughter loves that she has 2 different colors now and more monkeys to hang on cabinet knobs and such.	1
great replacement	1
Wish I new about the aftermarket batteries before getting this one. They're about the same quality wise, and half the price.	1
Great replacement	1
arrived fast. I followed instruction and charging and it works great.	1
exact replacement	1
Good Batteries	1
Update 4/10/2018:  The battery still has the sides caved in a large amount.  In the last 1.5 years, this battery has seen only than 45 minutes of actual use since the battery barely powers the truck, and Fisher Price has repeatedly ignored my attempts to contact them.  It is topped up once a month with a Noco 6v charger.  In the future I will avoid Fisher Price/Power Wheels ride on toys completely and advice friends and family to do the same.  Original: The battery I received has the sides sucked in more than 1/4 inch.  Makes we wonder how long the battery will last.  Contacted Fisher Price but they have ignored me for 3 months now.	-1
less than half the price that TOYS-R-US charged .........excellent value	1
These are perfect replacements for our Power wheels, we needed a second one due to recent increased activity :)	1
You could get a cheaper one... Put custom connectors on.	1
Excellent Product.  Excellent Price.	1
Great	1
fantastic price for the battery, if you buy this same OEM battery at a big box toy store it'll cost you around $90.00 buy it on amazon and save yourself some money! performs as expected.	1
Five stars because it was much cheaper than going to my local famous toy store to buy the replacement battery.  Fit perfectly in my son's caterpillar dump truck.	1
just fine	1
Great direct replacement battery for your power wheels. Just be sure to check your model and the style battery connector that you need. This battery was kind of vague on the connector type.	1
Didn't really hold a charge long.	-1
As described. Works great	1
works great	1
No problems, takes and holds a charge. Used with a power wheels type car for the grandkids.	1
We bought this so we'd have a backup battery for our toddler's Power Wheels vehicle. It works great.	1
great price	1
Just what I needed	1
our old battery lasted about 5 years, so it was time to buy a fresh one. once this came in we tossed it on the charger over night and the 150 rove like new again. great price for a great product.	1
great	1
fit perfectly jeep operates like new	1
used this battery to modify my kids jeep.  works great!	1
Works as described	1
ok they don't last that long	1
works great	1
Works Great	1
Battery works great. Seems to last longer than my son's attention span when driving the car. Just a side note, after doing my research, I thought this was the proper replacement battery for the Lightening McQueen car. It is not. The connector didn't match what was on the car. Being a bit handy I was able to make my own connector for both the car and the battery so it wasn't a big problem. Just make sure that this connector matches the one on your car or truck.	1
The battery holds a great charge and my nephew get hours of fun out of his jeep.  I would purchase this battery again.	1
great price, great option to give new life into a hand me down toy. it has been over a year since buying and still going strong. just wish that it did not take so long to re-charge.	1
My son has racked up the miles on the original battery and this replacement keeps him going strong. I expect a year of driving out of this one too	1
went to buy this at a local store only to discover the battery was already past the expiration date.  Received this one, gave it a full charge and its works great.	1
Battery is what's required for the 4 wheeler. Plugs right in and works fine. My 3 year old grandson has no trouble taking it in and out and charging it. It takes over night to fully charge it and he puts it on early in the morning and plays with it on and off most of the day. He has a lot of fun playing with the 4 wheeler. Then he puts it on the charger for the next day. I'm sure if he rode it constantly, it would run down quicker, but I could buy another battery in that case. The price is good. I recommend buying it if you need it.	1
FOrtunately, package still had two batteries as ordered. I plugged them to charger and they charged right away OK. Will put them in Dora the Explorer and test tomorrow. Will throw old battery away, since charger seems to work OK.	1
Considering this battery costs $30/ea. + tax at local Wal-Mart and other stores, $27/ea. that I've paid for this (including shipping) is not bad.  I've saved few bucks and time of getting to a Wal-Mart to shop.  The product worked as advertised but I wish it was packaged a little better. The two batteries I've ordered were shipped in a box with few pieces of news papers; nothing else for protection. Batteries were scratched (fortunately the plastic case did not crack) but work fine.  To me, this showed the merchants lack of care/attention to detail, and does not deserve a 5-star.	1
Make sure you get the right one (6V or 12V) and the right connector. This was a direct replacement for the original battery that died after a few years of use. It works well and holds a good charge. Don't forget to charge your battery after each use and over the winter for longer life.	1
the battery was exactly as described and fit into the car as expected. the price was great and the battery holds the charge for a long time, even sitting idle.	1
Even though it was sold with a particular product as an extra battery, it isn't, and it doesn't fit into that product. Conveniently, it's not returnable either.	-1
This battery was a perfect replacement for my son's F-150.  Half the price of one in the store and perfect performance.  Shipped quickly too.	1
I hate to admit this, but as I was driving to work one morning a gentleman was dragging a Harley Davidson power wheel (PW) to the curb. I have a 2 year old and those PW vehicles can be pretty pricey. So, I stopped and asked if it worked. The man said it did but it needed a battery and batteries for PW are really expensive. Needless to say my next stop was to Amazon, which had the PW battery for far less than I could have bought it any store. Very happy.	1
My grand daughter, at age 5, had the previous battery in her Fisher Price pickup truck for 3 years.  I reciently bought this additional battery and a fast charger so she can run longer. This battery works just as well as the original.  It is the same size and has the same connector.  This battery is a good value. After 2 years it is still going strong.	1
If you have any power wheel and your kid(s) love it, then you know you need to keep one backup around. I certainly needed it. Nothing worse than the kids are happy playing and the car goes real slow and then dead.  Amazon's price for this battery is around $10 cheaper than retail stores locally. It's a no-brainer for me.	1
This toy battery does not fit all Fisher Price riding toys even if the picture looks like it is exactly the same. Verify the battery amps NOT just volts by calling the Fisher Price toll free telephone number. Fisher Price customer service representive will be able to assist you with a local purchase option. Amazon will not accept a return if it is incorrect for "safety reasons". Verify and re-verify before purchasing.	-1
Makita makes quality products and this is another.  Use a buffing/polishing pad spur-type cleaner instead of a screwdriver to clean the residual compound buildup for lasting use.	1
I own a used car lot, we do a lot of detailing...do you want to correctly polish your vehicles?? This is the bonnet for you. Simple huh!? -Jim	1
As buffing pads go the quality of this pad is good. It is thick and does not wear as fast as lesser pads.	1
Great!	1
Work great. Cleans up nice and maintains fluffiness	1
Very good polisher	1
This is a great replacement for the bonnet that comes in the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Makita-9237CX3-7-Inch-Variable-Speed-Polisher-Sander-with-Polishing-Kit/dp/B00OKEDW0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Makita 9237CX3 7-Inch Variable Speed Polisher-Sander with Polishing Kit</a>&nbsp;once it's worn out.	1
Excellant	1
Very good quality.	1
SUPER - LONG LASTING - GREAT FOR REMOVING WAX AFTER APPLIED AND DRIES HARD - BRINGS OUT BEAUTIFUL SHINE	1
I love using this!! The only thing when you use it for the 1st time there will be a lot of lint that comes out, I'm not sure if any way around that....but after a few usage, it's good to go!!	1
This is  a quality buffing pad I am very pleased with this	1
Fast ship great product	1
Works great!	1
I use these along with my angle grinder for many tasks. You have to also add a different backer pad but it is a whole lot cheaper than a separate sander/polisher	1
Great results and worked as expected. This bonnet is for polishing only and did a great job. Still prefer the 3M with adapter.	1
This product is advertised as 4 pockets but has 3.  This makes no difference, however it's why 4 rather than 5 stars.  The item is marked 1 micron filter on each pocket though I saw no JDS marking.  The Delta filter it replaced had no Delta marking either so this may be typical.  The filter fits my Delta 50-860 perfectly.  It should fit the 50-859 also since they are the same size.  This filter appears to be better than the Delta filters but I have no way to measure this.  I'd buy this again from the same seller.	1
I have an older TotalShop air filter/recirculation system for pulling dust out of shop air. This filter is a little hard to find, but this one fits it well and is nearly identical to the original, which lasted ~10 years.	1
This is an OEM replacement for the dust bag and it fit perfectly. I had cleaned the old filter a couple of times, but it was time for a replacement and this did the job nicely.	1
Seems to work as good as the original filter by JDS company. It's a must, to keep your shop clean of those fine dust particles that can't be seen. It's very easy to install. I would recommend it to anyone with a woodworking shop.	1
This is a reasonably priced, good quality, seven inch diameter, wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep, and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.  If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop, the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel, need to be in good condition, and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together, and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure, you can gradually increase the speed and pressure.	1
great product cannot wait to use .	1
As advertised, works good	1
Either I'm using it incorrectly or something. All the wool fibers come out. Looks like cat hair all over my car.	-1
Very poorly made in China.  Look at the pictures -- the strain relief isn't crimped putting all the stress on the copper wires.  The copper wire strands are also starting to break and I just took this out of the package.  At best, this is a LIGHT duty set of cables.  What a shame as the Coleman brand of products use to be made in the USA and were of the highest quality.	-1
This cable was of poor quality in both material and design.  It would have melted if I had used it to jump start my Diesel Mercedes. I donated to a worthy cause rather than go thru the expense of returning it.	-1
These seem small for 4 guage, unless they are counting the cheap insulation wrapped around the copper colored, aluminum wire. These are cheaply constructed. Returned 1 minute after opening box. I'll agree that these are probably o.k. for the occasional user.  P.S. I ordered a couple of sets of Bayco booster cables. They may be expensive, but they should last the rest of my lifetime.	-1
6 years = 3 motors.  I had the misfortune of having a Lomanco fan installed with my new house.  Of course to work best it is in the highest, hottest, most difficult to access portion of the roof.  Well, I am now and expert a changing out the Lomanco fan motors since they fail (seize up) approximately every 2 years.  House if 6 years old and I just replaced my third motor.  Bad enough but what torques me even a little more is these units are remote and hard to get to.  So, you don't even know when they fail.  For all I know, the motor failed months ago and I have been burning up my shingles and AC units to deal with the high attic temps.  I someone offered a heavy duty motor = it would be worth the $15 bucks to be able to rely on the attic fan working.  So, I am planning on converting this Piece of Stuff to use a gable fan which I'll mount flush below the roof board but use the existing roof hole, critter screen, and roof cap.  Hopefully Broan makes better motors.  If you are going to stick with your Lomanco motors, buy six motors and store them near your attic fan.  You change them out just about as frequently as the oil in your lawn tractor.	-1
This motor was in my attic for just under 4 years before it seized a month ago.  My builder had put this in my new home, no doubt the cheapest thing on the market. I removed the motor from inside the attic, it wasn't fun but I got it out and was surprised at the small size and lightness in weight of the motor.  I could have replaced it with the same but went to Home Depot and they had one type of replacement motor on the shelf.  In comparison to the original motor, it was about 2/3 heavier and longer but about the same in circumference.  The replacement fit perfectly in the bracket in the attic.  The new motor quality appears far superior to the original I replaced.  Also, it has sealed bearings and brushless in design.  I am not sure of the Lomanco model having these features but I am guessing it doesn't.  Regardless, the Lomanco model died in just a few years and quality motors typically last 20 years.	-1
On full-size truck, F150 2013 the bar has is extended all the way. where they meet is so flimsy it bends with the slightest pressure. It would be smart to not make them one-size fits all. Not every-one has a Ford Ranger, which they no longer produce. It fits perfect in my wife's Ranger. narrower bed.	-1
It will not work with a gravity feed.  Must have a fuel pump behind it to provide enough pressure for fuel to pass through.  It would have been nice if this was noted in the sales details.  I found this item when Amazon listed as something others bought when they bought a carb. rebuild kit.	-1
I had lots of dirt get through this "filter", its a  waste of money. Go buy a good one, you'll save in the long run...	-1
Product arrived bent and the outer prefilter ripped. Was able to get it to fit and washed out my old prefilter, but I'd look elsewhere for this item. Will not buy again and certainly not from this vendor.	-1
I purchased this antenna to boost my signal on my laptop, Toshiba with Windows 7. I loaded the software but immediately started having problems. The software would not operate properly and corrupted my files. Now I am forced to take my computer in to get it fixed. This product did not work for me at all I would not recommend it	-1
This lock jammed and couldn't be unlocked. I was happy that it was brass because I wound up sawing it off.	-1
Worked as it was supposed to but after the first winter, I guess salt somehow got past the cover and I couldn't get it unlocked, will not buy another one of these as long as I live somewhere where it snows.	-1
Was the wrong plug	-1
As previous reviewers said, you can not rely on this thing to seal - either @ the top with the large-diameter cap or the side, with the small-diameter cap.  Unacceptable.	-1
If this were advertised as a self draining oil pan, I would have rated it 5 stars!  We're not talking about a leak that is just a few drips, this thing leaks so much that it could empty itself in an hour.  I bought this at Wally World and returned it for a refund while it was still filled with oil leaking out of the small cap.  Just like everyone else has stated, it's garbage and not worth the used oil you dump in it.	-1
Bought this to dispose of oil in a clean and responsible way.  Turned my garage into a hazmat wonderland.  The nozzle is molded terribly, and the screw cap has no gasket. This means there's no seal.  If you like oil all over your garage or car, this is the best way I have found to get it there.	-1
Save your money and get something else.  Leaks oil from the top and side cover.  I used it once and threw it out.  Another quality item from China -_-	-1
I've used countless type pans over the years and had to replace one that finally gave out.  I decided to try this one by Rhino because it was enough to cover two oil changes for my vehicles and could be closed up.  Well it has fit in two oil changes, however, the closing up is a different story.  My main complaint has been with the train spout: It LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE!  I changed the oil in one truck, put the pan in the back of my other truck overnight and came out to a good half quart leaked out.  I thought maybe I didn't tighten the cap down enough so I gave it another quarter turn and the next day was more of the same.  As much as I liked the concept, I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.	-1
I've have two of these and trust me its not about IF the cap will leak but WHEN.  The cap is made from plastic that gets brittle when it comes in contact with oil!! Why Rhino will not change this easy to fix solution is beyond me. Even the large main cap on the top does not close securely enough to carry the container on its side without oil leaking out.  Do NOT buy this.	-1
This oil pan is a fantastic concept: drain the oil, cap it, and transport it. If done properly, there is no mess, and the lid/cap keeps oil out of reach, with no exposed oily surface, as the oil drained straight into not just a pan, but an oil container. Fantastic! I wonder why there aren't more products like this.  I read the reviews about leaking and debated over this. However, I saw someone who tried windshield washing fluid cap and it worked for him. I thought it was enough for me to bite, as the top lid doesn't have to be tight as long as I transport the thing horizontally to the nearest recycling center. I got it from a local big box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than Amazon, and that I wanted to see it first.  I made a few observations at the store trying to figure out why this thing will leak, and maybe pick out a sample that will have a better chance not. The recycled plastic of this pan is very cheaply molded, and all of them have warped large top openings to various degrees, so that the top lid won't ever go on flat, if it doesn't slip off first. There's no hope that it will create a good seal.  The drain cap is also plastic on plastic. Though at the store it could be fastened tightly--both the included cap and a windshield washer fluid bottle cap. That quickly changed though when there's oil--both caps leaked (yes, even the windshield washer fluid cap which has a paper/fiber insert as seal), and couldn't be fastened as it would just slip off the threads QUITE easily. In the end I had to put my latex glove over the opening *and* the threads to force on the cap to prevent a leak, and only barely.  The smaller drain opening is cut rather unevenly, making it difficult to create a tight seal even with a cap with paper gasket (as in the case of windshield washing fluid. You can forget about the included plastic cap as it'll never be useful). I picked out one with a relatively flat and clean cut, and it still didn't work. Pretty frustrating.  The saving grace--for me, not for this product-- is that the 4 quarts of oil I drained out just barely cleared the drain lip, creating little pressure on the leaky opening. I had to do transmission fluid drain as well, and since the cap didn't pass the leak test, I had to pour the waste oil to another container before doing another drain. Not quite the "drain, cap and transport" ease that I was hoping for. In fact, it made everything quite a bit messier than it had to be.  It's a great concept, but the execution is absolutely terrible. There should have been improvements over all these years (I think this particular product has been on the market for nearly a decade now?), but that's not the case. I hope there's some other manufacturer who can do a better version, and I'm willing to pay a little more for this concept well executed. It's a shame.	-1
Bought for oil changes and whatnot.  Mine actually worked decent most of the time.  It did not leak from the side cap like many reviewers said.  My problem is that every couple months, while in storage, that side cap would split.  Thanks goodness I did not have oil in it.  Anyway, I emailed the mfr. (Blitz) from their website.  I never heard back in terms of a response but a couple weeks later I got three new caps in the mail.  I thought that was nice of them.  Unfortunately, it's been a year and all three caps have since split so I threw the thing out.  Would not recommend this product.	-1
I picked one of these up recently for doing oil and ATF changes on vehicles. It looks like it would be a really good design but the top cover and side spout both leak like mad! Due to the warping that occurs with bare plastic to plastic, you can't get a good seal.  You'll want to empty it right away after using it.  The top grid is handy for catching the oil plugs so they don't go down into the oil... and setting the oil filter on to drain.  Hard to empty completely and it still leaks oil after it's emptied.  I can't help but think a rubber gasket would have solved most of the issues.  Nice Idea but smaller top opening and the messiness kill its usefulness.  Back to using cheap pans again!	-1
This item is poorly made. Even with the cap well put, IT LEAKS! Oil all over my trunk and garage.	-1
As stated above this thing is a piece of crap.  I took a lid off a windshield washer bottle to replace the small cap and it worked better to make it seal.  I changed my oil the other day moved the vehicle and pulled my other vehicle out of the garage and accidenty ran it over when almost full.  It actually left almost the same sized spot in the driveway as usual.  Glad it's dead.	-1
Both the drain cap and the larger top cap leaks oil no matter how well you tighten it.  Grid on top fell in when I set the oil filter to drain on it.  I bought to save myself time in the clean up.  I lost more time than any I could have potentially saved.	-1
What an absolute piece of garbage. You won't be thinking about the money you wasted on this thing as hot oil comes splashing over the "chicken wire" mesh that sits under the large cover. Yes, the "chicken wire" can be removed, perhaps by just touching it and then the whole thing falls into the hot oil, but then you have a large area to drop the drain plug into, The side spout leaks and if you try to tighten it too much, it will pop back out, ditto for the top lid. Oh, by the way the top lid leaks a little bit, too, but if you're taking this thing full of oil somewhere, you better put it into a leakproof container....inside of another leakproof container - and maybe the place will throw the whole piece of junk out for you.  I made a total mess the first time I used this, will get the oil drained and then the whole thing's going into the garbage and I'll look for a better design.	-1
I've owned two or three of these by now and unfortunately it's about the only type/brand of oil pan sold anywhere near me.  Do not buy this piece of junk, the top lid doesn't screw on tight and the front drain cap leaks.  Considering that oil is a regulated hazardous waste you would think this company would atleast test their product and make sure it doesn't leak before putting it in stores.	-1
I needed a pan so I bought this at my local auto parts store, took it home and had problems with the lid so I figured it was defective and took it back to exchange it but it had similar problems.  Although I've never had a problem with the small cap, the top lid is a joke at best. It's either loose or semi-screwed on. In either state you will lose a lot of oil. The 2 times I risked taking it to the oil depository I had it on top of old carpet, etc. in the trunk to absorb the oil that might spill.  It has a screen under the lid part which is ridiculous. It actually splashes falling oil onto you and other things. Not only that but mine has fallen inside of the container.  I can't believe so many stores and chains still sell this item after what must be thousands of dissatisfied, and oily, customers.	-1
Most of these reviews are correct.  I've used this product for over 10 years.  I've owned at least 10 of them.  They ALL leak, but they are very nice for oil filters and catching plugs.  Here are some tips.  Do not over-tighten either caps, the plastic will break.  Do not do more than one oil change before draining pan.  Do not put this in your vehicle, drain it into a 5 gallon gas tank to transport to Autozone.  It's better that way anyway so you don't have to go everytime you change your oil.  When you drain the pan make sure the big lid is facing up the best you can.  You do all this and your floor will stay clean.  Make sure to have a rag to wipe up any small leak you may have.  Another tip too is opening is not huge on this product so if your plug is on the side of your engine's oil pan take into account that the oil will spray out about 8-10 inches.  Use a big flat metal pan or a piece of cardboard if you don't want stains on your floor.  If they would improve the threads on the caps, this product would be perfect.	-1
The oil drain pain in the picture on this product page clearly shows a pour spout.  The ones that are being shipped do not have a spout like this, they just have a small section of the rim that is pushed out.  This is essentially useless as a pour spout and the oil just flows over the rim and onto your garage floor/driveway.	-1
Why would anyone make an oil drain pan with a spout that is flush with the top rim?  That's not a spout.  Unless you pour the oil out of this thing at a ridiculously slow rate, the oil just flows over the sides and misses whatever you are trying to pour the oil into.  This thing is going straight into the trash.	-1
this item is flimsy when filled with 5 quarts of oil. pouring the oil out is a challenge. recomend getting a different kind	-1
I bought this because it was inexpensive and I thought 6 quarts was large enough. Unfortunately I did not think far enough ahead. My truck has 5qt oil capacity, and this container will hold a maximum of 6qts on a flat surface. The walls are very thin, so when you pick it up full, it will bend. Suffice it to say, not a good combination when you are at the brim with oil.	-1
This is a great design but executed very poorly.  The concept of a large opening up top and grille to catch the drain plug in the oil pan is smart.  The side spout to drain oil is also well thought out.  BUT...the side spout cap is made of extremely weak plastic.  As others have said, it leaks.  Actually, the threads on mine broke during my 2nd time using it in only 4 months of ownership.  I did not tighten it excessively.  The thickness of the top of the cap is maybe 1/16-1/8 of in inch so it is prone to just break.  You will be better off buying a large flat aluminum cooking pot in a resale shop or garage sale because it will last forever and not 4 months like this product.	-1
wow... where to begin.  As mentioned in the other reviews, this LEAKS... which is not what you want when dealing with 5+ quarts of oil... it's a PITA to clean up afterwards.  Draining this is stupid too.. MOST oil pans are TAPERED so that when you drain it the oil goes down a little channel so MOST if not all of the oil is gone... not this.  It's just a hole that is in the side (topped with a screw cap that does NOT stay tight and also leaks)  So you are forced to move the entire container around to get that extra half cup of oil OUT of the pan and then what happens is you get dripps and leaks from the top center larger portion of the lid...  this is absolute garbage... I can't understand who thought this was a great idea to make but obviously they failed as engineers making this thing...	-1
I bought this carrier as a last minute solution to carrying a Jerry Can on an offroad trip a few years back. It is mounted using the 4 dimpled bolt holes to my aftermarket swingout tire carrier on my SUV. It is only used on trips where I need extended range and so far it has been loaded for 4 off-road expeditions. Last weekend after returning from an off-road trip I removed the gas can and noticed the carrier had ripped apart on one side around the top bolt hole where it had been dimpled and cracked around the other top hole. This carrier is flimsy and made from thin metal, not heavy-gauge as stated and not made to stand up to off-road use. I will not be buying another but instead will fabricate my own out of some thicker steel made to last. It did work good for those 4 uses and the red finish still looks good after being outside for about 2 years.	-1
The product is too small to fit the pocket of a full-sized pickup truck.  I spoke with the manufacturer who confirmed that it is intended for small pickups only.  The packaging and manufacturer's description do not mention this at all.  So now I not only wasted several days waiting for delivery, but I wasted my time and effort trying to install the product.  I wasted more time talking to the manufacturer who simply said it wouldn't work, but didn't want to do anything to correct the problem.  Now I have to waste more time repacking and dropping off at UPS.  If you have a small pickup, before ordering this product, consider that the instructions on the package warn you to check the anchor every 25 miles to make sure it's still tight.  No thanks.	-1
The adhesive on these strips is totally inadequate. They barely stick to any clean surface and easily peel off. Completely useless due to poor quality adhesive used.	-1
Minimal adhesive on back.	-1
The actual rubber product is fine. The self-adhesive claim is a complete falsehood. I have yet to find any material that adhesive used sticks even a little bit. It doesn't even stick to itself - which means it isn't an adhesive. In order to use the product an effective adhesive will have to be used and or it will have to be mechanically fastened in place (screws, etc.). Meanwhile the supplier is misrepresenting the product descriptions. An additional problem with product and its packaging is that the two rubber step pads provided were stapled together with carton staples - putting holes in the rubber pads. This is a moronic packaging practice. Holes in the step pads collect dirt and allow the dirt to work beneath the step pad causing wear to finish below.	-1
Porter-Cable makes bad accesories for their polisher, i washed the pad the the adhesive turned hard, theis makes polishing grinding. "The fine lambs wool polishes without harming the surface finish." what a load..... how can you wash the old wax off.	-1
Cheap. No fur on edges that will scratch. Only for flat areas. I doubt I will use it.	-1
Used today with DA.  Alot of fur came out in using the first time.	-1
Does not fit on Porter Cable 7424XP. The pad is hook and loop and the polisher is not.	-1
So soft.	-1
Garbage. Lasted an hour.	-1
Just didn't work well. It was a one time use.	-1
It deserves a -1 star rating.  Junk!   Backing came apart in a gentle cycle with other detailing items.   What a rip off PC!!!	-1
The size is great. The volume and pressure each pump stroke produces is best I've seen. Materials are mostly quite solid. BUT THE CAN ITSELF SLOWLY SEEPS THE CONTENTS FROM MULTIPLE SEAMS. This was true of the first one I received as well as the replacement I was sent. If you are willing to fill it, do the job then empty the fluid into a different vessel for storage, this item might be fine for you.	-1
leaks a lot. and leaks out after you use it no matter how tight the hose is	-1
This can does not perform well.  I blend a mixture of 60 vis nap oil and acetone for a penetrating oil formula.  The fluid leaks out of the cork washer at the flexible hose fitting.  Makes a mess.  The pump works very well.  The rigid hose works much better.	-1
Leaks oil around the bottom seam. I purchased because it was a Made in U.S.A. product. Sitting on my workbench...on a sponge.	-1
I bought this oiler, along with several other "Goldenrod" oilers... I thought they would be high quality because they were made in usa.... I was wrong.  This particular oiler was filled with WD-40 and after a few days of use, it started developing multiple leaks (at the base/seam , lid and spout base.  For the purpose of this review, I mixed UV dye in the oilier with my WD-40, then took pictures using a UV light.  It clearly shows the problem areas.  If you are looking for a oil can that gets your hands oily with each use and always leaves a puddle of oil on your workstation, then you have found a match! Look no further.	-1
Worst made in the USA product I've bought in years. Leaks like a sieve. Would not buy this again.	-1
Leaks profusely from day one. Added ATF and acetone mix and it leaks from the bottom of the can and from the top. The top does not screw on tightly. I bought this because it seemed high quality and because it was made in USA. It just leaks everywhere.	-1
I thought these were a bigger sizes kit I can't  use them I did not see a bigger sized rivet kit through this company I'm not suer y they do not have ? The product arrived on time and looks like a good kit just to small for what I need. I really can't afford to send them back end of this project. That what I get for not knowing Pop rivets sizes.	-1
Bought this a few months ago and used it once.  Just took it out today and tried to use it, but it would not pull the rivet.  Upon close inspection the front/head is cracked.  Very brittle cast material and it split. DO NOT BUY!	-1
I did not purchase this rivet tool from Amazon.  I purchased this from Home Depot about two years ago, but I have not popped that many rivets with it.  I bought it for a specific job and that job required a total of 40 rivets, and I've only used it for that job.  I had to do some rework on the parts that came back, so when it was time to button up the chassis, I pulled out this rivet tool to fasten a total of 12 rivets.  I for 10 done and the thread on the nose stripped.  I had to buy another rivet tool to finish the job.  So, this rivet tool only popped about 50 rivets, TOTAL.  I'm not having the same problem as everyone else.  The threads in the nose stripped so the mandrels won't stay in place so it never gets to grip the rivet at all.  My old rivet tool had installed at least 1000 rivets before I misplaced it.  I give this tool 2-stars, only because it has a nice hammered finish on it, but that means nothing if it doesn't perform what its supposed to do.  The swivel head is also a nice touch but I've never used it in any position other than the standard forward position.	-1
I've had this a little while, but it didn't really hold up. No longer pulls the rivets.	-1
Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter, you won't regret spending the money. This is the worst riveter of the dozens I've used. I can't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control. Were they trying to build a tree ornament? Because it sure doesn't hold up to any riveting.	-1
I could use it for 2 rivets and than it didn't pull anymore. It's a pity because the swivel head is a great idea.	-1
I originally wrote a pretty detailed review but Amazon censored it so I'll just say I don't like it and leave it at that.	-1
Quality has gone down in recent years, I used to get between 3 and 4 years and now I have to replace every two years.	-1
When you pull off the label that the distributor uses the original sticker reveals that the battery is only rated at 7.5A. At this price (priced similarly to others rated at 9A) it should be rated at 9A. Also, it is NOT manufactured by APC as the description on Amazon suggests... You will be better served by buying directly from APC. Be warned also that you cannot return a battery to AMAZON for any reason...whether the mistake was theirs or yours, or you ordered the wrong item, etc. No returns period.	-1
Very, very, very disappointed!!!   I looked up and searched for an APC RBC4 battery, and when I found the item and looked at the product image and it showed a battery with APC logo, and I ordered what I thought was an APC battery, opting for the more expensive APC $45 battery over a clone $25 battery believing I was getting a real APC product.  I am not sure how I am to handle this. The item being reviewed even states "APC Replacement Batter Cartridge RBC4", which is exactly what I wanted, not  a "unknown brand" look alike!  Not what I expected from AMAZON or Amazon retailers!	-1
This is the third strike for APC in my book.  Their equipment has now failed me three times.  Three different models over the years have worked fine until the batteries were expended, then I buy replacements and the unit is trashed.  With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements, but the charging circuit is not working.  Batteries have been test and they are fine so I'm assuming APC designs products that won't survive the death of the first set of batteries. So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in.  I've learned my lesson and will try another brand of UPS.  This product (the battery) works fine for me, but I'm scoring low to warn folks to think twice about flushing money down the toilet if they aren't sure that the unit will work with new batteries.  I'm off the cycle of replacing the hardware and strongly recommend you skip the replacements and go buy another brand.	-1
I purchased this because several reviews said that this comes with a prepaid label to dispose of the old battery. It does not. If I had known that, I would have paid a couple extra dollars and bought an original equipment battery from APC rather than this third-party knockoff.	-1
interesting design, but this thing really just irritates me more than anything!  trying to roll off of it is painful and its just big and bulky, you are better off buying a nice metal one!	-1
It's not as good as they say it is.. If u have a wide behind like me... U'll have a hard time laying down on the creeper. The head rest is very uncomfortable.. because it thugs on your hair and not much of a cushion.. The taller wheels doesn't make that much of a difference than the shorter ones I had on my napa creeper.. It still gets stuck on here and there situations.	-1
ok	-1
This was purchased to replace one I had for years.  This one arrived in a padded envelope, which the threaded shaft and then poked though, exposing the threads. These were backed around a bit in shipping requiring a bit of work to get it to fit the buffer. So, packaging, minus 1 star but the disappointment did not end there.  This one is not going to last many years. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the foam compresses easily and the glue used to adhere the foam to the disk has issues in regard to heat. It separates and the whole thing becomes unbalanced prior to the foam detaching.  I do not know if they  changed the glue and/or foam since the one I used for years, but it is mostly junk. I cannot recommend it.	-1
Genuine snowflake generator.  The pad shreds to bits, the pad comes unglued, the pad can not be washed, and even with gentle care will not last through an entire job.  When it works, I guess its okay, I mean for the 10-30 minutes of use two pads were turned into garbage.  Maybe its my lack of skill, but then again maybe it isn't.	-1
I bought this along with the 7424 thinking it was OEM and a proper accessory.  But I just thew them away once I got one of those Velcro backing plates.  Using an aftermarket Velcro backing plate opens up so many different options.  I just can't see myself buying bonnets and using this foam disc anymore.  I'm not even sure why one is included with the buffer.  Why not include a Velcro backing plate instead?  I bought 2 of them not knowing it would come with one also.  All 3 went right into the garbage can upon getting the Velcro plate.  Sry to repeat that so much...  cheers.	-1
It is falling apart after first use.  One car waxing.	-1
This pad it too soft and not durable, at all. I was lucky to finish lightly polishing one vehicle before the foam started tearing. I will not be purchasing or using this pad again.	-1
Cheap pad. If your Polisher didn't come with a Backing Plate and just this pad, buy a backing plate and buy removable Loop and Hook pads.  Lake Country Pads are probably some of the best out there, a lot cheaper than this.	-1
Fell apart after 30  minutes of use with fine compound. Very surprised with poor quality since Porter Cable RO polisher works great. I'll find a better item.	-1
Hope the foam lasts a while given the considerable price.  Fits my tool well and expands its usefulness for me........ Sorry to have to update an item with poor results from one of my favorite companies.  After just 2 uses, the foam broke apart at higher speed and rendered it useless.  And I wasn`t hard on the pad either.  Porter Cable should send me a replacement since the cost should be offset by decent lifespan.	-1
I used the pad with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher and within and hour of first picking up the tool the pad had fallen apart! I subsequently purchased the Astro Pneumatic 4607 5" PU Velcro Backing Pad coupled with Meguiar's 6.5-Inch pads and they work flawlessly.	-1
Totally ripped and fell apart within the first five minutes of use.  Do not purchase.  A real disappointment.  The Porter-Gable polisher is great, but the pad is junk.	-1
Does not roll over small gravel as easy as portrayed. Excellent for concrete flat surface.	-1
would not buy again, the casters were very cheap. I would not purchase this or reccomend	-1
I read another review that using cardboard works good, I can confirm that. Used this on a truck in gravel and although it would move with effort over the gravel the cardboard in the end worked out much better and cost nothing. Its a monster size compared to other creepers and the huge wheel pockets make it difficult to work around. Try the cardboard in uneven surface and use the smaller creepers in the workshops.	-1
I purchased 2 of these -- Both worked initially (when you come into the garage at a very slow pace) --- now only 1 works and it seems that the company went out of buisness or something cause I can't find a contact # that works for them!	-1
This was extremely disappointing. I have had a version of this for both of my cars for the last few years. One of them seemed to be dying so I bought this as a replacement. The difference was startling. My old one had a reliable green, yellow, red sequence. Red came on reliably at the same point. This unit did not. The picture with the light pushed through the garage wall that someone posted said it all. It is completely unreliable. It usually does nothing until the red light comes on and then you have no idea whether the car is in the right spot or not. I took it off and repaired my old unit instead.	-1
This thing is completely unreliable.  I tried a variety of sensor heights and distances, and THREE DIFFERENT CARS.  I moved everything else away from the sensor but the red light would not come on.  I could have driven right through the wall without it telling me to stop.  Apparently, based on the other reviews, a few people have gotten lucky, but there are also plenty of other people like me for whom it would not work at all.  The odds aren't in your favor.	-1
I bought the Park-Zone PZ-1500 Platinum Edition parking aid for my wife in early March of 2005 from Amazon.com.  Installation and initial calibration was quick and easy, and it worked fine for about a couple of weeks. Then it started going nuts with the lights winking in random order. After that, it started flashing red indicating it needs new batteries. So I put a fresh set of batteries in the unit, recalibrated it, and we were good to go until a couple of days ago. That's when it would have a solid yellow light that would stay on for minutes at a time. Now it flashes red, and is telling me it wants fresh batteries. No more batteries for this dud. I was planning on using the AC adapter once I got an electrical outlet installed nearby; but that is a moot point now.  The Park-Zone receives my "Just say NO to Chinese made crap!" seal of disapproval.  If you want an effective parking aid that will positively park your car in the same place everytime, then (...)They come in yellow or blue. The curb may cost more than the Park-Zone, and the shipping is not free; but the curb works. I have one for my truck and compact tractor, and I just ordered one for my wife's car. Just be certain you can drill 3/4" holes in concrete for the lead lag shields to secure the curb to the floor.	-1
Works then won't, put in new batteries and it may or may not work. Take out batteries put them in may or may not work. Tennis ball and a string is still more reliable!!	-1
I purchased this as i wanted an accurate tire pressure gauge. The gauge itself is well designed and is great. The problem is that it will not seal to the tire. You ALWAYS loose air when trying to use it. Did these guys not even try this thing before they started sticking customers with it??? Save your money or look at the dump, you may just come across mine. That's where it's headed.	-1
This gauge seemed to be accurate and well built.  Worked very well for about a year.  Then the seal that mates with the valve stem became loose and distorted.  After that, the gauge went in the trash.	-1
I bought this on sale a few years back and I found it more of a chore to use.  The plastic tip does not create a good seal on the valve stem and It usually takes me 2 sometimes 3 times to get an accurate reading.  I think this could be avoided if the tip was metal.  Also, there is no bleeder valve, so if you're tires are overinflated, you need to do more work.  I personally use the Accutire MS-4021B which I find far superior and it's way cheaper.  Strangely, it's cheaper but more ergonomic and practical as it has a nice thumb rest to help you get a better reading and it also has a rubber grip.  Personally the best gauge from experience is one of those analog ones that have a built in bleeder and have a filler chuck so you can fill the air through the unit and bleed off whatever you don't need.  Trust me it saves you a lot of time.  But if you insist on one of these digital gauges, I recommend the Accutire MS-4021B.  It's cheap, it works, and it's more practical.  I give the MS-4000 2 stars because it wastes my time and there are better products out there for less.	-1
I ordered 1 in hope of of getting the wrench so I could use it to adjust the hub's bearing cones. But the package arrived with everything except the wrench. I do not want to waste time to return it for just over 5 dollars. Patches and tire levers are not worth it, the levers are too thick. Anyone want to get patches can go to Walmart to get a Slime kit for few dollars at motocycle section which has different sizes to suite your repair and they work well too.  Amazon should update the product picture and description so the buyers know what they're getting.	-1
I just got a new Schwinn Volare clone, and on the first day got a flat from a misaligned rim strip (a sharp-edged spoke recess).  I wanted to ride the bike around, to finish adjusting the derailleurs, and used this patch kit.  I followed the instructions EXACTLY.  The patch failed when I inflated the tube to 60 psi (the bike has Kenda 700 x 28 tires, which have a max inflation of 85 psi).  To be sure, the puncture was fairly extreme...it was ragged, with 2 small "tears" each about 1/16th of an inch.  Also, this was near a juncture of 2 of those raised ribs that come about during the manufacturing process.  But still, the site was well buffed, and the patch itself seemed to adhere well.  This patch kit may suffice for a small, well-defined puncture on a smooth part of the tube, but otherwise, it's a roll of the dice.  You really can't choose what kind of flat you will get, so I can't recommend carrying this kit.  As an aside, the wrench is no longer included with the kit (it's not listed on the kit package labeling).  The tire levers are EXCELLENT, and they nest together, so I'll be keeping them.  I have a seat bag, and carry an extra tube, and have ordered a patch kit which uses glue.	-1
Bought this kit at Walmart. Tried to remove a Maxxis Ardent 29" x 2.4" tire. Result was that I quickly broke one lever, then another before obtaining a replacement set of aluminum alloy levers.  These nonreinforced nylon levers are probably OK for use on most tires not containing an internal steel wire within the inner bead.	-1
I got a very small leak on a bicycle tube.  Too small to see, but could feel the air.  I followed the directions exactly, then slowly pumped up the tube.  It was flat by the next day.  I removed the patch, then repeated the repair.  This time, I used a rubber roller to firmly press the patch to the tube.  Same results - in less than 24 hours, the tube was deflated.  Do not waste your money or time with this kit.	-1
This is a really insulting hashed together kit with vaguely useful nonsensically tiny tire levers.  metal abrasive material to scuff the rubber, and some pre adhesive applied, patches.  I really hope these poor reviews can stand as a guide to some at least to not purchase. They simply do not work. You will have as much luck using scotch tape as you will with these patches. They do not stick or adhere in any way. They peel up upon any additional inflation or deflation. They are incredibly thin unstretchable plastic round discs with no adhesive qualities beyond gift wrap tape.  If we are to give them the benefit of the doubt, then I can only presume that they age poorly? Something surely has to explain how they are able to continue to sell these without being sued.	-1
didnt work.  left my key in and drained my battery .....tried this leaving it in for an hour...there are two lights one that glows green on good battery side...the other light does nothing on bad battery side...should at least glow orange til it charges and green when its charged.  this is a great idea buy if the electronics aren't useful you are better off with a jumper cable .  I had to borrow a jumper cable to start the vehicle.	-1
Is this for real? When I finally needed these,they did not perform. What a bummer, but I blame myself for being stupid enough to believe the crap they wrote about this charger.  There is a sucker born every minute,and I was one of them.	-1
I HAVE NOT purchased one of these. I need one of these and I am willing to buy one immediatly. However, based on the comments here regarding the customers difficulties with XANTREX, I cannot sign up to be the next sucker in line. HEY XANTREX: PAY ATTENTION! BTW: I have purchased several thousand dollars in various products from Amazon with very good satisfaction.	-1
***** Listen Up All You Amateurs *****  What you REALLY need, for hours of service on real-world "appliances" is a "bucket of high-Ah SLA's" (i.e. high AmpHour SealedLeadAcid batteries) and a separate power inverter (DC to AC power inverter).  This will wind up weighing 200+ pounds, and it is NOT "portable"...I repeat it is NOT portable unless you have a pet pack mule...  ...this Xantrex-on-wheels is for brewing coffee in the morning, not powering useful devices for hours during a blackout...  ***** Did You Get That? *****  The original review follows---  Continuous power rating is 1350W, not 1500W.  Most units have 3x17Ah=51Ah, not 3x21Ah=63Ah capacity.  Loads approaching the rating will deplete the batteries in a matter of minutes, not hours--better read up on this one at Xantrex's website before getting soaked for $400 thinking you can, e.g., run a normal fridge for hours during a blackout--you can't, and you'll need a "noisy generator" anyway to recharge this unit and run other loads.  UPDATE:  I have added an extra 53Ah+78Ah SLA (SealedLeadAcid) battery so I can run real-world devices for "many" hours.  These batteries are HEAVY (100+ pounds total), so forget about a "portable backup pack" that lives up to the hype at AMAZON etc...  ...btw, the "karaoake" guy review is total nonsense--his karaoake must be something he uses in a small bathroom where he only entertains himself while he's in the shower.  Try and locate him and get the details and you'll not find him...buyer beware of paid-off testimonials.  ***** Bottom line ***** You'll be out about $3/Ah (you need at least 200Ah = $600) for the external batteries, plus $SeveralHundred for a 2000W inverter, plus a trip to an auto-parts store for the custom-made cables to attach the batteries in parallel to the inverter.	-1
will handle low power consumption devices, cell phone, etc.	-1
HEY CHECK IT OUT, IMPORTANT----IT SUX!!!  DIDJA GET THAT? IT REALLY AND TRULY SUX!!!  Well, after only two years this thing took a dump.  I contacted Tripp-Lite and after answering their questions and requesting a schematic so I can fix it myself (because it is out of warranty), they responded with, Well, yes, you're right it sounds like it is now in need of replacement. But,,,,we don't provide schematics for safety (and some other half-assed reason) so well, just go buy a new one from us, K? (I think not!!)  Wow, 2-years!!! and I thought the Xantrex was crap, well okay, it's a piece of is crap too.  This inverter also has a heavy transformer in it and Trip-Lite mounts the whole unit in an abs plastic case. The very weight of the unit broke all 8 corners. IF, I rebuild this thing I'll have to build a case from 1/4 inch plywood.  Now I guess I'll try one of those AIMS brand 2K units, watch for the review on that.  Thanks  AU  //(~_~)\\	-1
With only a 700 watt load on the charger it indicated a heavy load. Called factory service a they tried to tell me my tools must be to blame. When I told them I was using a Fluke certified instrument they then wanted to know the inrush current. I told them that there was little inrush current with the load being incandescent light bulbs. They would not admit there could be anything wrong with their product. Will be returning this charger ASAP. I do have to say this is the first Tripp Lite charger I have ever had a problem with and am disappointed with their service department .	-1
One can get this level of dirty power in a $100 inverter. I am shocked. Maybe it is defective as the previous reviewer had the same experience. Some of us have distortion meters and scopes. Very disappointing. returning.	-1
Really difficult to install.  Certainly wasn't designed to work when installing a radio is a Polaris RZR. This is not a kit, it only is one piece and nothing else.	-1
After buying 3 different squeegee's from Amazon based on 4 star glowing reviews, I have determined that all these people must have stock in these companies. Please check out all my reviews of these worthless products. This squeegee has double lips on it creating a chattering noise that will wake everybody in the house if you shower @ 5am. It hardly removes any water off the glass Doors and tile shower and it does not come with a hanger. The rubber is very ridged and hardly flexes. I bought a $1.99 Squeegee from Walmart a year ago and it was the best $1.99 I ever spent. Going there tomorrow since I cannot trust these reviews at all anymore.	-1
This product SUCKS does not even work. I don't recommend this to anyone. Water comes right out as soon as you bring it up to wash your vehicle.	-1
Just buy a sponge mop and bucket and save $$. The head on this stick does not swivel, pivot, flex, or otherwise make it easy to use. The stick part does not fill over 3/4 with liquid.  Also it has no 'lock' -- just moving the thing across the car causes the stick to push liquid out so that it empties and needs refilling just as often as you would dunk a regular sponge mop.  I'm returning it.	-1
Like other reviewers, I have discovered that this thing does not stand still. It should have had built in rubber feet. I had to carpet tape it to the garage floor. It works fine now.  It also works best with manual cars because automatic cars will tend to want to continue driving over it. I have to put the minivan into neutral and let go of the brake for a split second to allow the wheels to adjust itself.	-1
I ordered two of these from Amazon.com and then waited more than three weeks before they arrived.  Within a day, I noticed that they would not stay in place on the garage floor.  Whenever you park using them, they move.  These are junk.  Don't buy them.	-1
Cheap Chinese slippery and hard plastic.  They slide all over.  Totally useless.  FAIL!	-1
I've had a Club (regular) for many years. Worked fine. Just bought two of these new as an upgrade and because of their reputation. One stopped working not soon after a month of regular use. It was too late to return it to Amazon. Figured I would call the company and see what help was available. I left my name and number. No response at all. Partly my fault because I misread the warranty info on Amazon. The physical club warranty is for parts only. Pretty sure I would had had to pay for shipping to repair it. Since I never received a return call, it's just a thought. The actual warranty promoted in the description is for damage to your vehicle if it is stolen with the Club Lock in place. The registration form which comes with The Club that you have to mail (no online registration) requests all kinds of ancillary information, such as your income, auto insurance company, license plate number, and other otherwise personal info that should be kept confidential until needed, in my opinion. I forgot the time period restriction for the registration but you have to include an original receipt for the purchase - no copies. You can question the manufacturer - Winners International. I actually find it humorous to consider filing a warranty claim with them for vehicle theft. For what I paid for this item, I would at least have liked a call back from the company. Will be looking for alternatives. Hope this clarifies and helps when considering purchase.	-1
i thought i would not have any problems with this product! but after installing it about 5 days in a row, the painted chrome is starting to flake off , and fall all over my black interior. but the locking mechanism works ok.  thanks	-1
At full extension it barely fits my 2005 Tundra steering wheel and the locking system is complicated.	-1
when you brush clean slightly dusty vehicle somehow it makes greasy spots on surface.	-1
Junk !! Dont wast your money! Leaves all red lint on whole car Not like i rembemberd California Duster Maybe I got A Knock off	-1
Followed directions and let it sit on newspapers 24 hours.  Left gobs of wax and lots of red lint on vehicle.  Let it sit on newspapers for a week rotating it every day and shake the daylights out of it before usage:  little less lint but still gobs of wax on vehicle.  Now I'm wrapping it tightly in newspapers and placing in it's storage bag for a week in an attempt to get the excess wax out.  I pulled it out of bag yesterday and the wax had soaked the newspaper through five layers.  Had to change out newspapers and try again.  I am hoping that after using 15 newspapers over three weeks it will stop leaving the gobs of wax on my car.	-1
Horrible product. Returned immediately. Lint installer should be it's product name. Gives off tons of red stringy lint and tried cleaning it several times and tried again. I have an old California car duster that works amazingly well and figured this would be just as good. Nope!!	-1
Before I bought this thing I read the reviews and saw all the complaints about the red lint. I ignored them because I've had two of these in the past and never had an issue. Sure enough... this thing is leaving red lint all over my truck. What a shame!  It does take all the dust off and doesn't scratch the finish. But the amount of lint it's leaving behind is really awful! I tried to vacuum it out. I've shaken the crap out of it, blew it out with air... still leaves red lint.	-1
This mope won't pick anything up. It's the worst product I have ever received form California Car Duster. The pivot is really bad. Can't use it on a flat surface. It designed for all overhead dusting.  Hope you have better luck!!	-1
The wax on the duster never goes away, nor do the streaks it leaves behind on the car; especially badly affected are windows. I do not know how it gets so many + reviews....useless.	-1
Wow, I never thought I would give California Car Duster a bad review! I have used the plastic handled version for years with no issues. This model must be from a new manufacturer or a new manufacturing process. Here are the issues, mind you, I have not had these issues on the older, less expensive plastic handle one:  1. Leaves red dust fibers all over the car. You can't shake them out at all. Being used on a brand new car. Unless your car is red, you are going to see fibers all over it.  2. Seems like less brush! Best way to describe it is that it seems like less product. So as I wipe it almost gets down to the center core, not enough brush.  3. The wooden handle simply adds cost, nothing more. It makes it heavier to use!  Please go back to the original design! Find a way to stop those red fibers!!!	-1
If your car has extremely soft paint like mine, do not use this.  I used it once, very lightly, and it left very faint scratches all over my car, which I had just finished paint correcting.  This thing went straight into the trash bin.	-1
leaves residue, does remove dust well. BUT WHATS WITH THE WAXY RESIDUE!?	-1
Washed and waxed my new black '16 Corvette Z06.  A few swipes of the California Car Duster left red fibers and was streak marks (paraffin wax?)  on the vehicle.  Completely disappointed.  Do NOT recommend for a black car (not sure about others).	-1
It leaves lint all over my truck.	-1
It's ok. Not great. For it to work the car has to be completely cool. If you try to use it when the car has been in the sun, the brush smears wax or something like that and it's hard to get it off the finish. Along with that, it spreads lint all over the car, and you have to get a cloth, to try and wipe it off. I am not a fan of the duster.  If you want to clean your car, get a cloth and some detail spray. It works better and you will be happier with the results. The cal duster is too much effort.	-1
I have used several other dust brushes, but this leaves chemical streaks from what ever it is treated with.  The streaks were more difficult to wipe and clean than using wax.  Why purchase a dust brush that leaves more than what it is intended for?  Returning it and will go to Walmart and purchase the another one that I used to use in the past.	-1
Honestly just terrible. comes saturated in oil and can't be used right away. It says that it won't work correctly until 2-3 uses. So you need to smear oil and red residue all over your car 2-3 times before it works? Complete waste of money, go get a microfiber towel and wipe down your car	-1
Gets the "dust" off but leaves streaks and residue behind. Rather have dust! Returned after 2 uses.	-1
If you have a Black, highly polished car-stay away.  It will leave red lint everywhere, and wax droplets.  This is after following the break-in directions.  What a shame.  If you have any other car, it might be fine.  It does a great job of picking up pollen but is worthless if you have to go after it and wipe the car...	-1
Left glitter type debris on the car	-1
It WILL leave swirl marks....I never noticed till my detail man showed me and sure enough its a swirl mark monster....	-1
I have used California dusters for many years and I love them. I purchased the wooden handle version recently and wrapped it in newspaper for 48 hrs as recommended, before using for the first time. It shed so much red fabric lint or residue that it was totally unusable. I shook it vigorously outdoors and so much loose fibers came off it was actually choking me. I put on a paper mask and continued shaking until I got a blister on my hand and it was still coming off. I called Amazon and as usual they replaced it without question. The 2nd one is exactly the same with the same problem. I sent the newer one back and kept the original one thinking that eventually the shedding will end. My wife suggested putting the head in the dryer with the air no heat cycle. After 1 hr the lint filter was totally red with the material residue. 4 1hour cycles later it's still shedding though not quite as bad, but still not usable. I ended up using my 20 year old California duster on my Corvette and stuck this one in the basement for now. 20 bucks down the drain. I will try and deal with it when the old one dies if it ever does. I could not recommend this product to anyone any more.	-1
I followed the instructions and let the duster sit face down on some newspapers for 48 hours. It did leave little stains on the newspaper as expected. I then lightly "dusted" my car. The car was cool to the touch. The duster left tiny red flakes of brush all over the car. Despite how much I shook the duster, they were spreading with each use. The duster also left streaks in the finish. I was disappointed and used a soft detail cloth to clean up the mess this duster created. The duster appears and feels well made. Returned.	-1
..."No stars"  Piece of junk! Some kind of chemical on this thing that stinks and left streaks on my new black paint, I wish I had known. ...I can't get those streaks out of my clear coat. ...I ran it through the washer / dryer and still stinks and streaks. So sorry I bought this thing and now I'm stuck with it.	-1
A waste of 20.00 - The duster is treated with some sort of wax that leaves streaks in the finish of my back car.  It might work OK on a  light colored car but on dark paint its awful.  Don't waste your money	-1
I had the original that was 20yrs old or so and it worked really great. Got this one and right away saw it was around 3/4 the size of my old one. To be honest,  the old one was pretty big and heavy and hard on the wrist, so I was not really concerned of the smaller size. I use this on a 1997 F350 truck, so the truck is old now, go to use it for the first time, and I get 10,000 pieces of red fibers that fall off the duster all over the truck, so I figure the truck paint is too far gone for the duster, even though the old one worked really good even after 20yrs. Next I try it on a 6 month old Jeep Wrangler and I had just cleaned it, and there was very minimal dust. From what I can tell, no dust was removed, just 10,000 pieces of red fiber were scattered all over this Jeep. What a disappointment to say the least.	-1
Not the same product you might expect, much lighter Mop than the Original California Car Duster I have been buying for 37 years! Import from Taiwan, not expected... A very light duty product, has the logo but not the Quality!  Locally I can purchase the Full Featured Car Duster for only $5 more...	-1
. I had one of the original California duster's and it was awesome. Sadly in was lost in a house move. I decided to get a new one  and am so far disappointed. A classic case of they don't make them like they use to.  The new version leaves behind ALOT of red fibers and generally does not do as good of a job of actually cleaning.  What did you change ?	-1
Left little red fibers all over the interior of a brand new car. It did pick the dust up though however what's the point if it leaves strands of red cotton behind. I have a 15 year old full size duster that doesn't do that and never did. Maybe it was made on a Friday in china.	-1
I wanted to like this thing, it does clean dust off your dash but it leaves behind little red particles nearly everywhere in the 3 vehicles I've used it on.  It seems to be worse on textured surfaces but it will also leave red particles behind on your touch screen, gauge panel and just about anywhere else you use it.  Never had this problem with its full size vehicle exterior counterpart. Maybe that gets better with time but for something that is supposed to clean it sure is annoying to have to pick tiny red threads and red dust off your cars interior.	-1
This duster has no parifin wax on it. Dust won't stick to it. Sent it back for a refund.	-1
I used just once to remove dust on the interior surface of my car because it left a small red debris on the surface.	-1
When using this item on a Glossy Finish, as Wood or Plastic inside your Car, IT WILL LEAVE STREAKS AND RESIDUE!  In the item Description it states QUOTE: "Wax-treated fibers easily collect dust but won't scratch".  This residue will be left on the surface of your car, and will have to be removed subsequently.  Imagine rubbing a Wax Candle on the Painted Surface of your Car, this is what this does, LEAVES A WAXY RESIDUE WHEN USED!	-1
It is leaving red fibers all over my black interior I will not use it again should I wash it or send it back.	-1
Twists the tongue, doesn't it? Well, I speak the truth, and it sucks. Maybe I got a bad one, but.. I kind of doubt it. I was dusting my car for a second, next thing I knew  I was sitting in it an extra hour, cleaning up red stuff that was stuck on everything. It's like a smoke bomb all of a sudden. Sad first world problem. Very sad.	-1
Item looks very nice, but is not functional. The metal is almost as thin as paper. There are 2 seperate top pieces for ashtray. There are 4 tiny holes that each of the top pieces of the ashtray fit into. When you push on the release to dump ashes, the top pieces pop out of their holes and fall into the ashtray with all the ashes creating a big mess. You have to dig thru ashes and cigs to fish out the top piece and re fix it in holes again. This item had 2 glowing reviews is why I bought.....must be from people who make or sell these. Product is junk!	-1
I used to have these all over my house (about 10 years ago).  They were wonderful.  Hid the unsightly mess of cigarette butts and ashes. Even cut down on the odor.  So I was excited to see these on line.  Unfortunately, like most things these days, they have become cheaply manufactured.  The metal is thin on the lid making the whole ashtray is unsturdy.  It is still an adequate product, just more cheaply made.  UPDATE:  The metal on top broke within a month.  Not happy.	-1
Just got my 3 pack of ArmorAll wipes and the 3 pack was supposed to consist of 1 protective wipes, 1 cleaning wipes and 1 glass wipes.  I got 2 glass wipes and 1 cleaning.  I'm returning this cause who ever is selling it can't even put the correct products into the package.	-1

I was looking for a storage net, not just a 12 inch high piece of net to keep things from falling out of my suv. The only way you could consider this a storage net is if you put it against the back seat to create a pocket area. But even then it's only 12 inches high. It did include mounting hardware and instructions.	-1
The Hooks at the end are way to small and makes it impossible to use. Therefore i am not sure what to do with this spider web. Ant suggestions?	-1
Did not work as described. In a car theat was 68 degrees the food (sandwich items) went bad due to being at 55 degrees. Worthless	-1
I bought this for work travel.  It's a decent unit for what I need but the fan is extremely LOUD, and it will drain my truck battery too quickly to be the most useful for me.  Plus you need to run it almost 100% of the time to get decent cold out of it.  Once you stop running it for a while you loose the coolness and it takes forever to get it back.	-1
Bought this as a back up fridge while camping and to keep stuff cool in the truck while travelling. It worked fine for 5 months then died on us: just didn't work anymore. It didn't get abused and never was it in the bright sun light... just bad workmanship and poor quality parts I guess. Too bad, I loved it.  Bringing it back tomorrow and getting another make. I don't trust Koolatron anymore.  Mario	-1
Some thing does not seem right on all the feedback I read, if I am not mistaken at least the first two feedbacks sound like they are posted by the seller. I am permenant shopper on amazon and I susually read comments and feedbacks from other customers before I will make big mistake.   I saw diffrent model and brand which seems very interesting but it sounds it can help only with GM,Ford and Chevrolet cars, here are list of cars my family and I own, 2001, VW Jetta  VR6, 2001, chrysler PT Cruisser LTD. 2004 Mercedes Benz S600, and 2006 Toyota RAV4, if this machine can not work for all the above vehicles for me it has no value since I don't want to buy 4 different one for 4 diffrent vehicle.    The one I am really interested in is Equus 3150 Innova ABS + Professional CanOBD2 Diagnostic Code Scanner for OBDII Vehicles, but I want to know more about it specially if it will work for any vehicle, I am ready to buy it.    Please can someone e-mail me let me know for what kind of more vehicles it works better beside GM,Ford and chevy?  Thanks.	-1
Battery clamp broke in only 4 days. The clamps were plastic and one snapped, probably due to the spring tension of the clamps.  Vector suggested I ship it back to them (at my expense)and they would send me a new unit.  I suggested they have their Chinese suppliers design a more durable battery clamp.  Otherwise, the VEC1093 charger appears to be as advertised and does a good job.  I would buy another if they ever redesigned the battery clamps.	-1
Upon receiving this charger I though it would prove to be quality product. Unfortunately not the case.  I have had this charger for a year.  All of the labeling has come off the unit.  The lableling is barley better than a soup can.  The worst thing is that both of the clamps broke at different times.  Called Vector and they said to send the unit back to them. I asked if i could just send the broken clamp back for a new one, the girl on the phone said no.  If I changed them myself it would void the warrenty.  Bogus !  Pay $15.00 to send the unit back for a broken clamp.  Very poor customer care policies on such an expensive charger.  The charger is still charging but would not spend the additional $$$ it costs for this unit.  There are many other 3 stage chargers that would perform equally or better.  I have yet to get the 100 amp quick start to work.  Hope this is helpful	-1
I purchased this from a local auto parts store.  It did NOT remove any oxidation or gunky stuff.  It didn't clean anything.  To be honest it is not worth the purchase.  Pay more and get something from a higher end company that actually works.	-1
weakest rubbing compound I've ever used	-1
I bought this to remove a scratch in my wife's car. I decided to try it first on a smaller scratch on mine. No luck. I figured maybe I didn't apply enough compound (this is my first time trying it). With a giant gob, again, no luck. After wiping it clean and coming back a few days later, it looks the same. I decided to apply a second coat with a generous helping. Sadly, it still looks the same as before.  Just to make sure it wasn't limited to my car, I tried the scratches on my wife's, which aren't nearly as deep. Same result, no difference. Buy something else!	-1
I am kinda surprised by all the 5 star reviews as this product has "no grit" feel to it at all.  Seriously I could use this and pleasure myself, that's how smooth and buttery it is with no grit at all to be felt.  I am not trying to be funny just don't expect this to remove anything but the finest finest of scratches and hazes.  This is nothing like the rubbing compound I remember from years ago where the slightest mistake could be costly.  I even used this with a drill and pad with almost no real results.	-1
works like compound	-1
Couldn't get it to work at all just scuff marks...	-1
Turtle wax, 40/50 years ago was great. It would compound scratches out and remove stains from car paint. I bought it, shipped it over to Vietnam and it would not take gas stains off of my motorcycle. Live and learn. No, I would not recommend this product. jbay	-1
Bought the back-up alert beeper for my RV, the alert/alarm beeper can hardly be heard, and the back up light not very bright, I changed back to original bulbs.	-1
THE ALERT BEEP IS VERY LOW	-1
DID NOT WORK GOOD	-1
I have used these before and been happy with them, but this one didn't work when I first got it out of the box.  I tapped it a few times on the tailgate and then it started to work.  I'm sure on a gasoline vehicle with a stock exhaust it would be fine but it's far too quiet for my super duty.  Installed a WOLO beeper for less than 12 dollars from amazon and works much better.	-1
I was looking for a 5-terminal relay because I need the 87a terminal to switch something off versus switching it on. This is listed with a 5-wire harness and I foolishly thought it was a 5-terminal relay and it was not. I am sending it back.	-1
I installed this in my ford van.  The sound level is plenty loud enough for me, as I want to keep people from walking behind me in the parking lot, not alert the people in the next state over that I am backing up.  The reason I don't like this product and can not recommend it is two fold.  First, the beep beep noise is actually like a beep beep squack squack beep squack.  The pitch changes all the time and it actually is embarrassing.  It was my fault that I called to inform the company about this like 6 or 7 weeks after I got it, as it was just not high on the list of things to do.  They have a year warranty.  Well, they want me to pay the shipping to return it.  I explained to them that while I did fail to call sooner, I am not a liar and the product was bad upon receipt.  I already blew 25 bucks on this piece of junk, so I'm not sure I even care to spend another $5.00 to get a replacement.  That is my experience and how I feel about this product.  I bought this item at etrailer dot com and because of the way they are handling the return I learned the hard way that I should have got it from Amazon and now I know where I will not be shopping.  It's not a huge amount of money, but I have to budget every penny I spend so it affects me more than someone who might have discretionary income.	-1
did not need.	-1
Are you kidding?  Do it yourself?  I bought this thinking my husband could install it.  After all, this is the man who changed out one engine and put another one in, all in the front yard...but he read over the directions and said - no way.  AND there's a whole nother part that you have to buy.  This is not  complete...	-1
the producto does not say that it cannot be installed if the key has chip i had to give it away i was so exited, now I cannot used. 1 out of 5 stars	-1
Bought for wife and the first thing she said was: "its tiny". She thought that it would be larger than it is and that it takes a long time to clean the cook top.	-1
It is not working well on my glass cook top. I still have stains even after applying the paste for more than 1 hour. Sometimes I even tried for 4 hours but no use.	-1
This scraper is disposable and the sliding feature that helps to protect you from getting cut when you are using the scraper, gets in the way when you want to use the scraper. It does the job but I have other better quality scrapers that I prefer.	-1

Did not fit my application and to be honest was too complicated to install. Won't buy again.	-1
I saw this product on dealnewsdotcom when it was on sale for 28.37, with shipping.  My due diligence resulted in not making the purchase even at that low price.  Toyota Camry from 2007 to present includes a factory installed immobilizer device.  The engine can't be started unless the car detects a radio frequency signal from the key fob.  This arrangement makes stealing a car much harder for younger, less experienced, "grab and go" car thieves.  The usual method is gain entry, break off the key lock with a slide puller, then turn the internal lock mechanism with a pair of pliers.  The car is gone in 60 seconds or less.  The technique is reputedly well known to young teenagers.  This method, or the more difficult technique of hot wiring, will not start a car that is equipped with an engine immobilizer.  Obviously, a DIY remote starter faces the same problem.  The remote starter can bypass the wiring but the car will not start without detecting the RFI chip in the key fob.  The "solution" for this Bulldog RS1100 or any other DIY remote starter is that you have to put your spare, factory supplied key inside the unit.  The "bypass module" can be a separate unit or it can be integral, as it is with this RS1100.  The car can then be started remotely because the car detects the RFI signal from the spare key.  This also means that you have permanently stored a spare key inside your vehicle in a place where every car thief will know to look.  The placement of the remote starter module is dictated by the wiring within any particular vehicle.  You're not going to have a lot of options for where the module, with your spare key inside, is to be found.  Decide for yourself whether this breach of security is worth the convenience of a remote starter.  Personally, I think it's foolish.	-1
I received an item that had obviously been removed form another vehicle, stuck in a box, and mailed.  I could still see the splices above where the wires were cut.  Asked for a refund, no replacement.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.	-1
I spent countless hours on trying to get this to work. I even bought the T-harness to make the install easier. The T-harness only hooks up the remote car starter part of it. I was under the impression that it would hook up everything just to find that it doesnt. I also bought a bypass for the anti-theft system. I put this system in but couldn't find the power lock wires that I needed to. So I went ahead and figured I could go without the locks. This is where it got interesting. After spending hours and getting everything hooked up,I pushed the start button. The Trailblazer started........and shut off. Tried it again and the same thing happened over and over. Well went to the computer and found that the $120.00 bypass module I got needed to be reset because it was giving me a code. Huh,no problem,went through the list to reset it and got to the next to last step. You need to hit the lock/unlock button. Remember me saying I didn't wire the locks. I went back hooked the lock wires from the remote starter to the bypass module. Went through the reset list and nothing happened. After a hour of trying to wire this and that I came to realize that it must have to go through the anti-theft system itself and I couldn't find those wires to wire it up. I called support and left messages to which I still haven't heard anything yet to date. I emailed support and still haven't heard anything yet to date. All in all,I spent $240.00 for complete junk that I counldnt get to work. I also spent hours on the computer doing research because their directions suck and aren't clear. If you have no expereince in automobiles or wireing STAY AWAY from this crap. Its nothing more than a headache. Remember nothing is universal!	-1
Did not fit my 20012 Toyota Tundra class III hitch receiver. The span is less than 1/8 inch too short. Item description says fit all class III, IV & V receivers. Was going to return but lost original packaging. Now I am stuck with something I can't use. Ordered another one that has a 3 1/2 span. But that doesn't apply to the receiver lock. It applies to the Coupler lock. Description not clear at all. Beware!!!	-1
When I first got this I was checking out the cable and I thought it was really high-quality, I was excited. That lasted about 30 seconds; that's when I realized the lock piece was missing. A long piece of cable isn't going to lock up my bike unless I tie in a really confusing knot LOL! I contacted Amazon and they are sending me a new one so it is being taken care of. But it sucks I have to wait even longer to use a product I bought. Maybe after I received the new one and use it for a little while I'll update this review.	-1
Well Three years, greased often and did not rust ,BUT, when I went to remove key would not align with lock. I had to work very hard to cut and chisel off. I belive it is the type of keys used in this lock. Would Not Buy Again.	-1
I have towed with this product for approximately 10,000 miles. The protective rubber flap that helps keep dirt out of the locking mechanism fell off after a few thousand miles of use, even when the flap was there it never quite stayed shut. On one occasion the locking portion shifted on its seat. I was not able to unlock until I was able to hammer the lock back on square to the shank. The lock is extremely susceptible to dirt, grime, road salt etc. Last time I removed the lock I had to soak the lock in penetrating oil and lightly heat pin with a torch, this was the only way I could get the key to turn.  My failing was that I did not exercise and clean the lock frequently enough, if your like me and want to lock it and forget it look else where.	-1
I used this for a set of led back-up lights mounted for a receiver. In spite of packing it with synthetic grease and using the cap the lock seized. After some Blaster soaking etc. I was able to get it unlocked but it wouldn't let go of the key. Not suitable for New England environment unless you will remove it daily.	-1
While this product appears to be a quality USA manufactured item, it is in fact produced in CHINA. I personally do not feel safe using this item to pull my 9000 lb. Airstream. C.T. Johnson offers a very similar receiver lock for around the same price that is indeed Made In America.  I'm returning the Trimax lock, and ordered the C.T. Johnson lock instead.	-1
I can speak with surety about this product because I have owned it for five years. It received very little use the first 3.5 years. It worked great the few times I used it for those years. I only had it on the hitch when towing, and I removed it once towing was completed. But then I started towing a lot and left it in place for the last 1.5 years. Recently, I needed to take it off my hitch and found the lock was seized. Nothing worked to unlock it, so I had to cut it off; a long process that I did not have time for since I was in a hurry to get on the road. Once I pulled out the pin, I saw the pin was badly rusted within the receiver. So, in 1.5 years, this lock rusted fast and became useless.  Here is the good: 1. It is sturdy and seems to be very secure. 2. The rubber key cover works as advertised and lasts a long time. 3. Easy to operate. 4. Out of the way from my chain connections. 5. Fits my hitch very well. I have seen other reviewers complain about it being too long for class 3 and 4 hitches. I can't figure out why they have a problem with that. There is very little side-to-side motion, which does not affect anything.  Here is the bad: 1. Chrome plated. This means the metal it is made from is not corrosion resistant. 2 You have to keep the lock lubricated very frequently (like once or twice a month) to get decent life out of it (too much maintenance for me). 3. The corrosion problem could lead to structural failure without warning. That could mean losing your trailer on the road. 4. The lock mechanism can seize up from corrosion. If you end up having to cut this off your hitch, there is possibility of damaging the chrome or paint of your bumper because the cutter can and probably will slip.  Because of the corrosion problem, I would not buy this again. I would pay more for a receiver lock that is corrosion proof. Too bad those are hard to find, but I did find a Fulton that claims to be rust proof; so I will try that one.	-1
This lock appears to be nearly identical to the old masterlock design.  That one built up rust inside the lock mechanism, so this will probably do the same. It is a few mm's shorter than the masterlock and barely clears my curt hitch holes, so you may want to try before you buy on this one.  Update-After one winter the locking mechanism and shaft completely rusted over to the point I had to take a mallet and bang it out of my hitch.  Since this and the masterlock are are only good for a year or so you may as well get the masterlock for half the price.	-1
Does not fit in my 2015 GMC Canyon. It has the factory installed spray on heavy duty bed liner, and it does not fit in the holes.	-1
The hook may hold 1000 lbs. although the plastic that holds it into the pocket will crack and break. When it cracks and breaks more each day eventually it is just a loose hook into your trucks pocket. I see they make a better stainless version # 05653 for $10 more and that would eliminate my issue altogether.	-1
I'll start with the pros... this net is fairly well constructed, with nice heavy duty bungees.  The adjustable hooks are a pretty cool feature too.  Now the cons... this net is absolutely, completely, utterly worthless for anything small or light enough it won't stay in the bed on its own.  I have a full-size (8-ft) bed, and just attempted to use this net for the first time.  The bed was full of large garbage bags full of trash, recyclables, etc.  Unfortunately the holes in this net are larger than a full trash bag.  I added 4 bungees to the net to help cover some of the bigger holes, and was still concerned I might lose part of my load.  I had to stop once to readjust, fortunately it was a fairly short drive with no speed limits over 45mph.  Unless you're holding down something very large that doesn't like to move anyway, I would strongly recommend looking for a net with a much tighter pattern.	-1
No agitator. No problem with return though.	-1
I bought this unit to add to my quad for salting after I plow. Big mistake. It does not flow salt at all. I called the mfg before I purchased it to specifically ask about salt. They said it did. The box says salt on it but it simply doesn't work. Returning it tomorrow.	-1
Very disappointed. I like how it's made in the USA but after 2 days of being on my truck in San Diego it was covered in rust and the handle was corroding. I don't know what paint this batch had but it's terrible! They really need to do a better job at coating it...	-1
now this is the worst shortcut I have ever attempted.  Just buy the tank that fits in your truck bed along with a fill right pump, and auto shutoff nozzle at first.  Because after you buy this, you will be pissed off, and wind up spending the money you should have to begin with number one....kit comes with a s***ty hose that gas eats through in the first week.  This is after you have to find help getting said s***ty hose over the flange of both the pump and the nozzle.  Even if you manage to get this done yourself, you still pissed off because you just wasted an hour and your hands and fingers are blistered.  The pump itself is great.  Everything with it will definitely let you down.	-1

I used this machine to take off  20 x 8 x 8 2 ply tires from their rims. The big issue was putting the 20 x 10 x 8  FOUR ply tires on . Taking the tires off the rims was easy. Putting the new ones on was a whole different story. . The bottom beads of the 4 ply tires was easy.  The problem was getting the top bead on the rim. I bent the threaded rod and several times I  bent the bead seater tool with the ball on the end of it. My first attempt to put a 4 ply on failed after about 90 minutes effort. Second attempt another hour failure. Third time was a charm using my forearm to hold the tire down and pulling like my life depended on it to get the top bead on the rim...lol...successful!  That was the first tire. The second time taking the 2 ply off and putting 4 ply on took about 20 minutes. The device is flimsy but I don't know if it was designed to mount 4 ply tires. it seem to work great at taking the 2 plys off.  I don't like the machine but I guarantee I'll use it again instead of throwing it away. I didn't injure any body parts during this fight with the tires !	-1
This thing does not work at all for removing dents.  This is why professionals do it!  This thing is meant to carry glass and that is exactly what it should be used for.	-1

Good for indoor use but what's the point then.  Wind constantly blows the front and back end off. They give you rope about 1/8" thick to keep the center tied down but thats it.  I'm constantly almost daily basis pulling it back down and 19' is not enough to cover a dodge charger even though Amazon says it's enough. I pulled it down one day and it ripped like paper. Had it less than 6 months and regret buying this POS.	-1

Thought about giving a 1, but went up to a 2 because I might have picked the wrong size, wanted to give the benefit of doubt.  Got for a Maserati Quattraporte, based off of the description dimensions I thought there would be plenty of room.  However, this cover only fit about 3/4 the car, and that is being generous.  I kept pulling on one end, then the opposite end would pop off, very frustrating.  This is after several attempts to get the cover to secure to something.  It was too slippery and kept sliding off onto the ground.  I could not get a bite on the car for it to secure to, no mirror pockets or anything to latch on to the car. Is there a shortage on fabric?	-1
Very poor quality. Rips easily. Sun light will destroy the material in just a few weeks.	-1
Didn't fit my 2000 s430 Mercedes. Little bits of the paint showing near the bottom of the car. Can't beat the price though.	-1
On the product description this claims a 2000 lb rating. The package it arrived in said not to exceed 400 lb. Otherwise seems serviceable. However, I was placed in a dangerous situation because I took for granted that my 600 - 800 lb working load was not a problem. I was lucky. I will take this sort of thing for granted in the future.	-1
This Budge branch is the worst I 've ever experiences. I bought it twice and it's both rip apart after six months. It made out of some kind of recycle cottons. The warrant stated 5 years but that is not TRUE. I now try to shop another brand - STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND	-1
I was expecting something a bit more substantial.  This does not block water or even dirt.  While it does protect from the tree that I have to park under I am still having to wash it.  On a positive note clean up after taking the cover off is quick with a hose and no scrubbing.	-1
Cheap material, I'm still using the car  cover, however it's ripped already. You get what you pay for, imirite.	-1
I purchased 2 of these to cover my audi but after 1 week of "used" just covering my vehicles, it started to rip and thin and shed powder when I started to remove it from my vehicle.  Quality is not too good.  It is NOT water proof or DUST proof because I still get dust and pollen from trees all over my vehicle.	-1
Ripped on me after 1 week.	-1
Worked great for the first month or two but very quickly deteriorated, allowing water in (not good if you're looking for a quick cover on your convertible) Also leaves tons of powder like lint as it breaks down, enough to warrant a carwash Everytime it's removed. Definitely a case of you get what you pay for. See pics.	-1
Literally turned to powder in three weeks time.  No rain or wind in this time, just California sun.  Installed 7/13/16, removed 8/2/16.  It was thin and I certainly didn't expect it to last the 3 year warranty stated on the box, but I did expect a little more than 3 WEEKS.  Would give zero stars if I could.	-1
I'v had success with their other covers but i had to return this one twice after it fell apart in 2 weeks. The sun just eat it up in less than 2 weeks	-1
Low quality fabric I don't recommend this is not ment to use outside it will rip of with in 2 weeks	-1
WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK.  Each time I put it on the valve stem i got a different reading.	-1
Gauge was damaged when received!!	-1
It said it fits my car (1999 Benz S600) That cover  Won't even cover the top portion of that car!? Return cost is 60% of the cost of the cover, Thnx Amazon!!!!	-1
Doesn't fit Mercedes E500 very well. Used for 2 weeks. Had to stretch hard to get it on the car, and the antenna post ripped through the top. Also had issues with the mirrors and badge. Very tight fit and probably not the right fit for the car, as advertised. Material is very flimsy. The car was washed prior to fitting, and was absolutely covered with dirt when removed. I guess it probably was OK for the UV protection, but didn't do much of anything for the dirt.	-1
It was okay for the price, but I didn't realize how thin it was until it arrived. It's porous so it's definitely not waterproof. I had to cute a hole in it for my antenna, which was fine, but it didn't withstand the wind and frequently blew off, even with the tie on the underside. It also doesn't protect against scratches at all. If you want this cover, just know that it'll only work for sun protection or if you want to hide your car for some reason, and will not work for other natural elements. I ended up throwing mine out and will invest more money into a better cover in the future.	-1
Just after the return fate expired this product is yearing like paper and now im stuck with this bog piece of paper on my vehicle,  don't waste your money.  Very unhappy.	-1
I thought this would have a very fine abrasive to buff out scratches, but this is basically just Armor All for clear plastic. Leaves a wax-like coating that makes things a bit clearer, but not much and must be re-applied. Might be good for appearance value if you're selling something and just want to spruce it up.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.	-1
Bad fit bad quality	-1
Good for covered Parking Lots, tested in a not covered place... forget it...	-1
Good for covered Parking Lots, tested in a not covered place... forget it...	-1
I didn't like it because it is made with a very thin material. Perhaps, It is too small for my CAMARO 2010.	-1
Its cheap. That's why I bought it. But seriously? The grommet came out the first time I put it on. It can't be kept on. Junk.	-1
So thin and transparent.  It will not block UV or anything.	-1
I was shocked to find how easy this cover will tear while it's wet. During a rain storm a small twig fell from a near by tree ripping the cover. Best use as a dust cover for a garaged vehicle only.	-1
Scratched my car and overall cheap material	-1
I returned it today using an awesome Amazon locker for the free shipping.  This was a replacement for an S-516 that also had to be returned to Amazon. I was looking for a commercial quality inflator with a gauge that was made in USA. It is heavy and looks great but the dual head air chuck just blows the air straight through it. I returned the one and really wanted this inflator so I ordered it again but both had the same faulty dual head chuck. Milton's people on top must have thought they could cut expenses with a cheaper gasket inside, probably a cheap fix.	-1
I like the pressure gauge its east to read seems durable but the problem is with the tip it has a ball that moves from one valve to the next but it does not work well at all. I've taken it apart cleaned it but this cheap plastic ball makes it difficult to change which valve air come out of even the $5 harbor freight ones don't have this problem. My friend wanted one so I bought him the clone of this one works better and was cheaper.  update: gauge is 10 psi out of calibration even my Harbor Freight was within 2 psi, leaks from the chuck stem where connects to hose from the day I got it. Wish I bought the copy of this that my friend has which is cheaper and apparently made better.	-1
Listing shows Milton S-516 for heavy duty dual tires with straight dual chuck and 120+ psi rating. Received the Milton S-506 light duty with angled chuck and 120 psi max rating. What a joke...	-1
Junk! - They all seem to stop working correctly after a year +/-.  Very disappointing.  Poor accuracy for both cars and heavy trucks.  I won't purchase another Milton product.	-1
very clummsey  end sticks to valve stem fight to get off  wouldnt recommend	-1
I just did not like s516 , It just wasn't for me ,it seem sturdy enough but I am looking for something more accurate  and quicker , like maby a digital which I may be ordering before long , not sure which one yet Thanks	-1
this is the second one of these that doesn't work will not stay attached to valve stem.first one bought from auto parts store.my compressor maintains 170 psi- that could have something to do with the failures, but there are no warnings of how much pressure they will handle.	-1
Got this after getting wiper blades with RainX on them.  Honestly, this doesn't work even 1/10 as well, even after a couple of applications.  With the wipers, they got such a nice coating on the windshield we could drive through a rainstorm without even needing to turn them on.  This bottle might as well not have been on there, for all the difference it made.	-1
Does not Fit vehicle that was listed on the box.  It's about 12" too short length wise.  Review is for the #3.  Vehicle is Nissan GT-R.  This cover is only good for indoor use.  For the Price you cant beat it.	-1
Was useless when it rained and as many times as I tried to wipe off it just left smearing swirls	-1
I bought two covers made from this material.  It does not hold up.  Both covers are completely trashed after less than 6 months on use.  Both covers were put on sitting vehicles, the damage is not from wear and tare of being put on and off.  buy a more expensive cover. It would be a good cover for inside of a garage.  NOT for outdoor use.	-1
Followed directions correctly.  Product DOES NOT WORK!	-1
Doesn't fit a 2007 Grand Prix GT...need to work on your fitment software.  I think it will fit my son's Z/28 and I can use his cover that was too big last winter, otherwise it will be returned.	-1
Junk.  Cover kept blowing off until I made holes in the front and back so I could tie it down in 4 points instead of the 2 sides it came with.  I noticed the covers getting thinner this summer and then one day they just ripped and fell down to the sides.  Probably would have been just fine if they were indoor but these covers didn't stand up to the weather.	-1
I have used rainx for years, I love it. However, I think they are cheap rascals because the company does not put a washer under the cap to keep it from leaking all over the place. So, either buy a washer to place under the cap, place in another container or put up with the leakage and smell in your car.	-1
rip on the first day	-1
Doesn't last. Turn to rags in less than a year. I would think they could use better material. But then, it was inexpensive. Tried two of them in case it was a fluke, but the second one wore out faster than the first one.	-1
Fit the car but didn't last long due tio the heat in South West Texas. After 6 months started literally falling apart. Bought a stronger more expensive canvas cover for my 1969 Chevelle and it is still good to go.................	-1
Used this product on glass and only saw water affect more than before. The windscreen is now not cleaned by wipers and I see residue that I was not seeing before. I was initially excited to apply this before rains but I got disappointed by using the product.	-1
Although I did not buy through Amazon, my Budge B-2 car cover started to tear after only 4 years. The entire life of the cover was spent covering a car in the garage. It was only exposed to limited, mostly indirect sunlight when the garage door was opened for brief periods. It was never allowed to get wet. The cover was removed no more than 15 times over the four years it was used.  The cover is flimsy, too thin, and not worthy of the 1 star rating I give it.  My advice, pay a little more and get a thicker, better quality cover from another manufacturer.	-1
Should have known better. This is really a cheap cover. Had one previously and it was constructed much better than this. This is one oftheproblems with buying sight unseen. I'll use it until it tears then replaceit with a better one from Pep Boys or Auto Zone.	-1
I noticed that the shield became hydrophobic, but it is helpless due to the rain dispersed into very small droplets and still stick on the glass, which make it worse to see through. Want to remove it, but hard I know, because I guess it might be some silane coupling agent reacts with the silicon element in glass and hydroxyl groups on the glass surface. Maybe make it super hydrophobic performed not as good as to make it supper hydrophilic.	-1
said it fit my car. almost doesn't work. I had to clip the front to my license plate. it will keep out pine needles and leaves. it's better than nothing. made in china.	-1
Rubber bumper on Hub Cap Remover fell off in my hand as soon as I removed it from the shipping box.	-1
I guess the old adage you get what you pay for works here. It says it fits my collector car but it just never stayed on in wind and rain. Worthless, thin and just plain crummy.	-1
Lasted three months.  Sometimes the wind blows off the cover, which isn't a problem. This morning there was a huge hole in the middle of the cover, like a giant kid took a bite out of the center of a tortilla.  I touched the fabric slightly, and it started to rip.  I guess it is good if you keep the car in the garage, not so good if you keep the car outside - which is the point of having a car cover. Lame.	-1
this is the cover that i usually use on my car to at least try to protect it from the elements. the first one last me about one year. it really takes a punishment too. for the price it is good enough for me.  update:  it barely lasts two months in the sun. i don't think this is for outside use. it just totally disintegrated on the top. i am not too happy about it either.	-1
I ordered two and I got charged for 2 and I only received one. I have not used it because I still need to buy another one.	-1
Well I thought this stuff was awesome until now there is a permanent haze of little circles when it fogs and rains on my windshield making it super dangerous to drive with. Nothing I've tried makes removes it. i think the heat of the area in which I lived BAKED the silicone onto the glass and to refuses to come of with windex, rubbing alcohol, and all the suggestions posted on the internet via google search. I read of one guy who's been trying to remove this for three years. It does NOT wear AWAY with time in very hot areas of the country it gets baked on. This stuff shouldn't be sold if it makes your car and vision very dangerous. I am very unhappy with this product.	-1
Did not improve windshield water sheeting, and did not reduce wiper skidding.  Had absolutely no discernible effect on visibility or wiper performance.	-1
product is in good shape but very small. wasn't able to use. they look bigger in the pic but they are about the size of my hand	-1
Tried it many years ago.  Hoped it would have improved.  Did half the windshield.  When driving under street lights at night in a light rain, the RAIN-x half looked foggy, and the untreated half was clearer.	-1
This is very strange.  Years ago, I had a small metal can of this stuff, and it was like magic! You could literally be driving in a rain storm and not use your wipers.  I finally decided it was time to try it again. Not sure why I waited so long.  With this new bottle, something just isn't the same.  Back in the day, I remember quite a bit of haze on the window, and the effort required to apply it.  It was tough, but worth it.  Also, it was fun applying it, because it was so interesting to see the water bead off it.  It looked like mercury in those old thermometers, or that black alien stuff from The X-Files.  However, this time around, it was different.  Very little haze.  It didn't seem to smell as potent, and the water didn't bead so much.  There is something strange going on here!  I can't believe this is the same formulation as in the past.  I also had to use a lot more of it to get any effect.  Another reviewer mentioned the same thing.  This is not the same as it used to be.  Maybe I have to find the product in that little metal can again.  I always loved rain-x, so I am not sure what it up with this product.  If anyone has similar experiences, please post them...	-1
Walmart and Auto-Zone has these for 1/2 the price, locally.	-1
When screwing this in it was dented by my filter wrench. Metal is thin an susceptible to denting. Audi oem filter when compared to this has stronger metal. Would  it buy again.	-1
Very bad had pin hole near the top	-1
looks like a scam this funnel is tiny the opening is about 3 inches across not much of a funnel.	-1
Garbage.  Does not fit well and does not look like the photos. I recommend not to purchase this item.	-1
!CAUTION! Over Priced 200%...Go to Wal*Mart and get the same for 2.48! They got me with this one. Will treat a sedan about three times.	-1
Very hard to get key to work. Must pull key out slightly and try, wiggle, try, wiggle, try. First Master brand I have ever had a complaint with. Not up to their normal quality.	-1
It's a fine product, but the day after I bought it on Amazon I saw it in an auto parts store for $1.10. Wish I'd gone local with this one.	-1
its didn't end up working for my spare tire. Waste of $	-1
Cheap Chinese junk.  Master Lock should be ashamed to put their name on this.  A little girl with a plain screwdriver can overcome this thing.	-1
Put lock on wheel and now the keys will not open it. Think twice	-1
I put it on my black painted metal mail box post & it did NOT bring back the shine at all. Endust does but I have to apply it weekly.	-1
Waste...	-1
Size is 4"? No mine was maybe 2.5 inches. Cheap which ius okay, but not as advertised.	-1
Not very pleased with this product. Besides being very expensive - you need to purchase at least two of these overly priced tubes to procure the color change you're attempting acquire.  Don't recommend and will NOT purchase again.	-1
The hole is too small for the lug to fit through, and the lock does not secure tightly; a pair of pliers or a screwdriver could beat the lock.	-1
Great idea/concept, but not for all applications, I suppose.  Lock latch wouldn't engage backing plate.  Had to return it, look for something else. FYI, the hardware this unit was mounting over was probably too large, the threaded shank being 1/2'".  Anything smaller may have worked.	-1
I imagine this lock will come off easily with a pry bar.	-1
Not worth the money, the hole is too small to fit the stud through it, plus it can all be spun around and a thief could steal it anyway.  On top of that the spare tire holder on mine is held on by nuts and bolts anyway.  This would do nothing more than "keep an honest man honest."	-1
had to adapt it to get it to work on a longer stud	-1
A good concept, but hard to attach and then to get back off, and it's very easily bent.	-1
Cheap	-1

I purchased two... sending them both back.  I really don't understand any of the positive reviews, unless folks are just don't realize how ineffective it is.	-1
Terrible product to use on a visor for a motorcycle helmet.  Left a residue that couldn't be buffed out and instantly started hallowing. Visibility was worse than before using the product  Visibility is much better with soap and water! If I'm using it wrong -- let me know, but the directions seemed pretty simple.	-1
I usually consider this kind of product as snake oil- but when I priced the cost of a new plastic window on my 1990 Miata, I thought it was worth a try even if it turned out to be a dud. The window was not only opaque, but had a yellow color (probably oxidized)- I could not believe that it made it transparent again but also clear!  No yellow!  I can see the contrast between the whole window and the edge crevices where I couldn't get into. I bought the kit of 3 products- this one produced the biggest improvement, the # 10 a little bit better, and I am not sure if the # 18 did much- but supposedly that protects it- Maybe using all 3 will keep it clear longer, but it is way to soon to know- It  is definitely  worth trying on any type of plastic!  UPDATE: I thought I got all of the M17 off with a soft cloth, I was originally thrilled with M17, but now I am just angry - I don't know if the problem was the M18 or M17- I used it to take the oxidation off my convertible's window- It did a great job- I removed as much as I could with a soft rag- but then something weird happened- when it rained, some of the residue was washed off the window onto the fabric around it- wherever it touched I have white staining and white dots- they seem impossible to remove. I am going back to the glowing review I wrote for the M17 and change it.	-1
Too small for what I needed.	-1
I did not buy this at Amazon ( rare for me) My local Dollar General sells them. Yes it works......... However don't use it when pouring those 4- 5QT oil bottles. The pour area is really too small for anything bigger than quarts. Why one star? Leave it outside in the sunlight too often and it will crack in your hands and break up into little pieces. Both of mine did. If the color is faded it may end up breaking apart while your using it- bad! Too small for my use and not UV protected.	-1
terrible	-1
I wanted to love it, read an article that said how great they were.  But in my situation it simple did not work.  Screwed it on and "turning" the noozle to open the flow was a practice is frustration.  I could use pliers I guess but I expected it to be a "hand only" operation.  Sorry.	-1
I used this on the headlights of a 2004 Mazda that was garage kept for all but one year in California.  The headlights had surface crazing from age.  The product did nothing.  I used the Meguire's Plastic polish afterward.  I consider both a waste of money.  I could have cleaned the surface with isopropyl alcohol and used any wax.  Real disappointing given the rave reviews for this product on this site.	-1
didnt work	-1
Poorly made, not worth the bother	-1
I have not received this part of this three part order. There has been shipment, but I have not received the two items as of this date.  Please investigate and reship.	-1
Returned for a better quality product.	-1
This is not what I expected from Master lock. It is a cheap, thin, piece of junk. Could be easily broke off with a screw driver. If you want something that is good security, buy something different.	-1
too small for my lug nut on MB sprinter	-1
didn't fit my application	-1
This item was recommend to go with a specific spare tire carrier. Well, once they came in, it's glaringly obvious that this item, does not fit on that carrier. The "exit" hole for the bolt (what will stick out above the nut), is far too small, and will never work on any size tire carrier that I've ever used or seen. The only way this item will work at all, is if the nut ends up on the very end of the bolt, and unless you have a hard mounted mount with specific length all-thread welded on, then this will not work without taking it to the drill press. And if you're going to do that, may as well drill a hole in the bolt itself and throw a regular lock on it.  Good in theory, obviously not designed by a city dwelling desk jockey who's never had to use the product or has experience with a spare tire.	-1
Hole to pass over Wheel Lug is half the size of stud - No Workie	-1
You get what you pay for, very cheap quality. It funnels well though...if that's what you're into	-1
Did not fit, needed a different type of lock.	-1
Product came damaged, so I returned it. Quality was not what I expected and for the price not worth it.	-1
The lock seems to be decent quality material, but the locking design is not great, and it is sloppy and loose. I put a zip tie around it to help the flopping, but it only cuts it down, it will not eliminate it.. My lock is on a boat trailer, so the rattling is far from the cab. If you put this on a spare tire on you car or jeep, it might drive you crazy.	-1
The keys do not unlock the lock!	-1
I have a Suzuki Jimny. The spare tire is held on with 19mm round top nuts. This lock fits on with no problem but there is too much play - its loose and shakes around. By moving it you can create a large space to stick a flat head screwdriver in and pry it off. This is a deterrent, like a dummy security camera, but gives little protection.	-1
Don't buy	-1
Did not work for me!  The hole in lock was too small and would not go over the u-bolt.  Had to drill it out to size.  Once lock was installed (as per instructions) I could turn the entire lock assembly (a little hard but), and at same time, loosening the lug nut and  thereby able to remove the tire.  My fix was to install 2 thin lug nuts (grounded down to fit inside the lock assy.) and jam them together, preventing them from turning when the lock was turned.  I carry a pliers and a crescent wrench to loosen the jammed lugs for removal.  This way, when the lock is installed, you can turn the lock assembly all you want, but never able to loosen the nuts.  Should have sent me a larger lock for the u-bolt you sent; and maybe one with a swivel washer of some sort.  Then again, maybe there's something I don't know.	-1
Does what it's supposed to do but I really did expect something a bit heavier duty from Master Lock. I'm not sure it would take much of a hammer to break it off. If I did it over I would have bought one of those HD braided cable locks to protect the spare tire instead of this. Sorry Master Lock but it looks like you have fallen into the cheapo products category now too. Don't manufactures realize we would rather pay a bit more and get something GOOD?	-1
Only works on certain rim styles. DOES NOT FIT JEEP WRANGLER WHEELS	-1
Bought for my trailer, however it does not fit the aluminum wheels on the trailer.  It will not fit within the lug nut holes.  Don't look for this to stop the determined thief as I am sure it can be pried off fairly easly.	-1
The base won't clear the ridge around the lug hole so the top can't be secured. The base should be slightly recessed inside the cover but the raised ridge on the wheel keeps the cover from engaging the base plate far enough.	-1
Was not even able to use it the funne was to large for my Hyundai sonata engine oil opening and gas tank opening seems like a quality product that would work with almost all vehicles	-1
This lock did not work as the feed through hole for stud is way to small for any stud that I have ever seen. Very cheaply made for being a master lock	-1
Bought this for my spare tire on my utility trailer. Very inexpensive (cheap), flimsy and loose fitting. Seems like it can be broken off easily. Will probably end up getting a cable lock. This device doesn't really give me a sense of security. I suppose for only five bucks you get what you pay for.	-1
Why are they selling this as something that will work with a Jeep Wrangler/Rubicon?  This does not come close to being able to fit on the spare. ..  . in addition, it is cheaply made and I doubt that it would work after being exposed to the elements for a couple months. . . .  Being able to secure a spare tires is a priority for me, so wasting time by ordering this and having to send it back and finding a better answer is frustrating. . . .  No wonder they don't show this lock actually attached to the spare--- IT DOES NOT FIT. . ..bogus product. .  . Come on Amazon, take down this bogus product	-1
For the purposes listed, I thought this funnel would be great, and if it were $1, it would be, but it is overpriced by 500% for what it is. It is very small, and since the size information for items on amazon is hardly ever accurate, I assumed it would be 3 times the size that it is.	-1
As always, arrived quickly from Amazon.  I have preferred Master Lock products.  However, I am surprised they would put their name to this item.  The housing does not fit tight to the lug nut.  There is a full one-third inch gap that would allow a point of leverage to pry the lock from the wheel.  It is flimsy enough to do such.  It will also rattle around, due to the floppy fit and is aestetically unattractive.  The top of the housing appears to dangle.  Will buy a cable lock instead.	-1
Might be a nice product were it not for a tiny hole (3/8" ?) where at least a 1/2" hole should be so your spare tire bolt can protrude through the lock. Most spare tire racks I have seen have a long protruding bolt after the nut is applied. This product is worthless unless you have only a short (1/2" to maybe 3/4") section of bolt sticking out.	-1
Much smaller than it looks, way too expensive for its size.  If I'd known how small it was I would not have purchased it.  They charged me $3.33 for it, for $1 It's ok.	-1
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.  It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.	-1
Did not need this for the repair	-1
no direction on how to mix this	-1
Instructions poor, and the amounts to mix together are in fl.oz, which is hard to gauge given these are pastes in tubes. Also, it's more translucent that hoped for: the dark Fiberglas under still shows through, so while the spot is repaired it also still shows.	-1
listed as a 1-1/16 but got a 1 inch bearing kit.more to return just kept it.lucked out and gave to my brother for his trailer	-1
This is way smaller than 1 1/16th. Does not fit on my axle. Looks like they need some Quality Control or maybe they packaged it incorrectly. Now i have to go buy another bearing set from somewhere else...	-1
Washes off really easy with gasoline after it is cured.  Has almost no adhesive qualities.  But I bet you could get really sick if you breathe in the vapors.	-1
Didn't do very good sealing a gasoline fitting	-1
I had a tiny leak on the bottom of my gas tank.  I'd read that Seal-All was easier to use and just as good as the epoxy gas tank repair compounds.  After all, it actually says gas resistant on the label.  Unfortunately, Seal-All doesn't appear to resist dissolving in gas at all.  I had a hairpin crack at on the bottom of my tank on the edge of a divot.  So tiny that it dripped maybe once every 5 minutes.  It was about 1/1000 mm wide and 1 mm long - so imagine the tiniest crack you can get.  I ran the tank empty, angled the car on stand to make sure the remaining gas did not come out, then cleaned and applied Seal-All.  For the first 24 hours it worked and it adhered well to the area around the leak too.  Then the area were the tiny crack was started to go from clear to white and bubble.  Then gas began to seep from under the 2" round patch I'd made.  I made the patch that big to ensure adhesion on a possible seep leak, but after it started coming out the whole path was subverted with gas.  In the end, the adhesive area that had initially turned white from gas contact became so gooey gas leaked directly from center of the path too.  The product is absolutely and unequivocally, not what 'common sense' would call gas resistant.  If you only need it to hold for 24 hours before dissolving, this is the product for you.  Otherwise, get an epoxy sealant for applications involving exposure to gasoline.  I gave it two stars, because it does glue other things well.  You'll find other comments here and elsewhere about this failure to hold back gasoline.	-1
OK	-1
Didn't seem to help faded gel coat	-1
I'm happy with the product, I've bought it a few times. Just gripes me that they no longer ship the red tube with it any longer.	-1
Has an odd habit of actually rusting bolts, not sure if I actually got a bad can.	-1
Can't really recommend them. I was about 230 pounds at the time and all the cushions fell off 2 of these within a month or two of heavy use. Then I had to always fiddle around with them to try and keep the the cushions in place under my butt or to them from blowing away while trailering. Turned out it wasn't worth all the effort. What a shame. These would be the best cheap lightweight boat seats on the planet if they could figure out how to permanently attach the cushions. The plastic "snaps" they use now (or whatever they are) just don't hold up. On the plus side, the seats themselves are very durable and should last years and years. they are also comfortable enough without the cushions, so I say just buy the cheaper version that doesn't have cushions till this gets corrected.	-1
Only lasted about a year.	-1
The though was I wanted to keep my battery charged in my boat, went to take boat out battery was dead, what made me upset the battery was new.	-1
I bought 2 of these, one was dead out if the box and had to be replaced. It died again about 3 months later, the other lasted almost 2 years being used maybe once a month overnight to top off a gas golf cart battery. It died as well. Just but a good charger, do t waste to e with these.	-1
Disappointed, not nearly as good as powder for breaking down solids, or odor prevention !	-1
I would not buy this charger.  I used it for maintaining my boat batteries during winter.  When I initially plug it in and connect it to the battery everything seems fine.  However, later when checked it the red LED is flashing and my battery is completely dead.  At $100 minimum for a marine/deep cycle battery this gets really expensive fast, especially when I need to rely on my battery while on the water.  This has happened multiple times.  There is not indication on-line or in the manual what could cause this behavior.  Also, Schumacher claims it this charger is okay to leave connected while not charging.  This is clearly not true since it drained my large battery to 0 multiple times.  When not powered this charger will drain your battery.  Beware of using this charger.  It is better to just charge you battery and disconnect it than risk drawing it down to 0.	-1
It charges but is the noisiest charger I have ever had , Makes a loud buzzing and vibrates , not sure why I have tried to mount it differently and with rubber mounts but is still noisy	-1
This thing is huge. I couldn't find a suitable mounting location for it so I returned it for a traditional style trickle charger.	-1
Blew up after charging a brand new motorcycle battery. Used once then returned. Probably got a lemon.	-1
Crap	-1
These are one of the worst quality oil filters on the market, check out the YouTube videos	-1
Not a good filter at all.  Recently took apart 5 different makes of oil filters, all similar to this.  After examining them it is apparent that Fram is not what you would think they were.  fram filters have 1/2" spaces in between the filter bends.  all the rest were nice and tight 18" or less.  also the over flow valve on the fram is poorly constructed.  most were built in to the filter but frams just sat in there along with the sealing o-ring. still doing the job but not as effectively.  An instructor told me that they put the black grippy stuff on there because it is junk metal and if you try to use a filter wrench it will rip the metal.  I can't confirm that seeing as I used fram filters for a little bit and never used a wrench to remove.  thanks to the black stuff.	-1
this does not fit 1997 ford explorer xlt 5.0 awd despite the description saying it does	-1
Does not fit 1996 Ford Bronco 5.8L engine.	-1
The oil leak around the rubber gasket, still leak no matter you loosen it or tighten it, I thinks the rubber or the way the rubber housing is bad. It happened on a few cars of mine using the Fram filter, I own a fleet of rental car. Dangerous if you don't catch it early.	-1
Be careful with this product.  It doesn't have a switch to distinguish between different battery types and killed the get battery in my truck.  I disconnected it and charged the battery and haven't had any issues since.  I would strongly recommend you get a batter tender that will do the trick much more safely and effectively.	-1
Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail. Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities. There are websites devoted to discussing oil and oil filters and Fram products are nearly universally criticized and avoided. There are also videos online that investigate Fram oil filters and they are nearly all universally negative.  Purolator, Wix (NAPA), Mann, Mahle, are some quality filters. Fram are the worst filters and you are risking harming your car.	-1
Did not realize that when purchased, I cannot use them.  Too lat to return, maybe someone will buy them in garage sale.	-1
I have an old car that I rarely i drive it. To keep its battery good and running,  I installed this charger which effectively gave the amp load and indications that loaded.  BUT  This only work for a year. I checked and noticed that the transformer worked. So  I  was to disassemble it and remove the main board, installed diodes and a capacitor. Works well when I need to make an emergency reload because the out is 17 volts and the battery is 12 volts. I have to buy other than this brand.	-1
Too small for a whole car. And I don't know how to store it. If you keep it dry, it will become hard and easy to break. If you keep it wet it will not do the work.	-1
This product did nothing to my boat's vinyl white seats. Yes, I followed the instructions. Soap will do a better job than this product. Do not buy this.	-1
ok did not work on the sun screen in the vinyls wich is what i bought it for	-1
Would not remove an ink stain on white vinyl. It was advertised as "Heavy duty Vinyl Cleaner" SO I WAS HOPING IT WOULD WORK ON THIS STAIN.	-1
Either I am using it wrong or the product doesn't dry the cars as others described. I bought this based on other reviews, I used it once and my car ended up with alot of swirls. I will try again another time and see if I can get better results.	-1
I bought an SE-1-12S a couple years ago and like it, so i tried to buy another.  It seems to have been superseded by the SE-1-12S-CA.  This new version looks the same but weighs less than half as much. My presumption is that the charge circuitry in the old version is inductive (uses transformers or coils for major funcitonality) while the new version is more capacitive (uses more caps, probably depends on switch-mode conversion). I have no qualms about the choice of technology, either can be done right or wrong.  The new version could be made much smaller, however, and there are certainly people who would appreciate that in some applications.  The problem is that my new one does not appear to switch into the maintenance mode.  It's my understanding that the se-1-12s is a true 'float' charger, meaning that after a regular charge cycle, it continues to deliver continuous current and can immediately respond to a drop in voltage by switching back to the high current charge mode. This style is preferred by people who plug in so that they can use 12v accessories when the engine is not running without fear of draining the battery.  Some battery maintainers have a built-in timer that is activated when the charge cycle completes, and only checks the battery voltage again after the timer has expired - many products use a 24 hour timer, so they maintain charge by charging the battery a maximum of 1 time per day. This will not allow the use of 12v accessories when the engine isn't running - the battery will simply drain.  The SE-1-12S-CA does not appear to be a float charger. Or maybe mine is defective.  I bought this 2nd unit because i have a diesel vehicle that is not working well that i am working on from time to time. It has trouble starting so it may need to crank a long time, and because the compression of diesel engines is 4-5 times as much as gas engines, diesel starters use more current, and since the engine won't fire unless the starter cranks at full speed, a drop in voltage will prevent starting. There is also the glow heating cycle to consider, with each glow plug drawing several amps. Diesel engines depend more on the cranking amps delivered by the battery.  The diesel vehicle i am working on may also have a current drain issue when switched off. Which makes a true float charger even more important in the interim.  I installed the SE-1-12S-CA in my diesel, plugged it in, and then i didn't have time to work on it again for a week.  When i went to crank it over today, i only had enough juice to start it once.  When i checked the charger, no LEDs were lit. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. No change. I unplugged it, waited a few seconds, and plugged it back in. Then the red charging LED lit up.  On my other vehicle with the previous SE-1-12S version installed, if it is plugged in there is always an LED lit up, and i have watched it switch automatically between modes.  So on Monday i will get on the phone with Schumacher to ask if my SE-1-12S-CA is defective, and will see if i can send it back. I had to replace the ring terminals on the cable to install it, though, which might prove to be a very disappointing problem.  As it is now, I can't recommend this product.	-1
leaves streaked on glass. ok on paint but you will find re-doing your car windows :(	-1
I have bought this brand for YEARS and been totally happy with every purchase. What they don't tell you about this little charger is that if it isn't plugged in to an AC outlet it actually DRAWS power from your battery. The eyelet connections implies you can hook it up and plug it in when you need to and leave it connected to the battery. This is not the case. Had this on my generator battery and it charged perfectly. I unplugged the ac cord and left the charger connection attached to the battery. Came back 3 days later and the battery was completely dead. Used another charger to charge it again and noticed that the red light on the original charger illuminate (it was not connected to ac at this point). When I pulled the other charger off the battery the light stayed on and began to discharge my battery again. If by "fully automatic" they mean it will automatically fully discharge your battery, then they are accurate. Very disappointed.	-1
Plugged it into a less than one year old normally working automotive battery. After leaving it plugged in for 20 hours and over night temperatures of 7F the vehicle would crank but would not start. Hooked up a battery charger I know works, it reported that the battery was at 50%. After leaving the other brand battery charger hooked up for ten minutes the engine cranked and started.  This is a common theme throughout the reviews for this product. Schumacher quality control must be extremely poor. The instructions alluded to the distinct possibility that this unit might be DOA. I will never buy a product from this company again. It seems like sending junk out the door is A-OK with them.  Pay for shipping to return this hunk of junk? And what about my time, installing, removing it and shipping it back?!  Do not buy. Stay very far away unless you like playing the lottery to see if this product will work. I am glad I found out it didn't work before I went overseas for two months and came back home to a dead battery and a charger that was worthless.	-1
I don't see where this does anything of value!  Please water cleans just as well.  It might protect -- I don't know, but it certainly does not clean!	-1
Doesn't do much.  Water still spots, other products out there are much better for boats.	-1
I didn't like this. It doesn't dry very well and it left streaks. Not as advertise and the price is too high for just a wet rag	-1
thought it was junk, tried to return but was to late	-1
Does great at drying, but I follow every direction on the bottle and it smells like mildew every time I go to use it, no matter how many times I hand wash it. I've used similar products in the past & it did not stink.	-1
These aren't the best way to dry your car as far as taking care of your finish. It soaks up water well but I use it for door jambs etc now, not for paint.	-1
I have a 33' long 5th wheel trailer that's 12' high.  After having extensively worked this unit over with 3M's fiberglass gelcoat restorer and wax, a task that took considerable effort over more than a week of chipping away at it, I was happy with the results.  That said, I live in the desert and figured a good coat of Mequire's Flagship Boat product would be beneficial if for nothing else as to add in some UV protection (this product touts that as a key attribute).  So a couple of weeks after the 3M work I applied this product to my large trailer and the results were extremely disappointing.  My trailer is white gelcoat and after having applied this product I could see a white 'haze' over much of the surface the product was applied on.  When i started out the surface was pretty much a mirror finish, but now had a slight haze on them, very disappointing.  I went back over the entire unit to ensure I had buffed it all off well enough but that didn't seem to do anything.  After being on the coach for about a month now I'm resigned to the fact I need to go back over everything again with some carnuba-based product (which is frustrating given the effort required).  A sample area I have already re-waxed with Mequires "cleaner wax" (a carnuba product) brought back the high luster that the Flagship Marine Wax screwed up.  Bottom line for me is I'm going to stay with carnuba products and most likely the 3M line as those have proven to work well for me over a 10+ year period (you just have to be careful with hard water around them or it'll get stripped off).	-1
Seems like it was working good when I bought it, but now I don't like it.  I have had it for almost a year. Does not dry my cars very well, leaves them wet.  I have never found a good substitute to the real chamois.  See the before and after pictures, and that's because my vehicle was not even that wet.  I don't know of it's because of the humid climate I live in, but I never had a problem with the real chamois.  I agree with another reviewer that's it's more like a sponge.	-1
I have an older absorber that I was looking to replace.  The new one doesn't seem to soak up water like the old on did when it was new.	-1
scratches car	-1
It was okay quality wise but nothing special amd for the price i think a bit pricey than other amzon basics items	-1
Par for the course as Convert-a-ball is a loser of a company with ZERO R & D and no improvements over the years.  If I could give it a zero, I would.  The lid only has tiny catches on the long sides and it is cast out of limp plastic and the bulging sides don't grip the base so the lid pops off.  It should hinge and be attached permanently.  It is third one I have owned over the years and the only option.  They know it and abuse that fact in their lack of improvement.  If a company could just come along and do it right these guys would be history.  Lack of competition breeds complacency.	-1
Rag can't go through car it stays.....	-1
To many that fit 350 Chevy.  This is a little short.	-1
I do not understand this thing at all. After soaking it in warm water and using it, it moves water around, but doesn't absorb it and certainly doesn't leave my car dry, it is also hard to move it along the surface of the car.	-1
I don't like this for drying cars.  It seemed to smear the water rather than absorb it.  It always left streaks on my newly washed car.  After "drying" with this, I'd have to go back and get rid of the water spots.  I now use Meguiar's X2000 Water Magnet Microfiber Drying Towel.  Sucks up the water for a streak-free shine.  The Water Magnet can even get rid of DRIED on water spots.  It's crazy.  I'll be using that from now	-1
Generally I never give a one or two stars to items on Amazon, but in this case, one or two stars is a gift.  Yes, the item will absorb as advertised, but compared to other chammies, I am not so sure. The reason for a one star is that one cant wipe or clean up with this item; it will not go over any surface with out hanging up, twisting, etc.  I bought two of them and will return the other.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Mildew even though it is "mildew resistant"	-1
Wet towel as directed it did not absorb all the water off the car and was almost like it was scraping against finish .	-1
This is not the German stuff. It absorbs water well...once. Once it tries it becomes as stiff as cardboard and its useless.	-1
Bought this to manage some mildew on the bottom of the canopy for our travel trailer and some tree sap and stains on the vinyl ends. It took off the top layer of the mildew, but left the black stains and it didn't work on the tree sap at all. I later got the black mildew stains with another cleaner. Disappointed in this product.	-1
Did not help, still have to submerge the trailer until the boat float's off the trailer.	-1
Are you serious?  It turns stiff as cardboard when it dries.  I purchased this to dry my camera gear when it was raining and took it out of the container so I could store it in my backpack.  Low and behold, it dried up like cardboard.  Then I found out you have to keep it in that thing, and it was coated with some alcohol like chemical, which I am sure is not good for my gear.  Crappy product..give me a regular microfiber towel please.	-1
I've been looking for something that replaces a natural chamois for awhile, I like the idea of a washable chamois, but this left a thin sheen of water behind which left the glass streaky.  It also went moldy when left damp.  Dried out it seems fine for other jobs, but not what I had hoped.	-1
It doesnt do anything just hard to move around on the car, doesnt absorb any water. just useless. will not buy another.	-1
I purchased this item to dry my car. I own a black car and don't recommend this product. Instead use a soft microfiber waffle towel. This product leaves streaks and swirl marks on the paint finish its to rough.	-1
I had the original ABSORBER (several in fact over the years). My most recent finally wore out. The orignal versions performed very well. BUT the "NEW" version....NOT!!!! I am amazed at the good reviews received on the very poor "new" Absorber being sold now. It performs no were near as good as the original. What a big step down in quality. Hard, Barely absorbant, Discolors easy, Tears easy...... look elsewhere......I am not sure where???, but someone has to make a decent synthetic drying cloth (by the way, a real chamois is very hard to care for and thus my search for a good synthetic)... sorry for being wordy.	-1
I'm quite an avid automotive detailer, and strive to keep my Corvette Z06 in showroom condition which is difficult with how many miles I put on it. So regular washes are necessary to keep the grime off. I had previously been using a microfiber type drying towel, which was lent to a friend who never returned it. So before washing my car one day I ran over to Autozone and purchased on of these 'Absorbers'. While it is good at removing the large buildups of water on a vehicles surfaces, it is not good for final streak free drying. No matter how hard you wring this Absorber out, it still leaves water streaks. I had to run out to find a suitable drying towel and re-wash my car to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left. Since using it, I have purchased a "Carrand 40059AS Microfiber MAX Supreme Deep Pile Fiber Drying Towel" through Amazon, and my goodness what a difference. So now I use the absorber for removing the bulk of water from my Z06, then finish up with the Carrand Drying Towel.	-1
It clearly states in the description at the top of the page: "Includes lock bracket, lock and keys for security".  Guess what -- NO, IT DOESN'T.  After the package arrived, and I saw it wasn't as advertised, I went back to look at the item's page again.  There, it says the lock is optional.  I may be partially to blame for expecting an included lock.  Had I read the whole page, I would have seen it wasn't included.  However, when it's stated at the top of the page highlighting the product's features, well...you just assume you're going to get what's advertised.	-1
I have used this three times. It dries my car well. After each use I have stored it damp and rolled up in the tube, as per the manufacturer's directions. Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it. I think it is some kind of mold. I used it anyway and it still dries well, but I don't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car. I think I will go back to towels.	-1
Flimsy cheap mirror that has an extremely distorted view.  Not worth the price.ther	-1
Cheesy!	-1
Really small	-1
Very dissatisfied with mounted it on my pontoon boat drove to the lake when I got to the lake did not realize it the glass part of it was missing now all I have is a plastic frame you wood thinking would last a lot longer  then one trip than that very very dissatisfied	-1
I used this on my car the other day for the first time with excitement.  I ended the clean with less enthusasism:(  I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car.  Will try two for the car on wash number two.  Maybe that will make the job easier.  Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water.  Need at least a second try.  I detailed the clean with a nice towel "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3" I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight.  They work as advertised and am impressed with the results. Easy to use and no streaks.  These special type of absorbents all give me difficulty and have yet to find the trick or the magic chamois or absorber.  This was definately not it!	-1
No good, rusted out after one season. Boooooo!	-1
great price, looks good, but hard to see any thing with it.	-1
Cheap plastic with a mirror finish. Doubt it will last out the season.	-1
no universel mounting bracket!	-1
Junk, avoid this.  It will not stay clipped on.  The plastic is too flimsy for the clamp to stay attached.	-1
Cheap mirror..  Gets job done but wouldn't recommend for anything more than that.	-1
I wouldn't put this on a jon boat.  Straight to the trash.	-1
Cheap product, too small, flimsy. Would not buy it again if I would need to. I just used the clamp from it that I fabricated to attached to the old better - bigger mirror.	-1
Not very clear to see, and it broke around 30 mph.	-1
Cheap and blurry, But what I expected for the price. Does mount easily  Buy metal or glass for clear visibility	-1
2nd one I ordered, the slightest bump and it is broken. I put a new one in my boat on saturday 7/13 and I bumped it on sunday 7/14 it broke.	-1
Tried to save a buck...you get what you pay for. The clamp actually popped itself off as soon as I mounted it.	-1
Waste of money. Virtually no improvement.	-1
I got this to polish a golf cart windshield. I polished multiple times but only got minimal results. Not saying it is a complete waste but it isn't the miracle worker that some were suggesting.	-1
Doesnt do anything	-1
yeah it didn't work very well. I'd go for something else..	-1
Was really hoping for higher quality.  The chrome finish is crappy, and the end caps are cheesy.  It is functional, but cheaply made.  Go with the Rhino.	-1
I bought the westin lights that go on the running board and 2 of them have blown	-1
This step hitch is more suited to compact SUV's rather than large trucks/SUV's. Originally wanted this for my F150 but it looked to small and dainty. Wound up going with a Go Rhino step hitch which looks much better.	-1
JUNK	-1
I bought mine at Wal-Mart for the same price. Mine says "new and improved". It had absolutely zero affects on my headlights. I returned it. And yes, elbow grease was thrown at it.	-1
It worked when I put it in and a week later a friend who was following me told me it was not working.  I checked the "Jeep wiring harness" and it checks out just fine.  I already threw away the shipping box, so I guess I'll just eat the cost and order another one.  Update....it was just a burnt out bulb.	-1
bad	-1
Does not fit properly and pops open often as a result.	-1
The first light that I ordered did not work at all when I received it. I put in a new bulb and it worked with the brake lights only, and not the tail lights. I  called Bully and they said it should also work when the lights come on and get brighter when you apply the brakes. I sent the light back to Amazon and another light was sent. The new light only works when the brakes are applied also. I still have the 2nd light and I do not think I could have received two defective lights in a row. It just does not work as the manufacturer claims that it should. I'm disappointed.	-1
junk	-1
they changed their formula.  not a fan.	-1
Disappointed.	-1
It worked for about 2 days.	-1
Ok item. Compared to the harbor freight comparable...they are the same. Price is high for the level of quality.	-1
Plugged into my 2016 Ford Expedition, the trailer computer goes nuts.  Trailer connected, disconnected, left turn fault, right turn fault!  I've looked at my truck manual settings, Bully mfg contact info cannot be found anywhere!  Im sure it works fine on older model trucks, but nothing new!	-1
I used it to clear my cloudy headlights on my Toyota Tacoma but it didn't do anything!!!  Had to return the product...	-1
I bought these to protect the pins on my trailer.  Unfortunately, they didn't fit and I was forced to get a refund from Amazon.  Frankly, they didn't come close to fitting and I don't understand why the description is not more clear.	-1
Easy to install but certainly not as bright as I expected.	-1
Was clear for about a week then then got foggy again.  I used all the preparation products before hand also.	-1
Works well. Looks nice but, the connecting wire is too short and I had to buy an extension. Also, the adapter is too long and extends out way past the hitch. The gasket that comes with it doesn't do anything because product sticks out too far.	-1
