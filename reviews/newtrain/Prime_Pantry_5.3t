Good price. Tastes good. Glad I purchased.	1
Great taste, pretty high in fiber, relatively healthy breakfast.	1
A bit sweet but not syrupy sweet. Crunchy.	1
A great price. About 1/2 of supermarket and same fresh cereal.	1
Most of us don't get the amount of fruit and veggies we are supposed to each day. I have found that by incorporating small amounts into many of the foods I prepare that I get more. My morning oatmeal recipe is to set out to prepare 5 servings of oatmeal the way that you do it. When you put the water on to boil, add 3/4 cup craisins, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/4 cup shredded coconut and then your oatmeal when the water boils. Turn heat to low and time for 5 minutes. Turn heat off and stir in 1/2 cup of your favorite nuts (I like walnuts) and let sit covered for 5 more minutes. I eat this 5 days a week and add a bit of fruit and nuts to my diet this way.	1
I've always liked dried fruits and I've had dried cranberries in trail mixes and things of that sort. Well, on my last visit to my nearby Costco Warehouse Store,  I spotted some bags (48 ounces) of Ocean Spray Craisins dried cranberries (Original) and decided to give them a try. That's a lot of cranberries, but they're delicious and I'll get through them with some help from my little boy. These are real simple: just cranberries and a little sugar. Full of fiber. They're a lot iike raisins but I prefer the cranberry flavor. I wouldn't hesitate to use them anywhere I use raisins. It's a good product. The package I have has a slightly different design, but it's the same product.  Gary Peterson	1
These are absolutely DELICIOUS!  They are fresh, perfect amount of sea salt and the taste is wonderful.  What I really love about these are the two simple ingredients:  Macadamia nuts and sea salt.  That's it!  This is a NON-GMO food.  That's always a good thing!  I love these and plan to try to make chocolate covered Macadamia nut clusters!	1
smashed but ok	1
Typical quality for a Quaker product. Will remain a favorite.	1
Love these delicious morsels.	1
My family loves this cereal.  It is a little bit high in calories, but the nutritional value makes up for it.  Give it a try as it is a really tasty and filling breakfast meal.	1
This is one of my favorite cereals!  The sweetness and flavor are very subtle.  I think some people would think it isn't sweet enough.  It reminds me a lot of Life cereal.  I like that it has extra protein!	1
This is one of my all time favorite cereals and Amazon Pantry has it at a better price than my local supermarket.  It is made with whole grain oats.  It is crunchy and not too sweet.  This listing is for one 14.5 oz box.  This is going on my buy-it-again list!  Ali Julia review	1
good and fresh , I would buy this product again.	1
These are not only healthy but they're delicious. If you like raisins and cranberry sauce or cranberry juice, then you'll love these.	1
Excellent quality. Good value. Never disappointed with this company's products!	1
Good	1
My fave cereal!	1
Just buy it. Crunchy, sweet, not soggy in your bowl. Your whole family will love this stuff.	1
delicious	1
This has to be one of my favorite cereals ever. It's tasty, filling, and a is right at the hard-to-find happy medium where it's neither too sweet nor too bland. This is a cereal that I liked when I was 15. . . and still like even now so I feel that it has longevity. I personally like the texture whether dry or soggy but some of my siblings do complain that it's kind of gross if you let it soak too long. Everyone has their own cereal preferences, and no cereal works for everyone-- but I really like this one and would highly recommend it to others.	1
Excellent for anyone needing high fiber diet that is Los tasty!	1
good price	1
Tasty.	1
Perfect, could not have been better.  I've a bit reluctant to order snacks because they are sometimes a bit stale, like with the pistachios.	1
Bought two bags a few weeks ago. Both bags lasted maybe 3 days. Just bought two more. Crack in a bag. I just.....cant......stop!  EDIT- I have to buy a different brand now, since the price shot up 5 dollars a bag.  That is unacceptable. EDIT 2- Price went back down a little. So I bought another bag.  Its gone.	1
i like this cereal	1
<3	1
I cannot digest meat, wheat or dairy so this is a great find to eat with yogurt. Love love love the texture, whole grain "nuttiness" and flavor. Not too sweet. Also great for pie crust, ice cream topper, trail mix, quick glucose pick up.	1
I LIKE THE OAT CEREALS, BUT IT CAN BE TIRESOME AFTER A WHILE.  THESE LITTLE SQARES ARE A NICE CHANGE. SLIGHTLY SWEETENED, NICE BITE-SIZED.  A BIT MORE SOLID THAN SOME OTHER CEREALS.  I ENJOY THESE.	1
no	1
Love this cereal! The fiber to sugar ratio is pretty good.  The price was a great deal when I bought them from Amazon Pantry!	1
I was glad these weren't as bland as I thought they would be	1
Great price, great taste and all from Amazon Pantry saving me money at the store and at the gas station.	1
my favorite cereal	1
Always a good treat, could get better price in store, but needed it to be shipped.  There are several brands of cranberry treats, this is a very popular one.	1
Received on time and right to my door! These Craisins are nice and fresh! Tasty great snack and nice on salads and mixed with nuts as an on the go treat. Love this size bag! I plan to set a side some and freeze them. Then soak them and plump them up for Thanksgiving. Great bargain. Ocean Spray is a good brand too.  Thanks to the Vendor, Amazon and Fedex. Great!	1
This was really good cereal. I thought it would be bland, but we really enjoyed it, and it's healthy!	1
Love this stuff.	1
A yummy cereal that actually has some protein.	1
good price and service	1
Delicious, and you are guaranteed to go number two the next day.	1
Great cereal!! Very tasty and healthy type of breakfast. It has a light taste of brown sugar that is not overpowering.	1
Good cereal	1
These are amazing with Greek yogurt.	1
Love this cereal!!	1
GOOD	1
Great	1
This item arrived quickly and just as described.  Would definitely recommend this seller to my friends.  THANKS!!	1
I am a huge fan of everything Quaker Oats. I grew up on the oatmeal and now I love the Oatmeal Squares Cereal. This particular variety has a hint of brown sugar, giving them a bit of a sweet taste. The squares are large and crunchy, and very satisfying. I like to enjoy these in a bowl of milk or straight out of the box as a snack to munch on.  I would recommend Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal without hesitation. You will not be disappointed!  I paid full price for this product. Opinion is entirely my own.	1
The Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal Squares are by far my favorite.  I love the hint of brown sugar and that it's not overpoweringly sweet.  I'll be getting this one again!	1
Love these as a snack.	1
Tasty.  Good breakfast or snacks.	1
Great taste, awesome price	1
Best cerebral in PP.	1
I love this cereal.	1
Yum	1
I bought these for my husband after our local big box retailer quit carrying it. He enjoys eating them nightly. You can't go wrong with Planters Mixed Nuts. It has the perfect peanut ratio. A definite salty snack.	1
I didn't care much for these. It's the texture.	-1
Love these!	1
This cereal is similar to Quaker Life, but is only about half as sweet, and the squares have a puffier shape. I think they're harder, too, and stay crunchy a little longer than Life. I've been a Life cereal fan since early childhood, and these rank up there with Life. They have a clean oat flavor with a far better texture than any oatmeal. The ingredient list is fairly short, whole grain flour, sugar, added vitamins. I think the only out of place additive is yellow dye.	1
this is what living the dream is all about	1
Excelente	1
Crispy and good taste.	1
Rarely do I eat breakfast, let alone breakfast cereal.  But this stuff is MIGHTY tasty.  Generally, I eat it as a movie snack...much healthier than popcorn or chips.  If y'all have never tried it...you're missing a treat!	1
Healthy and tasty	1
The Ceral was as described and delivered ontime.	1
Little sweeter than you might think, but it's not too much - a great balance in my opinion.	1
Tastes good, but too sweet. Glycemic index for this cereal must be sky high, judging from it's effects. I'll stick with cheerios or Quaker oatmeal.	-1
good	1
great cereal. Very simple but has a lot of flavor.	1
What can I say? Quaker is leader in oats. This stuff is my favorite cereal. I could eat this stuff all stinking day!	1
gone within two days with my kids	1
Tasted kind of bland just alone, add loads of fruit for an amazing taste	1
Taste great	1
What could be a better cereal.  Nothing!!	1
Box  arrived crushed, with cereal in the box and package torn open.	-1
One of my favorite cereals at a much better price than it costs at my local supermarket. Not too sweet and stay nicely crunchy in milk. Also great to eat by the handful as a snack!	1
Lower priced than Target	1
My husbands favorite cereal. Great taste.  Super price also in Prime Pantry!!!!	1
hard to find sometimes, so i paid a LOT for these on amazon.  the cereal is delicious.  good for you, all that	1
Love these big bag worth the money	1
These are so delicious.	1
I have always liked this product; but what I liked the most about this purchase was the Prime Pantry option.  Prices are good and very good, and it's $5 shipping.  As you grocery shop, Amazon tells what percent of the box is full (and qualifies for the $5 shipping price).  I have never filled more than one box in an order.	1
Good	1
A nice alternative to the junk cereal that normally gets eaten around here. Both kids and adults like this and it makes everybody nutritionally happy!	1
its good	1
Nice taste.  It's a great buy.	1
Good taste...like it very much.	1
Awesome cereal. I always have to order an extra box, my wife usually gets more of my box than I do.	1
Perfect snack throughout the day!	1
Planters have tasty nuts that I love	1
Fresh, good	1
A wonderful perfect gift for my step dad who never wants a birthday nor a gift to remind him of said birthday! First time he did complain! He literally went nuts at the holiday gathering the dishes of this wonderful mix like a kid picking his favorites!! Lol...luckily this is a big wonderful can I could keep refilling them! So I reordered a can for his birthday!! Along with another jar of salt free pistachio mix and popcorn...He's all set to watch his movies & sports!!	1
Good	1
Our company decided that all our staff kitchen must have PB&J for staff. Skippy chunk PB is always the first one to be used up. I did get different brands before, but people really like Skippy the most. Personally, I agree. It's not so chunky that's hard to spread, and not so salty that's hard to swallow. It's just the perfect mix of chunky and creamy peanuts. Plus, Amazon has the best price after you use the subscribe & save. Got them shipped directly to the office, I didn't even have to carry them in. It's awesome!	1
Just the thought of Mauna Loa macadamias make me happy. I first discovered them in Hawaii when I was meeting my special husband for R and R from his tour of Vietnam. We spent such a happy week in Honolulu trying lots of new foods including macadamias. When I came home I brought several bags for my parents and siblings. They were quite the treat at the time - still are - Mauna Loa puts out such good products and I have never been disappointed in them. I could get a case of macadamias right now.	1
Great mix of nuts!	1
This was a great price for what we got.  Thank you.	1
Great product will buy again!!!!!	1
Love the stuff. Buy some Tums or Prevacid...HAHA	1
love it	1
If they made a cup filled with this stuff...I'd drink it...daily	1
I love Tobasco sauce, so there is nothing else to say,,,,put it on eggs, steak, vegs, everything.	1
As expected	1
LOVE IT	1
good tasting.	1
Spreads easily on everything and soooo crunchy and yummy. I don't want peanut butter with oil that separates and goes rancid. This satisfies my craving for something crunchy. I like to spread it on apple slices and celery sticks. Mmmm.	1
Better than I thought!!	1
love it!	1
Great Buy!	1
About 60/65% Peanuts so it is grossly over priced.  The Almonds are of all sizes with bits and pieces about25/30%.  There are a few Cashew bits and pieces and I found four parts and two small halves of Pecan and two small Brazil Nuts.  I found only one of each of the other nuts listed.  I will never purchase "Planters Mixed Nuts' again.	-1
Always a great product to have around the house. It not only adds "zip" to anything you add it to but it is a must - in my opinion - in a good glass of tomato juice. Every dish I use this product in turns into a tasters delight and I can control the "heat factor". You like it hot? Add more. You like it just barely noticeable a few drops will suffice. Great stuff and it does not take up too much space in the refrigerator door.	1
I've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to "kick up" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.  I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.  After purchasing and taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old versus new notes  ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested.  Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.  I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm very certain you will be pleasantly surprised.  1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Available in most supermarkets. Praised in many reviews and rightly so. Look for a large bottle with a rooster on the label.  2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers and available in most supermarkets. Look for the wooden top.  3) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting) featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar - widely available  I hope I've encouraged you to try a few other hot sauces.  PS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a "plus" in my view but rather a "minus" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!  What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce.  UPDATE (August 2013): While my review was written over a year before - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED HOT SAUCES.   What sauce came in very LAST?  Tabasco!   What was first?  Huy Fong Sriracha.  I'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.  Tastes vary of course	-1

After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!  I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others  Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces.

It's true. I like to spice up food. And one of my favorite ways of doing this is through the classic hot sauce--McIlhenney's Tabasco Sauce. The hot peppery taste is a part of what makes Buffalo chicken wings Buffalo chicken wings (at least, using the recipe that I have).  I routinely add a few drops to gravy (or spaghetti sauce), eggs and omelettes, sometimes to salad dressing, and so on. Since the rest of my family is not so hot about this product, needless to say, I end up serving them Tabasco Sauce-free versions of what I eat.  Anyhow, for spicing up food, this is a never go wrong way of doing so.	1
I will personally fist fight you.  Best macadamia nuts on the market...hands down. Buttery taste with just the right amount of sea salt. These will make you throw rocks at the grocery store brand nuts. They are also a golden yellow and about 1/3 larger than the grocery store variety. Interesting sidebar.....if you do the helicopter volcano tour out of the Hilo (big island) airport....you fly right over their packing facility. How is that for street creed?	1
good	1
just wish all the great food wasn't Pantry ..	1
so tasty and crunchy!	1
Like Skippy.	1
My name is William Hardin and I am....a peanut butter fan. There I have said it so I can relax now that the world knows. You will never find me without PB at home. There is always back up jars just waiting on the bench to be put in the game. That being said, because of the cost differences, I typically purchase the best value. In a perfect world my option of choice would be Skippy smooth in small jars. Every 5th jar would be Skippy super chunk. Super Chunk is good but a bit much for me all the time so I use it every so often.  So now the you know I like the product, why only four stars you ask? Because I am not the biggest fan of this size & style of container. The smaller the better so you prevent the PB from separating the oil or getting too loose. Jars with straight sides are easier to empty than this design which basically requires your hand be INSIDE the container to finish it off.	1
Been eating Skippy for years.  Love the Extra Crunchy!	1
I've been a Skippy fan since I was a child -- MANY years ago.  My favorite "go-to" for a quick meal is a peanut butter sandwich, a small salad, and an apple or other fruit.  It just hits the spot.  They've changed the formulation over the years but retained the same basic flavor.  I use the creamy mostly for cooking/baking: peanut butter cookies, peanut sauce for satay or summer roll dip, etc.  The Super Chunk is for eating -- sandwiches, peanut butter & celery, peanut butter and crackers, etc.  All things in moderation -- this isn't low-cal, but it doesn't take much to satisfy the hunger pangs.  Excellent deal, too -- you get two 64-oz jars.  I love the stuff -- a well-deserved 5 stars.	1
Skippy lovers rejoice! America's favorite peanut butter is value priced and packed in TWO sixty four ounce jars. Everyone in our home that likes peanut butter loves Skippy's perfect balance of sweet and salty and that it's blended to never need stirring. The chunky version has bits of peanuts that give added texture and crunch. Creamy is the style most of my family likes for sandwiches, but I especially like chunky for baking. I'm forward to trying the new Super Crunch version. Smooth or with bits of nuts, Skippy is a preferred brand in our home. We go through a lot of peanut butter, so being able to order these big jars is a plus.	1
The peanut butter I received is Creamy.  It is perfect for using in peanut butter cookies.  I like the flavor of this and I love how easily it mixed up for cookies.  Peanut butter cookies are my favorite and I always forget how easy they are to make with the right kitchen tools (KitchenAid mixer, in particular).  The flavor is really rich and peanutty.  I am usually a fan of Jif but once I branched out to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Peanut-Butter-Co-Top-Sellers-Pack-16-Ounce-Jars-Pack-of-4/dp/B00CWYXLZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Peanut Butter & Co. Top Sellers Pack, 16 Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;Jif was pretty much all over for me.  There are a lot of great peanut butters that taste really great.  This is one of them.  I am really curious about the Super Chunk now, though.	1
Sugar and lard are un necessary ingredients in peanut butter.	-1
I like to christen each jar of peanut butter by opening it and taking a spoonful and this jar was no different.  It was peanutty, creamy and just what I expected.  These jars are HUGE, but we actually go through two of these a month so it's a good deal for us.  Yes there is a quite a bit of sugar in this and we could buy a more natural peanut butter that may have less, but we like the flavor of this one and so we are okay with it.  Only thing keeping it from a five star is the price as it's just a bit higher than what I would be used to paying.	1
I've loved peanut butter for the past almost 70 years.  Now I make numerous cookies and confections with it, including peanut butter fudge, peanut butter cookies; and others and while making those, I cannot pass up the spare moment or two to get a scoop of the peanut butter on some cracker or a half slice of bread.  It brings the kid out in my again after all these years!	1
Love the Extra Crunchy Peanut burtter by Skippy.  Thank you	1
Love it	1
good	1
Amazon Prime is the ONLY place I can find Skippy in this large of a container. Awesome!! Thanks!!	1
These are the best mixture of nuts, cashews, macadamia, and almonds.  They are in small packages and great for a little snack.	1
What can I say . These are great .	1
good and fresh	1
Yum!	1
This is THE Skippy Superchunk, and still tastes amazing.  What I have a problem with is the price, which is $6..95 at Walmart.  Why is it so ridiculously expensive here?	-1
For the price, this was a great deal. It has since gone up dramatically.	1
8 pounds of wonderful tasting  crunchy peanut butter for a price so low I thought it was a typo. Great deal. Great peanut butter.	1
This is what happens when your up at 3 am & hungry..lol	1
Good!	1
I always buy this, but i never get any.  It doesn't seem to matter how much of this super chunk peanut butter I buy, my guys always eat it up on crackers before I ever know the jar has been opened.  I don't care to bake bars or cakes with this particular kind, because the nuts always sort of sink to the bottom of any batter, but it is ok for cookies, if you like peanuts in your cookies.  Generally I buy the smooth to cook with and the crunchy for my guys.  They love this on just plain saltines or graham crackers.  They also prefer it for P&J sandwiches.  I don't- I don't find it as easy to spread, but it is just a matter of personal preference.	1
Yummy!	1
Very good! I love this mix!	1
Good product.	1
This was not less than 50% peanuts, more like 50+% regular peanuts	-1
I eat it right out of the jar for a quick pick me up.	1
D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  Smooth, rich creamy white and milk chocolate & shredded coconut surround a fresh, crunchy macadamia nut.  I received a bag of these for Christmas today and they are as fresh as the ones you can buy in all the local stores in Hawaii. I've been a repeat visitor to Hawaii over the last 25 years, lived there for 5 years, and during that time I've bought many bags of this candy. The one I received tasted just as fresh as the samples I was given when I visited the Mauna Loa factory on the island of Hawaii. For anyone who loves chocolate, coconut and the islands this would be the ultimate treat. You won't want to share this bag!	1
I buy these nuts often. This particular can had a better mix with less peanuts. I really liked it had plenty of brazil nuts.	1
great item	1
Good nuts	1
I am nutty person to mix with yogurt. Thanks	1
I sent these to a friend who is part of an active US Military family. They can use all the help they can get stretching their food dollar and Amazon makes it so easy for me to assist as often as I can.  Peanutbutter is an obvious staple.  With two little ones that LOVE peanutbutter, they go through a lot of it.  Skippy is my personal favorite.  This happens to be chunky, which I also love for texture as well as taste!  Win/Win/Win. :)	1
very good	1
Excellent product and shipping.	1
I live with a Skippy Super Chunk addict. Had no idea how bad it was until I mistakenly came home with a jar of creamy style peanut butter.  "I just want you to know, that every time I open that jar, its like you care nothing for me."  Jeepers! It's only peanut butter! Well, apparently not. Amazon's Prime Pantry has a decent price, so I guess I'm out of the doghouse. To be honest,  it is indeed a good, fresh tasting peanut butter. And Super Chunk is super chunky.	1
Always good to snack on,  my can had more than its share of peanuts though and that was a disappointment this time..  I have always enjoyed your product and will more than likely buy them again.	1
Good snack	1
Tasty and crunchy and so good in the morning or anytime on toast!	1
Great peanut butter- and the chunky version is a favorite on apples.	1
very fresh!	1
I have always been a peanut butter lover and in my opinion the absolute best tasting peanut butter is this Skippy Super Chunk Peanut Butter Extra Crunchy brand. The great thing about peanut butter is that it is a good source of protein and vitamins.  I also love to use this product on raisin toast and crackers.  If you are looking to eat a little bit more healthy try cutting up some apples and putting this Skippy Super crunch peanut butter on it. It is a delicious treat.  If you love peanuts and peanut butter you should check out this Skippy brand of extra crunchy peanut butter.  Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: A poetic tribute to warriors).	1
Love it!!	1
Ith wath rearry goot	1
whats not to luv	1
Fresh, crunchy, and good	1
These Deluxe Mixed Nuts hit the spot. What a great, healthy, low-sodium snack. Planters is king of the tree-nut. Always fresh and perfect.	1
always good	1
Very tasty	1
These are the best tasting chocolate covered macadamia nuts on the planet!  I ate them as a snack while on Maui, but they are pricey, so I am purchasing them from Amazon.	1
Large, perfect, glorious taste, just what I've always come to expect from this brand.  They are a little bit saltier than I would like, but the nuts really are lovely.	1
Of the major brands of peanut butter, I almost always buy Skippy. I've tried the others, particularly Jif and Peter Pan. And while they're okay, the texture of Skippy is smoother, the chunks are a little bigger and more numerous, and it has a richer taste. I'm quite aware that this is probably not the most healthful peanut butter around, but when it comes to taste, nothing can be beat. I like to put a dab of it on a slice of apple. I also have a little concoction I make for an energy boostera tablespoon of Skippy, a spoonful of granola, some raisins, and a few chocolate chips, all mixed together. It tastes great and is a nice way to get a little bit of energy at the start of the day.	1
this jar of skippy was very fresh.  I never knew it could taste differently than when I buy it in the store.  I guess they have a very short turn around.  It tasted very peanutty and fresh.	1
What else can I say? I love Skippy peanut butter, and we go through a lot of it. Buying it in this size is definitely the most cost-effective way to do it. I have not had problems with freshness, and would recommend these.	1
This is one of our favorite cereals, so it doesn't take long before someone is saying "Did you eat the last of the Cracklin' Oat Bran?"	1
If you like crunchy, these oats stay crunchy in milk for a while. The taste is great and the added fiber to my diet is a bonus. Great buy and great delivery too!	1
Love this cereal!! I can never find it locally anymore.. Glad to see it here! Tastes awesome, a bit sweet and good with or without milk.. Good snack and full of fiber..	1
While I preferred the original form of this product, it's still delicious and it never lasts long around my house. It's crunchy, a little sweet, and full of fiber. My favorite of the big commercial cereals and it only gets better once it's cover with milk.	1
Super nutty, and thankfully peanut free. There's nothing worse than those awful red peanut skins that litter so many nut mixes.	1
I've always liked this cereal. It's cheaper from Amazon than at the market.	1
My doctor advised me to begin eating this 3-4 times a week for breakfast. It is high in fiber, with all those benefits, but is tasty. I am now eating it regularly.	1
Great Cereal	1
Nice, crunchy cereal.  I often eat this.	1
very good	1
Very tasty....	1
Mad about nuts.	1
Take a half-cup berries or chopped peaches, add 1/3 of a serving of Cracklin' Oat Bran, 1 Tbsp. cream, 1 Tbsp. water; now warm it in the microwave and stir it all together and you have a tasty treat that's not far off in flavor from an old-fashioned cobbler. Or kind of break this up and mix it into some plain yogurt with berries and add a little honey to it.  We never eat cereal as a breakfast food, but we love it sometimes used as an ingredient in a quick snack or dessert, and Cracklin' Oat Bran works really well for that since it's kinda sweet and has some good cinnamony flavor.	1
Nothing good about this cereal	-1
The best cereal!!! And, it is like $2 cheaper than at any grocery store!	1
This is one of my favorites, so I love clicking & it appearing on my stoop!	1
I love my nuts, I can't resist nuts in my mouth sometimes.  I have ordered this a few times!!	1
all good	1
It good and yummy. Something I add to a snack mix.	1
Surprisingly very good. I was worried there would be no flavor, but not the case. Not too sweet either. Nice and subtle	1
taste was ok but this are very hard and don't soften in milk	1
I thought it would be gross, I'm glad to say I was wrong, this cereal is like little cookie/granola bites, good cinnamon taste	1
IF U LOVE RAISINS THAN YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE THEY CAN BE IN SUPERMARKETS. THIS IS THE WAY 2 GO. 4 LARGE BAGS FILLED WITH FRESH, MOIST SWEET RAISINS JUST BEGGING 2 BE ADDED 2 UR CEREAL, BAKING OR HEALTHY SNACKING RIGHT OUTTA THE BAG. THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY, IN PERFECT CONDITION + ALL HAVE FAR OFF EXPIRATION DATES! AND U JUST CANT BEAT THE PRICE! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMED!	1
If you are truly "HEALTH-CONCIOUS", THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO PURCHASE RAISINS, and Raisins and Almonds is the only way to 'FLY..."	1
i love raisins. i snack on them and put a few extra with my raisin bran cereal in the morning. it's good food.	1
Delicious!	1
I bought a box for old time's sake, but it'll probably be the last time I do so. I guess I forgot how bad the ingredients were, or perhaps I didn't pay that much attention when I was younger. Saturated fats, preservatives, and corn syrup... yuck. And it doesn't taste as good as I remember either, it's way too sweet! Is it really so hard to make a cereal that doesn't have so much unnecessary toxic junk in it?	-1
good cereal	1
VERY GOOD	1
Ive locked cracklin oat bran my whole life. I personally enjoy it best after sitting in the milk enough to make them soft.	1
good taste but a little hard for my liking	1
Great way for getting fiber in one's diet without feeling that it's something that you have to eat for health reasons.  It's so tasty that I have to remember to stop eating after one cup.  One of my favorite breakfast choices.	1
I like this. That is why I ordered it.	1
toogood for words	1
The most delicious cereal out there. It's unreasonably expensive in most grocery stores so buying at a reasonable price via Prime Pantry is the cat's pajamas.	1
As if getting fiber in your diet isn't tough enough, this cereal is unappetizing and looks like dog food.	-1
So convenient to order online. Love this cereal. Good price.	1
Love Cracklin Oat Bran and price was great!	1
Tastes great!	1
Ok	1
HEALTHY	1
Fresh and good quality	1
DELICIOUS	1
My husband loves this cereal for breakfast.	1
It's cereal	1
Wow!  I didn't know this stuff was still around.  It used to be my favorite cereal of all time, and then I sort of lost track of it.  Saw it here on Amazon and ordered it from the Pantry.  It's just like I remember it!  Great "oatmeal" taste with just the right amount of cinnamon and spice.  Good right out of the box, too, as a snack.  I usually have a "standard" serving (3/4 C) with about 1/3 C milk, along with some fresh fruit or small 1-egg veggie frittata -- the perfect size breakfast and a tasty beginning to my day.  Will continue purchasing this as long as Amazon carries (it's not available at my local supermarket).	1
The rasins are great as usual.	1
Great product. Good price. With Prime shipping, and subscribe and save, and Prime Pantry memberships. Everything pays for itself in one shipment. So many packs. Great take with you anywhere snack.	1
A good, fresh tasting raisin. They are good as a snack, in a bowl of oatmeal, in cereal, or in numerous recipes. I love these little boxes to slip into my purse for a quick snack on the go.	1
Not as fresh as the ones I get at the local store.	-1
I enjoy nuts, and I enjoyed this product.  It is a little bit too salty for my taste even when I have cravings for salt, so I think next time I will look for a lightly salted product.  Planters is a bit of a standard in American commercial nut manufacturing, so you can be assured of a consistently good quality product.  And modest portions of nuts is very heart healthy.  Enjoy!	1
I prefer less salty roasted nut options and this one was a great mix. The nuts are just lightly salted, which makes them more enjoyable for me.  The mix is mostly peanuts and almonds, but it had a good selection of other nuts. -> The peanuts were good tasting, just lightly roasted, but not as flavorful as other peanuts I have tasted from Planters. -> The almonds have a dry roasted flavor. -> The mix has some walnuts and pecans, both mostly pieces but some pieces are quite large; walnuts were crunchy and dry, lacking flavor; pecans were less dry, almost buttery, but again lacked flavor. -> There were few pistachios in the mix, but they were absolutely delicious. -> Hazelnuts are sometimes hardly there, but I had some cans with decent amount of hazelnuts. Those had a strange almost `raw` flavor, most probably there were not actually roasted.  Overall I enjoyed having a mix of nuts (I used them for various recipes requiring certain nuts, not only for snacking). This review is for the Planters Nutrition Heart Healthy Mix (Peanuts, Almonds, Pistachios, Pecans, Walnuts & Hazelnuts).	1
Although they don't look all that appealing. They taste really great.	1
Gotta love breakfast.	1
Since Cracklin' Oat Bran was created, there have been a lot more high fiber cereals created, but this one still holds up. Very tasty and pleasant for breakfast or a snack.	1
My favorite cereal	1
Awesome	1
ALWAYS GOOD SUNMAID RAISINS.  BEEN EATING THEM SINCE I WAS A CHILD.	1
Didn't read, I got small boxes.	1
Great	1
Remember these? The itty bitty raisin boxes we all got as kids in school snacks or lunches? Turns out they're still tasty and nutritious, and still in those tiny boxes.  Great to have in the pantry for a day where you need a snack but don't want to go buy something.	1
Thought the price was okay and like the idea that more than one pkg. comes at a time.  Love raisins and we use a lot of them.  Will be ordering them again soon. Thank you	1
Good for a healthy snack. Reasonable snack.	1
I love raisins so  want  to have a supply always  on hand.  Reasonably priced.  Great taste!	1
Love them	1
Yummy! A great price on Amazon....I will certainly be purchasing more in the future!	1
A wonderful oat cereal without the worry of nuts.  There are so many children who are allergic to nuts these days and it's hard to find many kinds of cereal without nuts these days.	1
Love this cereal	1
It you're looking to get more fiber in, this works.  It tastes amazing but is high in calories.  Trade off.	1
I used to LOVE Cracklin' Oat bran. Kelloggs ruined it with tropical oils.	-1
This is one of my favorite cereals! I wish it weren't so expensive. I've been eating this since I was a teenager. I'm not so much of a teenager anymore. Doh!	1
Delicious!  Higher fat cereal - but definitely keeps me full longer than sugar cereals	1
Cracklin' good!	1
love it	1
They arrived fresh and plump.  We like these smaller boxes more than a single large one.  At a cost a little more than 20 cents per box, you cannot find a more reasonably priced healthy snack, and when purchased like this they are already individually portioned.  Easy to toss into a lunchbox or purse, they are great to have on hand when hunger strikes.  I didn't think these had changed one bit since I was a kid, so I did a little research. The "maid" has changed very slightly in the past 100 years, everything else is the same.  Wow, I love it when a company doesn't feel the need to mess around with perfection.	1
Good	1
Fresh	1
As expected - love that you can have groceries sent :-) I love to send care packages to my family	1
great fresh raisins	1
Family favorite!	1
I love Mac nuts, but these under delivered. They were sorta tasteless  although they are sweet but finish sort of oily. I found that their Chocolate product actually tastes great, and plain mac nuts are also yummy. But these just didn't have it.	-1
This is Reynolds "new" version of the older "Reynolds Release!" product - a non-stick foil that REALLY works.  I've been using this product since it was first introduced - at least 7 or 8 years - and I haven't found anything yet that sticks to it.  I coat chicken breasts with a honey/mustard glaze, and each serving releases with no sticking whatsoever.  Oven-roasted veggies? same thing.  Cheese-filled flanksteak rolls? melted cheese will not stick.  I couldn't live without it.  Well, I guess I COULD, but I don't want to.  It makes life soooo much easier.  I won't speak to the price here, because I've seen it range from MUCH lower than my local supermarket to VERY high plus postage.  Just keep an eye on it, and snap it up when you find it on sale.	1
just the right size for a quick low calorie snack, good for you! very good price and on time delivery!	1
These raisins were very dry and seedy. They did not taste fresh and seemed shelf stale.	-1
same as store	1
YUM, Great product	1
I am an old Sunmaid Gal....  Yummy	1
One of my favorites	1
I have been eating this product for years and like to mix it with granola for my breakfast. But my wife says they look like dog biscuits. Haha Bow Wow	1
Great!	1
This is the best cereal but I love Bran.	1
good cereal.	1
Nice mixture of nuts, very tasty!	1
I love these Planters nuts.  I like nuts that aren't nearly all peanuts.	1
Tastes great.	1
Delicious as expected, not too sweet, not too salty.	1
Yum	1
The raisins are fine, but they stick together like crazy.  Every time I want some raisins, it's basically me clawing some away from the pack with my fingernails...	1
Though they've been around forever, they are still the best there is. Love them. I used to buy store brand on occasion until I found little crawling things in a package. Ugh!	1
good	1
Good	1
Great chewy flavor!  Perfect size for adding to your lunch box or keeping some in the car.	1
These are my favorite snack food for anytime! The price is a little high for my budget, but I buy when I can!	1
Sweet and crunchy. Not too sweet.	1
My favorite cereal!	1
Too much GMO sugar!	-1
Exactly good for you that should taste nice.	1
all good	1
It was great.  But watch what you order with heavier items.  Soda crushed many items.	1
most excellent	1
good cereal  & healthy	1
love it	1
Great product for the price!	1
Great cereal	1
So yummy that you can eat them right out of the box without milk. They really DO taste like Oatmeal Cookies!	1
good product	1
Everyone likes raisins, and the little one ounce boxes are the right size for a mid-afternoon or midnight healthy snack. Sun-Maid makes good quality products at good prices.	1
Classic. Best brand of raisins, in my opinion. I give these out at Halloween, as part of the treat bags I prepare. Perfect portion size, good snack.  Also good on cereal. I like to buy the Sun-Maid can of raisins, with recloseable lid, to keep them fresh for use at home (cereal, baking into muffins and sweet breads).	1
I love planters	1
One of my new favorite cereals.	1
despite being good for you this really taste good.	1
Best cereal ever. Need I say more?	1
Best cereal ever.	1
The same class for so many years. I try this brand when I was 6 years old and the quality and flavor still the same.	1
It's fine and it is what it is!	1
it really works and makes clean up a breeze.	1
Can't go wrong with non-stick!  Why isn't it all non-stick though . . . when do we ever want foil to stick?	1
worked great	1
Like this for baking	1
I love this product for cooking and doing projects with glue.	1
This is the best foil i have ever used!	1
good snack item	1
Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.	1
Good quality and enjoyed.	1
They're Sun Maid.  What's not to like!	1
Taste Great!	1
I've been buying these for years, but recently they haven't been available in the 6-pk so I tried Paul Newman's organic and they are much tastier.	1
a raisin is a raisin. but sun-maid dose it best.	1
I bought this for snacking on something a little sweet but without the fat, and I guess I used to have more of a sweet tooth.  They could cut the sugar down and it would be ever batter!	1
Healthy and delicious. I get this for my wife and she really enjoys eating it.	1
Definitely in my top '3' of cereals. It's got the sweet, the crunch and the health components. It's just good-old fashioned yum!	1
You must try these!	1
Sweet Oats ,Oh Sweet cracking Oats! Perfect W/Milk ,even W/ Goats' ! So try  Dry , You could Survive !	1
Very Good price for this..	1
Excellent product, love it!!	1
Good tin foil	1
Truly non-stick and thick	1
as described	1
This foil does wonders to protect your noggin from interstellar mind readers.	1
I love this cereal but it's not always available at our grocery store. The price was lower on Amazon, too.  Very pleased.	1
Probably one of the healthier commercial cereals.  Very good.	1
Just love this crunchy healthy cereal. Sometimes I even have it for a light dinner with fruit. It even has protein. Yummy.	1
just as described, love it	1
This cereal is so good. You can just grab a handful for a snack and it's great. This is one of the cereals where you can actually eat "one" serving of it and be full. Amazon has by far the cheapest price for this as well. i usually get this for $3. At the stores by me, it goes for $5-6.	1
Love this cereal!!	1
We love these nuts for family or party!!  The mixture is the best and the salt content is just right.  There is such a healthy nutty crunch in every bite...like a party in the mouth!!	1
very good product. Has the nuts that are supposed to be the best for men.  Taste good .	1
What can I say. Planters Nuts	1
wonderful for snacking	1
Haven't seen this in the store for a long time.  Love this cereal.	1
The best tasting colon cleanse on the market.	1
Forgot how good these taste.	1
I have been eating Cracklin' Oat Bran for years.  I eat it right out of the box.  It's the best tasting fiber I have ever had.	1
I cannot find this in the store anymore or  it seems it is bought out before I get to it! I have bought this for years!! Love it!!	1
First time using Reynolds non stick foil. Was very impressed how nothing stuck after using it to cook bake chicken.	1
Best foil ever	1
Didnt think it would be so small	-1
Very thick very good rap	1
Love this stuff!  I use it to line cookie sheets and other pans so that I do not have a messy pan to clean.	1
always use this product	1
Use often and love it	1
favorite cereal	1
Very disappointing.  Tastes stale and is very dry and crumbly.  I can't even eat it because it crumbles into bits and becomes powdery, causing me to choke.	-1
These are very good.  They are nice and fresh in resealable bags to keep them that way.	1
Good snack for the children.	1
Just fine. Not a knock off. What do you say. They are good. LOTS OF EM. LOL But just fine and dandy.	1
tasty!	1
Always wrap your meat to keep you healthy. Food poisoning can be deadly.	1
This is exactly what is needed when I am cooking or baking. Not available in Europe, so again, I take it with me when I go there.	1
Truly ... it does not stick no matter what you are broiling, baking, etc.  Really works.	1
I love this non-stick foil!!  It really works!!  Use it whenever I make fish in the oven.....no mess and clean-up is a breeze!	1
Good one, as advertised - non-stick, heavy duty	1
Great for use with my outdoor grill. We always bring a roll with us for camping or at the cabin. Really is non stick!	1
Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal is a delicious treat that I haven't had for years.  At local grocery stores one small box is over $5-$6, which is pretty ridiculous for cereal.  When I saw it for a great price on Amazon Prime Pantry I jumped at the chance to try my old favorite and was happy I did.  Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal tastes like a delicious oatmeal cookie.  It is satisfyingly crunchy, with an oaty, lightly sweet taste.  One thing that I did not recall from eating it years ago was that it has a slightly cinnamon flavor as well.  Perhaps the product did not have the cinnamon flavor in prior years.  I like cinnamon, but don't always want cereal or baked goods to have a distinct cinnamon flavor, so this is something to keep in mind in case you dislike cinnamon or feel the same way I do.  This cereal is so tasty that I will grab a handful and eat it plain for a snack.  But it tastes even better in a bowl of milk.  It isn't a low fat cereal, at 7g of fat per serving, but it is certainly a better choice than highly processed sugary snacks, or baked goods with more fat and sugar.  I find that it is somewhat rich so just a small bowl satisfies my craving for a sweet snack.  I am happy to have found it available on Prime Pantry and will purchase it again.	1
Thanks to the Prime Pantry program,  I bought this cereal for a great price. It was cheaper than buying it at my local grocery store,  even with a coupon.  It was fresh and very tasty.	1
wonderful - fresh, crunchy, delicious - lower priced than supermarket	1
Good	1
Raisins are a naturally good and healthful source of iron and fiber. Eat them as a snack or for an after dinner desert. Sun Maid has always been my Favorite brand.	1
Love raisins, have been eating this brand for as long as I can remember. They came as expected, in good quality!	1
Standard branded product - exactly as you would expect.	1
I enjoy these raisins!  They are soft and taste great.  I use them for snacks as well as baking.  Last work!	1
Best product ever! Love this non-stick aluminum foil! No need to use oil spray adding additional calories, nor oil to food that shouldn't be oily. I wish the package contained more than 35 feet like the 200 feet regular, original Reynold's Aluminum Foil.	1
This aluminum foil works well.	1
This stuff really is non stick. Great for grilling with.	1
This is great!  I cannot find it in stores near me.  NOTHING sticks to it.  Cooks food evenly with no issues.	1
Good flavor, just a tad costly online.	1
As always, these raisins are great.  For cooking, baking, or simply as a snack.  Very, very tasty!!! Very, very, very!!!	1
Love this!	1
I looked for this cereal in several different supermarkets and none of them carried it. So I'm glad I could find it on Amazon but it's still as good as I remember it being a few years ago. This cereal has a great taste, a great crunch and unlike other Bran type cereals it doesn't get soggy in milk right away. At least now I know where to look for it the next time I want a box of it.	1
My favorite	1
Great	1
Delicious and health.  We love this cereal.	1
This is good but is sugary.  I think as far as a fiber cereal goes I'll stick with Fiber One.	1
My trusted brand.	1
No good it is too thin	-1
Worked well	1
I wish it weren't so expensive to use this foil; I HATE it when foil sticks to my food, or vise versa. However, Amazon's price is lower than just about anywhere else without going to the warehouse store and having to buy 2 1/2 miles of it!	1
much better product than expected	1
This the best product I have ever used. Can'the believe it took me so long to find my new favorite product. Thicker than regular foil and so far nothing sticks to it including starchy roasted potatoes. Wish it came in bigger size.	1
This foIL lives up to its name! Doesn't stick,  is not thin. Doesn't tare like a lit of other aluminum foils do.	1
I love this foil.	1
This is one of those products that makes you wonder how anyone ever cooked before it was developed. Tremendous for pressing Cuban sandwiches without the cheese or pork sticking to the heated press. Thousands of uses for this foil.	1
Great product. Really doesn't stick to foods!	1
Yum!	1
Great crunch and good for you.	1
Great!	1
Product as described	1
delicious	1
Has a texture similar to granola, in a pressed form with a cinnamon flavor. Cheaper on amazon than at the grocery store!	1
great	1
Surprisingly great flavor. Cinnamon tasting. I was expecting it to taste like a hay field.	1
This cereal is soooo good and it's getting harder and harder to find in stores. It has oats in it with just a hint of cinnamon. It's one of my favorites. It's here at a good price too. Grab a box, you will love it.	1
I haven't had this cereal since I was a teenager. Honestly I didn't even know it still existed until I saw it in Prime Pantry. I need to order more I forgot how much I loved it!	1
I love this cereal, and it's not overly sweet like some cereals are, and (if I can say this, they give you your need for fiber), at least it helps me.	1
My very favorite cereal!!! This has so many memories connected to it from my childhood at my Grandma's house.	1
favorite cereal	1
The nuts were delicious as a snack.	1
great stuff is in here	1
About as good as foil gets	1
Thick and solid	1
It's high quality, thick foil. However, I expected a larger size considering price.	1
This is a great way to buy this product. Money saving by buying bulk, yet packages are reasonable size and the balance stay fresh. Also, save on shipping!	1
Ok, I bought these because prime pantry didn't have my regular All Bran cereal...stay very crunchy, even with milk, which I love but they do have a cinnamon flavor. That's fine for me as I love cinnamon, but some may not like that in a bran cereal.	1
My single favorite cereal.  Glad to see it at a good price on Amazon!	1
My favorite cereal. Nice and crunchy with lots of cinnamon and nutmeg flavors	1
Most underrated cereal. Delicious if you let it soak in the milk for a little bit	1
I love the taste of this and it's made from oats, which is good for you.  The grocery stores charge a fortune and Amazon has a much lower price.  It keeps you full for a while too.	1
I love this cereal and eat it almost every morning for breakfast. Pretty healthy set of ingredients as well.	1
I love this cereal, was a good price. Give prime pantry a try.	1
yum	1
Will never again go with a less expensive brand.  I tried to save money, but the amount of product in this tube is so worth it!!  Will not do without it again.  It is strong, does not tear easily, and keeps odors and foods fresh in containers when refrigerated.  Wonderful product!!	1
works great	1
It is foil and works well.	1
Like this product worth the price, durable, non stick results with a variety of foods that would usually stick to regular foil.  Will and have recommend product and will continue to purchase.	1
great product	1
These packs satisfy my craving for nuts, especially cashews. Only 210 calories per pack	1
Good nuts - Amazon pantry is very convenient.	1
Planters are the best when it comes to nuts. You would think all nuts would be the same but it's just not the case. This container has a lot fewer 'pieces' and mostly whole nuts with the freshest flavor and crunch. Don't forget the precise amount of salt. Bad part is that I could eat the whole canister in no time flat. This product is very consistent when reordering.	1
Delicious as always! I eat directly from the box as a snack!	1
Saw these available in the Prime Pantry section so ordered some. Had forgotten how really good this is!!	1
The best.  At a very good ptice.	1
This is one of my all time favorite cereals!!!  It is crunchy and sweet and very filling.  I think of cereal as a comfort food and Cracklin' OatBran is very comforting to me.  Sometimes I eat it for a snack or dinner.  It is yummy and filling any time of day.	1
Loved it, my whole family ended up eating it.	1
This non stick works really well. I have tried some of the generic non stick foil, and I just don't think it stands up to Reynolds Wrap Non-Stick.  Just my preference, will buy again.	1
Purchase as expected.	1
Thank you	1
It's what I expected	1
The 56oz can of "mixed nuts" consists of almost entirely very tiny peanut halves and almonds	-1
This stuff does the job!	1
ok	1
It is Reynolds the BEST!	1
Excellent quality. Excellent price. Exactly as described. Highly recommended!	1
I love Advil. Wish they had a larger quantity for ibuprofen available via PrimePantry.	1
Excellent!!!	1
Great product for the aches and pains of life.  Do not take on an empty stomach and do not drink alcohol with this medicine.  Easy to swallow.	1
Arrived intact.  Worked as Advil should.  Will buy again.	1
A	1
It's foil. It's fine. I can't say I love it. But it makes a whole bunch of foil hats for when we watch CNN.	1
Reynolds Wrap is the best.  Need I say more.	1
Great product as described.	1
its tin foil	1
Great product for all your baking needs!!!	1
Will buy again	1
Great Product! Love it! High quality as expected!	1
Great price	1
great	1
great price!	1
Good ...	1
Satisfied with the purchase. Straight forward price. Recommend buying through amazon pantry. Will continue purchasing from here. Did I meet the word requirement yet?	1
This fights my muscle pain	1
Does what it says on the box.	1
Helps with fever and swelling.	1
Needed in the house all the times	1
Excellent I like it	1
good price	1
This is a product that I find necessary to keep on hand.  It's effective for me and erases a lot of stiff muscle pain.  I'm glad it's available - works better than aspirin alone.	1
Nuts for the nutty household.	1
They are unsalted..	1
great!	1
Wrap is working well and good value for being received at my doorstep.  This is an honest and genuine review for which I did NOT receive any discounts.	1
No review	1
great product.  A+	1
Does What It Says!	1
Great	1
I'm in love with this Non-stick foil. Nothing stick on it at all. I use it in the toaster oven- stove -grill any where you need foil. Try it you will be please.	1
Love the non stick side	1
I received a free sample of this from smiley360 and I was surprised! It worked well compared to my usual children's Tylenol. Worked quick, aided discomfort and fever vanished! Will use again.	1
advil	1
sweet deal.	1
I can't use Advil myself, since I'm allergic to all non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, but my son and several friends swear by Advil Ibuprofen Tablets!!  They love the coating on the tablets, which makes them easier to swallow than other larger, uncoated products.  My son had neck surgery several years ago, and sometimes the pain comes back in spades.  The Advil Ibuprofen is his go-to medicine for that pain.  It relieves it quickly and keeps it away.  Wish I could take this, since I've heard so many good things about it!	1
I love Advil. It works really well. The tablets are small and not too strong. You can get them in a variety of prescription strengths. I got the 200 mg. I eat one to help me deal with monthly woman's pain. It helps my cramps feel less strong.  I just take one and it lasts for me almost the whole day. Everyone has different metabolic rates. So, you may need to experiment on yourself to see which drug and which dosage works best for you. However, I have found Advil to be a reliable brand. I have bought other brands before, but they do not have as good packaging or have been involved in recall scandals. Advil however to my knowledge has not endured any of these. It is a good product. Even the outer capsule is a pleasant taste.	1
Prime pantry works great.  A lot will fit into the box.	1
For headaches.	1
Good Amazon Price As Always. My Doctor Says Go Easy On This Product Because It Does Tear Up Your Intestines.	1
Better than acetaminophen for a sore back.	1
Like the coated 200 mg tablets from Advil.  Much better to me an worth the extra cost over a generic.  With the coating on this I can take these when needed without any fluid.  Tried an order from Amazon Pantry to see how it would work out.  I was impressed.  I filled a pantry box to near 100%.  Made sure that the items were a nice mixture of items that would not necessary be packaged together and could be a problem.  All arrived in great condition with no damage.  Chips, cookies, bottled drinks, cooking oil. Snacks, etc. were the type of things that I mixed together.	1
This is a must-have for casserole cooks.  It is sturdy and truly even cheese won't stick to it.  I've been using it for years since it was first on the market, even at higher prices.  As soon as I open the last one in stock, I reorder.	1
Works great for keeping the aliens from reading / manipulating your brain waves AND makes for really easy clean up when cooking.  If my review was at all helpful to you please click the relevant button, thank you.	1
Reynolds, the classic aluminum foil and perhaps the easiest to tear evenly. I keep a cookie sheet lined with this in the oven and can put potatoes to bake directly above that and no mess. I also have wrapped more than a few presents in this, carefully as it is easy to wrinkle and it looks very festive and can do unusual shapes quite well.	1
This is really good to use when baking. I am sold on this.  Will be buying more	1
Great!	1
A good product that works well for not sticking to foods that are covered. However, I'm not sure it's worth it to me personally for the amount you get. I think it's probably easier to just spray a little non-stick spray on regular foil. Maybe a good choice for baked goods though. I don't bake much though, so it doesn't really suit my personal needs. It did work for its intended purpose though, which is why I gave it 4 stars.	1
How did I cook without this!?  I love this foil. Nothing sticks. Foods crisp. I roast a lot of veggies several times a week. I also oven roast chicken breast.  I will never allow myself to run out. This is definitely a must-have for my kitchen. Cannot recommend highly enough.	1
Great product but higher price than at grocery store.	1
I love this stuff!	1
Love it, can't stop	1
good nuts	1
Predictably, these didn't last long!	1
Absolutely great stuff.  Thanks Reynolds Wrap	1
It really does keep the food from sticking. Yes it is even better than Reynolds wrap regular aluminum foil.	1
No baker can do without these.  At least once you've tried it.  Such a help in the kitchen.	1
Great product and service.	1
Great for baking	1
no	1
Good variety. Great	1
Very good mix	1
Item is just as described. Non-stick works great. Makes for easy kitchen clean up.	1
My wife and I are pleased with the quality of this product.	1
I normally do not use aluminum foil mainly because I hate the sound of it, but I recently discovered the non stick foil from Reynolds and LOVE it! I use this to wrap my russet potatoes and make baked potatoes in my woodstove. I use this to line my pans when making oven Bacon and also to cover some foods that use frosting. The price point is exactly the same as going to my local superstore, and the fact that I was ordering my first Prime Pantry box, I decided to order 2! This is the only foil I buy, and the only foil I will ever use! There is the one non stick side that is clearly marked non stick side, and the other side is a normal foil surface. I purchased this full price. My opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way for my opinions.	1
The non-stick side generally works really well.  However, its not fool-proof.  Although I don't have extensive experience with this yet, so far I've found that if there is a lot of moisture in a food, it will still stick.  But, generally, works as advertised with most foods at a variety of temperatures.	1
This works great. I never heard of non-stick foil but once I tried it I will never use regular foil again for cooking. I re-heated pizza on it and the cheese melted down. Usually that would stick to the foil and be impossible to get off. It just slid right off the foil so I could enjoy every bite. I love this product!	1
Reynolds never fails.  It does what it's supposed to do.  The serrated cutting edge works nice and it doesn't tear in a million places it isn't supposed to.	1
I think you have to use a quality product if you want quality results. There are other "cling" type food wraps on the market and we have tried some of them but always go back to Glad Cling Wrap, because it is easy to tear from the roller and stays on the food we cover it with. We have had some wraps that came loose after a couple of days in a  moist refrigerator and let the food spoil. This has never happened to us with Glad Cling Wrap.	1
I purchased these as part of a pantry gift for a friend who needed some help in feeding a family of 5!  She reports that they arrived in good shape and we all need plastic wrap, right?	1
Very good!	1
As with all mixed nuts, expect plenty of peanuts and almonds. The can says less than 50% peanuts nd they make up the bulk with almonds. I do like the sea salt tho. Just wish they would put more pecans, filberts, etc. in the can.	1
Good mix of nuts. Satisfyingly oily and salty. Good flavor mix.	1
I use this non-stick foil in my toaster oven, probably 4-5 times a week.  It works like a charm.  The food does not stick, and there is, virtually, nothing to clean up.  I don't use it for baking cookies-for that I use parchment paper. But for cooking or reheating food for lunch or dinner, this product is wonderful!	1
PANTRY	1
Great non-stick.	1
I love this stuff! Really works well. Might be nice if it was a little thicker/more heavy duty but it works beautifully and it's nice to have an even distribution of non-stick as opposed to when you use cooking spray or oil.	1
Love this for covering casseroles that would otherwise stick to it.	1
works extremely well, I think I'll be buying this exclusively from now on.	1
Love this product! It works to allow your baked or bbq foods to come right off the foil without any oils used. Excellent price.	1
Great tasting nuts. Am enjoying them very much. Love the chocolate ones but these are a great snack for when I don't want anything sweet.	1
I have an elderly mother, who doesn't eat much.  I send her this order every 3- 4 months.  It has healthy fats, fiber, and protein!	1
This is non-stick?? Well, it sure sticks to bbq ribs. Not worth the price or claims.	-1
stale	-1
Hello, The product I came was not like the photo, is very similar but not the same that I bought , just consume it, but not the same Offered in the page.	-1
Damaged goods box smelled like pickles and glass  all in it	-1
This stuff is junk.  Never clings properly and always comes unpeeled.	-1
I've often wondered why I went to the solid white Albacore instead of this slurry.  Now I remember.	-1
Yup. The other reviewers are right. This is basically tuna soup. My booty is chunkier than this tuna by far!  That being written, this is okay for tuna casserole or fried tuna cakes but forget making tuna sammiches out of this hot mess. No wuh-hay!	-1
We ate these by the bagful while we were on vacation in Hawaii. I got home and was still craving them so I ordered, and Mauna Loa is the same brand we got in Hawaii. Maybe they don't travel well or something because they were not as flavorful nor fresh as the bags we bought on the island.	-1
Over the years "Tuna" has changed. What use to be "Chunk" is now a "paste" of mashed tuna meat and "other stuff" inside the tuna....and sometimes "soy" or other "stuff". The tuna "paste" is referred to as "tuna rendering or sludge" in the industry. It is pumped as a a liquid through the packaging process. Anytime you see the words "Chunk Light" this means a "sludge" mixture of tuna particles and "stuff" in either an oil or water solution. Its all about MONEY and how cheaply this company can get CHINESE tuna and "stuff" mashed up and into a can. That is enough for me to never buy a can of this product. See attached picture from the Bumble Bee website.	-1
its not chunk	-1
The Heart Healthy Mix is overwhelmingly peanuts ... in more ways than one. I haven't picked a pinch out of the bag yet that didn't have at least one peanut in it, and the taste of the peanuts overwhelms the tastes of any other nuts ... even if I eat them separately, they still have absorbed the strong taste of the peanuts.  I like peanuts, and I like the taste of peanuts, but I do not like my pecans and pistachios, walnuts and hazelnuts, and almonds to taste like peanuts.  Nor do I like paying pecan, pistachio, walnut, hazelnut, and almond prices for peanuts.  If you don't like that also, best give the Heart Healthy Mix a miss --- try the Wholesome Nut Mix instead.	-1
there was over 85 percent peanuts	-1
What happened to the Planters Product?  These nuts are tiny, very small. PLANTERS, has see the last of my dollars. I ordered two cans, the price seemed fair, little did I know. Very disappointed in the quality of this product... I rarely post negative but I could not in good conscience let this slide.  The only reason I gave it one star is regardless of size or quality, they are mixed nuts.	-1
They should call these "overpriced stale peanuts with a couple other nuts mixed in". Total disappointment. 90% stale peanuts.	-1
I didn't like this all that well because there were far too many peanuts and not enough other nuts.	-1
I bought these for the mix of nuts.  And you get a mix of nuts, but EVERYTHING tastes like peanuts.  Pecans taste like peanuts, filberts taste like peanuts, etc.  You can barely tell one kind of nuts from another.  I won't be buying these again.	-1
stale	-1
Salty too many peanuts!	-1
I was pretty mad when I got this to find that they were not blue. The ones I got were red. If they are not going to look like the picture they should say so! I needed the blue to match the dcor I wanted so this was very disappointing. Otherwise they are your standard solo cup.	-1
Disappointing mix of nuts overall. Bought 4 of these, and have opened 3 so far. The cans are probably 90%+ Peanuts and Almonds. My wife likes Brazil nuts most, and in the first container there was only 2 of them. The second container had ZERO. The third container had 3 and 1/2 of them. Extremely disappointing. For Pecans there have been an average of 8-10 halves per can. Cashews have a bit more, maybe around 20 of them per can.  Overall the nuts have a good flavor. A lot of the almonds are toasted well, and the flavor really comes through. Just don't buy these cans unless you are fine getting mostly Peanuts and Almonds. Picking out a Cashew or Pecan is a pleasant surprise, not a regular occurrence. And if you manage to find a Brazil nut it's like finding one of Wonka's Golden Tickets.	-1
This is the third can I've ordered and the quality is poor. The first can was fine although it contained mostly almonds. The second can was great with a good assortment with a clean appearance and good taste. In the third can about half of the nuts were broken and many just small fragments of their original size. Bits of nut skins covering the nuts gave a very dirty appearance although they didn't affect the overall taste. The nuts didn't have a 'fresh' taste and came across as a bit stale. Planters doesn't seem to have any quality control on it's products and I'll be ordering from another company.	-1
HARD AS ROCKS!	-1
What has happened to Planters quality?  I used to buy these and get a really good mix of peanuts, almonds, brazil nuts, filberts, pecans, and cashews.  No more.  My can was well over half peanuts -- more like 75-80%.  I got ** 4** brazil nuts, maybe 8 or 10 filberts, a few pecans (mostly small pieces), a healthy handful of almonds, and NO cashews that I could find, unless they were in pieces that look like peanuts.  I certainly didn't taste any.  Overly salty, too.  Just not worth it.  Will purchase only "premium" nut blends at the supermarket in the future.  Sorry.	-1
I was probably one of the first fans of Press 'n Seal.  I still think Press 'n Seal plastic is far superior to plastic wrap.  Lately though, it seems the box it comes in is so cheap, that I am frustrated to the core trying to get the Press 'n Seal out.  The two end caps that hold the roll in fell out.  Now, I have a plastic roll with nothing to hold it in the box.  If I grab the roll to try and unroll, I end up pressing on the roll and the Press 'n Seal starts sealing to itself right there on the roll!  I almost had a wad of Press 'n Seal I couldn't use.  Every time I unroll it, I have to be extra careful not to do that.	-1
While these were fresh they are almost all peanuts and almonds. The picture shows big pecans. They were not in the cans I received. I just got two or three broken pieces. I will start buying the kind of nuts I like without almond fillers.	-1
Very sticky in the roll making it almost impossible to pull out without squeezing the box. (Squeezing the box will result in increased adhesion of wrap in the roll.) Good idea but execution less than good. Will not reorder.	-1
I orginally purchased this because of an idea I saw on pinterest: to line the shelves of our fridge to help ease with the clean up of the crumbs and spills. It doesnt stick. It doesnt stick to plastic, glass or anything else, other than itself. Ugh. Will most likely toss it. Great idea, poor quality product.	-1
Sort of sweet and gets soggy in milk pretty quickly. I got it because it was on sale and was relatively lower in fat, but wouldn't buy again unless really really inexpensive.	-1
Prefer regular wrap.	-1
It is filled with soy. My stomach can't handle food made with soy.	-1
I received the product defective. It would have been better if someone inspected the shipments better to avoid issues like this.	-1
Do not like.  To hard to deal with	-1
Works well but leaves a sticky residue on your dishes that is impossible to clean, even if you have a dishwasher. Will not be purchasing again.	-1
Gross, you get these rock-hard pieces of I don't know what that you can't even chew. Taste is ok, it's the texture that makes this inedible to me.	-1
Absolutely nothing like Glad Wrap or Saran Wrap. This Is Awful. Doesn't stick to regualr plastic bowls, not a great seal on food, either. I wish I never wasted the money on this. If you want Glad Wrap or Saran Wrap, buy that, and not this instead.	-1
This plastic wrap is almost impossible to get out of the box, very hard to use. I gave it two stars instead of one because it does cling once you can wrestle a piece out of the box. I wont' buy it again. What an annoying and hard to use product.	-1
My error...texture of produce very disappointing. I should have researched more	-1
This was my first and last experience with Glad Press and Seal Plastic Wrap. I have used many brands including Glad' s plastic wrap.(original). That can be a little bit of a challenge to use at times.  This stuff however, is like using extra wide Duct Tape. It doesn't want to pull away from the rest of the roll. The box fell apart as I was trying to get it started.  When I finally got some off I found while it will stay where you put it okay.  It doesn't want to re-seal onto the item you put it on. Meaning I had to use a whole new piece to cover my food again. Doing so deposits twice the residue from the adhesive. On glass or plastic it's hard to get off worse if it's textured  This lead me to be very frustrated and displeased with the performance of this product.  As I find it costs much more than Glad plastic wrap and does much less in comparison. For this reason I can't recommend this product to others.	-1
I just did not care for the blandness of these .	-1
With the ever long race to reduce prices. It seems they have cut the amount of cinnamon used in this. There is only a slight hint of a cinnamon taste to it. I doubt I will buy this again, any time soon.	-1
If you want something that barely has any flavor go and get this. A few years back I could taste the cinnamon and have a bit of background sweetness. This version is not it. I am giving up cereal. Gone are the days of actual flavor. I hate to pass this on to others but better off giving it to someone else than wasting it.	-1
Box smashed	-1
Too sweet. Threw it out	-1
if you want to pay full price for a sample.. I had to laugh when I took this out of box.. I buy the Biggest jar of Nutella from the store for 3.68.. this jar cost me 3.something close to big jar's price. They do not even sell this jar in the stores..I truly believe it is a sample.. Its a joke ..thats what it is!	-1
these pads will be nice for pans with stick, work great	-1
Don't Like It. It Has A Bad Smell. Does Not Clean Well. Not Worth The Price	-1
Didn't like this but that is just me	-1
When you buy a nut spread, and the nuts are the THIRD item in the ingredient list, you have a problem!  You just bought yourself a bunch of sugar and palm oil!  The way they tried to market this as "healthy" is just silly!!	-1
Yucky	-1
Really not a fan of packaged mashed potatoes.  It is definitly better to just go buy fresh potatoes and make them from scratch.  It may be a little more work but when done right it beat the packaged potatoes everyday.	-1
so do	-1
the worst flavor and over sweetened stuff ever!	-1
The reason I am a soda addict is because; Colas use a different type of caffeine (possibly Caffeine citrate?) and the cola nut.) Colas do not affect the nervous system like coffee. Coffee makes me nervous, shaky and has other side effects. Colas do not make me nervous...  Zevia uses coffee as the source of caffeine. Cannot drink it. I also do not like Stevia sweetener. Makes my system feel 'off'.  Please, someone out there make a true natural cola without coffee. Keep the main ingredients but NO sweeteners, no aspartame, no sugar, no fructose.., no coffee, no tea. We can add our own choice of sweetener.  Also tried that new soda making machine. No good! Ingredients loaded with chemicals, sulfites that cause migraines. No option to add my own choice of sweetener; forced to use high fructose corn syrup or aspartame...  Do we have to make our own truly natural sodas?! I am learning and will be free of all you guys someday!	-1
My wife and I were thrilled when we heard that there was a soda with Stevia used for a sweetner, instead of dangerous Aspartame or other artificial sweetners.  We went down to our local health food store, where we purchased several different flavors of 'Zevia', including their cola.  Imagine our surprise when we read one of the ingredients listed as erythritol, a sugar alcohol!  And then we learned that it very well could be made from GMO (genetically modified) corn!  Our quest for a truly natural, non GMO, stevia only soda continues!	-1
I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.  But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.  Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.  If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.	-1
King Arthur's website gave the impression that this could be used instead of white flour and that's not the case. I make homemade unkneaded bread and never had a failure before. This flour was awful. I tried it twice and it was the same thing. I have almost two whole bags and will use it up by adding white flour to it.	-1
They have a very earthy, grainy taste which I typically like.  However, they also have a very subtle sweetness to them from the cane juice, perhaps?  Salty, not sweet is what I'm looking for in a chip.  For that reason I would probably not buy these again.  Aside from that, the chips I received were fresh, well within their expiration date, and mostly whole chips...not very many crumbs at all.  Portion seems small for the price, however.	-1
Not great not worth the money not very many	-1
I really wanted to like this drink.  But, unfortunately it tastes pretty bad.  I couldn't even give these away at the office.  People either recognized and their reaction was something like "Gross! No way!" or they didn't recognize and the response after tasting it was "Gross! No way!".	-1
I did not like the taste of this root beer soda.	-1
Organic is great and all ,but it was a lot sweeter than I expecting, and the consistency was strange.	-1
These taste really waxy.  So yes, they are natural and organic, but they don't taste good.	-1
I wanted these for a healthier snack but I don't like them at all. The flavor isn't too bad but the texture is terrible. I know they aren't claiming to be gummies but that was closer to my expectation for the texture. I was disappointed.	-1
NO TASTE AND SPENDY	-1
we did not like it at all, it was not fizzy and the taste was not to our liking	-1
Disgusting!	-1
I ordered this cause I'm on a Keto diet now and this was highly suggested.  This flavor is disgusting.  I don't know what it tastes like, but it's not anything good. I was told to try some other flavors before turning my back on this brand.  I'm going to try some others. But stay away from this one unless you're an avid flavored water drinker. I'm not, so maybe I need to get used to it?	-1
Worst taste ever. Horrible!	-1
Yuck. Tastes lame. In my humble.....	-1
Like the taste, low gal drink	-1
I couldn't stand the taste, taste like seltzer water.	-1
got tired of it fast.  not enough flavor	-1
I don't taste any flavor just carbonation. I was expecting a hint of flavor.	-1
Sparkling water with an off putting taste.	-1
It's too bitter.  I can't even add it to juice to blunt the taste.  Ugh.	-1
did not care much for it	-1
Does not taste good at all.	-1
Tastes like public bathroom deodorizer smells. No, thanks.	-1
too bitter for me.	-1
Probably the worst I've ever tasted! I threw 11full unopened cans away.	-1
Horrible. I could find no one who would drink it.	-1
I couldn't stand the taste, taste like seltzer water.	-1
I didn't care for the taste. Tasted like I was drinking Alka Seltzer.	-1
Yuck! Sorry, but I did not like it at all. Reminded me of club soda. Guess if you like mixed drinks using club soda, you might like this product. I never did like mixed drinks with club soda. Haven't got a clue why it got such good reviews from so many people. Bought it more for my brother and his latest girlfriend b/c they don't drink regular (or diet) sodas and I seldom have anything but water or coffee to offer them. She said she liked it (used to be a big drinker) and he claimed he did also, but never went back for more. It does smell really good. It's s shame it doesn't taste as good as it smells. Only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 b/c my company drank it.	-1
Maybe I was expecting to much out of these. I am currently not drinking soda as much as I used to. I figured this would be a good alternative to soda. I just couldn't get used to them.	-1
This seemed like a good value, but the taste is just funky. Nothing like berries at all.	-1
Tried this to find out if I would enjoy it. Not at all. The flavor was totally lost. The carbonation was too intense. Was painful to drink when warm. Not painful when cold, but tasted salty and very little fruitiness.	-1
It's just bland fizzy water, Although it doe not have much flavor the flavor it does have is not great at all. I have had many people try this to make sure it was not just me. Some are health nuts who would eat tree bark and smile, Nobody like it. I was hoping to find a drink like the old New York Seltzer back in the day. The hunt continues.	-1
WEIRD TASTE; I'LL SKIP THIS ONE	-1
We have had multiple shipments of the Apple flavor burst during shipment and ruin everything else inside the shipping box.  The pink lemonade did not do this.	-1
This is just water that may  have been in the presence of a grape at some time......	-1
IT WAS OKAY	-1
This granola was not my favorite.  It is a bit bland and sugary.  I usually eat it with almond milk but think this particular kind may actually be better with real milk.	-1
Too bland for me..And really tiny box lol.. for that kind of money, i'll stick to frosted mini wheats and honey bunches of oats instead lol	-1
Marvel Titan Hero Series	-1
It's indeed chewy and breaks apart easily, but it had some chemical or artificially flavor which made it taste horrible. Like most cookies it makes you thirsty. It's $2 cookies, can't expect too much from it	-1
Not my cup of tea. The Wife likes them but I prefer a non chewey cookie. The tast is kind of bland.	-1
Smashed, don't buy with anything heavy.	-1
Kinda stale though.	-1
Prefer original	-1
I don't know what chips ahoy is doing, but these don't taste like any kind of cookie, or chocolate chip cookie, they are gross, I really don't like them, taste like fake chemicals or something, just get Oreos.	-1
Tastes like a yoga mat with chocolate chips.	-1
Bland. . no real flavor.	-1
Seems like they've changed the formula and it tastes nothing like the chewy Chip Ahoy cookies that I enjoyed many years ago.	-1
Good price but  very little flavor, not worth eating.	-1
ok	-1
The Cookies Were Melted And All Stuck Together ..	-1
the chips were melted when delivered.	-1
I have had these before and I didn't like them in the past but I wanted to try them again because they were such a great deal through Amazon Prime Pantry. Unfortunately I just don't like them and can't.  This review is hard to write because there are some "good" things about these cookies. First of all they came packaged well. They arrived with no broken pieces and nothing looked melted when I opened it. So that part of the cookies were "good". I just don't like the taste of these for some reason. They don't taste like regular Chips Ahoy. I don't think it's a defective batch because like I said I've tried them before and I didn't like them then either.  So with all that being said I have to unfortunately give these cookies just a 2 star rating because I simply do not like the taste of them. Who knows though, maybe you might like them? As far as packaging and how they arrived though I'm happy about that, the taste of them makes me sad though. Might be Chips Ahoy brand but definitely does not taste like the regular ones.	-1
These tasted awful and were all stuck together. Will never order them again.	-1
Ordered these via Prime Pantry and I should have thought about waiting till the weather was much cooler where we live.  Unfortunately, when they arrived they looked like the had baked even more in the back of the delivery truck. Which honestly they prolly did. I know it can get in the 150 degree Fahrenheit in the back of those delivery trucks riding in the hot sun all day in NE Texas.  The cookies were melted and stuck together so it almost looked like a roll of dough in the packaging. I wasn't a fan of melted, crushed cookies BUT my hubs and children didn't mind... they just ate em with a spoon	-1
What happened to taste?  These were like cardboard.  I love regular crunchy chips ahoy but these taste horrible.  I would never purchase these again.  Sorry Nabisco.	-1
Too much sugar, it exhausts my body	-1
They tasted stale and just weren't good. We would not recommend this flavor. The original ones are so much better	-1
I thought these had a weird taste to them. my hubby and kids loved them.	-1
Not very tasty.	-1
The bag was already ripped open. My favorite cookies though. We had to throw them away.	-1
Hate the smell.	-1
I expected a different product.. its too hard to use.	-1
Fan of Palmolive but didn't realize this wasn't the "ultra".  Needs more product to bubble up.	-1
I love this brand, but this particular product didn't rinse off well. Probably due to my sub par dishwasher in my rented apartment, but if that's what you have, this product isn't for you.	-1
I use many Method products and for the most part have been really satisfied with their performance.  This dishwasher detergent was my first Method disappointment. Incompletely dissolved tablets, residue on dishes, and---the deal breaker for me---dirty dishes that weren't properly cleaned even on the "scrubbing" cycle.  To be fair, I am the kind of person that believes in letting the dishwasher do the work; I'm not pre-washing dishes before loading them. My chemical-laden cleanser tablets (Cascade, PowerBalls, etc.) have all been able to get things clean under these conditions. This environmentally-friendly version must be a little too mild for our household needs.	-1
smashed	-1
Sorry but the flavor Dose Not Last.	-1
Please don't use this for bed sore  recovery barrier. Use something like  Calmoseptine Ointment.  It is what our hospital uses as part of their wound care protocol. However, when my grandmother was transferred to a rehabilitation center.  We were told Desitin was the same thing.  Having been a new born and toddler nursery worker for many years. I was very familiar with Desitin for diaper rash and seen it work very well unless your baby has a cod liver sensitivity or allergy. I had never heard of Desitin being used for my grandfather when my rather was ill but we tried it at the center's insistence.  It did nothing for grandma and when she was released to being Home Health her bed sores were pretty bad.  While I decided to share information in this review regarding a off label use to try and help those in a similar situation.  This isn't why I  chose to only give it 2 *  As that doesn't seem right to me. Rather the low rating is based on our families experience with Desitin  as a  diaper rash treatment. It wasn't effective because of fish and shellfish allergies.  When it comes to very young babies a lot of things are hypo-allergenic and top 8 Allergens free. Those products seem a much safer product.	-1
TOTALLY SMASHED!!!!!	-1
damaged	-1
Arrived smashed and package broken, won't buy again!	-1
Never buy crackers online. Go to the store- unless you love broken crackers. Learn from my mistake.	-1
These cracker was cracked up. I feel they was pack wrong, because I have order cookies before. Other wise they is a good source of crackers.	-1
i don't remember these being so flavorless and flourful bah	-1
arrived broken	-1
Not like they use to be...  too hard.	-1
Mrs. Meyer's sold out to a big company.  This is not natural and has known carcinogens in it.  The product does smell good but if you want something natural that is not going to build up toxins in your body over time this is bad. Your skin absorbs some of the ingredients. There are other more natural preservatives like vitamin c or e that could be used instead of cheap chemicals that cause cancer in such combinations over time.	-1
Totally not what I expected. It doesn't even feel like my hands are being lathered with soap. It feels like a very thin consistency. Very disappointed in this product.	-1
my hair feels dryer after I condition than before. Not a fan of this at all.	-1
These are really expensive, and I didn't really like the taste.  It is a little time consuming but otherwise very easy to make simple baked kale chips with an oven and a cookie sheet.  Much less expensive and much more tasty.	-1
Pretty close to awful. Couldn't finish the box.	-1
Absolutely god awful tasting--had to spit it out immediately	-1
Taste like DRYWALL !!!!  AWFULL!!!!	-1
Dogs didn't care for it very much and we won't be purchasing again. We went back to using Purina One's Chicken and Rice. Purina One's Lamb and Rice is good too.	-1
Definitely on the lower end of the dog food quality spectrum. Just read the ingredients. I only bought it because it's what my pup was being fed before I got him so I bought a bag just so I can wean him off to a better quality food. Don't be cheap, spend a little more money to get a better quality food for your dog.	-1
Cats hated.  Dogs gave it a shot. Disliked it too except that they thought they were stealing from the cats so they were into it. Blue jays loved it best.  Will not buy again to feed wild birds. They prefer peanuts anyway.	-1
Two cats puke this formula up, I had to get the gentle formula. They do not go crazy over any Purina food. Sometimes it sits for a long time. Even the ferrel cats outside reject it.	-1
I have bought this same product at a pharmacy and loved it. This order must have been an old box or something, because there isn't even a trace of Vicks on these tissues.	-1
Nice .	-1
The scent of Vicks is the key phrase here. If you need Vicks you probably aren't going to be able to smell it from these tissues: Because you need actual Vicks. In much the same way that the smell of money is not nearly as useful as actually having money. Start by saving you rs and pass on this one.	-1
This has become more and more difficult to find in the stores - almost everything is mint flavored anymore, and we don't use mint products.  Our dentist and his dental hygienist strongly recommend this brand and I got a good explanation why during my last cleaning, so we checked Amazon for the unflavored variety.  According to our dentist's office, this actually traps more food than waxed floss because of being made from Gore-tex.  Initially, I was quite happy at a large quantity at a good price, and an easy source.  But something in the back of my mind triggered an internet search on Glide and Gore-tex.  Immediately I found the long list of articles claiming I was going to die from all kinds of different cancers, get brain damage, etc., because of the chemicals used to make Gore-tex and Glide floss.  Frankly, I'm more than a little sick of all the horror stories on the internet about almost any subject one can find.  Everything is going to make us die horrible deaths, if the internet is to be believed.  Yet it's important to know that in our family we now use as few chemicals as reasonably possible.  We don't use chemicals in our garden, and have the best crops of veggies ever this year.  And yes, we use Black Berkey water filters for our supposedly high quality tap water, drinking or cooking nothing out of the tap unless it's first gone through our Berkey filter. (Note: don't buy Berkey filters on Amazon - Berkey doesn't warrant them because of the practices of some of the after-market companies.)  We use various other products that area as natural as we can get, and eat a lot of organic foods, drink raw milk, etc.  Sound like some healthfood whackos? Maybe - yet remember, I was initially skeptical about the massive number of warning articles about the perfluoro- compounds in Glide floss.  Why?  I want reasonable proof of things.  And I kept looking, and looking, and can find almost nothing substantiating the safety of these compounds, or even that they supposedly no longer persist in the finished product - just that they're used in creating it (that was the argument with them in creating Teflon).  And I spent considerable time searching the P&G web site, searched all of their FAQs for this product, and even attempted to find a product safety data sheet on this product - they don't list one despite having such sheets for other products - they don't even have an "ingredients" sheet for Glide floss.  So my bottom line is that I'm out the money spent on this product because it's past the Amazon return period.  Fine - not Amazon's fault, they're just a retailer, or the vehicle retailers use.  But out of what now seems more like reasonable caution, rather than a "just in case" caution, I am discontinuing the use of this product, and going back to my previous unflavored, waxed regular dental floss.  Do your own research - your mileage may vary....	-1
Downy scent is way way way too strong. Had to move the clothes that were drying to a different room as they smelled too much. Not sure what to do.. I got 2 bottles	-1

love Tide-but this was supposed to be 2 count....only one came	-1
It breaks me out in a rash every time I have tried this stuff..	-1
Even using very little product, my clothes still come out covered in suds. I am currently searching for a different "free" detergent.	-1

Doesn't make clothes smell good. I ended up smelling like baby powder and old people. Sticking with the original	-1
Not worth the price	-1
I can't recommend this Tide. I really can't believe I am writing this. Tide is the only detergent I use, it's just this on in particular is not for me. Because of the touch of downy it smells awesome, but that's the only positive I found. In my HE machine it leaves a film in the bottom of the detergent distributor. I don't know if it's too thick, but it doesn't wash all the way into the machine. The clothes come out clean, and smelling good, but then i have to wash the top part of my machine to get rid of what didn't go into my machine. I don't notice this with any other detergent.	-1
I had to reduce my stars.. it won't desolve in my H E washer. And using less won't clean my clothes as well.  This was my first time using powder Tide and don't trust it, may ruin my washer. I LOVE Tide and I'm a loyal user but have to switch back to liquid Tide.	-1
Didn't dissolve fully in my front-loading washer.	-1
LOVE THIS	-1
I didn't realize these were diet, that's my fault. But you can't get past the taste of the artificial sweetener in them.	-1
I like this tea and it is my favorite but sadly this stuff was almost out of date. I think I will end up just buying it at the store where I can make sure its safe.	-1
Tastes gross. I love diet teas, but this one isn't doin it for me. Kirkland brand is 100x better than Lipton.	-1
honestly it tastes like a melted orange ice pop.  not tasty at all.	-1
I typically do not like diet drinks, that fake sweet taste that it has is awful. This one is even worse. If you don't drink your beverages within an hour of taking it out of the fridge, you probably won't like this. Because when it gets warm, it tastes even more awful. Even when cold it tastes a bit weird but it's not noticeable.	-1
This product overall is good, though I am starting to taste whatever makes it diet, and think I'll switch back to just brewing my own tea. If you get this, get the citrus flavor. The mixed berry is a bit much.	-1
better price at your local market.	-1
Not made with good ingredients	-1
Not my cup of tea.	-1
Taste kind of flat	-1
It seems Coca-Cola didn't learn their lesson with their New Coke formula change back in 1985, because they've made the same blunder with the new Coke Zero Sugar. Original Coke Zero had a flavor distinct from standard Diet Coke, and it definitely didn't need any alteration to the formula! Minor differences in the quantity or type of chemicals in diet sodas = major differences in taste! Hopefully there will continue to be consumer backlash about this, so Coca-Cola will bring back the real Coke Zero.  I would give it one star, but it's still better than Diet Pepsi so there's that!	-1
Purchased this VERY SAME item for $3.00 in April of this year (2016).  NO WAY it could now cost $14.+  I love the product; but would NEVER  pay this price.	-1
Somewhat the taste of the product was very different than the previous products I have bought in the stores. Had to donate it to the school that I work for. It would have been a hassle to pay shipping to return it.	-1
This drink was inadequately packaged & a few cans were punctured & leaked all over my order!  I expect & would anticipate, another, completely 'Intact' cartoon of Fanta would be sent to me , as partial Compensation to me -- at no further cost to me, whatsoever!	-1
I love the size of this 8-pack of Pepsi but it's unavailable on Amazon now and I'm getting really annoyed that Amazon Pantry offers items and then stops offering them.	-1
If these were 12 ounce bottles then i am confused. they were the little 1/2 pint bottles	-1
might be better in a slushy drink but in jut normal cold water not my favorite	-1
rename= pink SWEET liquid	-1
Not crazy about the taste.	-1
Don't like the way it squirts out.	-1
This tasted awful! Like sun tan lotion. Not good!	-1
Although this new beverage may taste great, Pepsi has yet to be held accountable for the deforestation taking place at their hands. Once the rainforests are destroyed, we can't magically bring them back. But, Pepsi can find a way to acquire sustainable Palm Oil not linked to deforestation. Animals such as the sumerian tiger, orangutans, and countless other species are being pushed to the brink of extinction by giants like Pepsi Co. Let's make sure that they know that enough is enough. It's time for Pepsi to truly lead the way and commit to only buying palm oil from 100% sustainable sources -- now.	-1
Not enough flavor	-1
Something is definitely up with these, as soon as I opened one to try i could sense the taste of alcohol or something. I poured the rest of contents into a clear cup to see if anything was visibly wrong but there wasn't it just tastes like some kind of alcohol coffee concoction to cut production costs. I still highly do not recommend these I don't even trust the rest of the cans. ill be throwing them out soon enough. Very disappointed.	-1
rubber taste and smell	-1
this product is just as bad as the company whom makes it. way to not care about your fanbase	-1
Having been an iced coffee drinker for more years than I'd like to admit as it will surely age me, I am always on the search for the perfect iced coffee when I cannot prepare it on my own.  This Starbucks double shot espresso is a bit of a disappointment. It's overly sugared and has an artificial taste.  It almost taste like the coffee version of YooHoo. Granted, it's better than  many iced coffee is I've purchased in caf&eacute;s ,  but it still misses the mark.  If you want to terrific iced coffee and you can't make it on your own try Ily Issimo. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002IEZJMA/ref=sr_ph_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1471454167&sr=sr-1&keywords=illy+issimo+coffee+drink	-1
I buy this tea quite regularly at the grocery store & always enjoy it. This order however left me dumbfounded. I found this tea quite awful. I don't know  if it was past its prime but it did taste watered down and flavorless. It seemed like a very good buy in my Pantry Basket but I will not buy it here again. Something is definitely "off". Yuk.	-1
Too sweet	-1
Not as good as MIO	-1
horrifying taste, overwhelming sweetness.  not enough to be just sugary sweetness, sometimes it tastes like watered down semi-fermented syrup (like the kind you put on pancakes), sometimes it tastes like a tree.  the aftertaste is overwhelming and lasts basically all day unless you drink something else.	-1
I can broken when it comes, and whole box of other stuffs are full of COLA!	-1
ew	-1
Just my personal taste, BUT..YUK......although I rarely buy anything of this sort, I decided to try it as I don't care for water by itself except Italian mineral water so I figured I'd add it to our plain spring water.  Anyway, I found the taste to be not only fake but tasting like a dose of aspartame or other "sugar free" additives; nasty aftertaste for me.  In any case, it's awful and I can't believe it's a Coca Cola product.  Can't see worth the cost in dollars or taste.	-1
Empthy calories	-1
Man these really taste weird as an adult. As a kid I loved them but after not drinking coke for a few years and then taking a sip you start to realize that it's just this highly refined sugar drink that just tastes artificial and plasticy. What a bizarre beverage, I'll bet archeologists studying us in a thousand years will find it highly amusing we used to refine corn syrup into such a strange artificial "treat".	-1
I really wasn't a fan of this product.  I wasn't sure if it was my water that tasted funny or the actual drops, so I used it with tap water and bottled water, but the funny taste was there with both, so I narrowed it down to the drops.  I did add the drops to carbonated water and I actually liked the way that tasted better, but the drops didn't last very long.  Will try a different flavor in the future.	-1
Many of the Classic Coco Cola cans contained Coke Zero! And I hate that zero crap! Too sweet and an off taste!	-1
Fake tasting.	-1
This tea would have been great if it had half the sugar in it. Tasted like good old homemade tea just way too much sugar. Try it you will like it if you like really really sweet tea.	-1
pure sugar taste drowns out the tea	-1
I had to call the corporate office and tell them that since I've been getting this tea through primepantry that apparently in the processing there is not enough tea syrup being added.  It is about 50% of the time pale green water.  I've been drinking this tea for years so I know when something is wrong.  It is very sensitive to light and heat but then it gets too sweet, not pale and tasteless.  I HOPE they are able to audit the processing at the plant and find out what the problem is.  On the bottle it says Purchase, NY but that is the main office.  Not sure if it is bottled there.  When it is as it should be I love this tea.  It is not too sweet and not carbonated; just right.  Quenches my thirst perfectly.	-1
This would probably be okay for some (my son likes it) but it doesn't float my boat.  It has a strange aftertaste that I can't abide.  I am used to artificial sweeteners so am used to some lingering taste, but this is really unpleasant.  I threw it away as I just couldn't drink it.	-1
Water and High Fructose corn syrup are the TWO MAIN ingredients in this. I thought Powerade was the good one and accidentally ordered a bunch.  There are essentially ONLY two ingredients in this drink. All the others are .5%.  Read labels. I threw out a bunch of this. I don't want the children drinking this junk.	-1
We didn't like the flavor of this at all. It was a good price, but I will not buy it again. I feel like I cheated on Gatorade. I won't make that mistake again.	-1
Taste like Medicine.	-1
ok	-1
Not a fan of this particular flavor. Willing to try the others. But it has a strange aftertaste that I don't find enjoyable.	-1
Looked at one of these in a gas station and had no idea what mix it was till I found out that in EU, BVO is banned from use as a food additive. BVO displaces iodine in body, which human body thyroid depends upon to function properly. Decreased thyroid efficiency can lead to hypothyroidism-like symptoms--fatigue, joint/muscle pain, depression, constipation, etc.  Ingredients: Water, high fructose corn syrup, less than 0.5% of: citric acid, natural flavors, salt and magnesium chloride and calcium chloride and mono-potassium phosphate (electrolyte sources), modified food starch, glycerol ester of rosin, calcium disodium EDTA (to protect color), medium chain triglycerides, brominated vegetable oil, vitamin B3 (niacinamide), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), vitamin B12, red 40, ascorbic acid (to protect taste).  But except BVO, this beauty contains HFC, a glucose in form of fructose which turns into fat unlike cane sugar.	-1
I don't have a Starbucks around me I have to drive 45 mins to go to one so I seen this and wanted to try because in the summer I hate drinking hot coffee but this its good but u get a metal taste in ur mouth.	-1
didn't like taste.	-1
The taste was Way to strong for me and some of the cans were damage when I opened my package	-1
Not strong enough.	-1
I had high hopes for these (easy to toss in diaper bag/ gym bag/ going-to-the park bag) but they were gross. Tasted sort of like bitter 3 day old coffee that had been swirled in an ashtray. And strangely, vaguely fishy. And I got a nasty headache after drinking them (well, 3 of them... I threw the fourth one away).	-1
Not what I expected!	-1
Gross	-1
MAKE SURE YOU keep it warm and pour it over ice.  Otherwise it just comes out badly.	-1
didnt like the taste, i prefer the frappy drinks.	-1
Both of my 12 packs were open and one had 2 busted cans. Totally disappointed.	-1
Cans swollen and fell out of box!	-1
I wanted caffine free cook but it turns out to be caffinated.	-1
This is not black tea according to PureLeaf.com.  It is a blend of teas.  They do sell black tea in packing like this, but this is not it.  Black tea has a medicinal effect unlike blended teas.	-1
Gross!!! This is not what sweet tea is supposed to taste like. Horrible!!!	-1
WAY too sweet for me!  If you can ignore the overly-sweet taste, the tea is fine, but unless you like it REALLY sweet, I would hold out for the regular unsweetened kind, which was not available when I made the purchase.  The Raspberry flavored tea is also very sweet, but if you like Big Red or one of the other red sodas, you may like it.	-1
I don't know what it is about Lipton tea but it always, no matter what, has this bitter tainted taste to it and this is no different. Yes, it is sweet but it has that bitter taste that I just don't like. I know a lot of people want to say that all tea is bitter and blah blah blah. But I got news for you, when you get good tea, it isn't bitter and doesn't have a weird tainted taste like this. It's smooth and actually really great. Unlike this tea. I won't be buying this kind again.	-1
Does not taste good - cancelled my subscription order.	-1
I don't like the taste of this at all. I got it to help fill up a prime pantry box. I don't like sugar or any flavorings in my iced tea, so I thought I might like this, but it doesn't taste anything like tea you would brew at home. I wonder where the weird taste comes from, if they don't add anything to it.	-1
Swollen glands in my armpit made me have to go to the doctor	-1
wet, gooey, smelly....not acceptable	-1
idk this is the first gel based deodorant i have tried and it lasts far less than the bar kind also the smell gives me a headache and ur armpits feel wet for a while after applying... not a fan even tho it dose work but i won't be buying it again unfortunately back to degree for me	-1
For a hydrating/moisture shampoo, this is one of the most drying drugstore shampoos Ive used. I got it for my husband and he complains his hair is actually frizzy... I tried it and after rinsing my hair felt like straw. Terrible product.	-1
husband says he smells like a flower	-1
Not bad, but it doesn't condition my hair well. I don't like this product and now I am just using it instead of a shaving gel! Just not to waste it.	-1
For a product that claims to improve moisture by 100%, my hair has never been so dry!	-1
Didn't see that it was coconut scented. Not for me.	-1
Eh. We found this formula to be drying and heavy on the hair.	-1
Update: I use to really love this  Hello Hydration by Herbal Essence but over the past several months I noticed a change in the color and smell of the product. Both the shampoo and the conditioner. It was also leaving my hair dull and my curly hair was less curly as if I straightened it. I am not sure what changes were made to the product but  I have given up using this product completely now. I didn't notice anymore breaking or dryness from it. My hair color was changing to "light brown" I tried a couple other herbal essences before changing over to TRESemme brand. I wouldn't recommend this product anymore. [ Orginal Five Star Review] I have waist length red curly hair, that tends to be very dry. I have tried many hair products over the years. From Wen to most recently Tresemme curl hydration. What I always seem to run into is, products that are difficult to wash out. I tried Herbal Essence Hello Hydrantion. I was skeptical about seeing improvements after one shampoo. It sounded too good to be true. Boy was I ever surprised, when it turned out to be true!  Best of all it washes out easier then any product  I have ever used. I was very, very impressed by this. Paired with the hello hydration conditioner and suave detangler while blow drying my hair has been softer then it has ever been. It also  has made it more red and less dull , while really bringing out my curls too.  I will be ordering more& would highly recommend it.	-1
I have had all of the Downy Infusion varieties to come out of the bottle like a white mud. It is gloppy and a mess to work with and will definitely stain your clothes if it lands on a piece of cloth without the agitation of the washer working immediately. At first, I thought the product had "gone bad" because I thought that there was no way any company would make such a disgusting mess. I was wrong. ALL of the "Downy Infusion" products are like this one.	-1
makes my skin itch. i'm now using it too wash my toilet bowl. oh, and the smell? yuck. amazon says i need two more words. this ought to do it.	-1
I have been using these strips, and to be frank, I have not noticed that "dazzling" effect that you are led to believe that you get. My teeth are a bit whiter, but that could be mind over matter. For the price, it's really not worth it. I'll also add that my bottom teeth in front have become super sensitive to hot and cold now and that was not the case before I started to use the strips. There is obviously a cost to tooth enamel density when you use these strips. For that reason alone, I would not recommend this product to anyone. The costs outweigh any benefits that you see.	-1
not feel good with it.	-1
While they appear to have whitened my teeth, they also made my teeth and gums ultra sensitive. I thought using a sensitivity toothpaste would help but to no avail. My teeth were sensitive for a week after using three strips. I have used other strips before and not had this problem.	-1
Smell is amazing and the size is a great value, that's about all I can say nice about this. I have relatively long/thick hair and have never had an issue with knots in my hair until I started using this. I can't even comb out my hair in the shower without having to wrestle with half a dozen tangled chunks of hair. My hair also seems to be frizzier than usual and gets greasier faster (I'll wake up and it's like I went 3 days without a shower instead of having just showered yesterday). Just very unimpressed with this product overall.	-1
Dried out hair immediately!	-1
As with all other conditioners I expect my hair to feel soft and supple. I have thin hair and soft is a must...  I love to try new brands based off others reviews or simply the smell of it when buying from Target etc.  Not happy with this conditioner.  After rinsing this conditioner out, I immediately noticed my hair had a "straw" feel to it. After towel drying it was frizzy at the ends.  My 9 year old Daughter used it tonight and after she towel dried her hair, it too was frizzy looking all over.  We both have to add a leave in conditioner after using this.  I also buy hair products for the smell. This is just okay. Smell doesn't last as long as other brands I've used.  Disappointed I have a brand new large size bottle to get through before we can try another brand.	-1
Yup my hair is soft, smells terrible though.	-1
Update: In The middle of July I noticed a difference in the feel and smell of this conditioner. It felt really greasy and had a off putting odor that I find hard to describe. I didn't like the way my hair began to look either. It was becoming straight and limp and light brown. I shopped around for a replacement before deciding that TRESemme was right for my hair. I am sorry that they changed this product. I no longer use this product so I can't recommend it now.  [Original 5 Star Review] I purchase both Hello hydration shampoo and conditioner. After trying all kinds of products over the years for my waist length red dry hair. Both store  brands and salon brands too. I didn't expect Hello Hydration to do much for my hair. I however was stunned to find that my hair is now at the best it has ever been, having been using both the shampoo and conditioner. If I must use a detangler I use suave when I blow dry my hair. The best part is the rinsing out takes no time at all. I am very please with this product & would highly recommend it.	-1
BEWARE! Febreze is TOXIC to lungs! Febreze gave me a lung/upper respiratory infection and a bad cough for 2 weeks, and I'm still not well. I've been coughing constantly and hacking up green phlegm every few minutes. One of the sickest periods I've been in, in my life. I have no other symptoms of cold or flu, just a bad cough and green mucus, and it won't go away after 2 weeks. It happened immediately (within 24 hours) of spraying Febreze in my bedroom and house. It started with a bad multi-hour migraine (one of the worst ever), and then weeks of coughing. I'm a normally very healthy and strong young adult.  Hard to say if it worked as far as odors. I'm too I'll to smell now!	-1
It has been awhile since I tried Febreze. Forgot how much I hate it.	-1
Yuck.	-1
The flavor is eh, so so.  There is a layer of something that balls up in my mouth and I have to swallow it whole or spit it out.  It doesnt break down with saliva like the rest of the bar.  I cannot say it gave me energy, I ended up falling asleep after I ate it.  Not what I was expecting	-1
NOT GLUTEN FREE like the ad said.	-1
ugh, only 60% peanuts so they can't call it 'peanut butter' and this page is badly titled.  peanut flavor is dominated by sweet stuff.  best is laura scudder reduced fat.	-1
This product has a very odd texture which makes it clear it is not a jam. I like that it is reduced sugar, but I am not sure what else is in there. Not a fan. Doesn't taste great, and the squeezable dispenser does not work the way I had hoped at all. Won't be buying this again.	-1
I was drawn to the product because of less sugar, but he taste is not good.  It's like using sweet n low instead of sugar- yuck.  Thumbs down from me and the 3 year old.	-1
Definitely notice reduced sugar, nice convent package but taste missing sweetness accustom to.	-1
If you don't mind mono sodium glutenate in your products, you may like this. I mind.	-1
Not so good , kind of blah ,I was very disappointed in it.	-1
Taste good but very hard to get out.	-1
Turns out we like our caffeine more than we thought.	-1
The squeezable jelly is a not effective.  Ultimately you open up the lid and scoop out the jelly with a knife,	-1
I had not tried this Smucker' s Squeeze strawberry fruit before. I am really disappointed in it. As it is really watery no matter how much you shake it up, or store it cap up or down.  Draining the water off makes this squeeze bottle idea not as convenient or as useful as you might think it to be.  In my experience the jars are better. The plastic of these bottles maybe good for shipping but, a lot more work in the long run. Has it being a wasteful purchase. So for those reasons I won't buy again or recommend this product.	-1
tastes old	-1
Cookies so broken up that you can't even get half a package of whole ones.	-1
Terrible tasting cookie. Nothing like I remembered as a kid. Actual cookie tasted and seemed more like a flavorless soda cracker than what I remembered. Do not recommend, save your money.	-1
Too much cookie and not enough filling.	-1
To hard to get out..	-1
I bought a better one on the supermarket	-1
the jelly is very runny and way to thin so it will come out as you squeeze the bottle. I don't like it at all.	-1
These cookies have no taste	-1
Need larger size.	-1
The kids didn't like it the way they loved nutella	-1
jelly is good. Packaging is terrible. It's so hard to squeeze out. This is regular congealed jelly trying to be forced out a little whole. It sucks so bad. Whoever thought of this should be fired. Nice Idea, poorly executed. Stick to the jar variety.	-1
They were grainy.	-1
bad taste	-1
this makes dishes a little but doesn't have much flavor	-1
I purchased this Smucker' s Squeeze Grape Jelly in the same order as the Smucker' s Strawberry Squeeze Spread.  This was just as disappointing. The problem I experienced with the grape having not used this product before. I couldn't get any jelly to come out by squeezing the bottle. To use this product I had to remove the cap and scoop it out with a ice tea spoon. Won't buy this product again. Therefore I couldn't recommend it.	-1
Tastes and feels like bacon.. but very salty. Wont be buying this again	-1
These "Real" Bacon bits were so awful I doubt there "real" status. I checked the date they were suppose to be good until 1/15. They didn't have any bacon smell. Just this smokey smell. To be totally serious I fed my dogs bacon treats that smelled better then these did. Yet I tried a couple thinking they had to taste better then they smelled with all the good reviews. Yuck they were disgusting tasting! I can't begin to describe it however I will politely say it was shudder inspiring. Won't ever buy again!	-1
unhappy with the quality... just tastes.... cheap	-1
Was stale	-1
do not like it	-1
Have been buying Maxwell House Coffee for decades. Have an excellent commercial Bunn Coffee Maker. Up until the last two times have gotten Maxwell House in orders it was ok. Then discovered the Maxwell House Coffee coming was ground so fine it was causing the Brew of the Coffee to not stream correct. Very disappointed in this last shipment. I will most likely be looking for another supplier to purchase my Maxwell House Coffee from.	-1
Gross. Had a few cups, gave the rest away.	-1
Gave my son and I both an awful set of burps, and then I started reading online how canola and vegetable oils are not processed by the body.  I believe that's true in our case.  Threw them out and went to coconut, palm oil and ghee instead.	-1
Taste like hot water!	-1
The Marshmallows arrived  welded together likely due to the heat in Az. I tossed them out and will order when the weather is cooler.	-1
they were melted by the heat	-1
Small	-1
Did not taste anything like Blue Cheese to us.  It is creamy, however, and has a nice smooth texture.	-1
We did not like the country roast or it was old coffee. It had a weird taste	-1
probably the worst of the folgers line, and i do like folgers.  what?  shredded paper and tree cellulose as filler?  i had to throw it out.  word.	-1
Not as good as it used to be, this seemed almost flavorless with none of those neat little roka chunks. They must have changed the formula.  It just takes like mayo with a little something salty in it.  Bob's Big Boy sells the best blue cheese at Costco.  Maybe I'll try Wishbone next.	-1
My reason for the 3 star review is the shrinking size and the increase in price both at the same time.  Why do they keep shrinking the amount?  I could line up the different sizes of Folgers containers as they keep getting smaller.  I prefer to buy a product that is a standard weight such as 1 lb of coffee not 31.1 Oz.  Do the companies think we do not notice?  I think I like some of the smaller companies coffees better the big names now anyway.	-1
I live for my coffee and try to always try anything new but I found this coffee to be really weak and bitter.	-1
My grandmother wanted to  try this coffee. I told her some reviews say it tastes like cigarettes. Neither of us understood that  comparison with coffee.  When it arrived she tried it. She thought that it tastes good. She was able to taste a chicory taste. That did not bother her. What she didn't care for was she said it was like drinking decaf coffee to her, a okay flavor but, it  provided no pep as she calls it.  She had to use a lot more coffee to get the taste and pep she was looking for. Not a coffee she would want a Second time.	-1
Bugs in the box	-1
I don't care for the flavor of this cake. It has an anise or licorice like flavor. I won't buy it again.	-1
Not that great. Mix up a cake from scratch, it's not that hard and this stuff isn't worth the small amount of time it saves you. What was I thinking when I bought this?	-1
Too salty	-1
Sour...tastes bad	-1
Don't buy this right now, you'll be getting a jar with a yellow and red label saying "New Recipe" and "Our Richest Thickest Recipe Ever". It is not good compared to the original "Old World Style" flavored with Meat. It has some odd aftertaste that may be more oregano or some sort of chemical and is not as dense a consistency. I've contacted Amazon and they're going to look into why the label doesn't match the graphic here.  I hope Ragu hasn't decided to keep this "new recipe" they're selling now.	-1
Do not like the taste	-1
I decided to try this cereal for a little variety, familiar with Kashi and a consumer of their Kashi Go Lean protein powder. The protein powders are fine, and I do well with them, but this cereal makes my gut wrench painfully, immediately after eating it, and causes severe gas and other unpleasantries for a minimum of 24h every time I eat it. Ive experienced this from one other of their dry cereals previously, their Heart to Heart product, but this is worse. No, its not because theres soy in it- soy and I are friends.  The texture is rather sawdusty, but tolerable. A bit too sweet for me, but the clincher is the terrible digestive issues it causes. I don't think I will be getting this product often, if ever again. I give 2 stars however for the nutritional pow it carries (if your body is OK with it)- fiber, protein, and more.	-1
I thought ordering some of my groceries through Amazon Pantry was going to be a great idea....boy was I wrong.  Out of the 39 canned good items I ordered 24 of those cans are dented; some pretty badly.  I will be ordering any more canned good items from Amazon.  :(. The Rice Krispies were crushed! :(	-1
Kellogg agreed to remove "all natural" labeling from its line of Kashi and Bear Naked products, which the lawsuit claimed contain several artificial ingredients. In addition, they're setting aside $5 million in a fund to dole out 50-cent refunds to Kashi customers and $325,000 for Bear Naked customers. They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research, apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some $790,700 dollars to defeat prop 37, GM labelling in CA. The question is why wouldn't they want me to know the exact ingredients, after all I am paying for the product.  The best cereal is muesli and I get that for my friend in organic form. It is the best cereal I could find for her and good enough to be part of a healthy diet. She mixes Muesli with organic soy milk few hours in advance and consumes it in the morning. Muesli is a healthy fiber with minerals, vitamins, nine different grains and nuts popular with Swiss culture. Soaking is a necessity since it is raw. Soaking in yogurt is another option as well. I even tried it once and it is absolutely delicious. No wonder she keeps having it muesli for breakfast.	-1
I don't know what it is with some of the stuff I order from prime pantry but this was stale	-1
I must be the odd one out here. Now, I don't know if this is a bad batch, if Amazon is the new Family Dollar, or if this is just the "new" recipe for Frosted Flakes. I grew up on Frosted Flakes. As a pre-teen, I ate them every day. As a teen I ate them quite often. I ate them with milk, I ate them straight from the box, I ate them with melted marshmallows like a Krispie treat. As an adult, I've had them occasionally. I hadn't had them in a couple of years, so I got some... from Amazon... mailed to me in my Prime Pantry box.  These are not the Frosted Flakes I grew up on. They are not the ones I ate every day as a pre-teen, nor quite often as a teen. Neither are they the ones I used to make "Rice Krispie" bars a few years ago. These are corn flakes with barely any frosting on them at all. There are two things that make Frosted Flakes better than regular corn flakes... 1) The sugary frosting that makes them sweet without having to add extra sugar and.. 2) the sugary frosting that makes them sweet without having to add extra sugar ALSO makes them more crunchy and makes them last longer in milk before they go soggy.  The old flakes... http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/6261616/600full-frosted-flakes.jpg The new flakes... http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3471/5802226853_ceabdfc49f.jpg  This box was a grave disappointment. So whether or not they were lacking "frosting" on purpose or by accident. These were just lackluster regular 'ol soggy sugarless flakes. Too bad.	-1
cereal was stale, feed it to the birds, they seemed to like it?	-1
Leaves a sticky residue and doesn't not stop the sweat for me.	-1
This deoderant is not very effective and you might as well not even wear any. For an antiperspirant or deodorant to work it really needs to be scented. The powder fresh version of this works a lot better.	-1
Taste is yuk and mouth and breath don't feel or taste fresh.	-1
Don't usually not like a product especially toothpaste - and I know I should scan the ingredients before buying - and would have realized this has SLS in it.  But the low rating is because my gums and my husbands gums actually started to hurt after using this.  This is one of those products that I won't buy again and turns me off to Tom's of Maine products in general.	-1
I have been using Tom's Of Maine products, on and off, throughout the years.  I used to use this toothpaste years ago, and recently bought some to try again, being that I am once again trying to live healthier.  I was very dismayed to find out that they had been 'bought out' by Colgate, and that they are using SLS in their ingredients!  I am now going to throw this out and find an all-natural toothpaste.	-1
I found  that it did not go on smoothly and could not detect any scent.	-1
I just picked this up two days ago at a local store, and didn't check the ingredients before I threw it in my cart.  I've always counted on Tom's of Maine products to be natural, so I was very surprised when I got home and realized that this does contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which can be very irritating on the skin.  Natural products also don't usually provide much foam or lathering, but they are still effective.  This product still doesn't lather, but the SLS is reason enough for me to toss it out.  It's very disappointing to see that Tom's has changed their formulation after being bought by Colgate!	-1
Okay I've looked at before I love Tom's products, however, was not impressed with this deodorant. At least for me... It didn't seem to last as long and I was always concerned about the coverage during a long day of work. I may try other types of the natural deodorant stick but this one's not my favorite.	-1
Someone gave me this. It has a nice scent. However, the scent does not last. Also, it made me perspire more using it.  I will stay with my favirite.	-1
I'm sorry Tom but after using your deoderant off and on the last 10 years I have to say goodbye.  I literately threw the last two sticks right in the trash.  The smell has changed and not for the better.  I purchased the unscented and was surprised by a horrible stink.  My coworkers were not impressed.  I called their help line thinking there must have been a bad batch or something.  They quickly mailed me out a replacement.  I opened it up and it had the same bad smell.  Won't be wasting anymore time with Toms.	-1
Smells a lot stronger than I expected. I'm not crazy about it. Plus, it made my armpits feel kind of sticky. I think I'll stick with my Dove deodorant from now on.	-1
Not so long lasting.	-1
I bought this thinking it was womens. No where did it say mens!	-1
Non of the TOMS products with aluminum work! I've tried all of them...the product might work 20% of the way and the rest of the percentage is you smelling and being comfortable. Not satisfied.	-1
not good for me, I sweat too much, if you aren't too active you will probably like but if you sweat alot from hard work it probably won't work for you. On upside it smells nice.	-1
This stuff is like water with peppermint flavor, not very stong	-1
the taste is terrible	-1
Unhappy with questionable ingredients now that Tom's sold to P&G. It's not what it was early on; won't buy again.	-1
No flouride, am not using	-1
Paste is not gritty enough so my teeth feel "fuzzy" when I brush with it. The non fluoride Spearmint version of this brand is the only one that works on me.	-1
I bought this Tom's flouride free toothpaste (peppermint, 2 pack) via Subscribe and Save and wish I'd read some reviews first...  I'm rating it 2 stars because it tastes good in my opinion and is flouride free, as I'd wanted. Unfortunately, it contains SLS and Carageenan. Next time I won't order in a hurry.  Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. There are 2 coupons inside each box but I don't think I'll be using them... Tom's isn't what it used to be.  Hope this is helpful!	-1
My teeth have been more sensitive since using Tom's and my dentist noticed I had switched toothpastes.	-1
I don't feel like this cleans at all. I find myself brushing three times before I feel good.	-1
As many have noted here, it seems Tom's of Maine is just another large corporation brand that tries to attract those wanting a more healthy alternative but in the end gives them a boat load of chemicals thinly disguised with crisp marketing that immediately instills cleanliness and a healthy lifestyle. It is a deception in my opinion.  While this does not have Fluoride, it does have other toxic ingredients such as SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate). It is a foaming agent but many are allergic to it. My young daughter had to go to hospital for treatment when she used shampoos and soaps with SLS few years ago. Now, I try my best to eliminate SLS but somehow Tom's of Maine managed to be present in our home (my fault for not reading the small fonts) largely due to the success of their deceptive packaging that eludes healthiness, while clearly not so.	-1
I like regular Tom's toothpaste, but have a problem with mint burning my tongue so I thought I would try this even though I am long past being in the target age bracket.  This definitely didn't burn my tongue.  The strawberry flavor isn't very strong, easily tolerable. Unfortunately, I find this product is too thin so it easily splatters everywhere when using an electric toothbrush.  Even worse though is the fine grit it leaves in your mouth. I used it for 10 days hoping I would get used to it, but I now give up.  I am going back to my old toothpaste and deal with the burn until I find something else.	-1
Well, crud.  I was using this for my daughter (I use awful and bad-for-you toothpaste but I don't want my daughter to) as a flouride-free option since she is still swallowing toothpaste and not rinsing well enough. She hates this toothpaste so I was thinking of switching brands anyway. But now I find out that Tom's is using harmful chemicals in the toothpaste! I was sort of just trusting it since Tom's is a well known brand and one of my "crunchy" mama friends recommended it to me.  I'm glad to be switching now but I'm not sure what I am going to switch to. It seems almost everything has a harmful chemical in it! If anyone can suggest something better please leave a comment.	-1
Toms sold out to a large corp formula now contains toxic ingredients.  Label still says natural but it is not. It has sodium laurel sulfate a foaming agent that can build up in your body.  No wonder there is so much cancer in this country.  Avoid this if you are looking for a natural product.  I was dismayed when I got this home and it foamed in my mouth. I read ingredients and learned it is full of you know what.	-1
My granddaughter does not like this toothpaste and only used it once.	-1
My granddaughter does not like the flavor and will not use it.	-1

I consume organic teas. Both green and black teas contain fluoride, although green tea contains twice the amount found in black. About 50 percent of fluoride (from any source) is deposited in the bone and teeth; the other half is excreted. Regardless, I get enough fluoride from my city drinking water and do not need additional fluoride or additives like Sorbital and Saccharin sweetners, SLS poison which breaks down tissue and causes cankers, Propylene Glycol an alcohol, etc...  The main ingredients in conventional toothpaste are sodium fluoride to prevent cavities and abrasives like hydrated silica for cleaning and polishing the teeth. In animal studies, sodium fluoride has been associated with both cancer and neurotoxicity. Like mouthwashes, toothpastes are generally sweetened with artificial sugars such as saccharin and sucralose, and coloured with dyes such as Blue #1 and Yellow #5. To create foam, manufacturers add sodium laurel sulfate, which may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a probable carcinogen. Propylene glycol, which can cause contact dermatitis at very low concentrations, is also a common ingredient in toothpaste. Triclosan may be added for its antibacterial properties. Triclosan is a possible endocrine disrupting chemical and has been shown in animal studies to harm the thyroid.

This product description "Natural" made it sound as if this might be eco-friendly and safe for human use.  Not the case at all.  "Natural" doesn't mean diddly-squat.  Will never buy this product again. High in the ingredient Sodium Lauryl Sulphate-Danger!  Very heavy scent is unpleasant, overpowering.  Hate it.	-1
Good for oven cooking.	-1
I feel like over the past several years they've cheapened Reynolds Wrap Foil. Years ago it seemed thicker and sturdier and now I find it tearing easily when I use it.	-1
with Easy Rip Tabs! stick to the original.	-1
too thin...	-1
When opening these bags, we often have them tear above or below the seam, so the bag can't be resealed. It seems to be an issue due to the taller tab providing too much pull in the wrong spot, because we don't have the issue with the same bags that didn't have the easy open top.	-1
I don't normally buy Ziploc, but for some reason I did, and I don't know why... these bags constant split down the sides when I am opening them to use for the first time.  I'm going back to Target brand.	-1
easy open tabs are easy tear off as well. Stick with the originals.	-1
I always buy ziplock bags and have no issues but the ones I got here did not zip properly at all. Hopefully I just got a bad batch.	-1
I don't know when they changed the design, but these bags leak and are hard to seal.  It takes a while to get the two sides fully connected for a proper seal.  I'll be looking at other brands for gallon bags in the future.	-1

Zip top rips easily.	-1
Not a fan of of ziplock.	-1
These Ziploc Freezer bags were okay for me to use,  Grandma however had a very hard time of telling when they were closed or not. That was very annoying for her so we won't be purchasing the bags you pinch closed from now on. As they are not useful for her visual impairment.	-1
These are way too soft and leave lint. They make great napkins or something to use as a facial tissue, but not for cleanups if you have appliances with glass or shiny surfaces.	-1
OK product, leaves behind to much lint and tears easily.  Not as durable as Bounty	-1
WE love love love the Viva paper towel on the rolls.  However, the Viva Pop-ups Paper Towel Dispenser is. frrankly. awful.  The paper towel is basically insignificant, almost not there.  It's okay as a true FINGERTIP towel, because that's pretty much all three sheets can manage.  Since the towel is soft and clingy, it doesn't come out as easily as I would have hoped, so one has to pull at it, to get it out, at least when the box is full.  One of my kids compared to it to our one ply toilet paper, if that's any help.  I'm very disappointed in these cut sheets.  I would never recommend them to anyone for anything, and would never buy them again.  There's not really even good enough for wiping up tiny spills.  Stay away.  What a waste of money.  UPDATED REPORT....  There is one benefit to the these boxed towels.  The work well for little kids.  The size is good for little hands.  Still not worth the money.	-1
These should be listed as garage clean up rags. The rolls are so small and there is no softness. Most paper towels aren't just for cleaning surfaces but washing hands & wiping children's faces - Not These!	-1
I switched from Bounty to Viva because my partner loved them. However, when we got them he agreed that they were awful. They do NOT absorb liquids! So weird even when you use one then use another and another and another it leaves liquid on the floor. I ended up having to get a microfiber cloth to clean up the mess after using several Viva paper towels. Bummer because I got them to make him happy. Maybe we got a bad batch, but I'm not interested in trying again.	-1
Extremely small rolls compared to the ones I was receiving in my orders previously. This was considered comparable?  Much smaller rolls and more exoensive. Not happy with amazons idea of a replacement.	-1
dosnt feel good to the touch! dosnt dry at all.	-1
Towels stick together.  Soft for blowing nose, but not pactical for kithchen stuff.	-1
When my 7 year old was in diapers Huggies used to be the best diapers.  Now with my 21 month old Huggies brand just keeps getting worse and worse.  They don't hold the moisture in at all anymore.  2 hours and he needs a fresh diaper.  i would expect more from the expensive diapers.  Thinking about switching to a different brand	-1
I purchased these because I was having one of those couple of weeks.  My son was sick, couldn't make it into Costco (where I normally buy paper towels).  Then the AC died, and we had repair dudes in, who were awesome, but in the stress of making sure our son didn't make it out the front door I forgot to put paper towels on the list.  Twice.  And I didn't want to keep sending my husband back out, so I ordered these.  And I've got to say, I'm probably never going to do it again, but I can survive it until they are all used up.  First thing you notice when you pull these out of the box is that they are much fuzzier then most brands of paper towels.  I have attached a picture.  It's kind of like felt.  So, this is not desirable, from my perspective, if you are microwaving anything that you would use the paper towel over and don't want fibers stuck to it.  Or drying off an apple that you washed and again, don't want fibers stuck to it.  Next thing is that they tear super, super easy.  Not just when wet.  It tore two holes in the first roll I used just sliding it on our paper towel holder (it brushed up against the shorter bar of it), and this is not normally a problem I have, not with any other brand I've used.  It also comes apart easier when you are wiping up spills, which also isn't something I personally find desirable.  I need my paper towels to hold up to a lot because I am swimming in a constant sea of messes over here.  I have a very naughty kitty who's decided peeing and pooping outside of the litterbox is the world's best form of protest, his sometimes equally naughty feline sidekick, and a son who is a joy but loves to play in the sink and spill things all over pretty much everything.  So my paper towels need to not fall apart, because I use them a lot...and some of it, I don't want my fingers to come into contact with.  It's not quite as bad as toilet paper when it gets wet, but honestly, that's what it reminded me most of the way it started to come apart and turn to mush.  So, heads up. This was my experience with these in our household.	-1
These pads are great in an emergency BUT I would like to see them a bit longer and not quite as thin.  I wear these pads over top of a regular Poise pad.  P.S.:  I have 2 kids - only 1 is ungrateful!  Thank you God!!!	-1
I have had my daughter in pampers and nothing but since the day she was born.  I used swaddlers exclusively until she was 6 months old then introduced cruisers. I never had an issue until the last 2 packs came from amazon!  I have had my daughter wake up soaked in pee, only had been in diaper 2 hours!  This is unacceptable as a customer!  They are an expensive brand diaper and need to work properly especially for bedtime!  I am not sure if I will order another box or cancel my subscribe and save!  I am really furious that they leak so easily!  The brand is made for moving and if she moves in them they leak quicker!  I am still using swaddlers now and will use them at night but wanted to have 2 different kinds that I loved because you can't order 2 boxes of same brand on subscribe and save.	-1
We finally managed to afford the luxury paper towel:  Viva. We bought Viva paper towels for a few years and enjoyed the soft towel that also cleaned. Then things changed. The current version is nothing like the original and once that happened we quit buying them. I hope the folks at Viva realize the original towel worked while being soft and luxurious. Please bring back the original as the current version feels like you are using sandpaper.	-1
is ok	-1
have soy allergy and did not know this product contained soy. no reason for soy in it.	-1
dented can	-1
Dented	-1
AS with the beans every can came extremely dented. I have not had one can shipped with Prime Pantry come usable. Huge disappointment.	-1
Cheap for a reason	-1
I like ordering online for my food storage, however, it's not safe to use dented cans for food storage.. price was great, however, when it has to be thrown out it defeated the purchase.	-1
Where is the pork?	-1
I bought 2 cans. Very very watery runny beans. Even after I condensed much of the water into paste, the beans were very watery and bland flavored. There was almost no flavor, and the pork was negligible to nonexistant. Avoid Van Camp's a better brand like Campbells, until Van Camp can make their beans more consistently porky and flavorful.	-1
My can was watery and the taste seemed to be diluted.  It also sank to the bottom of the plate.  I added some Simply Ketchup which helped the watery flavor and it stayed on the noodles better.  I purchased another brand of sauce and this did poorly in comparison to the others.	-1
No pork.  I mean, was someone thinking about pigs when they were canning this?  Also, why High Fructose Corn Syrup?  I thought people were on the anti-GMO bandwagon.  It's my own fault for not reading the can before purchase.  Never again.  Too sweet, no meat, lousy product.	-1
Meh.	-1
Dented	-1
These beans suck. I don't know what possessed me to buy them other than the price. When you're used to B&M and Bush's, these will not satisfy your tastebuds.	-1
Bleck. Bush's beans rock ...never again will I switch.	-1
DENTED.  LOOK AS IF CANS WERE THROWN INTO BOX.  RESOLVE ALL OVER CANS AND LABELS.	-1
I'm nearly old enough to collect Social Security, so these beans came into existence during my youth.  As a youth, I remember them tasting smokey, with a little salt pork square in the can.  They were good hot, not too spicy, not too sweat.  Now, just last night, my Prime Pantry order arrived and I longingly looked at the can (I ordered 4), decided to open it and have some.  KETCHUP.  That's what it tasted like.  Not at all what I remembered.  Now, if you have the same experience, fix the stuff by adding just a few drops (no more) of Wright's hickory smoke, offered here at Amazon in quart and gallon sizes.  That's one of the best food purchases I've ever made, but it's VERY strong.  So only a few drops (much stronger and better than, say, Colgin).  Then these beans will begin to taste like they used to.  Where you find the salt pork, lol I don't know.  Didn't realize it made such a difference, until now.	-1
It's Beans.  No pork.  Not even a tiny strip of pork in 3 cans.  It puts me very much in mind of Heinz Vegetarian beans in England.  The taste is excellent but it isn't Pork and Beans.	-1
The texture of these are different than when buying the same from the grocery store, it's more thick and pasty than I'd like.  I'm not sure why that is, but I won't be buying these from Amazon any more.	-1
Cheesy bag tears easy	-1
Box came tore up !	-1
If you use unscented laundry detergent because you don't like the way it makes the clothes smell, then these bags are not for you.	-1
Every 1 of 5 rips around the drawstring. I have no clue why, it's not too heavy, but whenever I pull the plastic to tie it it will rip out of one side.	-1
The smell of these is too strong - it's overwhelming when I first put one in the trashcan. Doesn't seem to do much to shield odors once it's full, either, so it's pointless. They also seem pretty thing, I have been in fear of them tearing right through a few times already.	-1
I'm sorry.  I love V-8 tomato drink but this drink I ended up pouring down the drain.  It was like very sweet colored water.  Ugh.	-1
NOT AS TASTY AS I HAD HOPED HAD TO ADD MY OWN FLAVORS	-1
Will never buy again. Tasted bad.	-1
This is very easy to cook - just open it and pour it over cooked chicken and simmer for five minutes. Serve over rice. It smells great actually and I was excited to dig in. A fast, easy appetizing dinner...what's not to like? Well the flavor is a bit off. It's sort of bland and salty at the same time. That can be addressed with some doctoring using seasonings etc while cooking, but to be honest, doesn't that defeat the purpose of a fast, easy meal? The deal breaker for me is the after taste - there's just a funky, chemical aftertaste that won't stop. I'll just make my own sesame sauce in the future.	-1
gross. The taste was just nasty. I will not be buying this again!	-1
I thought ordering some of my groceries through Amazon Pantry was going to be a great idea....boy was I wrong.  Out of the 39 canned good items I ordered 24 of those cans are dented; some pretty badly.  You can see 3 out of 4 cans are dented.  I will be ordering any more canned good items from Amazon.  :(	-1
This soup has a strange color, and lack-luster flavor. I will probably not order it again.	-1
orderd 2 cans 1 dented 1 broken open	-1
Did not like them.	-1
Unfortunately not as described on package! Chocolate was at bottom of bag with pretzels broken and some had bits of chocolate others not! SNYDERS a great company but this brand was a miss:(	-1
Their Honey Mustard pieces are excellent but these were not. I found no resemblance in taste to smores.	-1
I was really hoping that this would be a great summer drink, but it's pretty disappointing. The mix is really sweet and the lemon flavor tastes fake. I also don't like that the powder doesn't mix well into the water, so it doesn't taste like real sweet tea. It's an ok substitute, but I'm not repurchasing this when it runs out.	-1
I'm giving this two stars based on the mess they left on my hands, nkt on the taste, which was really good.  But, after picking up the little pretzel pieces, I needed a napkin to wipe off all the sugary "stuff" which adhered to my hands.  I will not order again.	-1
NOT SO GREAT	-1
Nobody around here likes this favor on these prezels.	-1
Was very yuck.	-1
An average big brand salsa. A bit watery with smaller chunks than many - yet that only matters if you want to scoop up a lot of salsa at one time  The bigger problem is that it was largely tasteless featuring a cooked tomato taste.  After looking at a number of blind tasting reviews of jarred salsas the number one choice is usually Green Mountain but it can be very expensive and hard to find.  Old El Paso comes in second place, most often. I have not tried this salsa in years.  When Green Mountain comes up on sale, I buy up as many jars as I can. Yet I wanted to try Pace and it turns out I was missing nothing.  Tip: Buy all your Salsa as mild! While I love Hot and spicy things I've learned to buy my SALSA AS "MILD" SO I CAN BETTER TASTE IT AND THEN MIGHT ADD MY FAVORITE HOT SAUCE TO IT.	-1
this arrived damaged, the bag was broken open and the pretzel bites were scattered inside the bottom of the box.	-1
Bad, the taste is that of a synthetic product	-1
Not very good. i don't know what they put in these miniature little hog dogs, but they are terrible. The best i can say is it  edible and that's all!	-1
This is much too sweet and I have a sweet tooth. I may have to water it down. The Fusions are much better.	-1
These are advertised as a pack of 12 when in reality they are only a pack of one. It's one 20 oz family size bag of Jolly Ranchers.  The Jolly Ranchers themselves are great. They come with a great variety of all your favorite flavors. It's a pretty big bag on its own, so it should last a while!	-1
Terribly tasting. Although cheap, but generic.	-1
So disappointed in V8 or should I say Campbell's. The amount of corn syrup just kills it. I'm saying the flavor is good, but why so sweet? I found it totally undrinkable unless you pore it over ice and let that melt down some.	-1
NOT a fan.	-1
There wasn't an equal mix of candy in this bag. It's mostly banana taffy and sweettarts and then Nerds. There was hardly any gobstoppers at all. There was only two flavors of nerds in my bag, grape and strawberry. There was two flavors of taffy in my bag, banana and strawberry. I was expecting a larger selection of flavors and an equal amount of all the candies in the bag. So unless you really like banana taffy because that's what you're going to be getting a lot of, don't get this mixed bag of candy.	-1
Milk in order exploding ruining this, unable to determine quality.	-1
I love V8 juices and was excited to try this mango peach. It was a smooth consistency and was thirst quenching but had a little aftertaste. Upon reading the ingredients I saw it contained sucralose which messes with my digestive system. I should have checked that first. Going strictly by taste it was okay but my rating also reflects the aftertaste.	-1

My biggest issue is the ingredients, the first two are: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, etc... So if you're thinking this is a healthy beverage you will be mistaken, as it's not. I can not believe that the healthy "V-8" brand has been bastardized, and sold out by their owners, Campbell's. HFCS is engineered to make you want more of it, and blocks the absorption of some nutrients so it can actually make the food you eat LESS nutritious. The stuff is horrible, one of man kinds disastrous inventions.	-1
Being a V8 labeled product you would think these would have healthier ingredients and be better for you than say...a soda.  But you know you are in trouble when the second ingredient behind water is high fructose corn syrup.  These are only 5% real fruit juice.  As another review said...these are just sugar water.  VERY disappointed.	-1
kinda gross... never had a v8 splash or any v8 that wasn't super.. this.. ick	-1
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS ALLERGIC TO MANGOES...	-1
i saw v8 and thought healthy. i drank it and then looked at the ingredients. this is nothing more than hi-c with carrots for color. tbh, i was disappointed by this drink (not even sure it is juice) because its all high fructose corn syrup. I won't be buying this again. maybe... it is a cheap drink	-1
When I ordered this I was filling a Prime Pantry Box and thinking V8 meant healthy option, lol.... I usually look at ingredients prior to ordering things but my mistake for rushing!  The second ingredient after water is high fructose corn syrup.... Yuck!  I gave it 2 stars because we did drink it since we did pay for it, lol, and of course it did taste good! Won't buy again though!	-1
For some reason I made the assumption V8 is  healthy. Never again. I poured it all out as I refused to poison my body with heaps of fructose corn syrup the second ingredient after water. Very little nutrition from the looks of the ingredients.	-1
Skip this or any of the V8 Splash and get V8 Fusion instead.  V8 Splash has high fructose corn syrup and does not taste as good as naturally sweet V8 Fusion.  I don't have to tell you which is healthier too.	-1
High fructose sweetened water with a SPLASH of flavor. Really nothing V8 about it.	-1
Yuck. Doesn't taste good at all.even chilled and on a lot of ice. Just has a very bad taste to it. I won't be buying this again.	-1
Not for diabetics.  Loaded with corn syrup.	-1
Less water used for processing, and it'd be tastier. Not my favorite salsa anymore.	-1
Hello today I wanted you to kow about this item . It is the : Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking water It is the 50.7 fl. oz. size single bottle It is being sold by : Essentia I bought this item in hopes that it would cut down on the trash and help me at the same time . But when I gotten it via Amazon prime pantry I found that it has things floating it in and I did not even try to drink it . It was not minerals that I saw but something else and I wantedyou to know about this . It iwas in date and unopened .	-1
a strange after taiste.	-1
My Mom states WAY too much salt. I don't like soup.	-1
I thought ordering some of my groceries through Amazon Pantry was going to be a great idea....boy was I wrong.  Out of the 39 canned good items I ordered 24 of those cans are dented; some pretty badly.  I ordered 4 cans of tuna, 2 are dented.  I will be ordering any more canned good items from Amazon.  :(	-1
dented cans	-1
These cookies are delicious...every single cookie in the bag was shattered to smithereens.  Could not serve as a treat with a beverage to company. It seems that if you are using robotics to pack boxes this is an area that needs to be addressed.	-1
I didn't realize that this contained artificial sweetener,  my mistake.  We opened it and tried it and it was horrible.  The taste was overly sweet and it left a bad aftertaste.  I ended up pouring it down the drain.  I guess if you are used to diet or low cal drinks, it might be alright.  I think products should clearly be marked as containing artificial sweeteners instead of having to search the ingredient list.	-1
High fructose corn syrup and water. You shouldn't drink anything like this---have a soda, it's better for you. I've added the back label so you can see it's 5% juice and the top 2 ingredients are water and HFCS. I felt deceived by ordering this and would return it if that wasn't a hassle. In the future, I will not buy a product unless they show the ingredients side of the label.  I say we ask Amazon to make that a requirement for selling any food, supplement or drink. Agree?	-1
ok	-1
taste great	-1
crushed!	-1
the package got crushed.. the little pieces weere frash and crunchy, and the crumbs were ok,but I had to eat them with a spoon. I think the package got caught in a tornado or something. Pepperidge Farm makes good stuff, but it does not stand up to buffalo stampedes. Not at all happy with the delivery.	-1
Stale,,,,past the expiration date,	-1
This is nothing more than a Kool Ade type of drink.  As it says V8, I thought it meant that there were  some vegetable contents.  I was wrong--no antioxidants--just sugar, water, and berry flavorings concentrate (whatever that is).  False advertising.  I don't recommend it.	-1
This is REALLY bland.  Hardly any flavor at all.  I much prefer Carnation Instant Breakfast, Dark Chocolate.  Much more flavor!	-1
Not an Amazon issue - just don't like the juice.  It's not much healthier than HI-C	-1
This tastes like Kool-aid and is like 5% juice.  What were you thinking V8	-1
This is much too sweet for me.	-1
Very tasty!	-1
seemed a bit stale	-1
Great cookies, but mine arrived saturated with cleaning product and I had to throw them away.  Prime Pantry doesn't always do a good job segregating cleaning items from food items.  My box arrived with a  broken bottle of spray bathroom cleaner with bleach which made a huge mess and ruined the cookies, paper napkins and other food.  It was a terrible mess to clean up the other non-food items. I'd give 5 stars for the product, but one star for Prime Pantry's packaging.	-1
Too sweet for me	-1
Only a few cookies were intact. Most were broken.	-1
Pretzel bits better	-1
If you want crumbled and smashed up cookies, then order these here.  The product itself is excellent.	-1
Should not be carried around in a mail delivery vehicle all day long in sweltering central Florida. Tasted great, but, oh what a mess.	-1
These cookies arrived today broken, with the chocolate melted everywhere inside the bag :(	-1
didnt like them	-1
When these arrived, the package was smashed, and so were the cookies!  I had ordered them for a church group that was meeting here, and I couldn't use them at all!	-1
Price way better here	-1
Nothing like crumbs instead of pieces, will never purchase again	-1
Okay.	-1
bag was crushed by a case of V8 energy drinks that were packaged with it.	-1
Too fragile to survive Prime Pantry delivery intact.	-1
Punch you in the face flavor.	-1
Too mustardy, very sour and don't taste good. Don't make the same mistake as me if you like honey mustard, onions, and pretzels all on their own - but combining them into honey mustard and onion pretzels is a bad experience.	-1
***This is just an alert I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER IN HOT TEXAS***  First off I really do LOVE these cookies under normal circumstances. This batch arrived a gooey melted chocolately mess. Putting them in the refrigerator upon arrival did firm up the chocolate BUT the Milano experience wasn't the usual pleasant one.  ***This is just an alert I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER IN HOT TEXAS***	-1
I like the convenience, but not the taste.	-1
I've used NexCare bandages for years with great success so despite these looking different than the old ones I didn't hesitate in buying them. Boy am I disappointed! The fabric is like super thin suede and the adhesive does not hold well at all. I was using them around an injury on my toe and the triangular cut did not work well at all, as in the center near the pad wouldn't connect with the flesh. To top that, within a couple of days the skin near the injury started peeling off. I went back to the bandages I had been using on it and the peeled skin heeled right up. I don't think I'll be buying NexCare again unless I just happen along some of their old-style bandages.	-1
Wont stick to a fly. Maybe they are old	-1
The smell is awful and lingers for a long time. I had to follow up with 409 just to get rid of the bad odor. I might try again in the future if they change that aspect.	-1
This smells awful!  Very gross,  like baked grass (if I ever baked grass).  I'm trying to do the natural cleaner thing,  but I can't do it if the smell isn't "clean".	-1
This cleans well but I CANNOT get past the scent of this product.  It has a horrible smell that I cannot tolerate.	-1
This is the worst smelling cleaner I have ever had. Yuck.	-1
This product stinks to high heaven!  It does not have a lemon grass scent.  It is disgusting. I sprayed my sink, and it lingered for about 30 minutes.  Yuck!	-1
Think of a dead skunk on a hot Summer day in Louisiana and that would probably smell better than this product, which is a major shame since it cleans so well and it is suppose to kill germs, but then they probably keel over from the smell.  Normally items left in our Laundry Room for other people to take are gone on average in less than an hour, however this product sat for three days before someone gave it a new home.  I am glad someone could use it.	-1
This item cleans well enough - but I hate the smell.  Chemically - not fresh.  Tone it down and add some lemon or something.  I am afraid to buy an other  Seventh Generation product because I am afraid of the smell.	-1
