Wow, works great!  Got the brown heat marks off my stainless V&H headers on my V Rod with a little elbow grease.  It really works and it didn't take much which is a good thing since they don't give you much in the plastic can.  Why can't they at least fill the can?  But it does work.  I haven't tried it on any blueing yet but based on how it took away the brown heat discoloring on my headers, I'm pretty confident it will remove blueing.  Next time I will remove my headers and give it the 100% cleaning... yeah right!  Get it if you don't like your exhaust discolored!	1
made my old pipes look alot better, wish it came with more powder!	1
Trash... it will scratch your  .... up	-1
Works well to de-blue motorcycle pipes but is a lot of hard work. If job must be done, this is the one.	1
I was very disappointed with this product mostly because it is hard to use.  It's basically a small plastic cap full of powder you have to dab with a cloth and apply.  The stuff works fine, but the application is terrible as the powder clumps, falls off the cloth and is either too wet or too dry.  Buy the stuff in a liquid form and save yourself some headache.	-1
Didn't cut the baked on oxides on my pipes worth anything.  It may be good for barely tarnished pipes, but not for the really crusted and oxidized ones.	-1
This stuff works very well on stainless steel pipes to get rid of the blue and gold tint caused by exhaust heat.  Well done!	1
Haven't got a chance to use it. I bought it to clean the exhaust pipes on my motorcycle, but replaced them before I used this.	1
The pathetic amount in the container is not much to work with. Should at least have enough to make a paste to put onto a 3" pad.	-1
The upper half of my pipes were a terrible looking dark blue fading down to a gold so I gave blue job a try for the first time. I started by hand following the directions and after about an hour my hand was killing me and I didn't get very far. I ran out to harbor freight and bought an electric oscillating tool with the triangle head with Velcro sand paper attachment, put some blue job on the cloth, stuck it to the head and wow! Did both pipes in about half an hour and couldn't believe how the blue/gold just came off on the cloth. My pipes look new again and with the tool couldn't have been easier. There's not much powder in the jar, but a little bit goes along way, and can probably use it about 5 more times. Great product!	1
I was a bit skeptical at first even after reviewing this product on YouTube. It seems it required a bit of force and elbow grease to rub away blemishes. I had some dis-colorization around my cylinder heads, in a matter of seconds this product removed every blemish. I'm sold!	1
Mag wheel aluminum polish put out by mothers and sold at Walmart works better. This stuff is basically the grit and you wet a pad for the grit to sti k to and when you try polishing half ends up on the floor. Not that good buy mothers.	-1
Plastic, so more durable than glass ones.  Have to squeeze all the air out of the bulb to pull sufficient fluid in.  Hose has a permanent kink, but it aids in closing off the tube if you wish to remove it from the battery to read it.  You DO have to thump it to loosen bubbles for consistently accurate readings.	1
good product	1
works well but its messy	1
Very nice brake surge head.  I've now used it for several years and it's performed well. Only complaint is that the back up lock out does not stay engaged on it's own.  I fabricated a retainer out of copper wire to hold it in place when backing up.	1
Fit great as a replacement for a Fulton that died a miserable death. Bolted on using existing holes and bled easily using a hitch ball mount and a ball not attached to the truck. Only complaint is the breakaway cable is pretty short.	1
Worked great bolted right up to my 1997 lowe boat trailer. Great product	1
works great	1
These are a real pain to rebuild. I am not someone who has time to fiddle with something. pay yourself in time & frustration, & I mean the frustration of driving to dumb parts stores trying to find the pieces inside. Bolt this beautiful piece on & get fishin.	1
As described	1
Dropped right in.  Seems as well made as the one I bought 18 years ago... that's how long the last one lasted.	1
fit perfectly	1
A++++++++++++ BOLTED RIGHT ON AND WORKED PERFECTLY AND I AM NO MECHANIC.	1
I am very impressed with the quality of this coupler.  I was sick of fighting my old coupler.. getting it on and off was a pain.  This coupler works very smoothly, easy on, easy off!	1
Very few metal waxes which are better.  Flitz is up there with this.  Better than Never Dull.  Most Collinite products are worth the $.  There is a larger bottle which is a good value if 1 bottle won't be enough.	1
great product	1
What can I say, great stuff.	1
Works perfect and fine price	1
A very good metal polish	1
I used this on my chrome running boards on my truck with the Griots 3in polisher and orange pad, and also with a microfiber towel. The results were great, it removed mild water spots and oxidation that I was not able to remove by washer or with OPC. I would definitely buy this product again.	1
this is a excellent metal cleaner I use it to clean chrome on autos works well on aluminum trim and dull metal you have to use some elbow grease  when applying but the results are worth it leaves a clean brilliant shine	1
This is the most amazing stuff ever for stainless. I used it in the past and just ordered a new bottle (from Amazon).  It is the ONLY thing to buy for stainless	1
I love Collinite No. 850 Liquid Metal Wax. It is a great product and a great value. A little goes a long way. Although it is marketed for Marine, Automotive and Aeronautical use (for chrome, copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel), it easily cleans and protects my brass and aluminum collectibles and home decor and keeps them looking beautiful as well.  You just shake the bottle well before use. Then apply the wax in a thin layer to your metal with a cotton cloth or applicator pad rubbing it in as you go to help loosen tarnish, rust, etc. Let the wax dry and polish it off with a dry micro-fiber cloth or cotton towel. When you are done you are left with a shiny, gleaming surface that now has a protective coating to keep it from further tarnish.	1
Works great, nice shine, and easy to remove.  I have used a lot of different metal polishes and waxes over the years on both automotive Aluminum and Chrome.  This one is the best general wax so far.  There are better products for removing oxidation from Aluminum but this works fine for keeping aluminum looking good with less mess.  Works real good on Chrome.	1
Like all other collinite products i have used, this stuff is great. Bought it for cars, but ended up trying it on some brass brackets for a old ceiling fan. I couldn't believe the tarnish and oxidation this stuff took off. Have yet to see what it does for Al and Cr, but even if it doesn't remove scratches and oxidation it leaves a nice wax coating to prevent it from getting any-worse.	1
Had a couple of small Quarter size hail dents in my truck. Thought I would give it a try. Didn't have any effect after trying several times. The glue would break apart in the middle and stick to the puller and truck surface. May work for larger dents but did not help me.	-1
So far its only been able to pull out about 1 out of 4 dents on the 2 cars I have tried it on. The first time I used it the thing worked like magic but I assume it has to do with where the dent is located and how much stress or lack of the metal is under. After my first dent repair I felt like a pro ready to conquer the world thinking why pay the dent guy $150 sucker. But the next 3 I couldn't make it work but they were much smaller.	-1
Didn't work	-1
Pretty good solution for dents.  I haven't actually used it on my car yet, but bought it to use on a garage door dent.  It isn't perfect, but it's far better than it was before.  The biggest challenge I had was that regardless of which glue I used, it would pop off the metal surface before it was done doing it's job.  I know it's a delicate balance bewteen providing enough grip to do the job, but not so much that you can't remove it, but it would be nice to have a stock option to do just a little more pulling when needed.	1
does not work!	-1
Worked OK but didn't get the bigger dings out	1
Good deal	1
I was very skeptical about this product after reading all of the reviews here on Amazon, but I decided to try it anyway after not being able to find a local paintless dent repair specialist. My car is a late model Dodge Challenger and I had a one inch diameter ding in the back of my front fender and another dent nearly the same size but with a crease in the center of it, right at the body line of the roof above the rear window. I started on the worst, the roof ding. I cleaned the surface and the threaded piece as directed, heated up the red stick (it was mid 70's this day), and with the car in the garage and the surface cool to the touch, I went to work. Two tries got out 90% of the dent, a third try actually brought it a little too high and I had to level it with the included tool, which worked out nicely. The red adhesive cleaned off both the tool and the paint with very little effort. Next, I did the fender dent and it all came right out with the first pull. Very pleased with the results, and there are enough glue sticks to do several dents for much less that one trip from a PDR person.	1
This does not work very well. Spent a bunch of time and money trying this, and it wasn't worth it.  You can sort of see how it might work, but it just doesnt work well enough to fix real dents in the real world.  good idea, just not good enough. I wish it worked, but it doesnt, sorry.	-1
Didn't work for a simple door dint	-1
Not the easiest to use, and the smaller circle "puller" stopped grabbing onto glue despite cleaning it over and over, but the larger one is fine to use when you have an annoying dent that you gotta get out. It takes some finesse, and a good amount of learning how much to torque, how much glue to apply... I prefer putting the hot glue directly on the puller part, quickly holding it on the area that needs pulling. Marking the area helps in this case (tape around or chalk mark) and remember that you have to plan the angle at which the cross bar assembly will pull from, so do a dry run so you angle the hot glue just right the first time. I say this because the puller "screws" go into the cross bar at almost exactly 90 degrees, with little wiggle room, and you want to have the cross bar feet pretty flat as to not do any other marking or damage.	1
I wod  give this negative 2 stars if I could!! Does not work!! Tried it on various size size dents with no luck. I tried it more than once and it failed.  Would not buy this or anyone similar to it again	-1
Did not take out any of the dents that I tried it on.  Multiple areas and two different material types - No luck.	-1
Perfect for small dents on flat thin metal.  That is all.	1
A large truck tire flew across the freeway and hit my front fender causing a foot long dent. This product removed 95% of the dent I had in my front fender and worked as described, I'm impressed with the results. It did take a few tries working at the dent due to the size, the tool works as long as you follow the instructions.	1
ok	1
junk-save your money	-1
This little kit really pulled the dents.	1
Work on a bigger dent but actually mad the smaller dings worse.	-1
It seems to work ok.  Most definitely not perfect for hail dent removal.  It certainly makes the dents less noticeable but they are still there after 2-3 attempts and 2-3 sessions at different temperatures.  I will try again when it gets colder (70's F).	-1
What can I say.  Although I was quite skeptical about the ability of this product to work by just hot gluing a threaded stud to a dent, it really does work as advertised.  I had someone bump me in a parking lot leaving a 8" long indentation that was between  1/8" and 1/4" deep in my pristine car.  While the dent wasn't serious, I was heartbroken when I discovered this.  I knew I was facing a a bill of several hundred dollars just to remove the mild dent.  Looking at he dent, I saw that there wasn't a hard crease but jut a smooth indentation.  I thought I could knock it out from the inside but it looked like a major ordeal to disassemble the interior panels.  Having only $30 +/- to lose, I thought I'd give this a shot.  Well, this thing actually worked pretty well.  I was surprised how well the hot glue stuck to the panel and then released using the provided releasing agent.  After a half-dozen applications,  I pretty must had the entire dent pulled out.  I also pulled out some hail dings out of my wife's car with this.  Cool!!  Notes: 1) Be patient and let the glue cool completely before starting to pull on the dent.  I would recommend at least 10 minutes.  Do the job while performing some other tasks so you can let the glue cool well in between pulls without having wait and stare at the cooling glue. 2) While I pulled out my dent, I did have some minor rippling in the surface where the dent was from where I pulled the dent.  This was very minor and I could probably level it out with some more applications. 3) I've read elsewhere that the releasing agent is really just rubbing alcohol.  If I run out of the agent, I will try some alcohol and see if it works the same. 4) Most modern cars have thinner metal than vintage vehicles.  I'm not sure how this will work with a vintage (i.e 60's) car dings.	1
Did not work for me. Wife put too big a dent in the car to fix, I guess.	-1
It really didn't work for me. Can't avoid the expensive body shop	-1
The product is as decribed and is good quality. It works better as you use it more. The only problem I had was on a bigger dent. I managed to take off a piece of the paint. Required some work to get the paint repaired.	1
good	1
It works.	1
Followed every step to the letter. Watched YouTube videos, but did not think the lifter and wing nuts would be the weak point. Both wing nut and lifters are very low quality and the large lifter stripped and failed on the first attempt! All of the other parts of this system seemed okay but are useless without good lifters! Unfortunately the review here does not allow less than "1", if it did I would only give it a half a star!	-1
Overall this product did a great job.  It removed sveral hail dents that were about an 1.5" across and maybe 1/4" deep.  It took 2-3 tries on the hail dents to get them out, but I would say it removed at least 98% of the dent.  It also mostly removed a dent about the size of football that was roughly 1.5" deep.  It didn't take it out completely, but it took care of about 90% of the dent after several tries where I targeted small sections each time. I think if I spent more time on the rest of ripples in that area I could get it all out.  I think you need to have realistic expectations on a product like this.  Is it going to work miricales...no, is it going to remove most of your ping pong ball sized dents...it did for me.  I think the success can also vary depending on the vehicle and it's age.  Older cars have thicker metal, the newer cars have thinner metal an in a lot of cases the panels are aluminium.  the package states not to use this product on aluminium panels.  Overall I would say this product did everything it promised.  Follow the directions and it's possible to get the same results I did.  Let's face it, you've spent more money on worthless products, for the money this is at least worth a try.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was beacuse I'd like to see more choices on the dent studs (the part you put the glue on).  I wish they'd have one more larger stud.	1
product is good, works fine! It was what I expect. Thanks I would recomended! product is good, works fine! It was what I expect. Thanks I would recomended!	1
I had a couple of gems from the grocery store parking lot and this kit got them all out.  The kit even includes a tap dowel just in case you pull the panel out too far.  A word of caution, if you have sharp dents, this type of kit will only remove most of the dent.  If you have smooth dents on the side of your car (or hail damage anywhere), like myself, it will take them out to near seamlessness.  I have to really look for the spots where the dents were.  Lastly, for best performance,let the glue set up for about 3-5 minutes before pulling and apply enough to the puller head to have about 1/8 inch "cushion" of glue between the head and the dent surface.	1
Give it a try! This is a basic kit but compared well to $200+ kits. A lot of thought & effort have gone into the design, instructions, and materials.  My car got severely beat by baseball & golfball size hail. This kit is allowing me, an backyard mechanic, to pull 70-80% of the dents. A couple have come out perfect. Most are not perfect, but I suspect this is more due to operator error/inexperience on my part.  Take your time, follow the instructions, and the results are quite good. Recommended!	1
very surprised how well this worked,I would say it removes about 90% of a dent. Saved me a lot of money!!!!	1
it will fix the dent on body panel. but  NO ON THE BODY LINE. Any dent on the body line this kit is useless. the only reason i didn't return it it's becase i used it. The glue is not that sticky. release agent is ok but not "GOOD"  If you wanna invest on some good dent repair tool, you need to look for another one	-1
We had a nasty storm that left hail damage on a couple of my kid's cars.  The cars are old enough that the only coverage I have on them is liability.  They're not worth taking to a body shop, but nice enough that I'd like to get the dents out as best I can.  I had mixed results.  The first day I worked on my son's '03 Nissan Altima.  It was about 87F but overcast so we worked outside.  The adhesive did not hold very well.  It would frequently pop off the paint as we would slowly crank on the piston.  After several attempts on a single dent, it looked a little better.  My daughter's ''04 Mazda 3 went better.  The next day it was just over 80 and since it was sunny I worked in the garage.  The adhesive worked very well and we pulled most of the dents out.  Not sure why it worked so much better.  Could it have been the paint type, or softer sheet metal, or the slightly cooler temperature?  My daughter took the car through a car wash just before I worked on it.  I'm not sure.  Here's a few observations: 1. Read other customer feedbacks.  There's a lot of useful information out there. 2. Even my best dent removal didn't totally eliminate the dent.  Hail dents tend to make a little divot that's impossible to totally get out using this method.  It took large dents and made them smaller.  But they were still there.  I did successfully remove a non hail dent that was more like a small sheet metal crease. 3. When screwing/lifting the piston dent puller, hold onto the rubber base that's attached to the adhesive.  I think by reducing the torque on the piston it helped keep the adhesion to the car body. 4. I think their special solvent is just IPA.  I tried IPA out of curiosity and it worked equally well. 5. When removing the adhesive, puddle a little solvent on one side.  Raise and lower that side by rocking the piston to let the solvent seep in underneath it.  It eventually comes free.	1
Do not work at all, and the glue is super difficult to remove! Save your money and try something else.	-1
Works on one of the major dents, which is well worth its price.  You have to keep repeating until you get desire results.  While this is not going to bring the dent back to its original, it sure did the job of making it look better than the "obvious-ding".  It made my car's side dings look less obvious, and you have to look very hard to find them "dings" now...  I can live with that.  Thanks.  Great idea and invention.	1
Used this tool on several dings and it almost totally removed them. Like others stated, it takes several tries and it holds better if you wait 5/10 minutes after installing with the glue. Moved the rubber pads in closer to the center for a stiffer pull on small dings. Would definitely recommend for normal dings that are not creased or gouged.	1
Everybody should remember the phrase "Too good to be true". If the package says: 1-"Dents improve 70-80%, to the point that won't be noticeable from the front view.   2- It may take more than an hour of dedicated work, more people will buy this product. Instead of the supplied wing nut, I used a metal nut and a ratchet and believe was able to pull more dent out this way.	1
I had a very bad experience with this product using it on a dime size ding. Followed the instructions as recommended on how to prepare the surface and use the right temp glue and etc. but it took three try for the glue to stick, however; on the third attempt it peeled of my door paint. No there was no previous paint crack or chip around the ding, so using this product should warn people of the consequent.	-1
Glue kept pulling off the body. Tried a number of times with same results. Just glad it did not cost more.	-1
I successfully removed a dent from a motorcycle gas tank using this. Saved me from having to buy a new tank or pay a body shop to repair the damage. Follow the directions and take your time and you will be amazed at how much this product can accomplish.	1
This is a very nice kit, it doesnt work as well as expected but it has taken out dents that I didn't think it would	1
Does not work - it's junk!  I have to fill in more words to post this review, so how about junk, junk, junk!	-1
I was skeptical to buy this after seen the reviews at amazon, but I had a very good experience with that tool.  We had in my country a very unusual hail storm with ping pong ball size. My car was protected but I got 6 small dents on the paint, and had to replace some chrome on doors and front, here is difficulty to find a paint less repair place, some people don't even know what it is, so I talk to the insurance company and the dealer said to me that they have to past and paint my 5 months old car, and I said no way I will do this!  After some research I found the Dent Out, using this was a breeze, 4 of my 6 dents is gone and two is a lot less noticeable I can see because I'm a neurotic, but my wife and friends can't so I think if the next owner is not like me I'm good to sell my car :)  You will need a lot of time, maybe a whole day working in your car, sometimes the metal came out too much and you have to punch a little bit to send it back, about the glue that some people complain, is easy to take it off if you wait some time, what I did is wait 5 minutes to start the pull process and the glue just come out with the tool, nothing stayed in the paint, if you wait only 10sec like the owners manual said, you will get residual glue very difficulty to remove, so just be patient!  The Red glue worked better to me even in less than 75F I was about 70F temperature.  Maybe this deserves only the 4 stars for some people, but for me it deserves 10! Because I saved a lot of money and my car is brand new again, so I just purchased another kit at eBay from Microfiber-Products-Online too, to keep one sealed just in case!  If you take care and follow the instructions carefully you will succeed, is easy and very effective, just keep in mind that everything depends from your skills and patience, and don't forget to wait 5 minutes instead 10 seconds to pull it off, use enough glue and don't press the tool on your car, just place it gently, you need like a small glue burger between the tool and the metal, if you do all this you are good to go.  Good Luck!	1
I suspect the device probably works best on flat surfaces and not corners. I had trouble with the glue not staying with the surface of the car, just popped off after several tries....	-1
I got a dent that is about 4" wide at the end of my car after I carelessly backed into a Christmas tree. I decided to buy this product and attempt to pull out the dent myself. I spend nearly two hours on it, and it did a pretty good job of pulling the out the dent.  It is by no means perfect, but at most angles, I could no longer see the dent. One advice that I would give for future users is that the more glue you use, the more pulling power you will have.  This is actually in the instruction manual, but I didn't discover it until later, which would have saved me a lot of time. Updates: Over the years, I have tried many different dents.  Some dents are hard then the others, depends on the location, or the angle. Some dents I just can't get to.  Dents near the wheel, for example, are impossible for me to pop out. I also used this on soft metal sheet such as toaster, which works ok. Hard metal sheet won't work.	1
I followed the instructions exactly as written but was unable to get either glue supplied with the kit to adhere to the surface of the vehicle sufficiently.  In the process of pulling a nickle-sized dent the glue would part company with the vehicle with very little force applied.  I had cleaned the surface with the supplied release agent, allowing it to completely dry - no dice.  I even when so far as to lightly sand the clear coat and clean again with the release agent in an effort to get either glue to adhere long enough to budge the dent.  Nothing worked.  The glue stuck to the business end of the puller just fine.  Working temperature of the vehicle surface was about 70oF.	-1
thank you for a excellent product	1
Again, I've used these for years on my vehicles. But they are also great for dusting around the house. Got to try it.	1
Excellent product	1
It worked as advertised and removed the dust from my 1965 Ford GalaxieXL Convertible.	1
Great for pollen removal.	1
I haven't bought a California Duster in decades.  Glad to see they're not flimsy and stringy.	1
I love this duster. Bought another one for my daughter	1
~BACKGROUND~ I have been detailing vehicles for 20 years and used a wide range of products. I have been using this product for ~15 years.  ==LARGE BRUSH== ~PROS~ - Low maintenance (shake out the dust) - Longevity / durability - Great for touch up dusting to remove dust and pollen. - Long handle and surface area allows for sufficient reach.  ~CONS~ - A bit of a "break in" period, but it's quick  ~TIPS~ - DO NOT use this on a dirty vehicle. You are risking scratching your paint by using this on a very dirty surface. - This is NOT for cleaning your car to remove water spots, heavy dirt, grime, etc. - Shake it out once in awhile. As it accumulates dust you want to give it a good shake to get rid of the excess. Also you don't want to trap a piece of debris in the duster and end up dragging it across a scratchable surface. - When it's new, use it alot. When new it has a bit of an odor and wet feel to it. I think it has some kind of solution possibly for "attracting" dust. It could potentially could stain fabric. After a few dustings the odor and odd feel are gone, so don't worry. - Follow the directions and wash the duster as needed. The performance is not quite a good after washing, but still works pretty well. - Check your local Walmart or auto stores to see if you can find it cheaper. I have seen it for ~$10 at my local Walmart.  ==SMALL BRUSH== The "Dash Duster" works great in wiping the dash, console and doors. Don't think that because it's called a "dash duster" that it's limited to just your car dash. Due to it's size it's perfect for using inside for shelves, cabinets, entertainment center, televisions, desks, window sills, etc.  ~PROS~ - Low cost - No recurring cost (like buying Swiffer refills) - Low maintenance (shake out the dust) - Longevity / durability  ~CONS~ - A bit of a "break in" period, but it's quick  ~TIPS~ - Shake it out once in awhile. As it accumulates dust you want to give it a good shake to get rid of the excess. Also you don't want to trap a piece of debris in the duster and end up dragging it across a scratchable surface. - Follow the directions and wash the duster as needed.

Do not know how could I live without this blower before, I have 3 aussies, 2 of them have very heavy coat, this blower is excellent, still try to learn the best ways and how much air and all, but it is sturdy, not cheap chinese plastic, and it blows air very good. great buy.	1
I have three shelties and have always used force dryers at the groomers. the groomer closed and I went to a new groomer and they had worn out machines. So I bought this for use at home. It is light, and has two speeds, the HI speed just gets the fur of my heavy coated shelties. I used it on dry dogs yesterday when it arrives and was pleased at how much fur came out of my big, shedding sheltie. He really likes it behind his ears, and it was hard to get to him to move around. I used treats to train this, and blew all three dogs, this took a lot of dry fur out.it was nice to sit on the back porch and be comfortable. I expect to still do some brushing. unit is not that loud, Great for show use of home light use, if you have a grooming shop buy something stronger. Arrived in ten days. Wish i had bought it years ago.	1
good unit, does the job well.	1
This unit seems to be identical to the Metro Air Force  car dryer but its about $25 cheaper so I figured, why not try it?  Well I'll say this, it works great.  If I used it on my 8 pound dog, it would blow her across the room! :-)  I'm very pleased with the construction and performance. My gripe is the way they stuffed the "manual" and warranty card in the box: just crammed in like packing material and all bent up and crumpled.  Some of us actually keep the manuals, okay? And speaking of packing material, there is zero. Just a machine in a box.  Glad UPS was careful.  Anyway, it is a great machine, all minor issues aside.  Highly recommended	1
I purchased this dryer for my Daughters 4-H project goat.  It is a good product for the price.  Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  Overall nice product.	1
Has been working for two years now with no problems. Be sure to drain the water or put anti freeze in it before winter.	1
I purchased this pump to replace the leaky one in my RV.  It is the identical replacement pump and made me realize how far gone my old one was. This new pump is so quiet I hardly know it is running and when it kicks on the water pressure is there instantly.	1
Excellent product! It looks very solid and very good.  It is inexpensive.  You will not regret to buy it with such price.  Highly recommended! I will buy it again.	1
I bought this pump to replace one that came with a sprayer that I pull behind a  lawn tractor. I have used SHURflo  pumps in RV's that I have owned. SHURflo is a good, reputable  brand, and it does the job for my sprayer.	1
This water pump was very easy to hook up. The fittings that came with the pump came in handy. It is a quiet pump and maintains a steady water flow. I haven't had any pump surging, just steady flowing. The pressure is actually a bit better than the pump I replaced. I am very satisfied with the pump as well as the ease of installation. Very good quality.	1
We needed a new pump and could not beat the price of this one.  Ordered and it as here quick!  It is same brand everyone uses in their campers and motorhomes and no one sells it this cheap!	1
Awesome pump for the price. I have use Sureflo before in the past and they never fail running for hours on end.	1
When my water pump went out in my truck camper last summer, my dealer at Camper's World wanted over $300 to replace it.  I went to Amazon, found this exact replacement and did it myself saving over $200 in the process.  It works well, and I have had no trouble since.  I highly recommend this vendor and this product.	1
II thought the pump away going to be different than my old one. Since my old one s part number ended in 144. And the new one ended in 444.  But it appears to be the same and works great. Great price compared to rv dealer. Amazon saved me $30.+ and they shipped it free. Would buy again. Instructions were a little vague. But installation was 15 minutes. Thank you	1
I was in the middle of winterizing my 5th wheel camper when the water pump went out.  Called around my area and then checked Amazon for one.  I found it cheaper and I didn't have to drive all around town to get it.  Easy to install and it works GREAT!!!!!  My old one must have been going out for a long time because when this one is pumping you hardly hear it running.  The old one would wake up who ever was sleeping on the couch during the night.  I would give this pump 10 starts if I could.  Best $76 dollars I spent on something for my camper.	1
What great little pump,it replaced the orig. pump from 1994 (had a bad micro. sw.) just bolt right back in place. Only $40. less than the RV dealer, and quicker 2 days ship,quite,pleanty of pressure 50+, plumbing fit same. Can't beat it.	1
Although this pump is a little different on the black pump end it hooked up the same as my old (and I mean old) pump, a Shurflo 300-310-39 that came with my 1986 Citation trailer.  The pump is mounted under the bed next to the water tank and taking the mattress of the bed and two screws to gain EASY access that was the hardest part of the job replacing the pump. Undue the two water lines and two wires and install new pump.  I think the whole job took about 20 min. I think anyone could do this job depending on how your water lines hook up to the pump, mine is just a nut on each side. It also works great. Jack	1
this was a perfect replacement pump for my twenty year old camper. but with the added features of 1 is allot quieter than the old one and 2 if you run it dry it won't damage the pump. its been in service for three months and no problems yet	1
I purchased this pump to replace a SHURflo that looks the same but had a slightly different part number that wasn't easy to find. The old pump sat and dryed for many years and I couldn't get it to pump, a rebuild kit would have fixed it but the pump kit price was only a little less that the whole unit. It installed easily and quickly.	1
This is a great pump. Bought for use on a rainwater shower @ the cabin. Hook it up to the tractor battery for constant renewable power. Pressure's great, volume excellent. Recommend getting the inlet strainer available from Amazon also.	1
Our 5th wheel camper needed a new water pump. This one has great reviews so we bought it. The old SHURflo pump had three mounting holes but that wasn't a problem. I (actually my wife since I am disabled) removed the three screws that held the old pump in place and then placed the new pump where the old one was and installed the new pump with 4 screws to secure it. The wires hooked up easily since this new pump had the same wiring configuration as the old one. It has great pressure and turns on and off quickly when in use. My wife commented on how she noticed a nice improvement with this pump. We'd buy another one if needed and would recommend it to others in search of a new pump.  Thanks Amazon!	1
Works great. No nosier than the one it replaced. inlet and outlet exactly same but came with adapters just in case. Easier to mount than previous version. This is rated at 2.8gpm original was at 3.0gpm I really don't notice any difference.	1
This water pump was a great value and I was able to install it without any problems in my 2001 travel trailer.	1
I bought this to replace what I believe to be the factory installed water pump in my 1985 Holiday Rambler camper that I bought for a steal of a deal off CL.  The old Shurflo 200-210-39 was fried, and this one was the perfect fit replacement.  One wire to ground...other wire to the switched +12V wire from the water pump switch, and VOILA perfect water pressure throughout the RV.  None of the more expensive Shurflo pumps are really necessary...just buy this one!	1
I looked at different pumps from camper dealers and online.  All dealers recommended shurflo pumps only more expensive.  I bought the camper knowing the pump needed replaced but Leary of this model because this pump was already installed and bad. Come to find out that the old pump ran fine for almost 10 years. Due to the cost and reviews I purchased this model.  Didn't realize how long this model was made, has to be good right?  Right!! So far I can't be happier, it works great.  Almost as if it were hooked up to pressurized water system.  I can here the pump run but not really noisy and not any louder than new model campers.	1
10 stars!!! We had one of these in an RV that we owned for 10 years and lived in for 5, often boondocking.  It NEVER gave us an issue.  When we moved to what was at the time a remote area of AZ, we chose to haul our water rather than drill 900 ft for a well because of arsenic content in the aquifer beneath us.  I bought one of these pumps to transfer water from a 525 gallon water trailer that was also outfitted with 2-4 55 gal barrels depending on what our rain collection system needs were.  The water was transferred to a 2500 gal above ground storage tank.  It takes about 3 1/2+ hrs for the 525 gallons and another 40ish minutes for 2 ganged 55 gal barrels.  That pump has been working faithfully for almost 6 YEARS straight!  This is not a vacation home but a full time residence.  I bought a very nice Grundfos with an internal pressure tank to supply our 1900sf 3 BR home that listed for $600 and paid $475 for.  That little -422 has pumped EVERY SINGLE GALLON the Grundfos has over these years and the Grundfos just DIED yesterday!!!  I set up the Grundfos to allow for quick change out if it became necessary.  Am glad I did.  Within 20 minutes, that little 2088 took on its new role supplying the WHOLE house!  The demand switch works perfectly.  There is a little drop in pressure if more than one tap is turned on and It does pulse trying to push water through a PUR faucet filter.  That might be able to be solved with an accumulator.  We might also have to make sure the washing machine fills adequately because of the washer's electro-mechanical timer, but it WORKS.  I have silently swore for forgetting about this pump during water transfer, sometimes leaving that little diaphragm dry pumping like crazy for HOURS without a lick of water going through it.  It is virtually indestructible from an operation perspective.  I am proud of that little pump!  It is thermally protected and there are cooling fins available for them, but even in 100+ degree temps I have never had the pump quit on me.  It has also had to do duty in sub-freezing temps.  Even the rubber base has survived the AZ sun and cold extremes.  I had to replace the head assy on another one of these I use for irrigation because I dropped it and broke the output port.  The head cost almost as much as the pump, but that is OK.  It was still cheap to fix and a snap to replace.  As long as the motor will work, you will have an inexpensive, easily repairable pump that is more capable than you could ever imagine.  I am now pondering whether I should even fix the Grundfos.  That is going to cost $200-$300, if it can be fixed at all.  Am going to just let that little 2088-422-444 go until the DC motor won't operate any more.  Meanwhile, am going to look into the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SHURflo-5900-0211-5-7-Extreme-Series-Smart-Sensor-5-7-Pump/dp/B000BGM326/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SHURflo 5900-0211 5.7 Extreme Series Smart Sensor 5.7 Pump</a>&nbsp;for a bump in pressure. I now have the benefit of being able to have water flowing during the many electrical outages at minimal cost and I expect my electric bill to go down, to boot.  When that little pump dies, if it can't be fixed, it deserves to be buried with the utmost respect instead of tossed into the trash heap!	1
I needed a good 12VDC water pump to provide pressurized water to a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Camp-Chef-HWDS-Triton-Hot-Water-Heater/dp/B001J4AU2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Camp Chef HWDS Triton Hot Water Heater</a>&nbsp;in a remote camp. I run the pump off of an Optima yellow top battery connected to a solar panel. The pump provided plenty of water pressure and flow to the hot water heater. The pump runs quietly and shuts off automatically when water is not being used. To reduce cycling, I added a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SHURflo-182-200-Pre-Pressurized-Accumulator-Tank/dp/B000N9VF6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SHURflo 182-200 Pre-Pressurized Accumulator Tank</a>&nbsp;to the output side of the pump. The combination works very well.	1
Our water pump began leaking from the head (which was a big surprise!). I ordered this one and had it shipped to our next destination. It made it in time, was an easy exact replacement install, and works quieter than the original unit (which was evidently quite worn).	1
Received fast and packeged very good.  Installed in minutes works better and quieter then the one I had.,  I will shop Amazon again.	1
The product works great.  Easy to install.  Started pumping water instantly.  Cycles on and off as needed.	1
The distributor of this pump was easy to do business with and very fast... And item was as described.. Only info I would have liked to know was that the Manufacturer of this pump had changed mounting hole locations from the original design, kinda important when mounting in a very constricted space..	1
Whistle tips go whoooooooooooo whoooooooooooo look it up on YouTube lol I made some whistle tips with these and they are loud	1
If you don't know who Bub Rubb is and Lil' Sis is, you don't get the title of this, but this is a great product!!! It fits just about any exhaust and is fun and cool. It's not police are going to pull you over loud, but it's, hey look at me, I am stupid loud. I good prank to pull on your friend, unless it's me...I hurt you if you mess with my car  Sam	1
It fell out almost immediately	-1
Wouldn't fit in my friends Evo's tailpipe, so I shoved it into his Miadia's. Worked perfectly. Sounded like a belt needed to be changed, he thought his water pump went out.	1
GR8 item THX	1
Didn't work in a 4" dual exhaust. I was able to make it fit after a little effort but it didn't whistle at all. It did work in an oem 3 series dual exhaust but that wasn't the intended target. You have to fit it snuggly because on startup on the 3 series the whistle came flying out.	-1
what is this  it is not fit on any car there  is no nut ,bolt how  you  install  on tip  waste of money	-1
Classic prank if used correctly.  Make sure to bend out sides liberally before placing into exhaust pipe.  It needs to be firmly planted at the outer rim for both effect, and to let the victim easily remove upon discovery.  This is a harmless funny joke if you follow these directions.	1
Funny gag item. Works pretty good.	1
Does not work.	-1
great gag	1
It's funny and was cheap.	1
Did the trick and will fit any tailpipe that I can see. Just bend them out and stick it in there. Pressure will keep it in. It whistled when gas was applied, not a idle which made it more fun to watch (driver kept putting on brakes and gas to hear!). Kind of sounded like something from the Jetson's!	1
bubb rubb and lil sis say the whistles go WOOOOOOOOO. It's dat woot wooooottt. If you know what im talking about.	1
do not waste your money on this junk, broke so fast after one use. did not whistle whatsoever. not worth the scrap metal it weighs. horrible horrible horrible.	-1
It's NOT the loud whistle as much as the LOOK on "the victim". It was pulled on ME! I was scared there was SOMETHING mechanically wrong with my car. I shut the car off and raised the hood to see if something was wrong. I turned the key on ----- without starting the motor ----- to look at the gauges: NOTHING. I started the car up and there's that Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! noise again. I walked to the back of the car, and noticed the "foreign" item stickin' in the end of my exhaust pipe. I felt MUCH better... until I noticed a friend laughing his butt off father down the street. Joke on ME! Great gag. My tailpipe is kinda big. The device looks a bit fragile, so if you need to bend the wings back a bit, do it carefully. I'm GLAD the metal wasn't thicker. Easy to remove, is what I'm trying to get across... and K=I=N=D=E=R than the [old] raw potato gag!	1
Went on quick and easy.  I added them to my "I aim to misbehave..." Firefly decal for added impression and it looked pretty good.	1
Quality of product is good. The only glitch to me is that the coloring around the hole is green. This is okay for tempered or automotive glass. On clear glass it looks a little fakey to me.	1
These are peel & stick--black on clear except for the "hole" which is black. They say they're removeable but haven't tried that yet! $4 bucks worth of fun watching people's reactions!	1
Was what was expected.  It is a plactic container after all??  Wasn't thin and bending.  SOlid container	1
Item as described. Quality made. Fast shipping. A+A+A+	1
Having a lot a laughs with these.	1
ok	1
looks great	1
As expected	1
These worked especially well on the glass portion of the door.  Very realistic and worked much better than the Dangerous Illusions would have.	1
Very powerfyl flush action,. Saves me lots of water. If you have flown on a comercial airline. This sounds like them. And a very sturdy seat. Wont feel like its about to break wen ya sit on the lid	1
This was a excellent replacement, very easy to install.	1
good	1
Worked great installed easily	1
The person who designed the toilet seat must have a weird butt. This is the only seat I've ever seen designed like this.	-1
I bought this because the fiberglass under my old skinny toilet was cracking.  This has a nice, wide bottom, so weight is evenly distributed over a larger area.  The Bravura is large, comfortable, and attractive.	1
works perfectly.	1
works well	1
Easy install, fairly solid considering it's plastic. Haven't been anywhere with RV yet to try it out.	1
their customer support is very BAD, you must buy a 42.00 $ part to replace a 50 cent spring that is very easy to replace on this model	-1
fairly easy to install, works fine, Thanks	1
Nice upgrade from the more basic Thetford bowl that came in my Leisure Travel Free Spirit. Easy to install, too.	1
Very good performance	1
This is the best purchase I have made.  It works as described and it was very simple to install.  After installing I was surprised at how sturdy it is.  Love the front flush step.  I would recommend this to any one.	1
I've had this in my RV for over 10 years. Ordered this from Amazon as a replacement. The product is great but the packaging from the manufacturer sucks. The product is not secure in the box and when it arrived, it had scratches, gouges, and rub marks all over it. Looked like somebody took coarse sand paper to it. I sent it back and ordered an exchange. The second one arrived in worse shape than the first one. It even had crush damage which cracked the cowling. I highly recommend the Bravura, but don't order it from anywhere online. BTW: it's about $50 more expensive at an RV store, but at least it looks brand new. And it was not Amazon's fault. Clearly the manufacturer packaging was not up for being jostled in a package delivery truck.	1
Fresh	1
works great	1
Expensive	1
As described.	1
These work great for deodorizing but not perfect for breaking down the "stuff" in the tank.	1
Nothing out there compares. Will continue to buy the product.	1
Works as directed	1
Works great in the sailboat!	1
I always toss one of these in about when I think the black tank is at about half-way. The tank is already treated with the powdered Walex because I always put a packet of that in the water I put in after I do a dump.  It seems to add a little extra dissolving action.	1
I use this product all the time love it	1
THESE MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE THAN THE LIQUID STUFF	1
Good product and works well.	1
refreshing	1
Keep your waste tanks from smelling. Very easy to use. Just drop it in and your done.	1

Good	1
keeps down the odor as good as most	1
If you own an RV, you have to have chemical for the holding tank and this is the brand I like best.  We have owned RVs for 47 years and this brand has been my favorite one to pick for the past few years.  I like the toss in pack rather than the liquid because the pack doesn't splatter.  Our toilet always smells fresh and one pack is all that is needed for a large tank.	1
Works as advertised	1
easy to use	1
Works great and love the smell. Will reorder more of these.	1
All as advertised	1
A++++	1
Perfect	1
helpfull	1
Works great	1
Works great.	1
These do great to kill the smell in porta-potties	1
works good	1
Works great so far.  I drop one in every time I empty my holding tank, with a couple gallons of fresh water.	1
something you just have to have!	1
Bought for a new RV and they work great. Easier than dumping in a solution into the black tank. All I do is open the toilet and drop it in. Keeps the smells down and appear to be a great addition to the RV. Will buy more when these run out.	1
yep don't smell so they must be working	1
Another good buy for the price. Easy to use and works well.	1
Nicer odor than other previously bought brands.	1
My favorite RV black tank chemistry.  Breaks down waste quickly and very easy to use.  Simply drop it in the toilet and flush with about two gallons of water in an empty black tank.  I've tried others, but this product works the best for me.	1
Gets the stink under control	1
I have not used any of these yet but I'm sure they will work fine when I do. Didn't go camping with the new porta pot this year so  maybe in spring I'll open up the pac.	1
these work well	1
The best for the black tank on my Rv.	1
works pretty good	1
Great RV toilet refresher.	1
Worked great.	1
Excellent	1
They work very well to eliminate the odor for a long time.	1
Seems to work as expected.  No smells from our gray water tank.	1
works great, I fill up the toilet with addition water by just holding down the camper toilets pedal slightly allowing the toilet to fill with water, then I drop a packet of this in to the toilet water, wait a few minutes as the packet starts to dissolve and sink to the bottom of the toilet, then flush the toilet completely. That's its.	1
Works as it should	1
Keeps the odors down in the porta potti, does exactly what it's supposed to do	1
A must for anyone with a RV or a trailer or a boat that has a holding tank can definitely tell the difference if you don't use it	1
Easy to use. Pre measured! So far no stink! Can't complain	1
Without diving in there to watch it work, I choose to believe it does.	1
It needs to be placed in liquid in order to start the chemical breakdown process, and then eliminates most of the smell.  Great for water containing port-a-potties, not so much so for portable camp toilets that use bags to catch feces, but not urine.	1
Just drop it in no fuss no mess	1
Ordered these and the bio ones. I want a stronger fresh smell.	1
These are strong enough to mask odors for us, we have a 45gal black tank and I drop one of these in with 5gal or so in it and it lasts until we empty the tanks.  I always run a few gallons of fresh in the black tanks after I drain em, then toss one of these in for good measure.  Works as described, would recommend	1
been using these for years good price	1
Does the job	1
Purchased these because our camper toilet is stinky. These are easy to use and relatively cost effective. The bag will last us quite some time.	1
easy to use, handy	1
A MUST HAVE FOR RV	1
good product.	1
Works great!	1
Must have if you use you camper's bathroom	1
works great	1
works good	1
easy to use, not as messy as the powder products. works perfectly	1
Great	1
Works well	1
I'm new to camping so figuring out what needs to be used with what is a steep learning curve. I had 2 store employees and several other campers tell me that the "PORTA-PAK" is a good product. There are others out there that work just as well but this one is in easily dissolving packs that you just throw in. I've only dumped my tanks 4 times since I've purchased my trailer. I've used this since I got it and have ZERO smells during normal operation. When dumping It will treat ALL 30 gallons to a bright Purple color and I've seen less solid matter. I like these. They're convenient and come in a small re-sealable bag.	1
We make sure to put a healthy amount of water in our holding tank and drop one of these in after dumping and flushing. We've never had an issue, when using this product. We might be looking for trouble, but we don't even have issues despite using regular bathroom tissue. This stuff just works.	1
Works very very very well. I did not smell any chemicals or *foul* odor at all while camping until I drained my tanks. This couldn't be any simpler to use. Drop one in the toilet (for black tank) and one in the bathroom sink (for the grey). Flush the toilet and run the water in the bathroom sink for a second until it dissolves. Much less messy than the liquid chemicals. You get what you pay for. I'd rather not have chemicals spilled all over my bathroom after a bumpy ride. Plus these are lighter as they only contain the chemicals and not the water. 5 Stars!	1
Good product, Does the job as needed.	1
smell good and come in different scents	1
Two weekend trips down and no problems. We actually failed to properly flush our black tank after our first trip just because we are newbies to a travel trailer. We realized this and added more water to the holding tank when we got home and put one of these deodorizers in. We knew were camping again in just a couple of weeks so we just planned to dump and flush before setting up at our next site. No smells or issues for those two weeks while it was parked in the yard. When we got to the site on the next trip we properly dumped and flushed. Using our clear hose fitting we could see everything had been dissolved and after running our flush system the water ran clear.	1
so far it is good	1
Helpful	1
Just don't touch them with wet fingers LOL	1
works great in camper holding tanks	1
Great product !!  I would highly recommend!  Lavender scent when emptying the portable toilet.	1
A little more pricey than Walmart, but not much. They do make it smell good.	1
does the job!!! ok price  a this is great b this is awe some c this is quality d this is out standing e this is	1
I USE IT EVERY WEEKI HAVE HAD NO ISSUES	1
Have used these before and have been very satisfied with the product, bought them through Amazon due to a better price, ;)	1
Works great	1
As expected.	1
OK	1
Just what I order to keep our rv septic tank smellin good. If that possible.	1
These things really help keeping our tank from smelling.  Love it	1
These work perfect.  Easier and cleaner than the liquid.	1

A little smelly; I'll try a differnt "flavor" next time.	1
works great	1
A must have!	1

Keeps the poopoo tank smelling just fine.	1
Seems to be working for me	1
good buy	1
Always buy it. No complaints.	1
These work well in our black Tank. Usually one does the trick after cleaning the tank.	1
I like it it really keeps the odor down but you probably need 2 per 40 gallon black water especially in the hot summer months	1
These worked so well!  They were easy to store in our camper, kept the bathroom smelling fresh, and our septic tank dumped easily.  I am definitely ordering these again for the upcoming camping season.	1
Does as advertised, great deodorizer.	1
As expected	1
We're do I put the blue bag ?? On the clean water is ,or where the wastes goes ?? Please some let me know ?	1
gets the stink out.	1
It works!	1
Works well but not to leave for long period. Best to dump tank once a week but I was not able to do that at the time. Smells great, but have to be very careful since this stuff will stain anything. I put in a Gatorade bottle to dissolve, shake, then pour into toilet while its flushing. Don't let it sit!	1
so much more convenient that the liquid	1
Smell be gone lol	1
Sure stops the odor good product	1
They work super and the pottie smell is about nonexistent!	1
THEY WORK KEEPS THE ORDERS AT BAY IN MY RV!	1

Works really well.  Haven't noticed any odors so it must be doing  the job.	1
Great product, Fast shipping.	1
good stuff	1
Smells good and seems to eat the poop up.	1
This stuff really works. Turns everything into an easy to dump liquid.	1
Pleasant smell. works as advertised	1

Love this!	1
Easy to use. Clean.	1

Works well.  No odor.  Just drop and forget.  It will do the rest as advertised.	1
Easy to use packs are mess free.  They work well.  We had no odor in the camper all week, plus the additional week before I had time to dump.  I'll buy more when I use these up...	1
We use in our 5th wheel camper.  Works and easy to use.	1
perfect	1
works as advertised	1
A very good product that does its job!	1
Do what they're supposed to	1

Best stuff ever!!	1
Works as intended and advertised.  Great price.	1
beats smelling the holding tank	1
Easy to use.	1
Work well	1
thanks	1
good	1
An act of Congress can't eliminate all the smell, but these work pretty good. I found that leaving one in the tank with about a gallon of water in between trips is a real advantage.	1
Good product.	1
Does the job.	1
No more stinky camper after transport.	1
We have been using this product for over 10 years now. We have never had a smelly black water tank. I do one thing different. I per mix it.  I have had to take my black water dump valve apart 4 times, due to the plastic film not completely dissolving and getting stuck in the valve when closing it.  So it naturally dripped into my compartment.  I solved that by: Taking  pail of water ( roughly 5 gallons, water )  Opening a package and pouring the powder into the pail of water.  Then I mix it up with a stick and  pour into the black water tank. Works Great - This Way and no more leaking dump valve.	1
Works as advertised in black holding tank in camper.	1
the best	1
Works great....	1
Breaks down waste well, however does not deodorize.	-1
This chemical does not work. I have used the liquid that contains formaldehyde, Aqua Chem by Thetford, it works great and lasts about a week or more.  Porta-Pak is a crystal that disolves when placed in water. It worked for about 3 days then you could smell the toilet smell. You seasoned campers know what that is. I was ok with it but my wife chirped "when are you going to change the toilet?" Also we started getting a few small black flies.	-1
Product is as described.	1
Great price!	1
Yep, it makes the crapper clean and smell better.  Great!	1
It appears to work great, no problems since using it	1
Easy to use and no odors in my RV	1
Good value	1
Works great - even in 110 F heat in the Anza-Borrego Desert.  For years I've used the orange stuff, but after having odor problems - especially in hot weather while camping in the desert - I decided to give these Porta-Paks a try. They work so much better. There is NO ODOR - even in the scorching heat of the desert. And neither does this make my black tank stick like a port-a-potty either. With this treatment, I can even go 3 or 4 camping trips without emptying my black tank due to excessive odors (I have a large black tank and have yet to actually fill it).	1
Very good for camping	1
No stink, helps to get rid of the paper and the "solids". We have used multiple packs of these and keep coming back to these. Pretty much the go to for an RV black tank.	1
These work, and they work well. Plain and simple. My wife and I just moved into a 5th wheel full time. Stepping on that toilet pedal and opening that hole above the black water tank is no longer a concern. It was terrifying before we got these. They do an amazing job at eliminating the odor. As far as breaking waste and paper down, it seems like it's doing the job as well.  These work like magic, and that's worth 5-stars to me.	1
Great product	1
Turns the poop blue...but that's about it. The "natural" foul sewage smell is made even more disgusting.  Like applying Chanel #5 to a corpse decomposing in a hot closed room.  I even tried using double the dose but in a couple of days, I had to run for cover.  Horrible.  One thing for sure...it certainly easy and clean to use. But it should be green instead of blue...because that would match the money you are throwing away. The only REAL remedy is to DUMP OFTEN and flush out your tank and hose thoroughly. NOTHING can conquer a foul holding tank!	-1
So far doing the job for the black tank.	1
Messy to use	-1
What's to say, it did as it was supposed to do and made visiting the out house portable toilet in the privacy tent less nose offending.	1
Lasts thru a full black water tank, keeping the odor out.	1
great working	1
Doesn't just cut the odor but knocks it out completely.	1
Great	1
Seems to work well.	1
This stuff works wonders!  I had been using Camco deodorizer in our camper and when we would briefly flush it would stink up the camper!  I read the reviews for this product and ordered it.  NO SMELL!  LITERALLY NO SMELL!  I will never be without it!	1
Works great.	1
works great	1

GREAT PRODUCT ..Love it! Seems to be better than most other brands.	1
I use this in conjunction with the BIO PAK....this does a great job of deodorizing!	1
This stuff works!	1
Kept the RV smelling good :)	1
Works good and smells great	1
Love the new container. Much easier to store in the under compartments and takes up a lot less room.	1
It just works!  What more can you say for a product like this?  It does the job it was meant to do.	1
My poo don't stink!!  (anymore)	1
Works great to keep the smell down.	1
Works great in our rv black tank.	1

Great Product and great deal!	1
Great product.	1
Thank you for this product! Memorial day camping with hot dogs and chili put this product to the test and WOW did this work well.	1
works	1
Works	1
Great	1
Worked as described.	1
Tastes horrible.  Smells good though.	1
Work good.	1
I will never use this again. I put this in the tank (1) and the next day I had a horrible odors. So I though maybe I did not add enough so I added one more. What a mistake it just made it worse. So I drained and flushed the tank till it ran clean and went back to Rid-x for RVS.	-1
The best on the market.	1
works	1
Great	1
Really helps out during a crappy situation..... HAH..... :) Delivered onetime. Product as described.	1
These work great keeping your rv toilet smelling good and helps dissolve hard waste in your tank. Easy to use and no mess.	1
Worked as needed	1
If you RV you use these. Watch for the right price.	1
Worked as described. Just drop in black water tank and let it do it's job.	1
Smells good.  Tossed one into my tank.  Should be ok.	1
Bought a used travel trailer that needed to have holding tanks emptied.  This was my first priority after getting it put on the side of my house.  This is great stuff, and I will be ordering more as time goes by.	1
Ok	1
good product	1
Works fine and the wee packs are handy.	1
Living in a camper full time I have tried several different black tank treatments and all of the Walex paks I've tried work the best over other similar products. Since I've been using these I have gotten rid of all horrible smells coming from the tank and I have never had a problem with a clog since using this. They couldn't be more convenient either, just drop one of the pods in the tank and forget about it till next emptying. Great product!	1
This RV blackwater holding tank deodorant works well and is very easy to use. Many RV'ers complain about tank odors (often while driving); I have eliminated that problem by putting a "weather vane" style fume extractor hood on the blackwater tank vent pipe and always tossing one of these deodorant packets into the tank right after a tank dump. (Be sure you reseal the foil package when you get a packet out of the pouch.) One packet lasts me two weeks (which is 50 gallons of black water accumulated from two people for two weeks). Considering what gasoline costs, the cost of using deodorant packets is very minor yet it yields a much nicer RV experience.	1
It really works!	1
It's tank cleaner/deodorizer.  It works.	1
Great product, used it for a few short weekend trips and I had zero odor after 3 days of use. seemed to do a great job with odor, and breaking down solids. Great price and super easy to use, I will be buying again when necessary.	1
Seems to work fine. Pleasant odor but I am not going to look into the tank to see how it is working.	1
Works very well	1
a must for camping	1
I have used these several times. Good product.	1
Used this for my port a potty when I went camping. I love these tabs and will be buying them again. I have tried other products but this is my favorite so far. It keeps the port a potty from smelling really bad	1
Combining one of these and one Bio-Pak into the toilet on every cleanup handled our RV toilet great!	1
Best odor control I've ever used.	1
Great for the money, Would buy again	1
Good product, use this may times.	1
good to have	1
Works great and as specified a must have for your RV black water tank.	1
Makes the RV toilet not stink.  THANKS!!!  I just fill the toilet with water, drop this in the toilet, then flush away for about 15 seconds.  Haven't had any smells.	1
perfect for fifth wheel neat and convenient	1
This is a great product for you RV septic system, only use one each time I dump and it does a good job dissolving the waist...	1
We use these with every black tank flush.  Works as you would expect.	1
It works	1
Porta-Pak works	1
5*	1
New product, works	1
workgreat and not to expensive.	1
This is by far the best I have ever used.	1
Haven't smelled poop so I guess it works.	1
Does the job as described.	1
Kills odor and very easy to use.	1
Keeps the funk down. Dump your tank, add a little clean water and flush the PAK. driving home will slosh the contents in tank and keep everything fresh.	1
Very economical and they work very well.	1
Love the drop ins, easy clean and affective. I try to buy in bulk whenever I can as these and all competitors to these get expensive if you happen to use your RV a lot; and we do! I do not notice any particular difference with this brand to other popular brands - perhaps that's a good thing considering, they do the job.	1
Very strong smell	1
Works well. Looks as it does in the picture. Came as described.	1
Easy to use, no odor	1
Bought these because I though they would be easier to deal with over the little bottles of liquid, but they don't work nearly as well as the liquid does. Back to the little bottles!	-1
Must have for RV	1
These work awesome, no more pooper stank	1
GREAT	1
they keep the smell down	1
Great!	1
Does what it says	1
Get's the job done.	1
Nice smell. Dissolves nicely. I don't know if it help to breakin up debris in tank but definitely makes any odor go away for week at least. Maybe longer but I empty weekly at campsite so not sure length of time it lasts.	1
seems to be a good packaged product, will be using this stuff in the future in our waste system	1
Camper must have. I use them weekly and every time I empty the tank, as well as the night before I am going to empty the tank. Also good if you are going to be away for a few days. Put a little water in toilet and one of these. It will keep it fresh and free from hard water stains.	1
great price	1
This RV black water holding tank chemical may be the best non-formaldehyde product on the weather.  Holds up well even in hot weather.  Great value for the money.	1
Great stuff and really easy to use!	1
Works Great For Me!  I use them in a basement sump pump reservoir.	1
like it	1
Nice Pack	1
I have used before, works good.	1
Fantastic!	1
easy to use.. no messy liquids!  Worked perfectly!  no odors!	1
fine	1
good	1
I have always used liquid chemicals from Thetford.  Based on the reviews, I have tried this product a few times now.  My holding tank is 40gal and it really takes two packs to properly deodorize the tank.  Also, the zipper bag is very difficult to open.  I plan on switching back to the liquid product when this item is used up.	-1
Great	1
We travel quite a bit in our Airstream trailer.  I always used a liquid deodorizer in both the gray water and black water tanks.  Well, we ran out and didn't use any at all and WOW, was that a mistake!  I thought we'd flushed the tank out the last time we used it, but the odor seeping into the bathroom was not nice.  I ordered a pack of these individual deodorizer tablets and used them on the next outing.  What a difference!  Easy to use, no dripping, splashing of the bottle. Just toss it in the toilet and flush it down. There's absolutely no smell now and even though you don't put these in the gray water tank, I don't have a smell there, either.  I guess that tank was not the cuprit.	1
Great product, keeps odors completely gone, easy to use.	1
GOOD	1
We have a travel trailer on a lake lot.  Sometimes we are down every weekend, other times once a month.  Part of our shut down routine is to flush one of these down the toilet into the holding tank.  It makes a big difference when we come back to a trailer that has been shut up for a week or two.  My wife is very sensitive to odors and this meets her approval.	1
Good	1
Keeps the smell down.	1
Great product, I use this for a porta potty that is installed at our community swimming pool and this works very well at keeping odors down between pumpings.	1
Good Product.	1
Works great.	1
They don't work very good. The gray water treatment works better.	-1
Quick, easy, and does the job.	1
Still not as good as original product !	1
these work great, no odor at all	1
I personally think this stuff is the best way to go using your black water tank for a few days before emptying it	1
east to use and works the best	1
arrived on time, these are the easiest way to keep your rv holding tank fresh, no messy liquids to deal with just drop a tab in the pot and your done	1
we've been using these a couple weeks now; pleasant smell ; no bad odors	1
Convenient packaging!	1
I bought these to put in my RV toilet tank, and they smell HORRIBLE.  You know that nasty chemical stench that hits you as soon as you walk into a porta-potty on a hot day?  That's what your RV will smell like.  Even with the bathroom door closed and the fan on, I can still smell them on the other side of our 30-foot RV.  To make matters worse, when I went to flush the tank after a couple days, the Porta-Pak hadn't done anything to break down the solids.  Even though we use special RV/Marine toilet paper, we had an awful time draining the tank.  The next day, (after adding another stench ridden Porta-Pak) the toilet completely backed up and we ended up having to use a stick to clear the clog.  -Horrible, Useless, SMELLY, Awful.	-1
easy to use and works !!!	1
I have been using this for couple years and it works very well.  No odor problems and seems dissolve the one ply rv toilet paper well.	1
I've been using this in our travel trailer for a year and a half now, no bad smells, seems to be breaking down TP fine, no clogs.	1
My new favorite. I am an avid RVer and this works like a charm and has a nice fresh odor. Seems to work longer than some of the other brands I have tried.	1
By far the best holding tank additive I have used. Easy to use and has been effective even in extreme heat. Have ordered from Amazon before and will continue.	1
It definitely helps the smell works great will buy more!	1
Meets the need	1
they work good for holding tanks in an RV	1
great	1
This stuff does the job it says it does.  Have used for about 4 years.	1
Quick and easy. Works well to clean sensors.	1
Great product works fine.  Now I am ready to roll my motor home.	1
My second time buying these so you could say I'm a repeat customer.  Here's the good-really easy to use, reminds me of the laundry detergent packs.  I fill up the bowl, drop it in and let the water turn a deep blue before flushing.  For 2-3 days without dumping, they seem to work pretty good.  After that, you should probably add a second one. When dumping, you'll notice that it really does a good job in breaking up waste.  Here's a hint, make sure you have a clear sewer hose connector so you can see what is really working.	1
They work great	1
Works good! Easy to use in my boat.	1
as expected. Happy with purchase	1
Poop de do...Hey, I don't smell anything	1
The best out there.	1
Smells sooo much better.	1
May need to order more. Great product	1
These blue pack work awesome especially if you use double, you can go several weeks and all solids will be broken down. Use other brands but found blue pack to be the best	1
I'm not kidding! This stuff does an amazing job controlling holding tank odors in our RV. Highly recommended!	1
Have not used it yet, but I am sure they will be good	1
While camping I treated the black tank in my second bathroom. However the valve was open on the tank for four days. The outer cap prevented a leak. However on the final day as I twisted the cap open I was met by blue water. The product neutralized any off chance of waste odor and made the recovery all the more bearable. Will buy again	1
Works well and smells nice!	1
:)	1
Works as it suppose to. Great delivery time.	1
Fair price for a good product.	1
Smells so. Nice	1
Really helps.	1
so far so good.  purchased for my camper and they seem to help.	1
Great product, does just what is says for my RV septic system.	1
Uhhh what can I say, I drop it in & s*** don't stink	1
Good product, works as well or better than other higher priced products. I recommend this product.	1
Definitely needed to keep your RV holding tank smelling fresh.	1
does the job	1
Very intense smell. Keeps the nasty fumes at bay, but you can over do it. Use only one in the winter and don't put it in until you plan on filling the tank. Pure stuff in a little clean water on the bottom of the tank will release the pleasant vapors in such intensity, that you'll think you died and went to your crazy aunt's house who always wore too much perfume.	1
i  like it	1
Anything that helps with getting rid of poop is good right?  That is what this does and it save me a trip to CampingWorld.	1
Works, a must have	1
Although for the most part they have worked great, I have noticed that a couple times they did not fully dissolve and I see the partial packet come out at the dump. Haven't had any odor issues yet though.	1
No stink=5 stars Also doesn't freeze bust and the leak all over my camper cabinet in the winter.	1
For the wife's sanity !	1
Works great, does what it says	1
Used it all summer with no smell. Ran out and the smell came back, purchased again.	1
Easy to store and use	1
As advertised.	1
My 5th smells always clean	1
We always keep (and use) these in our RV.......easy to use, no messy liquid to spill or stain.  These do the "job" (pun intended)	1
Works well for us	1
Great	1
Does just as promised	1
Works great in my RV 36 gallon tank and smells good too	1
Works great	1
aaa	1
I'm picky about the black water tanks and keeping smell away. Drop these in at the beginning of every weekend, no odors.	1
Worked OK, but I switched to the Green Pig equivalent product to save money. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093JT23K/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7	1
these are pretty handy you just toss em in the toilet they dissolve on their own, they make disgusting thing smell a little bit better.	1
nice idea	1
Simple and works great.  Not good for keeping tank sensors clean however.	1
Have used this product many times and plan to continue to use it in the future. You are supposed to just toss them in the toilet but I like to ad some to the grey water tank as well. I Flush my tanks and then get one of these blue bags out. I bust it a little on one end and put about 1/4 of it in the sink to help cut down on the Grey Water smell and then toss the rest of the bag into the toilet and your good to go(no pun intended).	1
Works great, easy to use.	1
Very good product, totally happy with it!	1
This product works very well. Make sure to add a bit of water on top of it; and if you have room in your black water tank add a few gallons of water to it by running the toilet just before you dump it.	1
I have been using this product for about two years now and have not had any bad smell. It has always been priced right.	1
Great price for a product that does what it's designed to do.	1
works great	1
Work great, when the temps are hot outside we like to use one of the Blue and one of the Green Walex tabs.  They seem to work well together to break down waste and eliminate odors.  Been using these products for several years and would not switch.	1
These work great! I've tried other kinds of packets, but these will eliminate odors better than any other. Our typical usage is about 4 days, so I can't speak to anything longer than that, but excellent results for the 4 days.	1
Competes very well with other tank treatment solutions and is less expensive.	1
Great product for the price	1
wife likes it	1
Great problem solver	1
Great and easy to use	1
We have used several brands, this one works - keeps things smelling fresh, easy to use and seems to facilitate flow when at the dump station.	1
Fantastic product!  Try it you'll love it!	1
works, and smells great	1
works well	1
Easy to use and really did a good job eliminating holding tank odors. I've tried many different options and I'll stay with this one. Drop a packet or two into the tank and forget about it!	1
What can you say about odor control? It works or not. This works.  We use it in our RV and the first trip out no odor!	1
These packets do an amazing job at keeping my RV tanks from stinking on hot days.  Best I have tried  Highly Recommended	1
I have been using the liquid blue stuff for 4 years and never had a problem until trying these blue packets. Now I had to call out a pluber because the toilet paper was not breaking down. Don't waste your money on this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!! And by the way amazon won;t let you return it either!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Highly recommended.  Just make sure it has ample water to get started (1 gallon minimum).  Used in warm and cooler weather without issue.  *Update:  4/2014: after camping an entire season with these, I found that they didn't work very well.  Tissue and waste didn't seem to break down very well, and it most certainly doesn't mask odors very well.  I even tried using 2 packets instead of one (for a 30 gallon tank); no difference aside from things being very blue!  I think I'm going to try the "tried and true" Happy Campers  Organic treatment next.	-1
I bought the green Bio pack before, and it's good stuff.  This product has no smell, it looks blue, as if in chem lab.  And it's not "green".  Spend couple of bucks more and get a pleasantly smelling green bio pack, it's worth the extra, and good for the planet.	-1
You must purchase fit kits for specific cars to make these feet fit.  Be very careful of Thule Fit Kits. At least one of them does not fit. I bought the 2171 fit kit for my 2006 Honda Civic. It does NOT fit! Thule will not stand behind their products and let me return the kit. I have another Honda and the kit for that one fits great. So, try and find a review of the specific kit you want to buy before you buy it. Do NOT buy the 2171 kit expecting it to fit a 2006 Honda Civic. IT DOES NOT FIT.	-1
The Thule 400 feet are great if you can find a fit kit that works.  But be very careful of Thule Fit Kits. At least one of them does not fit. I bought the 2171 fit kit for my 2006 Honda Civic.

I went out to place these on and found they don't fit the OE mirrors I have. They are for a 90 Dodge W-250 and do not work. Your better off to buy this at a local store to make sure it fits. They are worthless as they are to me.	-1
will not a 1995 as stated on box!	-1
They just make do, but again you get what you pay for. And I except that.	-1
Returned them because they look bulky.	-1
Bought for 2004 F150 Heritage. The box says they are for my truck as did the Amazon part checker. I believe it is for another mirror style (image with red mirror). My truck has a mirror like the first image (all black mirror).  Not even close on fit.   the adjustment knob is either about an inch too short or the spacer bar is way too thin.   do not fit any where near flush with the window.   the original mirror does not fit neatly aligned with the cut out in the towing mirror  Looks to me like CIPA designed a universal fit extended mirror, adds a mounting kit, and now it is a custom fit.  Returned for refund.	-1
I purchased these mirrors to use on my 2003 f150.  They do not fit as they are much too large. Product quality seems fine but they do not fit my truck like advertised.	-1
I have a 1998 Ford F150 and the web site said it would fit but the opening to slip these over my existing stock mirrors was much too large.	-1
don't bother getting bulbs online. one of the two did not work recommend picking these up locally.	-1
Mirror seal leaked and water rusted the inside causing the mirror to separated.  The mounting screw rusted in place after 1 year and I have to grind them out to remove the mirror.	-1
I replaced my Aqua Magic IV with an Aqua Magic V to get the higher profile.  After 2 months, the water module quit passing fresh flush water as if it was not opening.  My first call to Thetford resulted in them telling me my fresh water had debris in it causing the blockage.  I use fresh filtered water in my fresh water tank, so that is not the case.  On my second call to them, the CS rep tried to tell me my drain to the black water tank was blocked.  She obviously had never seen an RV toilet in action.  On my third call, the CS rep immediately told me the part # I needed and sent one on its way.  I replaced the module (very simple procedure - 1 screw) and hooked everything back up.  First try, a little water trickled out, then it stopped completely.  I examined the module I just removed and found it could be cleared but apparently had a misshapen check valve ball that would stop the water flow.  Thetford is sending yet another water module with the hopes that "third time's a charm".  I asked if they made heavy duty models & they said they did not, they just weren't as good as the old ones.  I have a 3 year warranty, so I guess I'll be changing modules until they get it right or I get tired of removing the toilet and replace it with one from a manufacturer that knows how to make them.  This is very disappointing because I have had Thetford toilets in 3 different RV's 2 of which I put in and I have been extremely happy with them until the Aqua Magic V crept into my posession.	-1
Not enough brilliant	-1
The unit was fine until the mirror dropped off while driving down the road after a couple of weeks.  The plastic that the mirror was mounted to just snapped.  This happened twice.  I do not recommend this unit.	-1
Began leaking water through the shutoff valve the second time I used it. Getting warranty after providing a proof of purchase, is a series of unnecessary Q&A .......total waste of time.	-1
Easy to install.  That's about all the good I have to say about it.  I suspect this design was intended for S.E. Asia, or some such demographic, where the typical user is small.  Very small.  And short, if you know what I mean.  Standing up it is ok.  Sitting down, not so much.  The jet of water that scours the bowl spills over the front of the bowl and sprays out even with the seat down and lid closed.  It is flimsy.  Thin.  Flexible.  Not comfortable to sit on as it feels wobbly and prone to collapse at any moment.  This opinion from a woman weighing 100 pounds. (My roomy). It feels cheap and poorly made and I don't expect it to last.	-1
Has a Crack in the assembly at the top of the toilet.  Water shooting everywhere.  Only 9mos old. Was replaced and the newest one has done the same thing.	-1
Seat and bowl size is OK midgets or children 10 and under. The bowl water jet will wet ones bottom portions if the bowl is flushed while sitting on it. Ordered this based on price and description. Very lightweight construction. Buy the Bravura models instead - low or high.	-1
Original review: Bought this unit to replace the identical unit in my Airstream trailer.  Perfect fit and easy install.  These are quality, well made RV toilets. I just didn't want to mess with replacing/repairing the water inlet/valve system on my old one and it was easier to replace the whole thing and be done with it and save time. Someone else might choose to repair at a lesser expense, but when I removed the old one and got a good look at the underside I was glad I chose to replace. Got 9 years out of the old one before it started leaking at the valve mechanism so can't complain.  Update:  Two years into this unit it started leaking from the same water valve that the old one leaked from.  Of course it began leaking during a campout.  We awoke to a trailer floor covered with water.  When it works without leaking it's a good unit.  But apparently Thetford has a history of leak problems with this unit and I am surprised they haven't found a fix for it yet and continue to put this unit on the market. I won't be purchasing this again and even though the part kit is only $20 I still have warranty time left on this unit and hope Thetford will provide the water valve replacement parts. If so I'll give it a try.  If not, or if it fails again, I'll be switching to Dometic.	-1
Didn't work on my sensors. Filled the tank with hot water straight from my hot water heater in the house. Drove around for 30 min., then let it sit for 24 hrs. Drove around again for 30 min. Emptied the tank and it read 2/3ed full. One star for fast shipping. Wasted money!	-1
I had high hopes for this product based on other reviews. I had 2 gunked-up sensors in my gray tank. I used this product following the directions to the letter. When I dumped the gray tank the sensors where still stuck. Then I tried a $2.80 bottle of PineSol which worked great (all sensors now working again) and it smelled great.	-1
Very cheaply made. The hollow inside with the valve about 9 inches above the tank entrance looks like a major hygene problem in the making.	-1
Did not seem to really work	-1
Left it in for over a week drove around with it emptied the tank and it still showed 1/3 had to send down a high pressure washer to get it clean	-1
After 16 months the water module is leaking, just glad we were in the RV when it happened. Seems to be a common complaint with this water module assembly I will see if Thetford will send me a repacement part. The single foot peddle is very finicky when trying to add water witthout the toilet actually flushing, liked the two pedal design better. This was not a good purchase. Unfortunately the warranty period is one year so I'm out of luck.	-1
This toilet is very much not worth it. The toilet seat is suitable for a child, that's about it. I am 5'8, 160 lbs and I could not fit on this toilet.  Product arrived sooner than expected and also returned as soon as received. Purchased as a replacement of a dometic toilet and this is in now a suitable replacement.  order for kids camper otherwise beware.	-1
Thetford customer service gave me the wrong part number and had to return at my own expense.  The original customer service woman was abrupt and actually rude.  The second one was much nicer, helpful, and she steered me to the right part.  My dissatisfaction has more to do with Thetford CS than the product itself.	-1
blew apart first try	-1
Be absolutely sure this is the EXACT part for your EXACT toilet. I have changed valves on three Thetford Aqua Magic IV toilets so I'm far from a pro but not a novice either.  This valve looked nor fit nothing like the ones I have changed. And it didn't fit on my trailer toilet.  Instead of risking 300 miles of driving and finding out this doesn't fit, pull your old one and take it to Camping World or some other brick and mortar store who can match it up with the right replacement part.  It's been over 2 months since I bought this so I doubt a return can be requested. I bought it when I diagnosed the leak and delayed installation until I had help (I had surgery and am not supposed to get into the positions necessary for this repair).  So now I'm stuck with an overly expensive toilet seal (the only piece I can use) and a bag of frustration.	-1
This didn't fit my toilet in a 2014 coleman 16ft bunkhouse camper. I had to get the entire toilet.	-1
Ordered these for my Honda Accord. They don;t seat on the OEM wheel (in spite of being advertised for the Accord). Poor chrome quality and the fact that they don't fit make them expensive garbage.	-1
The edges weren't deep enough to hold the wheels on they were squared off so they wouldn't seat properly.  I used the locking lug nuts, but had to throw the others away, they were useless as well as dangerous	-1
guess I didn't read the fint print...cuz they don't fit or work on a 80 vette	-1
Don't fit!	-1
Description said it was a fit for the Chrysler 300. The lug nuts did not seat properly in the stock rims. It looked way to unsafe to use so i used one lock on each rim and threw away the brand new lug nuts. Wasted money on this set.	-1
But I received another set frm AMAZON the NEXT DAY and that was on a Saturday.  The other sets works great and no one has stolen my mags ... I recommend it if you want to keep your mags YOURS!!	-1
This is wrong not for alloy rims all Montaros have alloy not steel, i want correct product for vehicle not item that will cause injury and or death you scammers...........!!!!!!	-1
Does not fit with LONG TUBE HEADERS! Careful. They sure look badass would have loved to have seen them on my engine.	-1
I ordered this in June of 2010, They arrived and I forgot all about them till a few days ago.  I decide to install them, little do I know that these are wayyy to short and will NOT work for a 2005 Escalade.  Of course my return window is expired so im stuff with useless plug wires.	-1
Did not fit 6.0 too short reviews said it would	-1
Read other reviews that stated they were too short, but did not listen.  These wires are at least 2 inches too short to be used with my 2004 LS motor.  One review stated the spark plug boot would bend to fit... well that ain't so.  I have found Packard-wired, with steel noise suppression boots, (like the OE), from United Motor Products, via RockAuto.  American-made.  These MSD's are pretty, and they give you a free decal, but the UMP parts work.	-1
These wires said they fit my 6.8 Liter Vortex V8, but they were at a minimum, a full Inch too short. So disappointed! Was looking forward to getting some performance from these. Then there was the hassle of the return. They didn't even have a different size to offer!	-1
wrong ones	-1
Don't order MSD 32819 for a 2005 Tahoe 5.3L or 2006 2500HD 6.0L as recommended by Amazon, they are way to short. I also called MSD's tech department myself before ordering set 32818 based on other reviews on Amazon they told me this set would work as noted on Amazon, NOT true.  After doing a lot of research I recorded MSD wire set 32829, this set is the same length as the OEM set & works great.  MSD part 32829, Great fit & function on my 2006 2500HD 6.0L & 2005 Tahoe 5.3L.	-1
Edit:: Within less than two weeks of installing these, I started having the well-documented "Service Charging System" RFI/EMI problem that has been linked to the use of 'low-resistance' wires due to their ability to induce an aberrant current in the wiring for the alternator, confusing the computer and causing problems.  The low-resistance is misleading and unnecessary for most applications, and any claim of a performance gain is a misrepresentation, these wires will not outperform the factory wires in terms of spark delivery, but may be more tolerant of very high underhood temperatures.  Initial review for reference: Noticeable improvement in exterior quality over aged factory GM wires.  Used these on an unmodified 2006 Corvette LS2 at 75k miles, paired with new Denso IT16TT plugs. After 10 years, the original wires were working fine but were past their prime, even with proper tools I was unable to remove them from the factory spark plugs without damaging the wires because corrosion had formed at the connection point. The silicon construction of the MSD wires allows you to eliminate the factory heat shields.  They are the correct length for the Corvette LS1, LS2, LS3, LS6, and LS7, but it is best to bend the spark plug boot by 45 degrees at the engineered bend point; The easiest way to do so is to press the spark plug boot all the way onto the spark plug, then with the other end of the wire pointed toward its corresponding ignition coil, gently press upward on the spark plug boot. The boot will easily bend to a 45 degree angle with very little effort.  You will feel an end point as you are bending the boot, do not force it to bend beyond that point.	-1
As noted by another customer, this did not fit my 2003 Cadillac Escalade AWD 6.0L. Way too short. Amazon states this part is compatible with my vehicle, but it is not. They fit my Corvette just fine.	-1
Probably great for LS1 and LS6 applications but they simply don't fit the LS2. MSD advertises these straight ends as 'flexible' but they have enough tension to pop themselves off on LS2 applications. I ended up re-selling them, buying the MSD truck wires and shortening them at the coil end using MSD crimpers to half way between the length of car and truck wires.  I've loved every other MSD product I've owned and race on their stuff but these simply don't fit. MSD has been informed of this and replied publicly on forums; they refuse to update the design despite numerous threads calling out the issue.	-1
I have the 2006 GMC Yukon XL with 5.3L engine.  The MSD site lists the correct part number as Part No. 32829 or 32823, which are the red and black wire version of the exact same cable. This also shows up as the correct part for the 5.3L application on the Amazon site. However the cables proved to be too long  to the point of geting tangled up in the stearing mechenism. I called MSD to complain and the tech told me that I needed these part number 32813 cables, however the Amazon fit checker states that these will not fit my application.  I purchased this shorter 32813 set on the technician's recommendation and they fit, but were quite tight. It would be good if they were all a half inch longer for this application anyway.  The plug wires as far as plug wires go are top rate. The stars were dropped due to application and fit ambiguity.	-1
Does not fit at all a2015 Range Rover supercharged	-1
Mine looked great for about 2 weeks then I noticed mine started to rust while my car just sat in my garage..I have since hit them with a rust remover and painted them black sadly.	-1
I bought these because the Amazon website said they fit my car. In all fairness to Amazon, that website also states: "The information provided is ONLY a guide. To insure proper lug nut, lug bolt or wheel lock selection, refer to your current lug nut to determine correct lug nut style and thread size for your vehicle."  I don't remember if  that disclaimer was there when I placed my order and, if it was, if I read it.  When I started this quest, I knew almost nothing about lug nuts. Now, after much research, I realize that they come in all sorts of sizes, shapes, lengths, and styles, open end and closed end, right hand and left hand thread, 3 types of seats, and more. The type of seat is very important, because that's where the compatibility of the lug nut with the wheel comes into play.  Wrong lug nut and the mounting hole gets chewed up and your wheel is toast. Just because the lug nut is the right thread, doesn't mean it's the right nut.  So... the first thing you should do if you're thinking about buying new lug nuts from Amazon is to remove one old lug nut from your car and compare it to the pictures on Amazon. If I had done so, I wouldn't be writing this review.  Fortunately, returns are easy and free on Amazon.  These Gorilla Automotive 91733 Acorn Bulge Chrome Lug Nuts are high quality and I would give them 5 stars, except for the fact that the seat is incorrect for my car. Amazon's website says it fits my late model Jaguar, but Amazon is wrong; it is not the proper lug nut for OEM Jaguar wheels. This lug nut has an "acorn seat" with no washers; the OEM lug nuts have built-in washers and are called "flat" or "mag seat". Using the incorrect lug nut is unsafe. See the attached photos, in particular the one that shows the differences between seat types - (1) Acorn, also called Conical or Tapered; (2)/Mag, also called Flat; and (3) Ball, also called Radius.  One other thing - be sure to keep one set of OEM lug nuts and the OEM socket wrench and tools in your car, since you'll need them for your spare wheel/tire in case you get a flat. The new ones might not work.	-1
JUNK RUSTED WITH IN 10 DAYS WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY . AN ON A BRAND NAME NO LESS!!!	-1
Not correct for jeep	-1
purchased these for my chevy truck along with some new rims,installed all of it on my truck and never drove it anywhere, went back to work (I work off for extened periods) came home 6 months later and found about half of them rusted already. Luckily I had extras.	-1
Bought from Amazon warehouse deals. Junk! Several were stripped! Does anyone look at these items before they're offered for sale? Returned for refund.	-1
I bought these to replace the crappy 2 piece lug nuts that were on my 2004 Jeep Wrangler Sport. These are a little longer than the factory ones, which makes it look a little nicer imo. These are also better quality they are chrome and much heavier than the factory lug nuts, they fit perfectly and one of my favorite features are the lock nuts. Whether lock nuts really prevent someone from stealing your wheels or not is debatable but I guess its harder having them than not, the reason why I really like these lock nuts is that from a short distance you can barely tell which one is the actual lock as they look almost identical, unlike some lock nuts which you can see from a mile away they're completely different. Now I just wish I could get a few more for my spare :)  Update: After a couple of months they are starting to rust. Not crazy noticeable but up close you can see it starting to rust. It is a shame because they are really nice lug nuts.  Update 2: A week or two after my original update, the rust has gotten much worse and is noticeable. The point of these were mostly to make my wheels look nice and new not like crap. Very disappointed.	-1
somehow listed as compatible for 04 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  Does not fit mine (my wheel studs seem to be thicker?)	-1
I ordered this item after checking if it fit my truck F150 5.4L V8. Amazon web site said it fits my truck. Unfortinatly I did not have the time to istall it on my truck and I lost my right to return it, THEY DO NOT FIT MY TRUCK.	-1
I've already reviewed this once, but here goes again....the plugs are fine; however, I ordered 8, got 7 (which doesn't work well)...then another much later. In the process of trying to find an 8th plug I came to realize that the local Reilly auto part store sells them for half the price that I purchased them for on Amazon...so, I returned them and got a credit.	-1
started to rust after 3 weeks i don't think this stainless steel maybe plated steel. would not buy but is more durable than plastic.	-1
These knobs have a 1" shaft. They came with 1-1/2" screws. After installing the knob...it was completely loose due to, the overly long screw bottoming out, and not securing the knob properly. I need 1" screws to properly attach the knobs. The end of the screw should be flush with the end of the black plastic shaft of the knob - not extended past it as shown in my pictures. The screw tip should stop at my thumbnail (depicted in the far right photo). Do I go buy new screws, or waste my time shipping little plastic knobs back?	-1
I have had others before in the past that worked better. This one barely holds the door open. I know it is installed correctly. It is just very weak. Not a very good product.	-1
I bought this item from The Sportsman's Guide through Amazon. It was supposed to be a rv entry door holder but instead it was a door latch mechanism. The clear see through box had never been opened and the label even had a picture of the item I ordered, but the item inside was totally different. This was the fault of the manufacturer, RV Designer, not Amazon or The Sportsman's Guide. The lady at The Sportsman's Guide customer service was very helpful in getting my money refunded. Since it would cost more to send it back than what it's worth, I got to keep it. I don't have any use for it, so it's totally useless to me. Unfortunately this item is out of stock at The Sportsman's Guide and other sellers want more than twice of what I paid for it. Shipping alone was around $8.00 which is more than the $6.49 I originally paid. I found this item elsewhere for $9.99 with free shipping and that's the best deal I could find. Since it's the same part number from RV Designer, I hope I get the right item this time. I don't know how many of these were mislabeled.	-1
The thing will work but first throw away the set screw. It is made of soft steel and cannot be tightened properly. The main part is ok for light use. I am just securing the rear window with T-handles so it is not doing much.	-1
Product did not come with the screw which makes it impossible to use. Tried Home Depot and Lowes, could not find a screw. I will not order this again. Very cheap.	-1
I did not install it when I got it,,this is May and when I opened the package discovered it is very flimsy not heavy duty,, It will not last long. To late to return it. Very thin,,,,Heavy Duty it is NOT. Installed I will wait and see if it holds up...The original stuff I pulled out on my Winnebago was heavy good stuff.....	-1
the color on Amazon looks white, the real color is more tan	-1
I have been using Mobil1 synthetic motor oil for many years for my wife's Corvette, and it is undoubtedly one of the best lubricants on the market. However, my perennial gripe is the OVERSIZED FILLER NECK DIAMETER of the 1-quart bottle which prevents it from being directly inserted in the filler opening of many car engines. Mobil1 1-quart bottles have a 2.5 " O.D. filler neck, whereas most other oil brands have 1.25 " O.D. filler necks. The extra inch in diameter forces you to use a FUNNEL to fill the engine with oil. Having to use a funnel makes it impossible to stick the bottle in the filler opening of the engine to let it drain, i.e. you have to hold the bottle by hand until it finally has emptied itself. I really would like to understand what led Mobil1 to come up with this oversize filler neck; it can barely be squeezed into the filler opening of my wife's 2000 Corvette	-1
Pretty straight forward product. However, when I opened the package there were seven hangers and only six hooks making the seventh hanger useless.	-1
the material is not easy to slide once you get it into the channel...warmer days make it worse and they tend to stretch under load. Stick with the fabric type...slider easier and will probably last longer	-1
Very cheaply made, I would have been better served by paying more for a better model. The plastic is very fragile for the handle.	-1
Pretty simple in concept, right? But when you put this thing to use, it leaks, has a difficult time getting a draw, and then just kinda falls apart. The tubing is stiff and cheap, too. Note that we have no water filter system in our RV, so that was not an issue. Bottom line, stay away from this Chinese junk and the other brands that use the same item just in a different color. I ended up buying a small 12VDC pump which worked fine. A RV friend of ours bought a small pump that attaches to his power screwdriver, a pretty neat solution (literally).  Camco makes some unique stuff for RVs, but wow, the quality variation between products is stunning.	-1
Used this to winterize my rv yesterday.  T-handle broke off after about 6 easy pumps.  Finished the job with a pair of vice grips on the rod.  The cheap T-handle never had a chance...it has no bracing at all to prevent the handle from rocking on the top of the rod...there's no way it could stand up to use for more than a few pumps...just plain skimpy plastic.  I did put 2 hose clamps on the lines before I started, so I can't say anything about whether they would pop off immediately without them as others said.  Male fitting to connect to external water input on rv did fit well and didn't leak, so hey, it has that going for it.  If you carry vice grips in your trailer and want to use them on this pump, go ahead and buy one, otherwise look elsewhere.	-1
Straps too short to capture awning	-1
The metal connection on the hose portion did not last.  Came apart after the 4th use. Glad I didn't spend a lot for this.	-1
I installed a residential refer in my 5 th wheel trailer. I needed some bars to prevent the contents from moving around while on the road. Had trouble using this. It really has little staying power and doesnt work great at keeping the stuff in a fridge in place. I ended up using heavy duty twist to hold shower rods instead. Would not reccomend.	-1
Hard to adjust. Doesn't hold.  Don't work well if your RV has a residential style refrigerator.	-1
Hooked it up as directed and fluid kept squirting every where even with a good deal at fresh water intake. As others have mentioned hose way to short. After resting winterizing fluid jug on 5 gallon bucket and trying to create tighter seal at inlet and still pumping the small black exit port snapped off. Do your self a favor and winterize through water pump!	-1
These are decent straps but they deteriorate in the sun pretty fast. For the money, they should be UV resistant.	-1
Does not prime very easily and makes winterizing a big chore.  I have an antifreeze suction line for my water pump which makes it incredibly easy.  Was going to use this as a backup, but not worth it.  I would only recommend if this is your only option and you do not have an air compressor either.  I am returning mine.	-1
Broke first time I used it.	-1
Junk. Broke on install.	-1
ZERO Stars!  Pump Failed!  My hand pump had transferred less than half a gallon of antifreeze when something broke inside.  After that it would not draw anything from the antifreeze jug or pump anything out the tube.  I could not open it up to investigate or repair without destroying the pump because it is a sealed unit, cemented or chemically welded together.  I appreciate that Amazon accepted return and refunded my money.	-1
Broke within first minute of use.  Very disappointed.  I didn't open it until months after purchase, so I'm out some cash.  I'm done with this brand.	-1
I was disappointed by this.  It just did not work very well.  I would not buy it again as it is a very weak pump.	-1
Pay attention to those of us saying they are too stiff... and too flimsy. The spring is so strong and the travel so short that you probably won't be able to hold heavy items securely in a plastic refrigerator. Either the springs will be so tight they crack the refrigerator interior or so loose the bar will slip, and once it slips even a little you lose all the tension and it just falls out.	-1
Flimsy and won't stay in place. Don't buy it.	-1
The double bar model did NOT work as it was designed to.  After using the single bar model I had high expectation for their double bar model.  Unfortunately the product I received had a problem where one of the two adjustable bars was very hard to extend.  You extend the bars by screwing the bars in or out for length while the internal spring to keeps the tension on the bars.  I was able to screw the one bar in and out very easily but the other bar the internal spring seemed to catch on something in the tube.  I was able to screw it out but when I tried to adjust it by screwing it in I couldnt. The spring would catch on, I think the seam of the tube and would go no further.   Pros:   1. Light weight   2. Good for Larger refrigerators (double door) and larger cabinets   3. Good price  Cons:   1. Mine didn't work as was designed.   2. Actually I think the way the internal spring mechanism is designed it is prone to failure.  Would I buy another NO!  Do recommend this product for your RV; NO.  I think sooner or later it will fail as this one did.	-1
Does not work as expected. If the ends would be made of rubber they would hold much better in the fridge. But the end is plastic, so you can not put a lot of tension on those bars. So it either blocks your way, or if you try to get out that 2 gallon orange juice you will hit the bars and they will fall out on the floor. So this works not as good as a cheap wire	-1
I tried it this out for the first time and only time the other day. I arrived at the campsite and found that the items in the fridge were not held in place. I'm pretty sure I installed it with enough pressure. I just think it's a little wonky to use.	-1
it was way too big	-1
flimsy and easily dislodged. Tried to use in my reach in-floor freezer to divide the frozen chicken from the red meat, other product. Product can't create a snug/sturdy barrier because the plastic ends are hard and slip easily on metal/cold plastic/etc. Probably find a unique use for it in the future and too cheap to worry about returning.	-1
I have a 2013 Keystone camper. These don't work on it. I wasted money on these.	-1
The velcro strap was too long, thus not enabling me to obtain a tight fit around the awing arm.  There is no way to adjust the length of the strap to make it shorter. In a wind, the strap simply rotates on the awning arm and provides little extra stability for the awning. My advice is to buy this item locally to see if it will actually work.  Doug...7/26/14	-1
Too small for most uses...would recommend the larger ones.	-1
These do not open enough to span the residential refrigerators now used in many coaches.	-1
Thought these things would be helpful and to some extent they are.  But, we are an older couple and the de-flappers need a lot of strength to hold tight otherwise they loose control in the wind.  Hard to put on too.	-1
I am trying to return 2 units and I am not able to do that. I need to talk to someone tto get this straightened out 501-519-1814 Denniss Taylor	-1
Maybe on bus-sized class A motorhomes with larger refrigerators this is useful, but it is not any good for my RV refrigerator (26 ft vehicle, decent sized refrigerator).  I don't use this, as it is too large, and use the single bars instead.  They work well.	-1
I bought it for when I would need it and forgot about it for a while, needed it and then It broke during my first use.	-1
Not very powerful.  Will fit through the center of the Johnny Chock Tank Flush Assist.  Leaks from the spinning brass end, most likely because the shutoff valve is not sealing properly.	-1
The sprayer end is not flexible for the last about 6 inches so I could not get it past the 90 degree elbow that runs down to my holding tank. My plumbing requires something that can make a 90 degree bend and this does not do that due to the rigid end. Can't comment on the quality as I wasn't able to use it.	-1
This product didn't have very good view to buy it, took a chance and it was the wrong fit.	-1
It is supposed to go into the tank to flush it but the head is too big to make the turn from the toilet down pipe into the tank.  Doesn't work as advertised.  All it will clean is the down pipe and I can do that with a toilet brush.  Maybe if the end had a curve it might work.	-1
Item leaks horribly from shut off be sure if attempting to use have a seperate shut off valve. Poorly designed good idea.  No sure if had any effect since usage was cut short for water spraying out.  Second attempt after checking and tightening fittings was just as bad.	-1
I agree totally with the other reviewed who posted a 1-star review.  As received, this lid will not close fully because of protruding rivet heads.  And the steel slider track is terribly rough.  Like the other reviewer, I extensively modified this lid to make it work.  I remounted the hinge using five 6-32 flat head machine screws to eliminate the protruding rivet heads.  I also removed the steel slide track and re-mounted the old aluminum slider track with a machine screw through the lid on each end of the track.  The old aluminum track will need to be shortened and the remounting of the track needs to be done with careful attention to positioning and alignment with the slider arm.  I like the polycarbonate lid for durability, but it is amazing that CAMCO could sell an item that is so wrong.  You should only buy this lid if you are handy with tools and fabrication, and with the understanding that you need to devote a few hours to the installation instead of the 15 minutes that it should take.	-1
broke after using three times.	-1
What isn't stated is to install this lid, you must take off the entire base from the roof to install correctly. Why not just get a new complete unit if we have to go to all the trouble?	-1
I was happy this item arrived on time for my trip. I was not happy that it wasn't checked for quality. Both ends of the hinge, pop rivets go thru the plastic vent lid, but not the hinge.	-1
photos speak louder than words.....blatant misrepresentation. "Facilitates easy installation on all 14" x 14" RV vents"....WRONG! ".......easy installation on all 14" x 14" RV vents."......WRONG!	-1
Definitely a waste of  money on this item. It was stiff and hard to open. After about 4 uses, it broke. Would not recommend this item	-1
cheap and don't fit the older modles and directions don't really provide adequate info about that priior to opening up the box and physically matching them up. Yep,,,have to buy everything twice *&^%$#@!!	-1
Bought two of these similar items from Amazon and neither fits my RV. Finally went to an RV dealer and got the right one.	-1
buy the hole thing for a little bit more makes a lot more since	-1
This is a basic plastic cap with spring tension retainers. It is not an exact replacement part that is a twist on to attach. The details section is not fully describing this as a "will fit" and not an exact fit replacement.	-1
Didn't come with the seal	-1
The supplier was supposed to ship the Camco product as shown. What I received was not Camco brand or quality. I notified the supplier who refunded my money, and did not ask me to ship the product back. Because the product is lighter weight than Camco, I did not install the item.	-1
So far so good.	-1
FLIMSY CHEAP CRAP.MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE.	-1
Everything I have written below is my personal opinion based upon many years of repairing/rebuilding/restoring travel trailers.  I use, I have used, and I will continue to use Camco products.  Not this one, tho.  I replace a LOT of vinyl insert trim.  I needed a roll ASAP to finish a camper (my 1000' spool ran out) so I added a 25' roll of Camco 25202 to a quick Amazon order because I DID NOT THINK IT THROUGH.  Big mistake.  There is a difference in vinyl insert trim.  This Camco product is inexpensive but it is not worth the hassle.  Camco 25202 is rock hard, slightly off white, and relatively inflexible across the width.  The profile is also wrong for almost every roof edge molding.  It isn't worth the struggle and sore fingers fighting this into the roof edge molding, and when you (eventually) get it installed there is an even chance that the screw heads this product is designed to cover will be visible (as bumps) through the insert trim, especially hex screws.  Camco 25202 cracks easily in cold weather and yellows quickly in areas of the country with stronger sunlight (south Texas, for example).  I have replaced Camco insert trim on campers out of south Texas that had yellowed so badly the insert trim looked burnt.  I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/JR-Products-10121-White-100-foot-Premium-Vinyl-Insert/dp/B0031Y7Z1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">JR Products 10121 White 100 foot Premium Vinyl Insert</a>.  The JR Products 10121 installs easily, covers pan head and hex screws without showing bumps, is brilliant white in side by side comparison with the Camco product (which has a slightly tannish hue), and according to my micrometer is almost twice as thick as the Camco product.  I can "zip" the JR Products inset trim into the roof edge molding with my thumb as fast as I can move it along the molding rather than fighting the Camco trim every inch of the way.  If I prefer the JP Products and dislike the Camco product why did I buy the Camco product?  Because I got in a hurry, did not want to make the 90-mile round trip downtown to my distributor, and honestly, it has been so many years since I have used anything other than the JR Products trim I forgot what an incredible hassle the Camco product was.	-1
It didn't fit the channel on my old Scamper camper	-1
This vinyl trim was very stiff. I ordered the right size but this did not form smooth peaks when inserted but rather sharp "V"s that did not look good. I ordered a rubber insert from another company in the same size and THAT looks just like factory. Camco is a good company but this product is sad.	-1
Sorry, but is not working for me. I cannot completely close it. In other hand, it is reasonable manufactured.	-1
The item was not like description will not work for what I needed.	-1
Looks good at first then shrinks terribly by following year. Installed on horse trailer and now have 1.5 inch gaps on each end of a 7 ft run. Every run has gaps. Sunlight must greatly affect this type of vinyl.	-1
Cheap and flimsy replacement. Amazon wouldn't let me return it when I found it not only would not fit, and the 'return period had expired'. So now I have a useless piece of plastic garbage. Nice, Amazon.	-1
Very thin plastic. I expect the first tree limb that hits the roof to tear it off. When that happens I get a better one.	-1
I ordered this based on the product description as shown in part below  "Spring tension attachment"  "Features spring tension attachment, which eliminates the need to replace the entire vent"  This item has no spring tension attachment but rather has 4 pairs of prongs which are on the base and seat in corresponding holes on the cap itself.  Since this does not mate to my existing base I will have to remove the old system.  This item includes a replacement base with 6 screws, new sealant and replacement cap.  The quality appears OK and it did fit. However, I was required to remove the old system, which is what I was trying to avoid.	-1
product came loose and fell off after hours of carefully placing it on van .	-1

We just installed this the end of March while in FL, as winter storage came into play too soon.  It held up fine while in FL and all the way back to WI, once in WI within 24 hours both of the top sections fell off :(  It was time consuming installing it and it was installed correctly, the lower sides stayed in without NO problems.  Very disappointed.	-1
Hard to use if weather is not just right	-1
Had to be heated a little to make it more pliable before you could install.	-1
cheap as hell and doesn't fit and can't tell that untill you rec've it.	-1
shrinks badly	-1
i loved these at first... until a couple of years went by and the top part became ultra-brittle. After the first one cracked, I discovered that I could literally crumble the plastic cover into small fragments with my hands, like a potato chip! All three covers were in the same state. Moral: don't buy these unless you're prepared to replace them every two to three years. I switched to Camco's #40431, which costs ten bucks less to boot.	-1
so stiff it is un-usable. threw it away and bought more expensive, better quality, stuff from the local RV store.	-1
didn't fit and color was off. returned with no problem	-1
Has to be heated up a little to make it more pliable.	-1
I purchased 5 of these and 2 of the 5 leak around the end that you tighten.  It appears that the ends on these 2 have seperated.	-1
I know the price was low, and you get 2 in the package, but so thin and poorly made I would think twice abut buying another Camco product. If this product failed....as it will ...... It could cause a lot of damage.	-1
This is junk, don't waste your money on this. I bought a pack of two and broke both while trying to install them. Would not recommend this product.	-1
Flimsy. Thats the nice thing to say. Better than plastic, I guess, but mine never seems to open as much as pop off and have me searching grass for it.  I'll probably swap them out soon for some sort of clamp or other positive locking setup. Its a shame that campers get the short end of the quality stick, consistently.	-1
JUNK! The spring retainers are very thin gauge metal and not spring steel, they just bend. Waste of money.	-1
First problem: instructions tell you the sequence to connect the alligator clips to the battery.  There are no alligator clips.  The battery connectors have ring clips--not as useful when attaching to a car battery as alligator clips.  Second problem: when the battery leads are attached to nothing both charging and charged LEDs come on which is impossible.  Once attached to a car battery with enough charge to start the car, both LEDs go out.  Utterly useless. Returning it.	-1
Jan 2015: It's keeping my generator battery charged with a 5w Sunforce solar panel.  I probably could have not used the charge controller on a 5w panel but it seemed like cheap insurance.  Beware as previous people have stated, I had to splice connectors to make the Sunforce panel and charge controller connect.  For me, I had read the comments and anticipated this.  I plan to buy more for my tractor, truck, shed....  Jan 2016: Dropping to 1 star.  The unit is dead.  I'm not sure exactly when it died but I was running a generator exercise the other day and noticed it's no longer charging the battery.  Granted it was cheap enough but I do have an expectation of not having to replace it yearly.  Jul 2016: I removed this charge controller and hooked up the 5w solar panel directly to the battery.  It shouldn't be enough to over charge the battery but I was afraid the failure in the charge controller would discharge / drain the battery	-1
I don't trust this controller at all. I hooked up the battery first per instructions. Then connected the controller. The charging lite  came on, I thought that was nice.  About an hour or two later, the green light was on that said charged. BUT, so was the yellow charging lite. 3 hours later when I went to power on the yellow led flasher, the battery was so dead it would not even trip the photo cell attached to the lights. It was working before I connected this because I checked it by covering the photo cell. So this thing definitely drained the battery. I have never had a problem with this when I had 3 small 1.5 w  chargers connected to it. I added this and a 7 watt charger to save room. I ordered 2, another for a 10 watt panel. I am returning both of these and bought 2 of these. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GIWMJG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  They appear to have better features and 3 leads. One for the panel, one for the batter and one for the device. This might be a better thing. This switches to float charge as well.	-1
I was using this on a smaller (100W) system.  This unit was working "okay"... originally.  Cut-out was just under 14V, and cut-on was fairly consistent at 13V.  This worked well for about 6-months.  After 6-months, the cut-out dropped to 13.5-ish V, and the cut-on was 13.2V... leaving a very small window of performance, and the deep-cycle battery never reached full charge.  After another month or so, the controller was allowing discharge at night, which eventually destroyed the battery (because it was constantly discharged and never fully allowed to reach max charge).  The controller was wall-mounted INSIDE my non-heated storage building, but humidity seems to have been the killer.  When I opened the case, the circuit board looked like wet news-paper and nearly every transistor, resistor, and capacitor were corroded or falling off the board.  Seriously, in 30 years of electronics, I've never seen such a poor platform upon which to build a circuit!  Truly Chinese-made CRAP!	-1
I bought one of these in 2007 and used it to charge the two deep cycle batteries in my truck camper for two years before I knew any better. Solar charging was new to me and this was cheap so I figured I would give it a go. It appeared to work fine - it showed it was charging.  But my batteries never seemed to last long.  I set out to find out why, and in the process learned a lot about solar charging.  Along with that education came a realization of the pitfalls of charge controllers like this one.  This is an "on/off" controller.  When your batteries reach 14.2 volts, it simply turns off.  Your batteries will then discharge, either from something running off of them or simply by the passage of time (self discharge).  Once they reach 13 volts, this controller turns on again and takes them back up to 14.2 volts, and the cycle repeats itself.  The problem is your 12v batteries are not fully charged when they reach 14.2 volts.  Deep cycle batteries, especially, need more than that.  Many are rated to be charged at 14.4v, some as high as 14.8v (many 6v pairs, wired in series, fall into this latter category).  And when they reach that voltage they should continue to be charged at a gradually reduced current until they are truly full.  When that doesn't happen they are chronically undercharged, which doesn't give you the full use of the battery's capacity.  It's like having a ten gallon gas tank in your car but never putting more than 7 or 8 gallons in it.  The result is you can't use as much electricity before needing to recharge again.  Worse yet, chronic undercharging shortens battery life.  Sulfation of the plates occurs, as well as stratification of the electrolyte fluid.  Individual battery cell charges drift apart, and eventually cell failure occurs.  It only takes one cell to fail and your battery becomes nothing more than a toxic lead weight.  Look for charge controllers that use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technology or MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking).  MPPT is expensive and not really financially feasible for many small solar systems, but there are many PWM controllers on the market these days that are nearly as inexpensive as this cheap Sunforce on/off model.  PWM controllers charge your batteries in three stages - bulk, absorption and float.  Bulk allows everything your solar panels can produce to be thrown at the batteries until they reach a set point, (14.4v for example), and at that point absorption stage takes over where the voltage is held there while the amps allowed into your batteries are gradually diminished over several hours.  This really gets your batteries charged fully.  At the end of absorption stage float stage takes over, which trickle charges batteries to keep them fully charged.  Renogy is one brand that is sold here on Amazon.  The ten amp model uses PWM and even includes in-unit temperature compensation, but it is about ten bucks more than this Sunforce model.  Even so, you'd likely save more than that in battery life.  It's got its faults too though, like a short 30-minute absorption mode.  If you really want a good one, look for Morningstar, Blue Sky, Rogue or Xantrex, to name a few.  I've also heard good things about a very cheap Chinese brand called Landstar.  Although most of these are quite a bit more expensive, they won't cut your battery life short and they will give you more battery capacity to work with.  To learn more about 12v solar charging see rvsolar101 dot blogspot dot com.  Part 7 covers charge controllers.	-1
So these are the lowest price solar charge regulators available.  If you are more concerned about protecting your battery than actually getting what the solar panel can give you, go for it.  I'll be sending these back in favor of some MPPT controllers.  Originally bought six, and had them in parallel with six 12 volt batteries, which were in turn wired together in series for a 72 volt electric trike with six 100 watt solar panels.  They only seemed to give me about half the charge I was getting from the plug in chargers, and really choked the power available while riding.  Tried to contact the manufacturer, who basically said they were not intended for the use I have put them to.  Oh well.  Have wired in one of the mppt units at 24 volts, with 4 remaining Sunforce units, and already seeing 4 more volts available under load than with the 6 Sunforce units, and only spending about eight bucks more over all.	-1
I bought 3 of these mostly for the good feedback and the cheap price - but no more. Of the 3 I have purchased, 2 have died (wont charge battery but still output battery voltage) within 2 years of use and no way have I gotten even close to 7 amps of charge current. I use them with 6.5 to 30 watt panels for small portable charging stations I build for camping and hiking. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Going to spend a little more money next time to replace this and I'm staying away from Sunforce products in the future.	-1
I have had two of these controllers go bad in three years. They start off good and usually last a year -then tragedy strikes. I had the first go bad after nine months (which ruined two expensive deep cycle batteries). The second (replacement) lasted another year-and-a-half and then went bad (batteries did recover).  I noticed that the unit works great at first, then out of the blue it starts discharging the panels at night (there is no indication on the unit when this happens); This ultimately fry's the batteries if left on for a pro-long time (a problem since this is on a camping RV that sits most of the year).  To be honest, I got four years of service with these two controllers for around $40. Add the ruined batteries and it starts to hurt: next time I am buying a higher quality unit. That is what I get for being to cheap to buy the right one in the first place:(  Good affordable unit if you are constantly monitoring the batteries on a consistent basis (daily driver, occasional camping trip, etc). Bad unit if you want to plug in and forget (resting RV or boat).	-1
Ok, so I invested in a sunforce solar panel and the panel works fine although it's larger and heavier than I initially thought, but the charge control somehow came preassembled with the WRONG connectors! Now I'll have to spend another 30$+ on a GSM CYC-SOLC10A 10 AMP Solar Charge Controller to get things going! All I wanted to do was hook the 12vt connector to my cigarrette lighter socket to charge when not in use to keep the battery topped off. Now I gotta wait yet another two weeks!  EDIT:  After purchasing the better charge controller I now have a fully topped off battery that runs notably a LOT better this winter. It has definately saved me a trip to buy another car battery. So the solar panel has nearly paid for itself after a single charge! But it still puzzles me as to why mine came pre-assembled with the wrong stuff.	-1
I returned this controller because it had limited charging features.  I prefer the Pulse Width Modulation feature offered by slightly more expensive controllers.	-1
As a few others have posted, in here, the quality control on this Chinese unit is poor.  The wiring on my unit was reversed.  Once I set things right, the unit worked correctly for about four months before complete failure.  My battery died in the bargain, due to the unit failure that allowed my battery to drain completely with no load on it except this unit and the solar panel.  I'll try one more and then update this review.  Update:  I just ordered: KINTREX SPC0601 Solar Charge Controller - 7Amp, 100 Watt,...  At just $10, on this site, it's a far better deal and has an extra indicator light for low charge condition.  The connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate. As far as the reversed wiring goes, in all electrical applications with connectors, an exposed contact is normally the ground, coming from a power source.  The hot side is recessed and/or shielded to keep you from grabbing it and then a grounded object or contact, which would result in a shock.  This scheme is reversed, obviously, in the non-powered side of the circuit, ie., the thing you're sending the power to that mates with the connection just described.  When I called Sunforce's rep, in Canada, and spoke with him, he denied knowledge of any other incidents of reversed wiring.  That's really curious, as others have posted about the reversals, as I mentioned, above. UPDATE: 4/2011- The Kintrex unit works flawlessly.  You are well-advised to go with it and leave the reviewed unit, as above, alone.  It costs much more and is inferior.	-1
not sure if it works I got it and now I have to buy more stuff to make it work as a charger for my motorcycle.  I put it on a shelf and purchased a battery tender.	-1
I purchased one of these panels to hook to a new 27dc marine trolling motor battery and it was not holding....I purchased another one and hooked both panels to the battery in parallel as the rep from the company told me and it did not help.  with both panels unhooked from the battery after I charged it with a plug in charger, it held at 12.79 volts for 4 days.  I attached BOTH panels back to the battery and it LOSES .6 volts every 24 hours...I will NEVER purchase these again...spent almost 75 dollars on products that I cannot use, very frustrating.	-1
If I used this item and left it on a battery overnight, my battery would most definitely be dead in the morning. This item horrible discharges every night. I was forced to throw it away. What a waste. (To much time had passed from time of purchase to the time that I figured out what was killing my battery)	-1
Pretty pointless for me... I got it to help keep a charge on an rv battery but it never kept up...	-1
Cord is only 3 feet long from panel to battery clips or to 12v adaptor, so unless you plan to have it on your dash, it is useless. Cant even put on your hood and get it to reach battery. Too much hassle to make an extension that will work.	-1
Purchased a few years ago. It worked so/so for about a month, but  the frame was practically melting off the panel. I put it away that fall & I didn't use until the next spring. I set it up to keep my battery topped off, but when I checked it a few days later, the battery was completely dead (had NEVER done that before) . I double checked my connections, they were not reversed, and made sure I didn't leave something on, found nothing. I checked the output in direct midday sun, and it was putting out milliwatts, not watts.  This is a very cheaply made product, of course the price should have given this away. I have found with most products, you get what you pay for.  Shame on me....	-1
I ruined not one but two batteries with this, bought in 2012. The leads from the panel itself are reversed polarity. That so many reviews are positive here suggests a quality control issue. If you buy one, check with a voltmeter first! OTOH Some of the charge controllers offer "polarity protection," and it wouldn't hurt to have one of those in any case.	-1
Cheap plastic frame buckled and cracked the glass. When I checked voltage, there was none. Apparently it's worthless once the glass cracks.	-1
Plastic frame warps in a few weeks, I will assume the glass will break soon and will be useless. Also they should send extra fuses ,they are impossible to find .	-1
I gave this thing two weeks to perform and it didn't.  Not only did it not charge, it actually put a drain on my battery.  I tested it each day and each day it got lower.  I'm sending it back and don't want to try another of the same thing. Disappointed. but will try a different one.	-1
Didn't see any 'repackaging'  but the corners of the package had damage and the panel itself on the rear had a 'hairline crack'. Glad I inspected the pkg BEFORE I opened it. decided to RETURN IT.  Amazon never mentioned this when they said it was used.  The number one-  failure for these items is water intrusion  which will short circuit the panel.   I also question the design of that input plug being at the top of the unit , other panels have the input plug entrance  so that is opposite to the top of the mounting .So any water from the top will bypass the plug and gravity will shed the water.  Amazon offers a 12 watt crystalline solar panel at the same price point which has aluminum framed, The sunforce products all seem to be made from ABS plastic framing.. over time[years]  this will be a factor in the life of the product.	-1
I ordered a 12V panel but received a 24V panel. Labeling and voltmeter confirm 24V output. More bang/$ but I still needed a 12V unit.	-1
This worked great for keeping the battery in my hydraulic dump trailer charged. I use the trailer about once every two weeks, and this panel kept the battery topped up perfectly. I would only rate it two stars because it lasted two years almost to the day and is now stone cold dead -- no voltage. I will be purchasing a different, less expensive five watt panel that is now available on Amazon to replace this one.	-1
Worked for about a month and now the battery is dead.  The battery will charge with a normal charger. Had hoped for longer service.  Now time is up to complain. $60 wasted!  Can't get an answer from the seller!	-1
Received this product from Amazon within 1 day, but it showed up broken.  The packaging is not suitable to protect the glass during standard shipping.  Without an opportunity to actually use this product, the quality of the plastic frame and dc connections were very poor quality.  I would not purchase this product again, despite all the reviews.	-1
I bought this charger for my wife's Honda Civic.  She parks her car in the employee lot at LAX airport when we travel internationally.  It was in the parking lot on this charger for 3 weeks, and the car battery was dead when she returned after the trip.  (Update: Aug14)-After this happened we started thinking about the parasitic drain of the stock Honda alarm system- with it's blinking dash light, etc.)  So we just manually locked the car, without pushing the remote lock button on the key.  THAT solved our problem and the very same battery is still working for us today!)  You'd think sunny SoCal would be a good location to use this product, but it did not work for us and it apparently did not counter the drain from the armed Honda alarm system.	-1
Put this in my suv that I only use when I go fishing, after a week, the battery was dead.  I jumped the truck and did not use this product for a week and after a week, the truck started right up.  Connected the solar panel and a few days later the battery was DEAD.  What a waste of my money.  How can they sell products and not stand behind them. Just another company stealing our hard earned money.  Again, I just threw away $16+ in the trash, and they are laughing all the way to the bank.	-1
No longer works. Disappointed with this thing.	-1
Stopped working after 45 days. Before it decided to give up the panels became very hot it poses a fire hazard when left inside the car.	-1
this panel was packaged poorly and the glass was broken on both sides when we opened it . I did try it and measured with a volt meter it puts out zero voltage so it was DOA	-1
This item is NOT intended for outdoor use despite its description.  Once you open the package it says that outdoor use is not supported.	-1
I've had 3 and they're all dead, some within 1-2 months, 1 after less than 1 year. The plastic frame cracks due to sunlight and heat.  Not good.	-1
I bought this solar charger for my car that I do not use as a daily driver. I hooked it up to the battery and within 2 days it drained the battery to almost dead. I thought...this may have nothing to do with this solar charger, so I tried it on my Jeep Wrangler battery and it drained all of the juice from it's battery in a few days also. Worthless product....ripoff.	-1
Bought this as a battery maintainer, it worked fine for about a week, then it quit.  The reason, the sun actually melted the plastic housing around the solar panel and shorted it.  I just don't see the point of making a solar panel battery tender if the sun would destroy it!  Stupid Stupid Stupid!	-1
When I discovered solar powered battery maintainers, it seemed like a great idea for the car. I invested in the Sunforce 50012 1.8-Watt Solar Battery Maintainer for my Chevrolet Impala and was diligent about plugging it in every time I parked my car outside my garage. That meant it was plugged in a minimum of 9 hours a day while I was at work.  This became a routine for me for months until the day I couldn't start my car. Worried it might be the battery, I hooked up my battery charger, which reported the battery only had a 70% charge. I was stunned, since I never leave anything plugged into the cigarette lighter when the car is off with the excpetion of the Sunforce solar battery maintainer. I expected the charge to be closer to 100%.  As it turned out, the battery was not the issue with my car that day, but having seen the amount of charge in the battery, I realized that the Sunforce 50012 1.8-Watt Solar Battery Maintainer wasn't doing a bit of good for my car's battery and was way more trouble than it was worth. It now sits in a box in my garage.  I would NOT recommend the Sunforce 50012 1.8-Watt Solar Battery Maintainer to anyone.	-1
I tried this panel to maintain the old battery in my corolla that I just ended up replacing due to its inadequate performance in the cold weather. I was hoping this panel would delay my having to do this, but after trying this device it seemed to not only not work, but it may have drained my battery. Plugging into the 12v socket was not an option for me because apparently Japanese cars don't send power to or from the battery when there is no key in the ignition. I had to use the alligator clamps and maybe the connection wasn't right, but it was difficult to connect it right unless the clamps were pointing straight up (getting in the way of the hood when closed). So I'm no authority on whether or not this panel will work for other cars (according to other reviews it does), but this product was not right for my car. Fortunately, Amazon authorized my return very quickly and I was able to easily track the prompt shipping updates.	-1
Definitely not waterproof for outdoor use.  Solder connection to ground side of solar cell will not stay electrically connected.  Does not meet my need for boat trolling motor battery charging.  Worked for about a week, re-soldered the connection, but it quit again after another week.  By that time I had thrown away the box and return shipping label, so will try to re-solder it again.	-1
Wish it didn't die so soon.  It's going back to Amazon.com.  It does come with a 5-year warranty though, if that means anything.	-1
I had to repair this item by resoldering all the connections inside it after two days of use. Basically this rendered to less than zero value to me since it now cost me 4 hours of install time repair time, in addition to its initial cost.	-1
The concept and packaging of this device is appealing. Unfortunately, after a minimal period of use, the wires broke off from the solar cell housing. (Easy to resolder, but I don't want to risk starting a fire in the car). Furthermore, the instructions tell you to always unplug the unit while the car is running, which is an annoyance and, I believe, hints at cheapo engineering. Avoid.	-1
The blue light just stays ON when hooked up to a battery (with alligator clamps, not cig lighter adapter). It stays ON whether the solar panels are exposed to light or not...and I'm not sure what it's doing to the battery.  Measured the voltage coming out of it in sunlight - was ~20V...fine Checked current going to battery - was ~45mA...also fine  Covered the solar panel from sunlight with cardboard and: * Voltage dropped to 14V * Current dropped to ~2.5mA The above corresponds to 35mW which is prolly about enough power for the LED. I have no reason to believe that this is not coming out of the battery!  I called SunForce and was told that the LED indicates "availability of ambient light". When I asked how come the LED stays lit even when the solar panel is fully covered, he goes "how could you possibly cover the solar panel fully without covering the LED itself"... To the question "why does it stay ON most of the time and blink some of the time" I was told that is "expected behavior". Very condescending! And I still have no logical reason to believe that the 35mW is not coming out of the battery!  Initially was very happy about being able to use a "green" solution and all...but the company attitude kinda killed it for me...  It's prolly a good idea to disconnect the panel when there's no sunlight.	-1
I don't know how people can say that this thing works.  The battery still discharged on my new car.  Too weak for big car batteries.  You will need at least 15 watts to make a real difference.	-1
Goods not as advertised AT ALL! the "Carwash System With Refill Supplies" isn't a system and doesn't have refills ....	-1
This kit will wash and dry your vehicle quite nicely if you follow all the instructions. However the refill filters and soap being no longer available you will have spent $70 plus $7 shipping for three car washes . Solution..hit the yard sales on Memorial day weekend and you will find these tossed aside by disgusted consumers. they are usually in the free box or the $1.00 box.. happy picking	-1
Don't buy Mr. Clean AutoDry. The manufacturer (P&G) discontinued the soap and filters. This item is now useless.	-1
This product is so bad I don't see how it could even be approved at all for production. It's a good concept on paper, but in the real world this thing is a tedious piece of crap.   First off the reason anyone picks up a autowasher is because they want to cut car washing time down and not have to go through the hassle of grapping a bucket and sponge and cleaning and drying the car off the old fashioned way. It takes hours of your time, and for the average person it is nothing more than a chore.   When I saw the autowasher commercial about every 5minutes on Speednetwork I thought maybe I'd give it a try. Maybe this was the car washing miracle that lazy carwashing people like myself have been waiting for. I made it down to autozone and picked one up to try it out.   When I first opened it up I saw how cheap it felt. Reminded me of those supersoaker knockoffs they used to carry at the disount stores. These thing is overly huge and clunky. Along with it came cartridges, and a soap packet. As soon a saw this I thought great... I've been thrown into the consumer loop of reapeat acessory purchases. I already knew I would probably spend 19.99 buying soap and cartridges every time I wanted to wash my car. That's a dead give away to any crap product for anyone who can read between the lines.   So after 10 minutes or so of trying to figure out this plastic chunk garbage I got the thing loaded and followed the steps as mentioned. Now here I am hoping that this thing was worth all the trouble. I get the car prepped and finally it's time for that MR. Clean Autodry action.! I shoot the soap onto the car...at first I couldn't tell if it was working or not because I  barely saw any bubbles. Finally after a few test I saw that it was working properly and the soap was comming out. The soap wasn't very potent at all. I have no idea what it was meant for cleaning but it wasn't my car. After washing my car down with this gunk I then followed the next steps and rinsed it off. Again the rinse factor is very weak. I think my showerhead gives a more powerful wash. Just as directed I rinsed the car off then let it dry. I went inside my house and sat for a half our or so and came back out to check on my new sparkling ride.   To my suprise what I really came back out to was a car that looked like it had never been washed at all. Same dirt and grime sitting right on it. Only the windows appeared have been cleaned off somewhat. After spending 2 hours with this piece of trash I was more than pissed. I picked up the gun and saw that the cartridges it came with turned brown somehow. I couldn't figure out how or why. You'd think something be more durable for it's one time use.   I stared at the dark blue gun in my hand. The devils on my shoulder yelling at me to smash this thing and stomp on it in my rage. I just wasted 2 hours on a Saturday for nothing...FOR NOTHING! ultimately I ended up returning the thing to the store. For the money invested I should of went to the dollar depot next door and picked up a bucket and a spone. Much better for 90% less than the price of this worthless Mr. Clean product.	-1
This product was a total bust for me. I have a new, dark colored car and wanted to give it a try to see if it saved me from hand drying it to prevent spotting. It did not.  The special rinse at the end to stop the spotting stopped working in a few minutes, well before finishing the car. The cartridge turn brown showing is was expended in under 5 minutes--not the 10 car washes claimed.  I also found that the soap dispensed was not very effective at cleaning, and with no bucket, it was difficult to rinse the sponge well.  If it worked, it would have been a nice convenience.  I will be either returning it or calling the Mr. Clean people to get a refund.	-1
We've been using the Mr. Clean AutoDry for about a year and results are mixed. If you apply the soap, wash, heavy rinse then filtered rinse then wipe the car/truck dry, then it works ok. I can dry it before the spots appear. But you cannot just wash/rinse/filtered rinse or just rinse and let dry or you'll get water spots. This happens regardless of whether you have a new filter or old filter. This has been a very disappointing product. We get a lot of tree pollen/seeds and I was hoping I could use the Mr Clean AutoDry to just rinse off our trucks and then let them air dry but it never works right. We always get some water spots and then you have to spend a lot of time cleaning/waxing the truck to get them off. If you have a new vehicle or one with an good paint job then be very careful about letting it air dry after washing/rinsing with this product.	-1
Not worth the cost; at a minimum of $1.00 per wash for ten washes that takes the cost of a wash for me to three dollars for everything.. The thing that wasn't expected was I STILL HAVE WATER SPOTS.. I did everything exactly as the directions stated; yet I still have water spots... After reading on the internet - ALLOT. I decided and made my own water deionizer. Use Both types of DI-Reson. One to soften the water and the second stage to Dionize the water. Know what? NO WATER SPOTS.. It cost me $200.00 for all the parts; BUT I can reuse the reson by regenerating it.. I also don't have to do this for around 1,000 gallons of water, so the cost is way lower.	-1
First time user, not impressed with this product	-1
lightweight and compact, but connections break easily.  Tipped over twice in a windstorm and broke into 3 sections.  I'll probably duct tape it back together as there are not a lot of options.	-1
Always falls over	-1
This holder works ok but its flimsy and flops around it packs up nice but next time I will buy a metal one	-1
Very disappointed!  We were hoping that we could pick it up by the handle.  However, it just falls apart.	-1
I have used this for a couple of years now and every time I stretch it out to its max and place the hose into it, when I dump the unit rolls over on its side defeating it purpose.	-1
Very flimsy, several links broke while extending the sewer hose holder but I was able to use it, hence the two stars vs. one. I would not however purchase that product again.	-1
Cheap already broke!	-1
I found it to be very unstable	-1
Wish I would have gotten the medal one! First time using was nothing special while saving it broke! JUNK Get the stronger medal one!	-1
does not stand up with a very hose sitting in it.  For the money don't buy it.	-1
As soon as you dump your black water, s*** gets real, and the hose starts to expand and dismount from its little cradle. The chunky fluid inside the hose basically causes the hose to bend and droop out of this gentle cradle in multiple locations along the length of your poop chute. This also causes the Sidewinder to slide around and at one point it even tipped over.  I even tried to use zip ties to strap the brown hose to the black Sidewinder, like a Fighter Pilot, and NOPE...like a squirming little toddler the hose still managed to wriggle itself out of its cradle... :(  Totally useless. I had to throw this thing in the trash.  My solution was to use a section of plastic rain gutter that you see attached to the edges of the roofs of homes. I supported the rain gutter with a large cinder block on the side below the sewer connection (the high side), and I used a small red clay brick to support the lower end of the rain gutter where the, 90, sewer hose fitting goes into the sewer system.  The sewer hose fits perfectly cradled along the entire length of the rain gutter and it does not move an inch when I take my big dump and that's the way I like it. :)	-1
Adapter came without the gasket.  The slot for the gasket is smaller than other dump hose adapters so could not use one from other parts already on hand.	-1
This thing is a joke and a scam. Parked my travel trailer on a perfectly flat and level concrete spot, brought out this contraption and hooked up my camco septic hoses for a test. As soon as you get anything in the hose it falls down and sinks in between the links trapping the contents in your hose and creates an opportunity for a backup.	-1
it was the cheapest on amazon and now i know. i am stuck with a 2 bay hook clearview adapter. it will break unless you have less than 10 gallons of waste water pressure. i will keep mine if i dump illegally. kidding.... you get what you pay for and this seller should have described his adapter truthfully and i think it is counterfeit Valterra. The seller was Tweetys RV & Truck Accessories...	-1
Real flimsy and hard to set. Not worth the effort.	-1
In order to use this I'm going to have to find an affordable way to keep the hose in.  I anticipate replacing it.	-1
I purhased this hose kit thinking it was just the solution to cleaning the black tank after using a dump station that does not have a water faucet to rinse the tank.  What could be better?  A hose connector for my flexible tank wand with the rotating spray on the businss end.  I'll be able to hook up the wand using the bathroom faucet, attach the wand and use the 12V pump to rinse the tank.  IT DOESN'T WORK !!  When you use the 12V pump for water, there isn't enough water pressure to compensate for the extreem water stream the toilet puts out.  You open the flush valve and push hard enough to open the valve so you can insert the wand, the problem is; the water pressure is taken up by the toilet which doesn't leave enough pressure to rotate the sprayer on the wand, . .it's just a trickle on the business end of the wand.  If there was a way to turn off the water spray in the toilet, it might work.  However as it is; Certainly not enough to wash any debre inside the tank.  So, unless I'm at an RV park that has full hook up; where the city water can stay connected,..this unit is useless.  If I have city water connected, I'm better off using the tank washer connected to the sewer drain.	-1
The thing broke in half....not too well made, but still have to use as two parts	-1
Product is too flimsy and light weight to do a good job in holding up the waste hose.  I would not recommend this product if you are looking for something to stabilize your hose.  Probably will work okay after you dump your tanks and then put the hose on the support so you can drain your RV while in a camp ground.  I would not recommend this product if you are dumping your tanks because the support is not that stable.  I've tried several different ways of laying out the support when dumping and the hose always ended up coming out of the support.  You are better off just laying the hose on the ground .	-1
falls over easy cant really hold much weight.	-1
broke on day 1. bit cheap in construction. would recommend different product, or even a different approach all together	-1
Handle/carrier was broken right out of the box.  I hope the rest of the product holds up better.  The carrier is made out of cheap plastic that is insufficient for the weight of the product.	-1
very small	-1
Slipped on a steep concrete pad.  Luckily I had other safety measures in place.  I went to the auto parts store and got the metal ones with rubber on the bottom	-1
Great idea, now make one that doesn't break apart at the hinges. I'm careful with it, just think it could be of better quality or design.	-1
returned it as thought is was rubber.  My garage floor is so slick it wouldn't get any traction, so I returned it.	-1
First off, my fault for not realizing these are sold in single units and not in pairs. That being said, I'm glad I didn't buy a second one, as these are hard plastic and will slide easily and not take hold unless you put a rubber mat under it. The good news is, you can pick up a pair of real rubber chocks at Harbor Freight for less than 20 bucks which work great.	-1
The chock I received had no tether cord, nor a hole to mount it. Also, the structure as viewed from the side is quite different. I am not sure if they redesigned it, or if it is the wrong one. Either way, it is a disappointment. It IS a hard plastic and slides on some floors, but seems to grip pavement well.	-1
You just don't expect these to be made of hard plastic and so small.  But then you look at the price and kick yourself for expecting more.  They work, but I highly doubt they'll still be around in 10 years.	-1
I retract my previous review of Great.  This connection leaks like a sieve where it screws into a sewer hose.  I have tried several different types of hose and they all leak.  There is no way to clamp it either.  Get a connection that uses a barb type connection and worm clamp.  This one is headed for the trash when I get home from my RV trip.  8/22/2012:  Finally figured out the problem.  Valterra connectors have a right hand thread.  Only Valterra hose has the same thread direction.  These connectors will not work with any hose but Valterra,	-1
did not work	-1
Wouldn't buy again... squeaked after first week and ended up replacing.	-1
Had to return because they broke on install.	-1
Cheap quality. If any debris from plants or trees get on these wipers they streak the whole windshield. Spend a few extra dollars and get a decent wiper blade.	-1
broken when received, sent a second it was cracked too :(	-1
It was a decent deal when I bought this for black Friday priceing. Regular price is outrageous to even ask that much. Everything in this kit is under 5 dollars other than the jumper cables.	-1
Lots of junk and "free" stuff.	-1
Connection  was leaking badly at connection.  Clamp would not solve problem.  8/22/2012:  Finally figured out the problem.  Valterra connectors have a right hand thread.  Only Valterra hose has the same thread direction.  These connectors will not work with any hose but Valterra,	-1
The motor and fan assembly was broken from the delicate solder connections and was laying loose inside the little cage.  I never even got to take it out of its clamshell package.	-1
As others noted, it's very cheaply built.  After a couple battery changes, I swapped out a set and put it back in the fridge... I just happened to check to see if things were getting cool, and the thing was burning up.  I immediately pulled the batteries and checked polarity, but it was correct.  Batteries were too hot to hold.  Clearly this thing had an internal short somewhere and would have melted down if I had not found it in time.  I don't trust it anymore, and junked it part-way into the second season of use.	-1
Didn't work right out of the box. Batteries were hard to insert and immposible to exract. I'm returning it as soon as I can.	-1
I had to replace the seal 3 times	-1
Missing the gasket so you guessed, it is going to leak. Wish I had listened to some of the one reviewers. Not a good fit at all. Very tight fit even with out the gasket. Poorly made	-1
This cap came without A GASKET in the cap. So of course it leaks.  This was a terrible purchase.  Plus I cant find a gasket that fits the cap.	-1
Had a Valterra cap on my trailer stock from the factory but it had no hose connection. This was of noticeable cheaper quality. It broke at the tabs the first time that I used it!!! Would probably be fine if you could put it on and never try to remove it again. I replaced with a Camco  brand cap and it hasn't given me any problems. The Camco seems to be of better quality.	-1
New as described, cheaply made product, should have saved my money and bought higher quality item. Probably will not last long as other Valterra products I have don't last very long. Time to stop buying that brand of stuff for me. Packaging and delivery were 100%. Gave it 2 stars as does the job for now as described but at that quality should be under a dollar	-1
Much too difficult  almost impossible  to screw this on and get it fully seated by hand.  I got no response from customer service when I messaged them about this problem, using the Valterra website's 'contact us' page	-1
trusting the secure strap, I dropped it. Strap let go and cap broke. A 15 second replacement cap for me.	-1
k	-1
I purchased a Valterra D04-0250 Dominator 15' Sewer Hose Kit, the kit does not come with end caps. So I bought these end caps and found out they don't fit in our new Forest River 21fbrs bumper. If you do buy these caps note that you'll have nubs on one end that this cap will fit and the other end will have little arms same as the cap, like a male and female ends. good luck, happy camping.  The product seems solid and will seal good in the correct application.	-1
Valterra stuff usually seems OK. This is junk.....Plastic was already sticky, gooey, and deteriorating upon delivery. Good news...It''s Amazon so it was easy to send back!	-1
I bought this Gray Colored Hose to use strickley for our RV.  To clean the Black Tank Dump Hose when finished.  Its a hose, rather cheaply made.  I don't think it will last for a very long time.  But its cheap, and easy to replace.	-1
I did not buy this from Amazon. I purchased it from a RV store. It leaks. Good thing i tested it day before I really need it to use it. Luckily i had silicon with me, in my tool box. With silicon I left it on from 3PM to 10am & it worked fine. Now i am looking for a cap for it, because I like to leave it on permanently.	-1
The ear tabs are not strong enough and break very easily when twisting  to the outlet pipe.  Would not buy again.	-1
odays adapter not usable for earlier 4" outlets. no one seems to carry such an item anymore. Same can be said for end closure cap for holding tank. had to return it.	-1
I had bad luck with this, it doesn't hold a charge. I put it in a solar charged water valve and I ended up having to buy the original equipment battery to get it back in operation. This battery speced out the same as original.	-1
Did not hold charge	-1
Battery is junk. This didn't last a month in my solar fencer. Seller wants me to fill out a form and pay to ship this battery back. If I don't want another one of these crappy batteries I pay for their original shipping. Not worth it. Lesson learned.	-1
Never worked	-1
When I first recieved this battery, I was shocked by how small it is. It doesnt have enough power to operate strobe lights fully. It would not even charge up my phone correctly. Its no bigger than a soda can. Dont waste your money on this crap, Search on Amazon for other 12v batteries, My honest Statement..	-1
So far it works well. I was glad to see that it was fresh when i got it. So many batteries sold on line are old stock and reached or exceeded their shelf life. This seller sells fresh batteries.	-1
nothing to say.	-1
I had a small nail in my heidenau k60. After trying two stop n go plugs it was still leaking. I got my Walmart  tire plugger and plugged it instantly. Luckily I had the flat at home. I got the stop n go for road trips. This was my first attempt with a stop n go. I'll have my Walmart plugs from now on.	-1
A neat item, but the plugs must be lubricated with something slippery for it to work.  Seems counterintuitive when you want the plugs to bond to the tire?  I've used it once, and the tire still slowly leaks.  I had better luck with the sticky-string inexpensive alternative...	-1
I bought mine from the BMW motorcycle dealer thinking it was a fantastic idea and probably a great product since they stocked it.  I'm not sure why, but I have had more flat tires this summer than in my 35+ years of motorcycling, so I can claim some experience.  I was impressed with the tools included in this product and really liked the ease with which the plugs are inserted into a tire.  The directions were clear and easy to follow and I had my tire plugged and aired up in no time.  My tire was fairly new and I really don't like replacing a tire if it gets a puncture and up to this point, have never lost a properly inserted rope plug.  So, when this mushroom plug was installed, I figured I was done.  Not so.  The following morning, the tire had lost a little over 10PSI.  After looking around, and using a bit of soapy water, found the plug was leaking so I pushed it into the tire and inserted another one.  It leaked too.  Immediately.  I pushed it into the tire as well and installed a rope plug.  It worked.  The pocket tire plugger is such a novel and ingenious idea.  Maybe it needs to be larger in diameter or should have a coating of some serious adhesive or something.  It will do in an emergency I suppose and along a busy freeway might be the better choice since it's fast and easy.  If you are comfortable riding on plugged tires until they wear out, this doesn't seem to be the best choice..	-1
I rarely use any such products, as I will not ride on a plugged tire if I can avoid it.  However, these looked convenient and less messy than the conventional kits.  Recently, the front tire of my bike picked up a brad, about the diameter of a large paper clip.  (The point is, still a very small hole.)  I got the opportunity to try this product for the first time.  On the first attempt, the plug pulled out with the applicator.  (This did not increase my comfort level.)  I tried again, and the plug stayed.  A day later, the tire had lost one pound, but it did not lose any more pressure standing a second day.  So I thought the plug was good enough to drive 4 miles to the shop to install a new tire.  Wrong.  The plug came out within a mile at speeds no more than 40 mph.  The tire went flat within seconds, not a good feeling on a motorcycle. I had two of these kits, threw both away, and replaced them with the cord-and-rubber cement kind.	-1
This is the second Accu-Gauge tire pressure gauge I have purchased.  The first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  This one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.	-1
After about 3 or 4 uses, it no longer holds the reading. Broken in less than 40 days, just past the return period. It also read 2 lbs higher than my other gauges, so not very accurate either.  To use the so called lifetime warranty, you have to send it to the company, and include $2.50 for return shipping. That comes out to just about the original cost.	-1
Bought it based on the reviews! Don't know if I can return it becauseI didn't test it till now! Wife stated we had a flat tire! Went out confident it would work placed it on the valve and it gave me a reading. Got out the air compressor to fill tire and the Accu-gage would NOT HOLD THE AIR READING ( it has a release valve so measurement can be inspected away from the car. Tried it several times leaked everytime! And would not hold the reading. After inspecting it I noticed the brass fitting connected to the hosehad worked itself loose, from the neck of the gage ( see where my fingernail is touching gauge). I was shocked. So I went into the house and retrieved my father-in-laws old Holloywood Accessories Brand to finish the job. I am not sure if I can apply loc-tite to the threads or if it needs to be replaced? By the way the cheapy gauge gave me same measurement as the Accu-gage go figure?	-1
This started out great, worked well. But after a couple of months it now leaks air out the release valve so I can no longer get accurate readings. I should have bought one at Harbor Freight for half the price.	-1
ahhh its ok, the needle is cheap and I probably won't use it as it doesnt seem that accurate	-1
I really liked this gauge, that is til it fell out of my hand , fell about three feet onto my concrete floor and didn't work anymore. The rubber surround didn't seem to help at all.	-1
reads 3 psi less than accurate doesnt read accurately - it's off by 3 lbs. psi - i wouldn't purchase again or recommend	-1
Does not smell like Coconut and everyone who smells it (especially females), says they smell nasty.	-1
Ok but doesn't have a hold-pressure button so have to get way down to use it . Plus it's 4 lbs off comparing it to a better quality gage.	-1
This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away.	-1
Please don't buy	-1
The hold button quit working	-1
it's not good	-1
its weak an in acurate	-1
The good news is that ergonomically, it is a great tire gauge.  It just goes right in without positioning errors that are common with gauges withoug a straight measuring tip.  The bad news is that its measurements are off by 7 to 9 pounds.  The inaccurate measurements make this completely useless.	-1
So, this is a fancy tire gauge and I got it for my new RV. It reads the tire pressure and is supposed to hold the pressure, but always drops the reading 5 or 10 psi. I find now that I regret having spent the money on this "fancy" gauge, and went back to using my 20 year old pencil style gauge that is smaller, cheaper, and much more accurate.	-1
This is not for me. Hate the smell.	-1
This is a pain to use. Thought it would be more accurate than the pen style, but I was wrong. Save your money and stick to the pen style gauge.	-1
Almost no scent. Perhaps these are old stock? That would explain no scent. None of the individual packs I received had much scent, but the many I have bought at Target over the years were well scented. Won't buy from this seller again.	-1
After reading the reviews, I won't get it. I would gladly pay twice the price for one that holds air.	-1
For such a simple product it is poorly made (in China, of course!). I bought two of these and they both leak, won't hold air. The valves are junk. I threw them away.	-1
Like other people say about these here on Amazon, you are most likely going to receive an older product which does not smell as strong or last as long as the trees you buy in-store. I took a chance and hoped for a newer batch for the price but I guess I'll be trying for a refund.	-1
I bought two of these. One was for my car and the other was for my truck. I installed one on my car first. I kept an eye on it for a few weeks and all was fine. I installed the other one on my truck and the spare was flat the next day. Checking with some soapy water, I found a leak at the fitting that threads on to the tire valve right where the crimped piece is connected to the knurled piece. I won't bother getting anymore of these in the future.	-1
Last about a day or two	-1
These do not last longer than three days	-1
Smell like a French whorehouse!	-1
Smells like laundry detergent; smells like soap. Read the 'positive' reviews, so I bought a few. Put one the car - which now smells like an open box of laundry detergent powder. Waste of money, much better off just spritzing a little good cologne on the floor mats.	-1
I believe I've gotten a bad or counterfeit batch from the Amazon seller I got it from. When I first opened the black ice it smelled good but then after about an hour it started to smell really off. It smelled like sweaty sex and I'm not joking when I say this. A friend of mine even commented and said my car now smells like "fresh vagina".  I believe I will stick to getting these from the stores for now on.	-1
Smell is so strong I had to throw it out after a day..........	-1
seems nice because everybody knows how good BLACK ICE SMELLS heck i remember the first time i smelled black ice, i thought wow, this smells like regular ice, but is black. definitely a much stronger smell than unfrozen water or other colors of ice.  The reason for the one star however is because unfortunately having the air freshener turns out to be a bad idea in the winter - you can't smell the black ice coming up on the road, and everyone knows how hard it is to see. with the smell of black ice all around you, you're never gonna notice the smell of the ice on the road until it's too late.  DO NOT USE IN WINTER!	-1
bad purchase, aroma very strong upon opening,..three days later nothing.don't waste your money	-1
This scent is way too strong for me. I threw it out 4 days ago and my car still smells like it!	-1
Supposedly the freshener with the smell most people like. I'm apparently not most people, I do not like the smell at all. Free handout for coworkers as long as I don't have to ride in their cars.	-1
These little trees are weak on scent and do not have the lasting power to be worthy of purchase. This sometimes happens with their products from time to time and across different scents. I do not know why but sometimes they smell strong and sometimes weak. If they are strong they last awhile and if weak maybe a day or so. This whole set i purchased was weak. The scent smells like a mans cologne which is not bad and is up to your preference. I would not suggest any purchase of this until the company corrects the amount of scent on each. Considering that i have encountered this many times now with their product it cannot be accidental or a production problem. It must be intentional by design and with the intent to sell more product so i say don't buy little trees of any scent.	-1
I received a used container. Outside stained and slick. About a 1/4 missing	-1
Corrosive. Faded the paint on every product I tried it on. I thought it was cleaning, but it was removing some of the paint. Purchase at you own risk. I am taking mine to the recycling center so I don't use it again. A waste of money.	-1
Finally made it	-1
not happy with it at all.	-1
IM fairly sure I would have never purchased this had I realized it did not come with a sprayer. Package showed up fairly smashed to boot. Buyer be ware, and please read the reviews before purchasing. They are mostly accurate.	-1
Otherwise works well.  Much better and cheaper than what you can buy and the local store.  Recommend getting some good spray bottles for mixing/application	-1
It's not as shown in the picture....and it's EMPTY!!!!!!!!!!! What an F*&*#@# SCAM!!!!!	-1
This is clearly a scam. It is an empty bottle. I have filed a complaint with the US Postal Inspector's office against J and B tool sales.	-1
I was totally disappointed when this bottle arrived. I paid $18 for an empty bottle, and to make matters worse, this bottle also came without a top to it.  I was totally unaware that this was what I had ordered by the previously posted description. I have noticed though that the description NOW clearly states that this is an empty bottle and the spray top is a separate purchase.	-1
Much better and cheaper than what you can buy and the local store.  Leaves a streak free shine.  Recommend getting some good spray bottles for mixing/application	-1
I simply do not understand the good reviews for this product, and not sure why I was naive enough to purchase it. It's exactly like using a shampoo conditioner on your hair.  You just cannot thoroughly clean with a product containing conditioner, and you cannot thoroughly condition with a product containing soap!  You can't do it.  I have used the Meguiar's twice and it does not clean well at all.  I've used it on the leather of a 2014 Honda Odyssey EX-L, and a 2013 Chrysler 300 that had very little wear.  It did little of nothing!  I had much better results with Lexol, and will go back to using it.	-1
Sad this product did not do a good job in making my trip or my black tires shine.  The mixture of distilled water to solution makes you run out of the item fast.  Thinking of using Chemical guys when I finish using this hyperdressing.  Love all of Meguiar's professional detailing solution except for the hyper dressing.  Your better off buying a dollar store brand than this.	-1
I am a profesional auto detailed and I know the products. I have tried time and time again to love this product, but I just cant. Does it cut through grease? Yes absolutely. But you WILL cough up a lung in the process. This should come with a big fat warning label on it. I use many degreasers, many of which most people can't even stand, which I tolerate with great ease. But this Super Degreaser? Not a chance. I absolutley CANNOT STAND the smell, it instantly makes you cough up a lung, even diluted 5:1.  This product greatly makes me worry for my health. The "Pleasant herbal fragrance" is a joke. This does not even slightly resemble a herbal fragrance. This is a heavy duty degreaser end of story. There are other products  that are far less caustic (Super Clean to name one) that have extremely if not similar results.  If this product gets on your skin, even diluted 5:1. It WILL burn your skin and leave it a red color for 2-3 hours. This cannot be good for the health. Heed the warning posted by the other user mentioning burns on the face. Sorry meguiars, I won't be buying this product again.  Effectiveness: 9/10 Price: 7/10 Smell: 1/10 Safety: 2/10	-1
No matter how I have mixed this garbage, even using it straight from the jug with no dilution, I am unimpressed.  Doesn't leave much of a shine, wipes off easily and since it is water based the minute anything liquid comes in contact with a surface that this was applied to it washes off.  Chemical Guys makes much better tire dressing products that do not wash away!	-1
good product 5 starts like the other comment said leads to price fixing and its not worth 45 dollars sorry megs.	-1
5 star leads to price fixing. Good product though	-1
So I didn't get all of it, but otherwise it works well.  Mix up to make high gloss, satin, or low gloss.	-1
product is a good but I wasn't happy with seller. I would give 5 stars for the product. But 0 star for the seller	-1
Mixed at 4 to 1 ratio and sprayed the oil covered valve cover on my car engine and waited for 45 seconds before rinsing off. It didn't do anything as far as I could see.  Will try it on other surfaces and see if I can obtain some better results.  Update on October 10, 2014:  I bought this really hoping that it would work well. So far I can't seem to find a situation where it does.  Having read numerous reviews on how well this works for cleaning pads, towels, etc. I tried soaking a terry cloth bonnet used for wax application for 30 minutes in a solution of 4 to 1 but it really didn't seem to do anything. I'm going to try adding to the wash when doing detailing towels with hot water and see if I can notice any benefit to using it that way.  I also read about how "strong" it is when used for tire cleaning. Again, it just didn't seem to do much compared to products like Bleche White which you can watch work. It seems like simple scrubbing with a brush and no cleaner but soapy water has more effect than Super Degreaser did.	-1
I buy bulk to save money This does not	-1
does a poor job removing brake pad dust/residue	-1
Too many strong chemicals.  I ended up using 409 and it works just fine.	-1
i did not see small print not to use on alum wheels. I bought 2 gallons and cost over $70.00 and can't use it should be in large print up front	-1
Maybe I got a bad can but this looks horrible. Followed directions and watched videos to apply it. It dried with chunks/bubbles in various places from big to small. Now I have to go through the headache of removing it. Waste of time and money.	-1
didn't work on power wheels for kids riding truck, I was trying to get some grip and make the wheels last longer but it did not work for this application. It may work for your needs	-1
2 weeks of waiting and the stuff all came out between the valve and the sprayer so rolled down my hand constantly!  Disaster!  Great product if they can make the slraybhead work- it was not same head as picture on can!	-1
weird bubbles like alkaseltzer and baaad finish as a result. Batch is bad?	-1
Not a great product.  Pealed off very quickly.	-1
they sent me a bad can too, first use it. it just cant work.	-1
Tried to coat my hubcaps and wasn't impressed.  Could be have been to cool weather when I sprayed the, but it just didn't finish as well as I'd hoped.  Then again, it's a $10 spray can.	-1
This stuff is just a pain to remove & makes a mess	-1
peeled off very quickly from roof rack bars	-1
Love plasti dip and have used it many times. I've always used the colors and this review is for the clear. I have to say the clear was terrible for my application - which was trying to lay this down and then the glossifier on my front bumper to make my own spray on and removable front grill. Very hazy and foggy and looked really bad, before and after using the glossifier. Ended up removing from my car and throwing the can away.  Plasti Dip is fantastic for their colors and the glossifier works well too, but the clear was very bad in my personal experience. Wasted my time and money.	-1
So I used this product to coat a smooth interior trim piece that I wanted black instead of silver.  The item is smooth, not textured.  My first attempt was to spray 3 to 5 thin coats per some recommendations.  This resulted in a rough texture surface that was okay until I attempted to remove a hanging piece of Plasti Dip which resulted in removing the product.  Next I sprayed a thick layer per some recommendations to get rid of the rough texture from my light coats.  This yielded a smooth surface (HURRAY!!!!) I got greedy and went for one more thick layer which resulted in tiny pin point holes.  I am going to pull all of it off and buy a good primer and spray paint.  Plasti Dip has some uses for very imperfect applications such as tool handles, water proofing, etc. but that is about it unless you have a paint booth in your garage, that might help achieve a good finish.	-1
Terrible product applied properly looks terrible I want and deserve a refund	-1
The three to four sprayed on coats were still not thick enough coat tool handles and the spray tip clogs between coats even if you clear the tip. The coating is peeling off after just a little use.  If the coating is thick enough it might work better.	-1
Did 5 coats on the new roof rack I bought, leaving each coat dry for an hour and a half in between and as soon as I mounted something on my roof rack it scratched off.	-1
This is a great product, but it can be found at half the price at local stores. Shop around	-1
I sprayed this over painted plastic that I thourghly prepped before I applied this, even took the time to wait 12 hrs between 4 layers it held up for about a months before it peeled off in spots.  This may work well in areas where there is no abrasion or even washing.  I was over all disappointed with this considering all the time I put into applying this.  I will be sticking with paint from here on out.	-1
Bad paint inside... Defective bottles.. They shoot thick uneven paint. I had used this product before and never had a problem. I was happy when I got the package. Not too happy after seeing the results.. Now I gotta spend double what I paid to clean up and start over again on my rims.	-1
Made a mess.  I should have saved my money.  I ended up using marine grade tube silicone for what I needed to water proof.  As messy as that can get, it was far better than this.	-1
This stuff is close to impossible to remove from car rims.	-1
Received completely wrong item.  Threw it away.	-1
With all the correct prep, this product didn't stick as it should and the slightest abrasion causes another peel to start. It was worth a try for the cheap money, but it failed for me...	-1
Not happy with it and CAN NOT RETURN IT. Took forever to ship due to regulations and once I got it, it does not spray evenly. sprays very thick.	-1
Frosted, not clear.	-1
used a more expensive product and it way out performed this stuff. In terms of coverage and durability. Guys you get what you pay for. this stuff is cheap and does a cheap job. the reviews are good because this is a revolutionary product. I would recommend spending more and getting a different brand.	-1
This product is not at all like a plastic coating or a dip.  It works more like a thin lacquer.	-1
Rubbish. It peels off way to easily for it to be useful in any way. I wish I would have returned it to Amazon while I had the chance.	-1
1) You will not be able to return it to Amazon if not happy with, 2) Not labelled but it dries as a matte finish not glossy, 3) Not easy to peel off as others have mentioned - too thin to easily remove by "just peeling off", even after 3 coats.  In order to remove from car bumper and door step (hard plastic - the lower panel where you step over getting in and out of your car), I used my sneaker (YES a sneaker), nothing else was handy at the moment and I tried rubbing it with my shoe and it made little ribbons of rolled plastic and the more I "rubbed" it the more came off. Pulling at these little pieces I was able to remove very small sections of coating. Took about 15 minutes, luckily the door step is a small area (4in X 36in). Need to work on rear bumper {sigh}.  When sprayed on rear bumper, it dried as matte finish, you can't really see it but you can feel it. It has a textured feel.  Will updated on how that goes and what I used, besides my sneaker.  Whatever you do DON'T use this on your car.	-1
Very misleading . It says 20 awning hangers but you get 7.  I was expecting 20 not 7 that's why 2 stars.	-1
Didn't do a thing for our stainless kitchen appliances....RETURNED!!!	-1
I was happy to receive my helmet until I started looking at the quality and workmanship. The vent holes and labeling looks like they were lined up by a drunk 2nd grader. How hard is it to line up vent holes and the label??? If my girlfriend hadn't wore it already I would be sending it back and asking for my money back. I'm glad I bought it as a spare and since she likes to do this weird thing with her hair in a bun I guess it'll work out. I would show you the picture with her wearing it but she would kill me. Lets just put it this way she's a red headed mushroom top. Actually she and I quote, "looks like condom head".	-1
I looked stupid with a giant fish bowl on my head. padding was twice as thick as any other helmet I ever wore. I returned mine.	-1
missing parts I give 1 star  because there is no 0 stars	-1
I've been using this helmet for over a year now and a few things I'd like to get out there about the thing. It is massively bulky for starters. Aside from that it is not constructed very well in regards to the visor. All three grommets holding the visor in place are falling apart meaning keeping it on the helmet is not possible. For the price, you can't go wrong but be advised it is not made for the long haul and looks a bit large on most people.	-1
Yea, The helmet looks alright and I read some of the reviews here on Amazon before I placed my order. The order came in promptly and the helmet was OK for the purchase price but the sizing chart on the manufacturers website is not accurate. My plan was to ship it back to Amazon and get a larger one but as I'm getting my shipment together I dropped the helmet and scratched it. Damn! Now I can't return it! If the sizing chart was correct I wouldn't have to complain.. But since it is not correct, I have a helmet that is too small and cant return it.. IM NOT HAPPY.. I just wasted my money!	-1
You can buy this or dig around in your drawer for a paperclip, jump pins A and B in the connector and turn your ignition switch and count the flashes on the SES light. Really, the company that makes these has some worthy products, with these someone must have been targeting the sucker demographic, hoping no one would catch on. Now you know.	-1
Rejex is suppose to not allow bugs to stick. After applying two coats to the front of our motor home. I found that there was little or no difference in how bugs stuck to the fiber glass front end. I would not recommend buying this product for this purpose.	-1
This product did not perform as expected.  Did not go on or dry clearly. When used it smudged and the smudge could not be removed easily.	-1
Worked fine a few times then the bleeder valve failed and stuck open.  I removed the valve and plugged the port but the seal inside the screw on piece that attaches to the fuel rail had been degraded by fuel.  I see on the manufacturers website a new hose set (everything but the gauge) can be purchased for $13 (includes free shipping).  The question is... how long will a replacement last? Is it worth throwing good money at a bad product?	-1
First time I used it the release button leaks gas..... Not real happy...	-1
Bought this overseas-made tester to troubleshoot a fuel problem with my 1996 Impala SS.  The gage fits fine, though you will need pliers to tighten it enough to stop leaks.  The drain valve is a handy feature, but the clear fuel line will harden after the first use, making it aggravating to use.  The schrader valve connection has a rubber gasket inside that will deteriorate after a couple uses, causing the connection to leak and make the gage useless.  This is a proprietary rubber seal, and local auto parts will not carry parts for these cheap gages.  I have tried an o ring without success.  Recommend investing in a better quality gage unless you plan to use it once and throw it away.	-1
Gauge did not work and posted that info previously but no response from seller.	-1
As a vacuum tester, this item will work OK.  As a Fuel Pressure Tester, the positive pressure gauge does not go nearly high enough to be used on any modern vehicle.  Unless your vehicle gravity feeds its fuel, save your money and purchase a real fuel pressure tester.	-1
bought because price was right, but when received the gauge was defective and had to be sent back to get a replacement. needle would not stay in the right place after one use.	-1
I had purchased this, and it had came in a good amount of time. The problem was with the item itself. Buyer BEWARE the product is of horrendous value. The plastic pieces are of substantial crap. The plastic adapter pieces had broke within the poor quality made hose. Due to both of these poorly made objects, they in turn had broke on each other. In addition to this, the gauge itself is a joke (only tried on fuel pressure). I was getting a 100+ reading according to the gauge when in turn my pump should only be delivering about 30psi. Take heed, this was not an incorrect reading by the operator. The gauge itself SAYS readings are x10 (times 10). Therefore if i got a reading of 3 (30 psi) it would be great. But instead i got readings of 100++ psi. I was amazed and thought either my pump is magically delivering this amount of pressure, or this gauge is faulty by far. I recommend when you see other comments saying it is of poor quality, do not bother to read another comment on success stories. This is an honest review on a first days use. I was careful not to break anything because i wanted it to work for my good, being that i only have so much money i did not want to break it nor waste my valuable time. Now i have to suffer with my mistake of getting a poorly made item, and i have to deal with a customer support that who knows how they treat people. I want a refund without any questions. I will submit another review, based on the product again, so it can be posted here, as well as a review on the service i receive when i mail it back this week. It better be pre-payed returnable.	-1
Received day before yesterday (shipping was very fast!) but the wipes are all dried out.  I thought these containers had a plastic film across the top that you had to peel off but there wasn't one on the package that I received.  Very disappointed in how dry they are.  Will TRY to use but will NOT buy again.  :-(	-1
They left streaks all over my new cars seats.  It took me much hard wiping with a damp cloth to remove the residue left by these wipes.  Maybe they work on some leather but definitely not on the leather used in higher end new cars.	-1
This case sucks its slippery and has little protection against drops. Dropped my phone and my phone completely shattered.	-1
Used on my leather and it only shows it certain areas, does not rub in evenly or easily...kinda bummed.	-1
The wipes were dry and unusable even the wipes at the very bottom of the container. This is normally a good product but this one was old or had a leak of some kind.	-1
Oh ,If I ever got them. They shipped 3 times and never was (ORANGE) cleaning wipes in the box. They gave me the contents of the second box, I guess I should be ok .NOT, They were regular Armor All cleaning wipes, only good to wipe your nose, don't clean for crap. So I was after the third just refunded. Please note they asked me for my opinion on a item I know now Armor All doesn't eve make anymore. Armor ALL really needs to look again at their products that work or don't work. Orange would be back!!!	-1
Cleaning 4-star I used these on my Mark VIII leather seats.  They cleaned well and removed most of the dirt.  Protection  minus 2 star About 2 months after cleaning the leather seats with these wipes, the top coat dye started getting small cracks all over.  Had very few minor cracks before using this product.  I also noticed the leather was very dry within a few weeks after using these wipes.  I would not recommend these on leather auto seats.  I now have to order a recoloring kit due the excessive cracks in the dye.  Prior to using these wipes, I did not have a problem with cracking.  Cannot definitely blame it on these wipes, but the cracking in the dye did not start until a few months after using these.  Why take the chance?	-1
I bought this stuff once, when I first got my car. It left the leather seats greasy, and left the leatther steering wheel cover shiny and eventually the dye started coming off. I bought the same cover and have been using Lexol, and the leather dye has not come off, and is not shiny or greasy.	-1
You know how some of the factories in China have learned, re-tooled and make fairly decent products these days? A few have anyway... Ones where the plastic and rubber isn't off-gassing for the next 5 years or the metal parts are well cast and machined? Well, this product wasn't made in any of those factories.  The parts are poorly cast and badly fitting with a thick coat of super cheap paint. I would not trust this jack. You get what you pay for, I suppose.  I wanted to buy two farm jacks to have onsite building new house and decided to test the quality of the seemingly cheaper one to determine if I should purchase a more expensive one.  I'll be buying a better one, hopefully with better machining.	-1
Very weak. The main bar bends easily when lifting 3500Lbs.	-1
MADE IN  CHINA-----------MADE IN CHINA-----------MADE IN CHINA-----------cheap knock-off junk!	-1
This jack has two roll pins securing the lugs. Each of the two pins arrived sheared off. The jack mechanism itself is poorly cast out of cheap metal. This makes a pretty baubble bolted to my jeep--and not much else.	-1
The sizing is on the small side, should have paid attention to the detailed description	-1
RAISE/LOWER lever would not fully engage into RAISE position w/o much persuasion.  I opened box and began to "test it out."  lever would not move fully into raise position w/o kick of foot or bang w/ heavy object.  This was in my house. I could not image doing this in the field, rocks, night, snow, cold farm, etc....  welds and paint were poorly done.  I sent it back to Amazon w/in 2 hrs and bought HI-LIFT HL484	-1
This is the cheapest knockoff jack ever.  The casting is so sloppy that the up/down lever won't even stay in place. I bent it around as best I could and tightened things up a bit to make it almost useful, but all I'd trust it for is pulling fence posts - not lifting a car with it!	-1
Unable to use them	-1
This part is junk. Oversize mount hole won't clamp on post. Threw in garbage. Not worth returning.  I purchased both the + and - clamps and neither would tighten properly. This is onto a brand new battery. I picked up a couple of cheap lead clamps and they work perfectly. If the slots were cut deeper or the holes were reamed smaller these would work, but these must have been overlooked by QC and got sold as-is.  These might look pretty but they simply do not clamp onto the battery posts properly rendering them useless junk.  Beware of this issue before you consider purchasing these clamps.	-1
I am pissed I paid almost 7$ for a bottle of tire foam no larger than my hand not even large enough for bike tires let alone car tires I was expecting the size I always order 20oz I think this person changed the posting or something and is also scamming people by grossly charging people for a bottle ment for smurfs.	-1
Small container for the price	-1
Unable to use them.	-1
Unusable!  Its to big for my positive battery terminals.  I have a f250 dual batteries and i cant use it.  Great idea but if you cant use them?	-1
This boot kinda fits my accu-gage pressure gauge, but the hole for the stem doesn't line up properly, which keeps the entire boot from sitting properly on the gauge. Overall, it's better than nothing, but I'd expect the company to be able to design a boot for their own gauges that fit properly.	-1
Found it 20% cheaper at walmart... Impulse buy... (now filling up space for the ad to be long enough). Bye	-1
Set it up right after I bought it....the first day I put it in, odor was very strong, by the next day I could barely feel it...2 weeks later and I might as well have not had anything in the car, it's really cheap, but it only lasts a week!	-1
Product is very bad as that smell bad and powerful to the point of suffocation and is located where the fragrance of the cheapest types of perfumes give him a bad evaluation of the item I did not throw at all Satkhaddmha	-1
Bought this product last fall installed it on my truck the chrome is already starting to bubble and peal off not very good quality	-1
I ordered the gauge as described because it had the features that I wanted.  Specifically, a straight chuck and a bleed valve.  The gauge that I received had neither.  It had an angled chuck and NO bleed valve.  It's not what I wanted and not what I ordered.	-1
unknown about gauge because the company that actually shipped the gauge(toysngamesetc) decided(without my permission ) to substitute another type of gauge.be carefull with future orders from this company. You can,t be sure that you will actually receive the same thing you ordered	-1
I ordered one of these gauges from Amazon several months ago. I like it very much as it has range enough to measure my RV tires and resolution and accuracy enough for my low pressure lawn tractor tires. So, I ordered another to keep one in the tow vehicle and one in the garage. However, I did not receive the same gauge as before and not the same as the one pictured. The one I received has a straight shaft (no angled adjustable head) and no means of locking the pressure reading.  Amazon may not have sufficient control of its suppliers, but they should not allow things like this to happen. An inexpensive item like this is not worth the trouble returning, but I am disappointed. The gauge I received just will not work properly for some of the measurements that I have to make.	-1
Failed completely within 6 months. Total waste on money.	-1
i purchased this as a back up to my accu-gage "4x4" gauge since it's a bit easier to have at least 2 tire gauges in the house. this is my 2nd accu-gage 60. my first one stopped holding pressure and i replaced it with my accu-gage 4x4 - purchased on october 2012, is still reading and working fine  this reads the same exact measurements as my accu-gage 4x4 but at half the price, there seems to be some internal differences. my new accu-gage 60 will not hold pressure for more than 1 minute. see attached pic.  pros: + affordable compared to other "bourdon tube" dials + compact size + easy to read dial face, i feel the white face is the easiest to read even at night with a light source + more "accurate" than your typical $1.99 pencil gauges  con: - doesn't like to hold pressure after reading, starts venting after about 60 seconds - doesn't come with rubber surround to protect against drops or bumps - crystal face is made of cheap plastic - easily scratched with high glare reflection in the sun - since lifetime warranty shipping is at least $3.00, not sure if it would be worth the cost. - my first accu-gauge 60 took years to develop a slow pressure valve leak. i'm not sure if this new purchase is just a fluke or all of them are working like this (see pic - both accu-gages initially read "32 psi")	-1
I purchased two units and  have different PSI reading. PSI variation is about 7 PSI between the units.	-1
These are made in China now and are complete junk! Bleeder valve won't seal to hold air for you to read the pressure amount like thier supposed to. Bought 5 of them they all failed within a a few light uses....Buy another brand or style. Myself I'm changing brands.	-1
Previous Accu Gauge/Meiser tire gauges performed well and the bleeder is very handy. Just need to get what I ordered and all would be fine plus it really deserves 4-5 stars because it really is a good tire gauge. Will order again.....hopefully it won't need to be returned.  Update: Reordered and returning tire gauge again because it's not the correct item! I think the seller has the wrong part# on both types of tire gauges.	-1
I bought this clutch for use on my doodlebug mini-bike with the 6.5hp swap.  It works for a little while, but doesn't last long.  It quickly becomes really jerky, and smokes.  At full rpm it will fully engage, but it's a bumpy ride getting there.  I highly recommend instead going with the Hillard clutch if your using it for mini-bikes, or go-karts.	-1
Should have bought from a different place or seller. DOES NOT COME WITH ANY HARDWARE! And as far as I could tell I recieved a used clutch and am in the process of asking for a refund so that I can buy the Hilliard Extreme Duty Clutch, which seems to be way better in every way and it also comes with all required parts for correct install. This one might be great if its all you need to replace but on a fresh build its a hassle and a bad one at that.	-1
I initially ordered a different product that was reportedly shipped to me then the next day I get an email from the seller telling me the product was damaged and that they would be back in stock in 9-10 days and they would ship me my order then. I cancelled my order because I wasn't waiting  weeks for my order and the seller was a little shady when replying to emails. So then I was stuck trying to find a replacement.  After some looking around I found these and although they were not exactly what I wanted they would be more than adequate. I was thrilled when I got the notice that they would actually be delivered to me a day earlier than originally estimated. When they finally showed up I was less than enthused. The box looked like it had traveled through a war zone. It was crushed, torn, and essentially open. The rails had obviously fallen out as had the hardware and everything had been stuffed back inside. I checked to make sure everything was there and it was.  Later that day I started the install process. The instructions were fairly clear and everything went well. Until I unwrapped the rails themselves from the bubble wrap they were wrapped in. I think I may have gotten a return item because one was wrapped in clean red wrap and the other was in dirty clear wrap. Both rails had some pretty nasty scratches on them, but luckily I had some black touch up paint that I use on my truck. The kicker is when I unwrapped the second rail (after EVERYTHING else was attached of course) and along with the scratches there was a good sized dent in it.  Sure the product works, but I didn't expect damaged product. I would return them for another set except the box fell apart once the 2 straps holding it together came off. Never again.	-1
changed head on my pump (as I have done this before) and this one did not work properly. When running it was pulsating and very small pressure. After many troubleshooting tasks, put spare pump I keep on hand and spare worked fine. Pump head is faulty, whether it was seller selling me a used head or whether it was justa faulty new one, I don't know. Will probably find another seller and buy another and throw this one in trash!	-1
Complete garbage, the metal plate that screws into the trailer frame broke in half after about 2 weeks using the control arm	-1
Missing parts 2 times	-1
Sadly this item arrived at my house for the second time w/ missing parts. The replacement item did not have the exact same part as the previous order. Missing part listed in parts list = No. 8 #48390 Sway Control Bar Plate, QTY 1. This piece is pictured w/ the other items in the group. it's the smaller plate that is to be welded onto the hitch. SAD!	-1
Easy to install but on the 4th day the self tapping bolts came out-stripped out of the frame. It was adjusted as recommended and I never backed up or turned too tightly. I felt it helped and will likely pay to have it welded in place. Lost one pin and 4three bolts. I would probably buy a Reese equalizer hitch with anti-sway next time but I have an Eaz type.	-1
Purchased the Camco weight distribution hitch and it was recommended to purchase the sway bar; unfortunately, it is difficult to fit both on a 6 X 10 foot trailer. Also the hieght of the trailer frame was smaller than the base plate holes so it would not have fitted anyway. Amazon SUCKS in that although the parts made by the same manufacturer did not work together as advertised, Amazon did not care and when I returned it I only got 50% of my money back. I now LOOK ELSEWHERE instead of Amazon since I now know several trailer company websites offer a FULL REFUND if parts don't work together when they are supposed to.	-1
This unit worked really great until it was about 4 years old. From being parked outside and road salts etc. the friction pads came loose and there's no way to repair them, therefore rendering the unit useless. I would think they would use some other way to fasten them instead of a dab of glue that lets loose when the unit gets rusty.	-1
Had to contact Amazon regarding my purchase of this battery last year. As it's quite cold in the North East this winter, my barn stored Mustang Mach 1 has a battery tender solar charger hooked up constantly. Went out to do the regular weekly start up and my new Optima red top battery was stone cold dead and would not take a charge. Amazon, to their credit is sending me out a brand new one under the warranty. I will post a follow up review regarding the replacement battery. My trickle charger has a float switch so it turns off when the battery is fully charged. My opinion is that this really should not of happened at all, perhaps a defective battery, time will tell with the new one, stay tuned.	-1
I bought this battery for my boat on June 25 2016. Do to unforeseen incidence I did not get to use my boat this summer. I do have a float charger connected. Went out to winterize and the battery has nothing!! How do I get a replacement?	-1
I bought this battery to replace the one in my RV and boat. Ive used it once on the boat. It worked great the one time I had my boat out. I put it in my RV when I left for Fl. My RV is a trailer. I used it over night once on the way here. I put it on a charger/ mantainer I tried to use it the other day and it was completely dead. I put it on a charger but it won't take a charge. I bought it in July last year. Thank you	-1
I have been using Optima batteries for the last 15 years.  They used to be very good and would last several years.  They are also sealed so you do not have to worry about acid leaks or spills.  The last three Optima batteries I have purchased have only lasted about 1 year.  They have changed something in the recipe and it has ruined a great battery.  I would recommend you find another brand of battery if you want to depend on it for more than a year.	-1
junk i had 2 of them in my hummer and neither made it 2 years. went to the recommended jell cell and no problems at all	-1
Been using D34M's in my boat for years.  Seems like the more recent ones, after 2007 or so fail quickly.  The latest boat anchor is the one I just purchased March 2017.  Died for now reason and would not take a charge.  They just are not what they used to be.	-1
These batteries lasted less than 2 years. They are not warranteed if you buy them from Amazon. Don't waste your money on batteries that are not backed by a warrantee.	-1
This battery failed in just over a year. Won't take a charge. It arrived banged up and I should of never accepted it. This has been my worse and most expensive mistake for internet shopping. Do yourself a favor and buy your batteries locally. I'm sure a local merchant would work with me if their battery went defective in 13 months	-1
Murphy's Law??  Died after 2 months.	-1
When you purchase these batteries from Amazon be aware there is no warranty. Amazon claims it is Optima Battery's responsibility and Optima claims it is Amazons and the consumer is stuck in the middle with a defective battery.	-1
Here goes the 2nd attempt to post a review. Apparently amazon wouldn't post my first review " although it adhered to its guidelines ". Damaged box, 2 of 6 damaged cells, cracked lower base and split upper casing. The battery was damage free however the dust on top was unacceptable. Both batteries had a shelf life for the past 6 months to 1 year " based on the manufacturing date showed on the battery ". Don't recommend to purchase batteries online.	-1
battery came on time worked great for 4 month then started having trouble with not holding charge. Had all equipment checked and working great, then in 5 month it died. I needed a replacement battery but could not find a dealer in my area. I had to but another battery and now try to get amazon to help with money back. I have been told I will have to go through Optima to get a refund. Be careful if you buy this battery.	-1
Battery showed up in a beat up box.  It was only protected by paper.  I think it was leaking something when it arrived.  Probably going to have to dispose of it, I need to figure out how to get a refund or another one.	-1
This battery is fine, but not necessary. For the cost you get a measly 1 year warranty. For the same price you can get a Yellowtop with 3 year warranty and it'll work in a marine environment just as well. Save a buck, get a better battery, get a longer warranty.	-1
Dead cells in 3mon of use. Had to purchase a new one.	-1
I wondered why I cannot find reviews that are more recent, so this review is from the last Redtop. The battery had a lifespan that was the same as most flat cell batteries. This one recently installed in the Volvo will be watched for the lifespan and if what some are saying that the quality has dropped in recent years then that will be the end of them.	-1
Unbelievable! I read many of the reviews about POOR packaging, or NO packaging.  I thought after all of the negative feedback from customers, the distributor and Amazon would figure out the correct way to deliver these batteries. Mine arrived UPS in about 1 week, and lucky I was present when it arrived.  NO Packaging at all.  The battery casing was damaged, the base was all chipped up, and the bottom looked like it had been used for a skate board!  The UPS driver was also upset that there was no protective packaging since it is considered hazardous material.  I ended up buying the same battery at Battery Plus (for about $38 more with tax), but at least got a battery that looks new.	-1
Lasted six months less than the three year warranty and it should have made it past at least three years.  More crap made in China or Mexico no doubt.  I went to Sears and bought their best DieHard at least there I can take it back if it fails.  No such thing with Optima or Amazon.	-1
Worked well for a short while. But It wasn't worth the money for me. Hasn't been a year yet since i bought it and its dead already	-1
One of the worst purchases I've ever made for my vehicles.  Not only was it one of the most expensive batteries I purchased, but it was also one of the shortest lasting.  It wouldn't start my car after sitting overnight (multiple times).  I have a really good (AGM) battery charger and charged it a few times.  Then it would start my car.  A week or two later, same thing.  Took it to get it replaced/tested and they told me it was fine and they wouldn't replace it for me.  I told them to keep it and bought a cheap walmart battery.  It's been 4 YEARS with the walmart battery and no problems.  Needless to say, it wasn't my car.	-1
Optima's used to be great batteries.  I actually got 11 years out of my first one which was amazing. Now I can't get much more than 2 years out of one. Optima warranted two batteries from two different cars for me which was good customer service but since Johnson Controls bought them and and moved production out of the US the quality has tanked.  These are certainly not worth the premium price. Try Odyssey batteries or East Penn's Intimidator I have had much better service from those brands.	-1
I bought two new Optima red tops for my daily driver Dodge Diesel pickup about three years ago.  I just had to replace them.  The truck started cranking slowly and testing showed less than half the rated cranking amps were being delivered.  I've never had a battery fail in only three years, not even in a motorcycle or lawnmower.  They're twice the cost and the warranty is no better than other batteries.  From what I'm reading on the various reviews it seems the Optimas used to be a great product.  Now they are made overseas in a very large Asian country and they've had quality problems since the move.  The large warehouse store I bought my batteries from has since stopped selling them in their tire department.  They told me it was due to the high number that were coming back.	-1
This battery lasted three and a half years. I should've bought a lead acid battery for half the price. Lightweight though if it matters to you.	-1
I bought this battery in May 2009.  It just suddenly failed Dec 2010.  Just over 1 1/2 years.  I originally bought the battery for my Mustang because of the early reviews and the 800 amp capacity.  Perfect for my car.  Now, researching why the battery died so suddenly - and quickly - I read on another site that it really is a good, powerful battery - just you have to disconnect it when you're not driving so the trickle doesn't drain the battery.  The stock battery that was with my car when I bought it lasted over 3 years (plugged in the whole time.)  I read enough about Optima's poor customer service and not honoring their warranty that I'm not even going to bother trying to get warranty service thru them.  I checked with the local Ford dealership, a mechanic friend and a rep at Advanced Auto Parts and they all agreed that it sounded like the battery was the issue ("a short inside the battery.")  In fact, after I described what happened to the Advanced Auto Parts rep and he recommended getting a new battery, I told him the problem battery was an Optima and he called across the store to another worker, "Hey, Carl!  I got another customer here with your favorite battery!"  I highly recommend that anyone avoid the Optima batteries.  They will give you great starting power in your car, but they appear to have a habit of dying suddenly and without warning about 18 months in.  Mine was great the last time I drove, then after not driving for 2 days, I got in the car and the battery was totally dead.  (And I'd gotten back at night the last time, so I'm sure the lights were off - they shine right on my garage door.)  I'd only recommend this battery to someone who just needed a battery to connect to as needed.  The rest of the time, it could just sit there. Or if you live in a cold climate and are okay with changing car batteries out every year.	-1
This is a tough call. One the one hand the Powerbuilt 648744 vacuum pump appears well made. On the other hand, it's really not very practical or effective. It's cylinder volume (the amount of air moved per stroke) is simply too small to be very useful.  The Powerbuilt's volume is sufficent for automotive brake bleeding, but there's another problem associated with bleeding. Vacuum bleeding causes air to be pulled passed the bleeder screw treads into the line to the Powerbuilt. This results in an endless stream of bubbles as the Pump is worked. One cannot determine when the brake system is free of air.  The Powerbuilt 648744 is an effective vacuum pump, but it's small volume limits it's application. Perpare to be frustrated by this limitation. I also cannot recommend use of this product for automotive brake bleeding.	-1
Purchased battery and it made it one year only, not a good battery at all, waste of money..	-1
17 months into owning this battery and it won't charge over 6 volts.  Update #1: Contacted Amazon customer support about the issue, as the product page indicated I should do.  They directed me to Optima customer support.  Spent 15 minutes on the phone with Optima customer support and got exactly nowhere.  Update #2: Contacted Amazon again and was offered a $28.67 (12% of the current battery price).  I recommend saving your money folks.  Head to Wal-mart and snag a battery there where they actually take batteries back when they die inside warranty periods.  Angry Update #3:  After getting the run-around from Optima I was able to discern that they had a fix for my low voltage problem; I simply had to buy an additional car battery to hook to the Optima in series in order to trick my charger into charging the Optima!  Why on Earth would I have a spare, charged car battery kicking around, Optima?  I now need to purchase an additional, conventional car battery in order to get the Optima working.  How on Earth is this an acceptable solution in their mind?	-1
Doesn't charge.  Worthless. Went dead after 2 weeks won't recharge.	-1
I have 5 vehicles, and over the years, and for almost a decade I'd buy nothing but the optima batteries.  But for the past 4 years it seems, and doesnt matter on which car I have the battery tends to only last 18-24 months.  They've always been good about getting me a new battery under warranty, but then by the time the replacement fails it seems to barely be past the 3 year warranty mark. and Im stuck paying for a new one.  For my next round of battery purchases I'll be switching over to a company that offers 5 year warranties.	-1
UPDATE:>>>>>>>>>>>>>> BUY A BATTERY THAT IS ROUTINELY STOCKED<> AND NOT A LUXURY ODDITY BATTERY LIKE OPTIMA> THE WAY OPTIMA IS SOLD< THE WARRANTY IS USELESS TO YOU! INTERSTATE'S AGM BATTERY IS SOLD AND STOCKED BY SHOPS EVERYWHERE<> FIRESTONE TIRE CENTER< MIDAS MUFFLER< AND 1000s OF GARAGES. OPTIMA IS SOLD IN SUCH A WAY AUTOZONE MAY HAVE "ONE" BATTERY IN STOCK, OR THEY HAVE TO ORDER IT IN. WHEN I WAS ON VACATION THIS LEFT ME SLEEPING IN MY CAR WHILE IT WAS -6 DEGREES IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLIZZARD. I BOUGHT AN INTERSTATE BATTERY.  If you buy one of these buy from Amazon! Autostoned sold me one that had sat on the shelf so long it was junk. My thought was, "At least I can return it", which I did, but Autozone did not have another one in stock. After a call to their regional manager, and the police I got my cash refund. I was not about to buy another Duracrap Golden Turd Battery. Autozone did give me a free battery, but next time I am going back to an Interstate AGM battery. Interstate batteries are sold at 100s of locations across the USA, unlike Optima, or Duralast Golden Turd Bricks. I am on the road, and need a battery I can exchange on warranty. Autozone wants to play games. O'Rieleys is okay, but the warranty is not very long. I found Interstate was sold in more places than any other battery. Amazon was great with the warranty on an Optima for one of our business vehicles, purchased on that account! Having to get it shipped to a neighbor's house was a pain in the ___! It also cost an extra $120 for 24 hour shipping from the billing address. Amazon gets 5 stars, but Optima gets 1 star, for not marketing these nationwide, or honoring their warranties through other retailers. That seems sleazy to me. It seems like a great way to dodge their warranty obligations on a premium high priced battery.	-1
Only lasted about 2 years. It does not stay charged more than a week now.	-1
It did not fit. I had to take a big hammer and hit the center tab for two smaller bolts for in the center of the hitch. I had to bend it towards to the front of the SUV so it can fit. It looks like it was welded in the wrong spot.	-1
I spent big bucks for this over a wet Walmart battery. It went south in a couple months and I couldn't return it. I have a couple other Optima batteries that seem to be doing OK. Guess this was just a bad one. I buy them because I don't like acid rotting my battery box and car frame. That's reason enough for me to go with dry cell. The battery is easer to replace than the car.	-1
the battery arrived with the red plastic surrounding the negative post cracked, I do not know if this works in the vehicle yet as I have not installed it.  While the packaging was good and did not appear to be mis-handled by the carrier, it seems that this broken plastic piece was missed at the factory.  I certainly expected more for a $150+ battery and with no returns on these, BUYER BEWARE.	-1
3 months after buying this thing, it has died. I go to use a charger on it and it says the 12v battery is now a 6v Battery.	-1
NO WARRANTY - Do not buy this from Amazon!  After less than one year, this red-top battery has now failed to keep a charge. Optimas normally come with a three-year warranty right? I've been told - no - NONE, ZERO if bought from Amazon! Do not buy it here or you may regret it in the near future. Thanks a lot Amazon - you should put that in BOLD letters - NO WARRANTY. Had I known this, I would never have bought it from Amazon (who usually is good for warranty items).	-1
I've used many Optima batteries over the years and never had a problem. In fact, I was a dealer at one time. This battery failed and can't be returned to Amazon, so I'm stuck with it.	-1
Been using red tops and yellow tops for years. Great deal on Amazon. This battery was completly juiced due to some other electrical issues and could not be recharged via auto parts store chain charging. and I can't return it. The majority of retailers have a 3 year replacement warranty. The price on Amazon is so tempting, but just spend the extra $50 or so and get it from you local auto parts store. Now I'm out $150. 5 Stars for the battery, 2 Stars for the return policy.  Update May 2013: I got the Optima 1200 charger and it fully recovered the battery.	-1
First off, the build quality seems top notch.  The welds are clean, the paint is even and it appears to be very solid.  My review below is for the fitment, and I gave it a low rating because it does not fit right over skid plates even though the instructions specifically state it will.  I bought this for my Grand Cherokee thinking it was going to be an easy install.  I have OE skid plates, and according to Curt, this is no problem since you simply do not use the provided spacers for the furthest rearward hole.  I spent 3 hours trying to get this thing to seat correctly on both sides.  I finally gave in and went to my friendly mechanic which required myself and 2 mechanics to get it to fit right.  It sits too snug over the skid plate and it is impossible not to scratch both it and the hitch considerably during installation.  It is a shame because that nice paint job on the hitch looks terrible now and will probably rust soon.  Bottom Line is Curt should make a model for skid plates and without.  Additionally, the bolts included were the wrong pitch AND one arrived broken so it cost me another $9 in hardware.  I wrote to Curt and I was told they would have engineering look into it.  Update: 1/29/11 Curt continues to list this as "Including Laredo & w/ Skid Shield", so I guess they have no plans of addressing the issue.	-1
Below is a copy of the email I got from Optima regarding a battery purchased from Amazon. So be aware the money you are thinking you are saving maybe costing you big time. You should also know that for marine batteries Otima is strongly reccomending the use of there $200 charger to keep them charged properly.  Hello John,  Amazon.com is not an authorize online OPTIMA retailer, We do not know where they acquire the OPTIMA batteries nor does Amazon.com honor the OPTIMA warranty.	-1
I have had two of these batteries in the last 6 years and now I need another. Both of the previous Optimas worked great and then at the three year mark they just die. And when an Optima dies you are dead in the water. Call a tow truck because they won't even take a charge when they die. I have been left stranded twice already and I don't intend to be a sucker anymore. They seem to be programmed to commit suicide right after the three year mark. Unless you need a pretty battery for your engine compartment I suggest you buy a regular battery or at least purchase a roadside membership from AAA etc...because you will be stranded. I've had WalMart cheap batteries last twice as long!!	-1
returned product didn't fit the jeep ( my bad )	-1
Make sure you will get the right part !!!!  Disappointed I bought it months age and i was laying on the balcony to set it up. I went to garage to install it but unfortunately this does not match my car what was Guaranteed on check-out.....I contacted the Seller  and they could take it back -20% (market price) but shipment on my cost what does not make sense (Receiver is big and heavy....shipment exceed price. I will ask seller what does it fit and i will sell it on my own....Thank you :(  1999 Grand Cherokee Limited ...	-1
Not even close to fitting like it says. Holes do not line up and does not fit around fuel fill and vent tubes. Was suppose to bolt right in with existing bolts but new bolts were sent. These will not work to to it having a square tube frame.	-1
Purchased the hitch. Had problem with installation. Contact curt and told me it was due to damage to my vehicle without evidence. Returned and bought another one from amazon. Installed without problem. So "it's your fault if it doesn't work". That sucks.	-1
I ordered on the bright idea of replacing my old lead acid batteries in my '95 7.3 F-350.  They not only are much smaller than stock/recommended batteries but the way they are held in place requires using their riser/base.  As they do not fit properly, they slid around, right out of their bases which are poorly made, and were unusable in my truck.  Also due to their different dimensions my cables didn't reach the terminals and I ended up having to rewire a bit.  Total loss that cost me not only the price of these 2 batteries (as they CANNOT be returned) but also time, and the price of 2 more batteries that fit my truck.  I will say that a 3rd Optima that I use in my Toyota truck has worked well for the past 6 months without issue.	-1
I have had many many optima batteries. This one does not hold a charge and it's less than a year old. Very disappointed.  These optima batteries have been bullet proof for me in tha past and I see the other reviews are not that good. So I'm guessing their source for these are a lesser quality item toi begin with. They did refund me the money which was good!	-1
