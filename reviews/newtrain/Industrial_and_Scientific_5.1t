This worked really well for what I used it for. So for my purposes it is getting full marks. This is an all around great, durable, and afforable sandpaper.  Pros: -Grit cuts really fast and evenly. No random deep scratches like I have seen in some cheaper paper -Didn't even have a hint of clogging up. -The adhesive is just what I needed. No permanent, but wasn't going anywhere.  Cons: -None	1
Fast cutting and good adheasive.	1
Worked great for my lapping bench.  I would like it if the adhesive were backed with waxed paper for storage and keeping the grit out, but all but the first 6 inches or so still functioned when it arrived.  I used rubber cement to remedy that.	1
As advertised	1
seems like a pretty good value as opposed to buying it at the big box stores by the sheet.	1
Good Product	1
This stuff is great. Adhesive on the back and you can place a strip on a superior flat surface such as a cast iron table saw wing or on a piece of granite countertop and you have a perfectly flat sanding board.	1
strap and lap it with this roll and keep on moving	1
Works great on speed bloc sander.	1
Only used a small amount ot the paper but it works with the porter cable profile sander	1
Absolutely love this and my "old" Porter Cable 330!!  I also use this product on my hand sanding block.	1

I cut off little pieces and stick them to a piece of hard board, and use them to dress plane irons and chisels that actually have nicks in the edges.  It's a little coarse for sharpening, but it's good for removing material to get the backs of  plane irons and chisels flat, establish the bevel, get them square across, and get them ready for sharpening.  I have rehabilitated tools that I had quit using.	1
As a hobbyist, I frequently need to sand the surfaces of the items I create.  Being able to stick strips of this PSA sandpaper to a tongue depressor gives me the perfect control that I need to sand small areas.  Great sandpaper!	1
Good product. I stick a length to my workbench where I carve and use my Dremel. Handy for the poor mans jointer trick too.	1
Worked well with the Proter Cable Profile sander just had to cut off the size needed to go on the profile . .	1
The alternative	1
After trying to get the sandpaper latches to open on my palm sander to no avail, I got this adhesive-backed sandpaper. Stuck a piece on and it is still stuck and sanding after a week! Less waste too, since there's no need to wrap around to catch in the latches. I'd never used sticky-backed before but now I'm a convert.  Very quick to stick on.	1
decent quality sand paper, it doesn't seem to last as long as other papers in same grits	1
Works flawlessly.	1
As stated in another of my reviews, this just great! And ... it comes in several grits.	1
I've been using this "sticket" sandpaper for years.  My son borrowed my 120 grit, and I already know it will never find it's way back home, so I ordered a replacement roll.  I always keep some 80, 120, and 150 grit in my shop.  I can't sleep at night if one of them is missing.  I love it.	1
Its gritty and it sticks. Perfect for your pad sander or your wood sanding blocks.. I have several grits. So much cheaper than buying single 8x11 sheets.	1

Great sandpaper	1
I have been using this all week with a sanding project I am doing with garden furniture... they work great... stick amazing.. and last a long time... Great product I have been using this with Trade Associates AF44L 7 Piece Dura Block...they work great together	1
JUST STARTED USING THIS AND SO FAR i LOVE IT. GIVES MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR CHANGING OUT GRITS ON MY SPINDLE SANDER. STICKS TO SPINDLE BETTER THAN PRE-FORMED ONES.	1
Use this in my woodshop, works great for facing table saw jigs for grip traction of work pieces. Use it for shop made sanding blocks, will by more when I run out.	1

the adhesive does not stick to wood as much as I would like it to.  The pieces come off too easily.	1
I have a very old (20 plus years) Craftsman 1/4 sheet sander. I got it because you could cut down full sheets and clip them to the sander.  Well after 20 years the clips are just plain worn out and no longer hold the sheets in place.  Well 1/4 sheet adhesive backed paper is WAY too expensive, and I have not found any full sheet sticky back.  I was just about to toss the sander in the garbage when I stumbled across these rolls.  I decided to give them a shot and I'm so glad I did.  The adhesive sticks well to even my 20 year old rubber pad.  The sandpaper is very durable and long lasting.  I'm using this mainly for wood, but won't hesitate to go after metal or fiberglass (should the need arise).  At only 20 cents a pop this is one of the most economical adhesive backed options around.  I'm gonna have to order a couple other grits cause this stuff is great.	1
Very good and well made product etc, I use it to prepare surfaces for painting and other uses as well.	1
This is an excellent product easy to use on my three block sanders. I keep all grits in stock. The adhesive does not dry out.	1
I have restored many old desks which I acquired from a local University surplus auction.  These oak desks were very good quality, but they unfortunately had an ugly black top on them.  I am unsure of what the black surface is, but it seems to be some sort of plastic/synthetic.  After stripping the desks and removing the edge trim from the tops, I used Gorilla glue to attach furniture grade oak plywood to the black surface.  After making a new edge banding and using traditional finishing techniques, the desks look like a million bucks.  I experimented with other adhesives, but found Gorilla glue to be the absolute best for strength, working time, and cost.  There is a bit of ooze-out when clamping pressure is applied, but I just wait for the glue to dry and scrape the hardened seepage with a chisel befor sanding.  I highly recommend this glue!!!	1
as described	1
Use it to reattach soles to shoe.	1
Love this stuff. It works great and is strong and long lasting. Metal, Rubber, Wood. Does it all.	1
gor	1
Works	1
Michael & Bar's pos review convinced me 2 buy...it sticks	1
Cap makes reuse easy by keeping spout open. This is a superior glue I've used for wood, shoe rubber and other heavy duty jobs.	1
This is the best way to repair an air mattress hole of any size! Cut a piece of any cloth and put glue on both sides and apply to hole. After about thirty minutes put any kind of paper over the cloth and press down to eliminate the bubbles. keep pressing out the bobbles till almost cured, or dry. About three hours. :)	1
it's gorilla glue. read the directions, try not to make a mess, make things stick together incredibly effectively, like maybe epoxy level of effectiveness. note that the tip needs to be cut off, there's no weird trick to it, it just needs to be snipped off and then you can put the cap over it when you're done. additionally, when the directions say THIN LAYER, it's a thin layer, this stuff expands and you'll see some "great stuf" around the edges of your seal if you use too much.	1
this s--- really works- always have the product on hand	1
Best dependable glue I now use in many applications.	1
Great Product	1
Great product, drill pilot hole in ceiling, squeeze gorilla glue into hole, dip ceiling hook into water, screw hook into pilot hole, wait until dry, enjoy peace of mind knowing shop lights won't come crashing down in while you sleep =)	1
Thanks this is just what I needed	1
Works great.  We have used it for many different things and it has glued everything.  My favorite glue.	1
I love this stuff especially for anything that will be wet a lot.	1
This is the best glue I have ever used...great holding and bonding power, on everything I have used it on, thus far.	1
be ready expands alot	1
Gorilla Glue eight ounce size. Most of us have been in a home repair situation that just keeps getting worse the more you get into it. When that happens worse means more cash to fix the problem. There are those who say just "do it right" or don't do it at all. You know who you are. I can agree with them, when there is money to use, but when there are no funds there is..... Gorilla Glue. Well here is my story.  I had a small problem that quickly spiraled into a carpenters truck payments. I had a loose toilet. Not a big deal right. Tried to usual tighter down the loose bolts. No help they just kept turning, which means the terrible and dreaded WOOOOOD ROTTTTTT. Yes Houston we have a problem. The tiolet flange that holds it in place was rotten from some sneaky water leak somewhere not visible. This insidious leak had taken its toll and caused great damage under the bathroom tile.  In comes repair guy 1 then second opinion guy. Remedy; You gotta take that toilet out, bust out all that floor tile, cut out the sub floor, put in new sub floor, put in new tile, new toilet flange, and re set toilet then grout everything. Estimate to "Do It Right" nearly two grand. Since you have a carpenter, then a tile guy, then a plumber guy. My heart sank as I knew how much cash I had at the time.  My thoughts. The floor seemed good everywhere but around the flange. The toilet while it would turn and lift on one side was still holding fair on one side. If only I could just shoer this thing up where it would be stable. I wish I could just shoot something in there that would fix everything and not go in debt.  How about Gorilla Glue. No that would just make a bigger mess. No here me out this might work. No it won't Gorilla Glue expands and will screw up everything. All this was the conversation i was having with myself in my head.  Ok lets do this but how to get it under the toilet. I took the bottle of glue and went to the hose department at home depot and found some clear plastic hose that would fit on the end.  The process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.  The attack. Hose on bottle, one side of toilet is lifted, hose inserted, squeezing and not much is happening as this glue is thick. Plan B, set glue bottle on floor use foot pressure. Eureka we have glue flow. Pumped about two ounces all around the toilet. Luckily the high pressure from my foot did not make the hose come off and get all over my shoes and the outside of the toilet.  Ok ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.  All in all it worked. Solid as a rock. No leaks. Used some white silicone caulk around the base. The choice was either eight bucks for the glue, or nearly two grand that could better be used for other things like beer, new flat screen tv, taking the wife out to dinner sixty times, or other electronic man toys.  This glue saved me. In life you come across small things that work their way your heart for how well they help you or serve a purpose. Your uses and millage of course may vary. Good luck always.	1
I have to say Gorilla Glue, has worked on everything that I have used it on. And I have used it often and on just about anything one could think of. I have used it on my camper floor, and shower, as well as fixing a running light. I used to repair the seal around my garage door, and a broken handle on a city trash can. It fixed a tear in camp chair, and a broken ice chest lid. I had ordered a Tampa Rays coffee mug, and it came with a broken handle, I glued it back on, just to see if it would work on a jagged edge, instead of a nice smooth surface, it has held for a year now. Now, having said that, I must say, I have not put that particular coffee cup, into the microwave, as I am not sure what that amount of heat would do to the glue. Make sure that you do not use more than it takes to do the job, as it spreads when it gets wet. I learned that lesson the hard way. I always have a bottle of it with me, or at least within arms reach, because you never know when it will come in handy.	1
Love this stuff. Foams up and bonds really well. Been using it for the longest time and never had anything fell apart. But it can get messy. It hard to judge how much to use.	1
I love Gorilla glue.  If i want something to stay forever i generally use it.  You just need to account for the fact that it will expand as it dries.  So make sure that there is room for that otherwise it may ooze out of whatever you're gluing.	1
I've used this glue before and really recommend it.filles voids and drys like steel. Caution, use rubber gloves when working with this glue, It turns black on your hands and takes 4/5 days to wear off. Nothing will remove it from your skin. Great product, great vender. I will order from theses folks again as needed.	1
Works great on most everything. Glued some new shelf door holders in a fridegerator that was craked and kept falling off. Not anymore. love it	1
8oz Original Gorilla Glue.  This is a good strong glue.  I use the full line of Gorilla products.  I can always count on the quality of their products.	1
It sticks like crazy to most surfaces. I bought these smaller packs as it tends to go off when opened. For anything that really needs to hold this is my goto product. Note this stuff foams a bit so not ideal for decorative joins but otherwise awesome.  TIP if contact between surfaces isn't tight, spray a little water on; it will make the glue foam up and bridge any small gaps.	1
If you need glue to fix most anything and your don't car what it looks like, just not to fall apart. . . well. .  this glue is for you.  It foams and fills before it dries.  Make sure you put something under the object being glued becasue when it foams outside the joint, the object will be glued to whatever surface it is sitting on.  I highly recommend the product.	1
Once you get familiar with with how this works, then it's easier to strategize how and when to use it.  It's very messy to work with and takes a long while to set up.  I've used GG (and other brands of the same type of glue - which, incidentally, seem to be identical to the point that I don't really have a preference) for countless things over the years:  I repaired the broken frame of a Nordictrack skier that developed a crack (I glued the crack and clampled it, as well as glueing and screwing a piece of wood to the side, along the crack and a few inches beyond on either side), put a kickboard on the screen door of our front door which is starting to deteriorate at the lower corner, built a small playhouse ladder, and about a million other things I can't recall.  It works well and bonds seem to be very strong.  I generally use glue as a supplement, not as the only source of bonding (if possible).  I've repaired some non-wood items as well.  Some have worked fine, some not.  As another review mentions, you can peel the dried glue off of the nozzle when you're opening it for another use - so it's probably not the best choice for plastics.  I've done some ceramics and it's been fine - the foaming as it dries can of course make the end results look less-than-perfect.  Overall GG is very useful, and there are plenty of things for which it works very well and where, say, super glue doesn't do the trick.  I don't know if it's better than wood glue for wood projects.  From what I hear it's not, but I don't always have wood glue around, so I'll use this.  The most important advice I can give is: don't buy too big of a bottle unless you really use it a lot.  When you're done using it, squeeze as much air out of the bottle as you can.  I've never been able to actually finish a bottle of this kind of glue, because as I get to the last third or so, it usally hardens or there's so much dried glue at the top of the bottle that I have to cut apart the bottle to get to the remaining glue.  Squeezing out as much air as possible before closing the cap will mitigate this to a large degree, but at some point you just can't get enough air out and so you start to see the crusty, hardened end of the life of your precious bottle of glue somewhere on the horizon.  It's the circle of life.  For glue, anyway.	1
Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle). I've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue.	-1
1) Elmers "Ultimate High Performance" is a Polyurethane (PU) glue and it's as good as Gorilla (another PU Glue) (As far as I can tell) but cheaper. also used the PL brand glue and can't tell any notable difference between the three. Have not used Sumo and from what I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life (this is generally not a good thing - see item #2)  2) This has a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. PU glue foams up and you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be more than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle - I can't even imagine buying the 16 oz bottle. PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.  3) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking. They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.  4) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! PU glue is waterproof and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google "Dog Gorilla Glue" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper.  5) Aliphatic wood glues (Like Titebond II) are still better for wood to wood bonding. Fine Woodworking did a test (Issue #192) and found Polyurethane glues to be about half as strong.  [...]  If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!	1
"Gorilla Glue" has become one of the most used "tools" in our house. We have used it to repair wooden chairs, fix a wooden medicine chest, glue soles back on to sneekers, fill cracks in a wall, and at least half a dozen other fixes in the past month.  Here are my observations:  * You must read the directions! * Surface needs to be damp for the glue to work * Use clamps when possible * It expands a *LOT*, use with caution or you might accidently glue your project to the table as it expands overnight! This happend to me :-) * This is strong glue and hard to get off once it is on a surface  Highly recommended!	1

Pros: -Really tough glue -More flexible than super glue -Waterproof -Works on many surfaces, metals, wood, ceramics, some plastics, etc. Best for wood applications.  Cons: -It expands, drips and produce tiny bubbles during the drying process. This is my biggest gripe. Definitely not for repairing your Lladros or others applications that require hairline precision. -Glue is not clear but yellow. Very noticeable, not good if you really want a clean finish. -Make sure you really clean the tip of the bottle or it will be hard to open and use it the next time -Expensive	1
Our concrete driveway had dozens of cement patches (to fix concrete pops), many of which were higher than the driveway's level.  This grinding wheel, mounted on a 30-year-old 4.5" right-angle grinder, easily smoothed the patches to the surrounding level. If you grind on a windy day, you won't even need a respirator.  Great product at a reasonable price.	1
Does a pretty good job for the price. It did the job I needed it for but wore out quickly. If you have a lot of grinding to do, invest your money in a diamond studded wheel.	1
Typical DeWalt high quality	1
Worked great for our projects	1
This is another great blade for my angle grinder that came in handy in mobile home demolition.  Hopefully, you won't use it very much, but it will do the job.	1
A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT THAT WORKS GOOD.	1
good buy	1
Used this to shave down slump stone that was rough on a block wall. Worked great and has held up very nicely.	1
Works well.	1
Works as advertised.	1
It's hard to draw that fine line of where the ol' Black & Decker reputation ended and the quality of DeWalt begins. So far I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased with the DeWalt name on it, including this product. I know that I pay more for schtuff with the DeWalt name on it, but in the long run it's usually money well spent when compared to other products.	1
It will take some time, as I am trying to even up and entire patio of wandering cement.  But eventually we will be done.  And the Dewalt small angle grinder kit I bought with it is too cool!  Power hand tools are so much fun.	1
tried this out on a stone i needed to grind down for a perimeter wall i am building around my garden.  worked great.	1
These are great for any demolition or cleanup work you need to do. Priced competetivley here on Amazon, they give you exactly what you ask of your tools. They go to work and don't let you down. Have used them for several projects and they hold up to a beating.	1
Working solo I used one 2601Q to raise a 26ft long by 9 foot tall 2X6 wall with little problem. Jack tends to bind if the 2x4 is not smooth, and then the rachet requires persuasion using hammer taps.	1
Slightly confusing at first, once you get things together and lifting - WOW - couldn't have raised my 9 foot shop walls without them. Make sure you get the wind hook safety attachment with them.	1
How could you frame without these? You would need a bunch of people, that's how	1
I bought two of them to build my house. They work beautifully and must if you are framing your house with only two people.	1
I bought these as a DIY'r who didn't want to by the  4K offered by the Big Box Stores.  They worked and didnot jam... recommend them if you have a situation like mine.	1
What can I say; they are staples. Shoot fine, don't jam my gun.	1
it work so well	1
They are staples...They work... Extra strong... Think staple size of a construction hammer tacker (not an exaggeration, actually that size)....	1
maybe if u wanted to  upholster a seat on a chair ok other wise  not good for wood workers sad	-1
Good replacement wheel, very low price, packaged and shipped very safe.	1
happy	1
works and wears well and fit perfect	1
Replacement for an old wheel.  Haven't used it yet.  Looks like the old one (most all new products are shadows of their former selves), so it's probably okay.	1
These are good quality abrasive chop saw wheels that seems to outlast cheaper saw wheels from Harbor Freight and others. I will buy again.	1
Have only needed one so far, work fine.	1
Works great for cutting metal pipes.	1
Good price on a good blade.	1
works  good and great price	1
excellent products.  This cuts so fine I use it to trim off the end of my CIGARS.  Dewalt always good blades, wood and metal.	1
They work well	1
Item exactly as advertised, cuts great.  This blade seems to cut better than the cheap Harbor Freight ones, but not very much better.	1
Fast ship great product Thanks	1
This is a good blade for my chop saw.  I have used generic ones that may be just a bit lower cost but they seem to wear much faster than this one does.  First time buying one of these on Amazon and it was delivered well and quickly.  I will buy this again when needed.  The blade is well made and seems to be lasting.	1
Rips easily (a good thing in my case) and lasts through the job. I used this to sand down some wooden bedroom furniture to prepare it for painting. I think it did a wonderful job	1
Quality sand paper....	1
Arrived on time and exactly as described.	1
Exactly what I needed. Well Packaged and as described.	1
This is a good quality sandpaper for softer woods such as pine. I does a good job sanding but does need replacing often as the abrasives fall off after one or two good uses.	1
as expected	1
great paper and works really well.	1
It works for the project I needed. NNothing else  to say about good sandpaper.	1
As advertised	1
I used these tubes to clean my wood shop. I attached them to my 2.5 inch diameter hose&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/2-1-2-3-FT-TO-20-FT-E-Z-Flex-Dust-Collection-Hose-By-Peachtree-Woodworking-PW515/dp/B0048J0CGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">2 1/2"- 3 FT TO 20 FT E Z Flex Dust Collection Hose By Peachtree Woodworking PW515</a>&nbsp;and then clean all over the place. I compared them to my current wet-dry vac tubes; these are better made and fit my accessories better. My old tubes kept coming from each other and wobbled, but these tubes are solid.	1
Worked as expected	1
fit as advertised and work well too...	1
My new wet/dry vac came with two 20in tubes. add two more and now I can reach 6.66 feet. that is very helpful sometimes.	1
This worked great for adding extension to my gutter cleaning attachment. Now with slight difficulty, I can clean the second floor gutters without climbing up the ladder. Tip: if you are planning to clean gutters, do use duct tape on every joint.	1
Fits and works great.	1
Worked well with the gutter cleaning kit.	1
Read closely, Two 20 inch tubes.	1
I used these to extend my blower to get near the screens over my pool area.  Gets rid of those pesky pine needles in a jiffy!	1
Works great	1
Seems to be first quality. Can't beat the price and free shipping!	1
Fits as advertised.	1
Just what I needed	1
Sadly I had to purchase the lid separately but it fits great. Very solid and perfect design to fit the dedicated can	1
It's holding up well outdoors.	1
HIGH quality and RUGGED	1
Useful	1
What's not to love? It fits and I did not have to purchase a complete new garbage pail.	1
PERFECT!	1
The gold standard of trash can lids	1
Fits the Brute good.	1
These trash cans are really tough.  They are industrial strength.  This one will fit two tall kitchen trash bags if they aren't really stuffed. I only wish the lid came attached to the can.  But then it would eventually break off like my lesser quality can. I recommend!	1
Fits good, tough.	1
EXCELLENT	1
perfect fit and much cheaper then what the stores here want	1
The lids fit perfectly on the trash cans that we inherited.  Glad they have lids now.	1
What can you say about a trash can cover. It works, fits tight and is strong. And my aquarium water is safely covered.	1
the lid is much flatter than I expected!  I would prefer a bit of a dome as shown!	1
lid that fits perfectly on my Rubbermaid Brute 44 gallon garbage can	1
Just what we were looking for.  We could not find new lids for our large, heavy duty trash cans as ours had gotten lost in a storm.  We found them here and they fit perfect.	1
Snaps on very secure.	1
Does the job	1
If you purchase the can this lid is a must.	1
Its a lid, it fits the garbage can.  Sturdy well made thick plastic	1
works great,exact replacement	1
Rubbermaid 32 gallon cover for BRUTE commercial trash can, perfect fit, snug and made of strong material. Good drip lines so water will not pool for bugs. COLOR GRAY.	1
Fits my Ace Hardware 32/33 gallon (can't read label any more) trash can perfectly, including latching.  Will see how long it lasts as the sun here in Southern California fries most lids within one year as they are outside year round holding various gardening supplies.	1
Brutes are the most heavy duty you can find.	1
Fits nicely on the 32 gallon Brute trash can.	1
It is what I needed.	1
Great Item	1
The brute cans are as advertised, great product but also not cheap	1
Very good	1
very happy with purchase	1
exactly what was needed	1
It works fine.	1
What can you say about a garbage can lid. It works, lol.	1
I've had a pair of these and the cans to match about 8 years now. All are in great shape still. Like these best of 3 different types I've bought.	1
After it arrived, I remembered I never put a lid on the old can, so... It fits and is nice but is not as needed as I thought.	1
I used this product to fill 1/16" - 1/8" gaps on my house's siding last year when I repainted.  It's been 11 months since we painted and this Dap brand caulk is already failing in roughly 75% of the joints.  This stuff is terrible.  Update: reached out to DAP regarding their 40 year warranty and have heard nothing back.	-1

It is reasonably priced, easy to apply, long lasting, paintable, and cleans up with water.  One trick for painting is to make sure that you prime first with a stain-killing type primer to avoid a more glossy look than the rest of the painted surface.  I use the white and clear mostly, unless there is a direct color match with something like pre-painted siding, for example.	1
Purchased this to re-caulk the kitchen sink, works as it should.	1
These cans and lids are the only ones that racoons have not been able to open aside from being nearly indestructible.	1
Did the job	1
good	1
Great for protecting the contents of the Toro collapsible yard/garden debris container from rain and critters when one needs/wants to leave the container outside. This lid actally fits snuggly over and grips the outer edge of the container's opening.	1
Good seller A++++++	1
Good product.  Received in good condition.  This lid and the container are quite strong.	1
Works great and a much better deal than buying local.	1
Exactly as advertised. Works well.	1
exactly as advertized, quick shipping	1
It was a little frustrating to have to buy the lid to the trash can separately.  It was quite pricey too.  Really curious why they are not sold together.	1
Trash cans deserve to have their contents concealed. This is the companion lid for the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rubbermaid-Brute-32-Gallon-commercial-trash-container/dp/B0085OEE1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rubbermaid Brute 32 Gallon commercial trash container</a>.  Fits its 32-gallon trash container companion perfectly. Reduces 100% of the unsightly visuals of the can's contents, and all but the strongest scents.  Select with confidence for your 32-gallon Brute.	1
I ordered one of these for a 32 gallon can I was getting.  Soon realized as I looked at it, that it was perfectly flat, so wouldn't allow rain or snow to slide off it, and I expect ice would probably crack it at some time in the future.  I returned it for another, on my dime I might add, and got a domed version to fit the can.	-1
This is a toxic cancer causing product off gassing in your house.  The smell it terrible the product shrunk after being applied and cause stretched holes that lead to leaks.... Go get some silicone or an ECO-Bond Heavy Duty you will be much happier	-1
The reason it's not more than $2 is because it should be sold in the dollar store.  If you respect your house at all you won't use this smelly junk	-1
Works good, sticks to pretty much anything.	1
Good for bathrooms, doors, etc	1
best caulk	1
I have used this brand for years, but this time when I ordered two CLEAR, I recieved two WHITE, it says clear on the tube but they are very white. very disappointing, I am using it to glaze cabinet glass, white will not work.	-1
great product. works as described	1
What's there to say? It is a vacuum hose attachment. It works and there are no moving parts to break. Does that work?	1
Worked as advertised. Great folks to deal with	1
just a stock brush..........good price	1
As advertised	1
Buy a caulk gun and use these larger tubes over the small ones - this will go much further for the $!  We use this type of caulk for doing windows, caulking between wood, etc.  This is NOT for bathrooms!  Cut a small slanting tip off the tube and this will work great.  Use Youtube if you are inexperienced with caulking - very easy and it makes a huge different for window seals and bathrooms!  We sealed some walls of a room that someone had built in our barn.  Worked great for keeping the dust out!	1
Great item.	1
I was worried when this came out white, but thankfully it dried clear. Works good. Great company.	1
good	1
Worked great in my bathroom project.	1
Great soft and easily removable.  I used it to seal up gaps around the frame of window screens.  It comes off easily so I can remove them if needed.	1
Well-made.	1
Best value, quick ship.	1
Wish the bristles were a little fuller, but overall good product for the price...	1
A little disappointed with the price. I don't see any reason this small piece of plastic should cost 8 dollars. I was also expecting higher quality for the money.	1
works ok for its purpose	1
I dug 3k sqft of baseboard out from between a textured wall and travertine tile. this stuff enabled me to fill the crevace left behind and then seal the gaps when the baseboards were replaced. I love this stuff.	1
GREAT PRODUCT.	1
easy to use;works well;suggest purchasing a cap for the tube in case you don't use it all at once to keep it from drying out	1
I always trust the brand, and this at a couple dollars each it was a sweet deal. It works just as it should.	1
This is half the price of the hardware store and does exactly the same thing. I needed one but I bought 5 because you will never see that price again!! Get it NOW!!	1
Works for me!	1
This is a good attachment product for your Shop-vac,,, I would have given it a 5 star, but some of the brush fibers come out with use,,,	1
I was going to buy this brush vac at HD but I thought $9 was outrageous for something so simple and cheap to make.  So, I bought two here and if the shipping is included you wind up paying about $3.50 per brush.  Since they don't last for ever having an extra is good. I can't see any difference in quality with the one that came with my Shop Vac.  I use them to suck up sanding dust before finishing furniture and wooden bowls-they work fine.	1
I use this every day when I clean out my pellet stove, really knocks down the ash from door window and sides of stove.	1
Fits and works well.	1
i give this 5 star .. about my self i need this part to use it in car or windows or sofa	1
I bought it to be able to pick up plaster dust without plugging up the regular filter.  Works well for the purpose.	1
This is a review of the Shop-Vac 9067200 10-14-Gallon High Efficiency Disposable Collection Filter Bag, 2-Pack.  Darn these are expensive. I go through these bags pretty quickly because I've been doing a condo reno and am busting out a lot of drywall. It's the kind of fine dust that will ruin a shop vac if you don't have sufficient filters. This does the trick and installs easily. Keeps the shop-vac from spewing out dust as fast as I am sucking it in. Without this filter, sucking up drywall dust is a lost cause.	1
works as advertised	1
Fit exactly and work great at a good price.	1
The usual high quality from Shop-Vac.	1
Dry wall dust will not escape these. Cleaned an entire new house after the drywall finishers left and went through four of these bags, but the inside of my shop vac showed very little evidence.	1
This is a very important accessory and really helps when you have a dusty job. They hold a lot and do not typically plug up until completely full.	1
I use these in my Rigid and WAP vacuum cleaners.  They are far superior to Rigid's bag, definitely worth the extra cost.	1
Great bag for fine dust, I have used these for several years now.  They are a little expensive but worth the cost.  I use these with Shop-Vac's Ultra Web Cartridge just to catch any remaining dust.  I am confident in using this combination for sanding drywall in my finished house with little to no release of any additional drywall dust.	1
I picked these bags up to add to my Shop-Vac 9633400 ordered here on Amazon.  When I first got my vacuum I used it heavily after some big project work.  Everything got dirty and clogged after the big clean-up, so now I've got a new filter with bags to keep things clean for more normal usage.  These bags fit perfect, and work exactly as expected.	1
Works great at a good price	1
These work as advertised.  If you are working with drywall, or cement / mortar, the fine dust you'll be vacuuming up, will clog your circular paper filter and cause your Shop-vac motor to burn up.  You must use these bags, or remove and clean your circular paper filter very often.  I got tired of the later and purchased these bags.  Never been happier.  Highly recommended.	1
Used these bags in a 16 gallon, 4hp shop-vac to clean ash out of a burn pit and a fireplace. These bags are what I use to clean out fireplace ash at the end of a season or when the fireplace has been sitting for a couple of days and there's no way to pick up a hot ember.	1
If you do any vacuuming this is the way to go. The bags aren't cheap but they hold a lot of dust preventing clogging of the cartridge filter. Prior to using these I'd have to clean the filter several times a day and get dust and grit all over myself. With the bags, do go several days of sanding and cleanup before the bag needs replacement and the cartridge filter is relatively clean. Don't get any dirt on you when you remove the bag.	1
Keeps the inside of your Shop Vac nice and clean. Do I have to tell you that you can't use these paper bags when doing wet clean-ups?	1
Fits my 12 gallon 6.5hp shop vac	1
Great fit and they work very well.	1
I use these to line my shop vacs now for all purposes except when picking up water.  The internal bag contains the junk you pick up and keeps the dust down from the exhaust. I used to dread the day I had to empty the old shop vac. Generally there was all sorts of crud in there and there was no way to clean it out without getting dust everywhere. Now I just pull out the bag and toss it in the trash.   These particular bags fit pretty well at a good price.	1
These work fantastic for sanding drywall!	1
Fit perfectly in my old Dayton Wet Vac.	1
These bags are original ShopVac brand.  They work extremely well when vacuuming small particulates (drywall dust, fireplace ash, etc.) and are the same bags as the big box stores but at a much cheaper price.	1
Bought the two pack for my Craftsman  XSP 12 Gallon 5.5 Peak HP Wet/Dry Vac  Model 12006.  I'm using the standard white/red stripe filter.  I needed to sand a couple rooms worth of drywall/joint compound.  I tried sanding with my Dewalt Sander with the vacuum attachment.  The shop vac was shooting out the exhaust a fine dust cloud.  Basically, the standard filter is not enough to stop all drywall dust.  And, after a short while, it totally clogs the standard filter.  However, when used with these bags, you basically get no dust shooting out the shop vac.  And, your standard filter stays clean.  Highly recommend for doing drywall or other fine dust collection application.  Clean up is a snap.  Simply take the bag out and toss in the trash.  Without the bag, its a big dusty mess.	1
Any old bag will do, until a cheap one breaks apart as you're trying to change it. When it comes to vacuum bags, you usually get what you pay for. Although these are not the cheapest I could use in my Shop-Vac, they're durability makes them worth the extra couple bucks.  For those who don't know, you should never use a vacuum bag with your Shop-Vac if you intend to suck up liquids. Moisture will turn any vacuum bag to pulp. Refer to the manual for instructions on how to configure your Shop-Vac for wet cleanups.  I can't think of anything I would change about these bags, except maybe the color. Why do they have to be yellow?	1
Have only used one so far but fit and function seem to be spot on for my unit.	1
This bags are kind of expensive but they trap fine dust and particles so you don't end up breathing them in. I only use about 2 bags a year so they aren't a major expense in spite of their price.	1
I like the idea of dust free handling of dirt and dust.  You can open the end of the bag dump the contents and stapple the bag back closed.  Have gotten three to four uses on reusing the bag before tossing it.	1
I wish I had known about these from the beginning. Even works for graphite with no mess. Just toss the bag when full and you are done.	1
We buy these high-efficiency bags for our aging shop vac, because they work the best.  They collect every bit of dust, dirt, debris and fuzz and protect the filter from getting dirty too quickly, and the motor from damage.  We don't bother using less expensive "regular" bags, since these are large capacity and not that expensive ($6 each)	1
I bought this for a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vacmaster-VBV1210-Detachable-Blower-Wet-Dry-Vacuum-12-Gallon-5-Peak-HP/dp/B0023EY052/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vacmaster VBV1210 Detachable Blower Wet/Dry Vacuum, 12 Gallon, 5 Peak HP</a>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vacmaster-VCFH-Hepa-Fine-Dust-Cartridge-Vacuum-Filter-Retai/dp/B002MUAGEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vacmaster VCFH Hepa Fine Dust Cartridge Vacuum Filter & Retai</a>  What can I say - if you hate cleaning the junk you vacuumed, and if you like keeping your tools clean: buy this. I know it is somewhat expensive, but it is all worth it. They hold great, they don't tear, and they are big. Try it - you probably won't go back to no-bag vacuuming.	1
good	1
WORKS GREAT	1
Work great	1
AWESOME nails just like you buy it at your local stores.	1
These work great with little to no jams.  But get a much bigger box than you think you'll need.  You'll save more in the long run.	1
Outstanding!	1
Gtrat product	1
I have bought nails at the big box store and the plastic strips ALWAYS are poor quality and I get misfeeds.  These have never caused a problem.......about 5 boxes through my Hitachi so far a NO issues.......	1
Not sure how you rate a box of nails! You open the box and there they are. They fit my nail gun and they come out when I pull the trigger.	1
I would reccomd these nails for anybody who owns a nial gun to use on thier next project, buy now.	1
WORKS GREAT	1
Good product	1
what can I say nails	1
Excellent.	1
great item but the gun was a POS had to returned the nails	1
gr8	1
Just make sure you have a lot more than you need.	1
These work great in my Bostitch F21PL Round head nailer.  I have bought several boxes of them.	1
good product, but a bit pricey.	1
Good product	1
Good job	1
$17 per 500 box?  Overpriced!	-1
I have bought nails at the big box store and the plastic strips ALWAYS are poor quality and I get misfeeds.  These have never caused a problem.......about 5 boxes through my Hitachi so far a NO issues.......	1
I've found these B&C Eagle full round head nails to be decent. They worked fine with my Porter Cable FR350 framing nailer. These nails came in a 500-count box and were more expensive per stick than buying in bulk, but I don't use bright 2-3/8" framing nails that often so didn't want a pile of them hanging around after the job was done.	1
Not a jam at all. High quality nails. They don't jam or stick. I like the rack you can get different lengths from the same manufacture	1
You open the box and there they are! I loaded them into the nail gun, pulled the trigger and they came out.	1
As long as these are the correct thickness and angle for your nailer, you should have no problems. I had only one misfire and I think it was my own fault.	1
This box of 500 nails are ideal for the DIY'er.  You go to the big box store and they have them in 2500 or 5000.........okay for the contractor but way too many for around the house.  This way I have a good assortment of the nails that can be used in my gun - without breaking my wallet.  Sometimes when you can't find the nail you need at Amazon, check out the Home Depot that has tool rental - you can get them there in small amounts....they don't gouge you either!  These nails are quality nails and I recommend them without reservation, my gun has never jammed or had a malfunction.	1
These are awesome!!!!!!! After scratching up my wood floors by using subpar stick on pads (that would just collect dog and cat hair and ultimate fall off).. These are very secure. Now.. If they wear out, how will it come out and will a new one go in without slipping out of the existing hole. I don't know.  But I do know that they allow the furniture, dining room chairs and table to slide without complaint and WITHOUT SCRATCHING YAY!! :)	1
The product is good solid,and sturdy. Good company,knowledgeable,and helpful people.	1
delivered promptly, performs as advertised	1
These are great for any demolition or cleanup work you need to do. Priced competetivley here on Amazon, they give you exactly what you ask of your tools. They go to work and don't let you down. Have used them for several projects and they hold up to a beating.	1
I bought 2 of the dewalt brand cutting/gringing wheels - the 1/8 for a narrow kerf and where I was mainly going to cut, plus the 1/4 for surface finishing or post welding touch up.  You need to hand tighten these with the arbor lock button pressed pretty good or they will spin themselvs off when the trigger is released due to the weight and inertia.  There is no locking system used on these since they have embedded screw threads that mate with the arbor.  The embedded mesh lets you do face work even with withe 1/8" blade, so it's sort of a do-all, but for work where I want to bear down on it I bought the 1/4"  The dewalt quality is definitely here in these cutting surfaces, from the threadded screw-on convenience to the mesh in the compound to protect against breakage.	1
Works as advertised.	1
works fine	1
Typical DeWalt high quality.  Works very well	1

As you can see in my video, it makes very quick work of concrete and is a bit slower going through dense brick. But it will definitely cut through any masonry and is very good for cleaning out old joint work.  A few safety tips, as I mention in my video, when cutting masonry:   I always wear good eye protection when cutting with my grinder, as dust and bits of rock will really fly around!  A dust mask or respirator is also key, as the dust masonry cutting puts off is pretty impressive.  Gloves are also key, just because of all the flying rock and dust  Note that some people run their grinders without the guard on when cutting masonry, but I prefer to keep that safety guard on their and just cut on the front 1/2 of the wheel  I've used DeWalt products for many years now, and totally swear by the quality of their tools. This masonry cutting wheel is no exception -- you can do quite a lot of cutting with this wheel before having to install a new one.  ................. This product was NOT given to me as part of any promotion. I bought it after doing some comparison shopping and this review is entirely the result of my own opinions and use of the product.	1
Seems fine, haven't used yet.	1

Worked Great on my Dewalt angle Grinder	1
Bought it to get rid of the sharpness from some pieces of metal and did not regret it. It worked perfectly. The surfaces were smoothed out with no issues of getting cut. Highly recommend.	1
Worked great	1
Worked great	1
OK	1
Typical DeWalt high quality	1
Solid Dewalt product.  The unit is incredibly strong and rigid making it impossible to believe it would not apply pressure evenly.  It is top quality as I expect and the Dewalt genuine name is unquestionable.  Love these Dewalt products.  I buy them whenever I get the chance.	1
cut my oil tank in half	1
Is as expected. Cuts like a dream and lasts as long as any.	1
very good grinding wheel.	1
Works	1
On time and as advertised	1
Great product	1
Very stiff, I thought it was flexible like a flapper. This cuts metal.	1
Fast ship great product Thanks	1
works good	1
Does the job.	1
DEWALT ANYTHING IS GOOD	1
These do the job and last a long time.  No complaits, the quality of DeWalt comes through again.	1
nice	1
Have only used once but these are some tough discs.	1
As expected	1
Quality metal grinding wheel.  Makes short work of rusted or corroded fasteners.  I repair equipment that usually suffers from moisture damage and this wheel eats right through the rust.	1
Used to shave down jagged edges on a metal/iron gate, worked awesome and didn't have any issues.	1
I've used no name cheap disks.  The Dewalt disks last four times longer! although the May not cut as quickly.	1
Great for grinding sheet metal on auto body work and also chassis.  Last longer than I had expected.  This is the threaded screw on type grinding wheel which makes for fast and easy changing of disk.	1
gift	1
It's a grinding wheel. performs as stated and works with my little grinder quite well.	1
Very happy with purchase.	1
I have always had good lock with these cutoff disks.  The last a long time and cot through most metals.	1
Great! Thanks!	1
Worked great, nice having  bigger vac attachments	1
Quality wheel, most DeWalt stuff is good!	1
I don't get the negative reviews...  It was as described and works great!  I have the wall mounted vac with 20 foot hose.  It is a love hate relationship, works great at that length for dust and light debris.  However it cloggs with any significant amount of material,  this hose solved that problem.	1
It's hard to draw that fine line of where the ol' Black & Decker reputation ended and the quality of DeWalt begins. So far I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased with the DeWalt name on it, including this product. I know that I pay more for schtuff with the DeWalt name on it, but in the long run it's usually money well spent when compared to other products.	1
This is not a high end disk with a high price, but it does a great job for the money.  Dewalt has done an excellent job with their abrasive grinder disks.  They are well balanced, do not experinece excessive fast wear, and still do not break the bank. Enjoy buying in confidence.	1
never expected this grinding wheel to be so thick when it arrived.  didn't read the specs to well i guess but extremely happy with the performance of the product	1
This product is well made, functions as described, fits or otherwise conforms to it's intended purpose, there were NO negative issues at all.	1
DeWalt makes good blades.  Some will argue they are expensive, but in the long run they out last the competition.  Just be sure to follow to follow the safety instructions.  I recommend w/o reservations.	1
We seem to use a number of these restoring an old tractor. These have lasted the longest of any of the products we have tried.	1
These are great for any demolition or cleanup work you need to do. Priced competetivley here on Amazon, they give you exactly what you ask of your tools. They go to work and don't let you down. Have used them for several projects and they hold up to a beating.	1
Easy on, easy off. I haven't used it much yet but it seems to works well for its purpose. Good price too.	1
work	1
I returned it because it didn't fit.	-1
Works great. It's a perfect fit for my 6 gallon shop vac. The larger diameter increases suction power compared to the 1 1/4" diameter hose, and I can suck up bigger things without worrying about it getting plugged all the time.	1
good quality product.	1
It work's great!	1
Ideal for odd sizes.  What I didn't realize is that this adapter is made from a rubber like compound, not the hard plastic used for almost all adapters.  It is conformable and you simply cut off (I used a hack saw) the portion you don't need.  I had an odd coupling between a Festool vacuum and a small Jet sander and this is the only way I could make the connection work.  The cut end is rough and I suppose I could use a sander or fine knife to trim the edge but it hasn't proven necessary.  Quality is good, material is conformable, highly recommended.	1
useful	1
Works as expected. I don't have to move the vac as much now	1
Crap.  Doesn't fit my shop vac hose and Amazon wouldn't take it back, so I literally bought it and threw it in the trash.	-1
works good	1
It arrived in good time, works great & did not cost a lot. I do recommend this seller.	1
Having purchased an already expensive shop-vac that came with a tiny 1/2" or 1" hose I was already disgruntled about buying this. It works the way it should but my shop-vac has lost suction due to the increase in hose diameter and it doesn't work as great as it should. Needless to say I will be purchasing a Craftsman shop-vac down the road.	-1
This is an excellent accessory kit. I upgraded to the 2.5" hose and attachments because my small hose would get clogged every easily. Now with the bigger hose nothing gets clogged anymore. I'm surprised at the increased amount of suction I'm getting with the bigger hose. You have to be careful not to suck up your tools because they will easily fit down the hose. If you have a powerful shop vac that is still using the 1 1/4" hose, you are missing out on a lot of power.  I like getting two extensions with this kit. You can put them together with a utility nozzle and vacuum without having to be bent over. It's also great that this comes with a hose. Most places charge more than this kit for just the hose alone. The crevice tool is big and doesn't get clogged. It still can fit into a lot of small spaces.  I found this on amazon after looking at my local stores for some 2.5" shop vac attachments. These accessories were about $9 plus tax each. The cheapest hose I found was $20 plus tax. This kit makes sense if your looking to upgrade to a 2.5" hose and Amazon has a good price on it.	1
I had originally purchased this for my DEWALT D26451 Orbital Sander. I first was trying to figure out in what ways I could get it to fit so at first I was disappointed because the smallest end would not fit, but the larger end would fit, but then when the other end was hooked up to the hose it simply was too small to slide on the ShopVac, what I did find though was that on the small end, simply by cutting off a single tier to the adaptor that the next notch up fit my DeWalt with a slight bit of modification. I give it 4 stars because after I cut the small end off it does exactly what I need it to, I took away a star because I had to modify it, but other than that, this thing worked beautfully for what I needed it for... so If you have a DEWALT D26451, THIS WILL WORK, but you will need to cut the smallest tip off using a razor and trip up the inside of the cup and need to stretch it slightly and after that it just slips on like a glove. Since I purchased this exclusively for use with my D26451 modification was not a big deal and especially since the modification was a simple and easy 2-minute fix.	1
This kit is a great way to get the most out of your shop-vac.  It includes all the attachments you need to clean up any mess.	1
A useful tool.	1
I used this to make an adapter for connecting my ShopVac to my Dewalt cutoff saw. I just cut  off the sections that I didn't need. Very easy to do.	1
This is a turd in the salad bar.  It does fit my Shop Vac straight extensions, but not my hose and not my tools.	-1
Not very useful.  the sizes I need are not adaptable. I have a output of 2" dia. this connection does not fit the output hose.	-1
This is truly a universal adapter. With different diameters you can easily cut it to size that fits your vac. It will adapt to shop vacs as well as household vacuum. I use it to attach to my Makita circular saw and hook it up to the Rigid 12 gallon shop vac, and it works beautifully.	1
I have found this Shop-Vac universal adapter to be extremely handy and have several that I use all the time. I've trimmed some of them down to use with specific tools, but others I left full length. They will fit, or can be made to fit, the dust ports on several of my tools, including my Dewalt DW423 RO sander and Makita 9220 belt sander as well as the coupling on my 1" Porter Cable vac hose. I have one that is trimmed all the way down to the largest cuff and permanently attached to my Makita 2703 table saw dust port and another along with a 2" rubber Fernco connector that is permanently attached to my Delta 28-150 band saw so I can quickly connect my 2-1/2" Ridgid shop vac hose whenever I use them. These adapters are a little expensive for what they are, but have work well for my needs and really do seem to last. Some of mine are probably around ten years old now and have had heavy use, but are still fully functional, so I think they were well worth the expense.	1
I have 3 of these to accommodate several tools that need dust collection. it has all the popular sizes ready to trim.	1
Cut the first node off and the inside of the next one fits over the 27mm port on Festool sanders, routers, jigsaws. The outside probably fits inside the port on the saws, or close enough.  My Festool saw is in another state away so checking isn't convenient - this widget does lack the groove in the rubber that helps hold the Festool hose inside the saw port however, so this is probably not optimal for use with the saws.  The material is flexible rubber, not rigid plastic.  As such it stretches a bit and is carve-able with a knife to make it fit.  I'm using this to adapt a Festool sander to a Kobalt brand wall-mount vacuum. Compatible with the Kobalt hose and with the Festool port. Works great and no threat of popping off in use.	1
It boils down to this: this is an entirely featureless, overpriced piece of short plastic pipe. But it does exactly what it needs to do.  This coupling isn't really a sawed-off pipe section; it's a molded piece with good dimensional tolerances and finished edges. It is an external coupling, so it grips the hose ends around their exteriors, and uses a good friction fit to hold them together. Since it couples externally, it doesn't act to decrease the vacuum hose diameter at the point of connection.  Two weaknesses:  (1) most of my hose connections have locking levers that latch into grooves on the attachment pieces to prevent them from pulling out. This coupling doesn't have any such grooves, so it's friction fit only, unless I want to come up with something quick and dirty to latch one hose end to the other (such as a wire loop).  (2) it's completely indistinguishable from any cut ABS pipe laying around, and I fear can be easily lost. This coupling really ought to  be brightly colored, and/or have distinguishing marks of some sort on it, so it doesn't inadvertently end up in the scrap bin. Nothing a wrap of bright yellow vinyl electricians tape won't solve.	1
aok	1
I use this coupling in setting up my dust collection system in my garage shop	1
Good product.	1
Definitely works well when combining two shot vacuum hoses.	1
A bit pricey for what it is but it works great and should last a long time.	1
The purpose of this coupling is to connect a second length of hose to standard hose that came with my Shop Vac. However, despite purchasing this Shop-Vac coupler and a Shop-Vac hose extension of the proper diameter, this coupling does not provide sufficient grip to keep the two hoses connected. I had to put a layer of duct tape on the cuff of each hose before inserting them into this coupler, then duct tape them together on the outside of the hose and coupler in order to prevent the hoses from slipping out and apart at the slightest nudge. If I'd known I was going to need to use duct tape to hold the hoses together with this coupler I would've simply doubled up on duct tape and done without it.	-1
Great coupler	1
It's just a black plastic coupling, but is durable and an exact fit for the cuffs on my 2-1/2" shop vac hoses. I use it mainly to couple an extra 8' hose to my regular vac hose when I need the additional length. It's probably a little expensive for what it is, but you need it when you need it, so is pretty much a must have item for your shop.	1
I needed to connect two hoses. and this works perfectly. Well made like all other shop vac items just check your diameter first!	1
Attaches my 2.5" shop vac hoses together and does not slip off or come loose. It is a hard plastic and is fairly durable.	1
This coupling was a perfect fit on my Ridgid shop vac hoses. I can couple several hoses securely which allowed me to place the vacuum further away while dog grooming.	1
The instructions say to use the brush with the guards on.  I have a 4 1/2" Porter-Cable and it is a very close fit.  The brush sparks on the guard but cuts fine.  I guess the 4" wheel would have been better in my situation.  You'll probably have to take the guard off if you do much with this brush.  I also have a smaller cup brush and don't have any issues like this one.  I gave it Stars because it does what it is supposed to do.	1
This is one of the grinding attachments my husband had me get for him to go with the new grinder.  The sole purpose was to grind rust off his lawn machines.  This one allowed him to get into areas that the others couldn't go.	1
Great last for ever	1
Did a great job	1
It works well for removing rust and old paint.  You have to wear protective clothing because it does shoot the occasional wire.	1
Good	1
I believe in name brand when it comes to wire wheels. I do not like the bits of wire that break off of cheap brand wheels and stick into my arm. Dewalt wire wheels do hold up and last longer than others.	1
I had a damaged spray in truck bed.  Some very rough edges had to be removed before it could be re-sprayed.  This brush on my Dewalt grinder did the job.  Also cleaned rust off metal gate.  Very handy.	1
Good	1
Tough polish wheel, hours of use and i'm not sure it has shed anything yet. It's a little too aggressive for aluminum but works great on steel.	1
THis is for gross removal of rust, crud and corrupted material in a hurry, using a right angle grinder motor. It certainly works, just remember it is not a Dremel and will walk all over you if you don't hold the motor tight! It certainly does work and did a good job on my vintage trailer frame. Use good goggles 'cuz whatever you're blasting will fly all over the place cuz this means business!	1
This wire wheel is a beast ! It eats paint and rust for breakfast. Used it to strip a Bilco door in conjunction with paint stripper. Made the job much easier.	1
strong	1
VERY GOOD	1
Tight quarters wire brush, works well	1
One of the best wire wheels out there.  Here's the scoop, you can pay more for this one or you can buy cheap import junk wheels and burn through 10 of them before the DeWalt wears out.  These are the finest of wheels	1
Work great	1
OK	1
GREAT	1
works great for slag removal.	1
Well, this is aggressive. I thought I would take some UCoatIt epoxy off the floor, and not only did it do that, but it actually removed the concrete in BIG chunks.	1
works well on the side of materials	1
Excellent brush	1
Good Quality!	1
Good quality, fair price,  bought to have on hand in case needed.	1
As expected	1
Tough brush for the angle grinders. Very stiff brush that can remove the most stubborn material with your 4 inch angle grinders. This is a versatile accessory and tool guys love accessories. I was removing rust from an old fire place damper and it was like Rustzilla offering a satisfying domination over the forces of corrosion and gunk. If the wife get the hubby one of these she will have total control over his will power for weeks. Maybe not.	1
good price does what its supposed to.	1
No more wires being spun off and hitting you and going all over. The TWIST wheels and TWIST cups are the way to go. I have had even brand name regular wire wheels send wires into my flesh and into the work area.	1
No issues and works well.  Fit nicely on my 4 inch hand grinder.	1
Great! Thanks!	1
It was exactly what I expected	1
It's hard to draw that fine line of where the ol' Black & Decker reputation ended and the quality of DeWalt begins. So far I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased with the DeWalt name on it, including this product. I know that I pay more for schtuff with the DeWalt name on it, but in the long run it's usually money well spent when compared to other products.	1
what can I say about a wire wheel but it removes rust and paint :) good quality from DeWalt  Thanks .	1
This product is by far one of the best wire wheels I have ever used.  The price and Quality are definitly of the best of best.	1
This is excellent "havy rust removers" I purchase this Dewalt DW4930 4 inch cable-twist wheel to remove rust. And with 5" grinder is perfect solution for removing rust from metal.	1
Does what I purchased it to do.	1
Super pleased and just what was expected from a quality outfit like Irwin. I found the design of the drill bits especially useful in enlarging existing holes in addition to boring fresh new ones. Unlike many drills, these drills boar a clean, smooth hole with no burring. Used both on wood and steel with the same performance and through the various usages, no sign of wear or deterioration of the product. It maintains its sharpness without any distortion from friction.  The various sizes included in the kit fulfill every drilling and/or boring requirement.  The carrying case and the form fitted material which the bits rest in make it super convenient to locate the exact size bit needed for a given job.  My husband still has Irwin bits that have lasted him for years. He works in the trades and relies on quality tools and equipment and Irwin has always performed at the highest levels. While it remains to be seen if these will stand the test of time some of his original bits have, they seem to have the same quality about them as the others.	1
This Irwin 10225 Unibit product is high quality set of step drills, made in the USA, that comes in a substantially padded protective case. While it does cost significantly more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.  The Good: Thickly padded, zippered blue case. Smooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood. Pointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole. Two of the four bits have shanks formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review). Markings are highly visible and easy to read. The quality workmanship of this product is obvious. Finely machined, highly visible markings, and a beautiful storage case.  The Bad: There really isn't anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking the two smaller sized bits can be a bit difficult to extract from their padded slots in the case. (I warned you I was nit-picking!). The smaller two bits fit standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal. This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bits had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance in my testing.  Price: This is an expensive set of bits - it costs more than my first drill press did! If you wish to experience these high quality bits at a lower cost, there may just be a way to do so. Simply do what we all love to do on amazon - shop around!  A quick amazon search of Irwin Unibit" reveals that the price of these bits is largely related to their size - for example the largest bit (#4) is roughly half the cost of the entire set. If all you need is one of the smaller two bits, either can be had for under 16 dollars with prime shipping. If you can live without the largest bit, a set of three can be had for about 43 dollars (there is no case, and the third bit is slightly different than the set reviewed here, but seems comparable).  Ive posted a price-comparison chart in the photos accompanying this review.  Of course this information is only current as of the posting date of my review, as prices can, and probably will change in time.  Summary: If you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.  If you like short reviews - stop here!  On the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on  The 4 bits in this set are labelled Irwin Unibit 1, 2, 4 and 21. The three smaller bits are self starting, and the forth is for enlarging. All these bits can be purchased individually here on amazon.com.  All have hex shanks for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. The #1 and #2 bits will also fit in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine have six sided shanks, also known as hex shanks.  Each bit is described in detail below. Its difficult to produce tables in these reviews, so Im listing each bit one at a time.  Iwin Unibit #1: Irwin Item #: 10231 Hole Sizes: 1/8 - 1/2 Step increment: 1/32nd Number of steps: 13 Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8 Overall Length: 3-1/8 Shank Size Across flats: 1/4 Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4  Iwin Unibit #2: Irwin Item #: 10232 Hole Sizes: 3/16 - 1/2 Step increment: 3/8 Number of steps: 6 Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 3/8 Overall Length: 3-1/8 Shank Size Across flats: 1/4 Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4  Iwin Unibit #4: Irwin Item #: 10234 Hole Sizes: 3/16-7/8 Step increment: 1/8 Number of steps: 12 Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8 Overall Length: 2-7/8 Shank Size Across flats: 11/32 Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 3/8  Iwin Unibit #21: Irwin Item #: 10221 Hole Sizes: 13/16 - 1-3/8 Step increment: 1/8 Number of steps: 10 Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8 Overall Length: 2-7/8 Shank Size Across flats: 7/16 Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/2 Note: this bit requires a pilot hole, 3/4 diameter or greater.  Size of case: 7W x 4-7/8D x 2-1/4H  I happen to own a low cost import set of step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.  When is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?  When drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced. Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough. When a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit. Its possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes. If you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered. Smooth cutting step drills - like these Irwin bits - cut plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter). A single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.  When is a standard metal drill bit better?  When you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece. In thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just aren't designed to do this.  Other details and observations:  Use step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical. Enlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged. You can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole. I was able to consistently drill accurate, well formed holes in wood that was 5/8 thick using the Irwin #2 bit using this technique. I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 fir plywood with each of the 4 drill bits, as long as I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2, 7/8 or 1-3/8 holes, you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bits all cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless. On review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction. In hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results. Always work safe and remember these wise words: DONT DRINK AND DRILL!. (I think Homer Simpson deserves credit for this, but I cannot be certain.)  I hope you found this glut of information useful. If so your feedback would be much appreciated.	1
I own several Irwin tools and think they are well made and basically a one time purchase since they are durable and won't require replacement unless you lose it or it is stolen. These heavy duty bits are great for drainage holes or really any stepped hole. The zippered case is very well padded and sturdy. They may seem a bit pricey  and overkill for homeowners use, but I've learned the hard way that it is better and usually easier for the do it yourselfers to have reliable tools that makes the project go easier with considerably less frustration. Also the big orange store carries this brand and is competitive on certain items if you need it in a hurry.	1
My husband has worked as an HVAC mechanic and was looking forward to trying out this set of Irwin step bits. Just today he got that opportunity when he had to enlarge holes on a commercial exhaust fan and drill a 3/4" knock out for electrical. The bits cut right through the heavy metal with no problem or heat build up.  They come in a really nice case they came in and make for easy retrieval from your truck when you need them.   I would highly recommend these drill bits. I am very satisfied we are planning on getting a lot of use from them.	1
and has been been using them for the last 30 days in his work room that was previously known as our garage. He finds these just right for drilling holes into stainless steel, copper, brass, aluminum, plastic and vinyl. The Single-flute cutting edge has great control & the Hex shank prevents slipping in drill chuck.  Unibit #10231 aka #1: Hole Sizes 1/8" - 1/2"; # of Holes = 13; Maximum Material Thickness = 1/8; "Fractional Self-Starting":  Unibit #10232 aka #2: Hole Sizes 3/16" - 1/2"; # of Holes = 6; Maximum Material Thickness = 3/8;  Unibit #10234 aka #4: Hole Sizes 3/16" - 7/8"; # of Holes = 12; Maximum Material Thickness = 1/8;  Unibit #10221 aka #21: 10 hole sizes (13/16" to 1&3/8"); Maximum Material Thickness = 1/8; "Fractional Hole Enlarging"\  I found a great video on YouTube "IRWIN Unibit Step Drill Bits by Tools In Action" that you might find informative.	1
I didn't realize how I could live without this set of Unibits until I put them in my drill case.  Buy them and you will never regret it.	1
I'm doing a fiberglass car project, and these things leave much nicer edges than my normal pilot point bit sets. And even on un-masked gelcoat, this leaves minimal cracking. (Though I'd still recommend using masking tape, and cutting in towards the gelcoat).  I like the right-most one, which has long steps -- it helps get nice straight holes, even through a fairly thick piece of fiberglass. The only minor thing is that I wish that there was more variety in sizes. The bigger one is, if I recall correctly, 3/4" at the largest. If the set had a narrow, medium, large one, it would be slightly more versatile, than the current set which has 2 narrow ones, and a medium one.	1
I have used these for years, but the current production is of inferior steel. Very soft and does not cut well at all. Suitable only for soft metals. Irwin seems to have outsourced the production to the lowest bidder.	-1
Great  Product.	1
Super sharp points and easy adjustment. Only purchased this divider to work with nautical maps for fishing, I can't complain about it!  However it does ship in some sticky grease-like oil.	1
works great , use for lathe work	1
Good!	1
The points are not exactly the same length but they are perfect for what I use them for and are very well built. I'm sure they will last me a long time.	1
I have used a lot of these grommets over the years. Works great.	1
This kit is ideal for putting grommets on things. Was hesitant to buy at first, as kits tend to usually be cheaply made. This one however, is very nice. I will be able to get many uses out of this. Just don't expect the wood block to last as long as the other parts. I would buy again.	1
Exactly as described and arrived on-time.  Takes about two minutes to install a grommet into anything reasonable.  All the parts seem to stand up to use and the grommets hold tight.	1
Used this to add eyes to those cheap tarps.  Works well.	1
Happy with this grommet set!	1
Good kit for this price.  Includes the everything you need to install grommets except the hammer.  The grommets themselves are decent quality.  Time will tell if they hold well and don't rust.  My package was slightly opened and most of the contents spilled into the box.  2 of the washers were missing, so I didn't get 24 complete grommets.  I got 22 complete grommets.  Its not the end of the world.  I only needed about 1 for my project, and Imagine only needing 1 every now and again.  Everything functions as I imagined.  The wood piece is small and isn't really that hard.  Its hard enough to punch holes through the fabric with the hole punch.  I would not say the hole punch is super sharp, but it does work.  I went through 2 layers of Sunbrella Marine fabric with ease, and I can see this working with up to about 4 layers.  Your best bet is to use a heavier hammer and swing light, as opposed to a light hammer with a heavy swing.  I found that a 2.5 pound hammer was ideal.  With this hammer, the grommet installation is a piece of cake.  Just tap lightly a few times, check it, tap a couple more times, check it, light taps to snug it down.  Do not over hammer or the anvil gets stuck in the grommet and can be difficult to unstuck.  The hole punch seems durable enough for 100 uses or more.  The grommet installation tool seems durable enough for several hundred grommets or more.  The hardwood piece is probably only good for a few dozen cuts.  No big deal, I did not expect that to last long.  Overall, I would buy this again at this price.  I would recommend this for occasional grommet installation for the home user.  Not really a pro tool, so don't get your hopes up.  This is really more for repairs than for production.	1
Great value	1
Very bad quality control. The punch was .011 larger diameter than the hole in the die. I just tossed it in the trash.	-1
Worked great in repairing a large tarp.	1
Very simple design that seems to work well for what I needed. I put some grommets on some lightweight carpet for travel trailer outdoor door mat and can stake it down using the grommet holes and grommets to keep from ripping carpet. This item is simple and works.	1
Little loose but works well.	1
works pretty good doe's the job	1
Product as described. Works great. Would by again.	1
I don't install grommets everyday, so justifying spending hundreds of dollars on a production press just wasn't in the budget.  For those of us with smaller projects to do, this kit was perfect!  It has everything you need to get the job done.  The anvil portion, arguably the most important part of the kit, is very well made.  I'd give it 5 stars.  The wood block is just a piece of oak.  The cutter works okay, I'd give it 4 stars.  The grommets I'd say are not the best, so I'd probably give them 3 stars.  But again, the most important part is the anvil and this kit delivers a top notch anvil that will pound hundreds and hundreds of grommets.  I was using the cutter on some nylon webbing, so it didn't cut the best.  I suspect it works far better on leather or cotton.  Regardless, it did work, it just wasn't awesome.  The grommets are pretty light weight.  I've definitely used heavier grommets before.  That said, they were free and come with the kit and they work fine and seem to hold tight.  How they'll stand up over time I'm not sure, but I'll just have to see.  So if you want super nice top notch grommets, you'll probably have to buy those separately.  Overall I give this kit 5 stars because it delivers an excellent anvil and it's very affordable.	1
Good in a pinch. I wouldn't recommend this if you have a lot of grommets. An inexpensive, low pressure grommet machine would be nice.	1
I have a tarp with grommets that ripped out.  I put new grommets into a webbing strap and my wife sewed the webbing onto the tarp.  This worked very well.  The Grommet maker is easy to use.	1
does the job	1
excellent tool, you must sharpen it before serious use	1
Heavy duty!  thanks.	1
Tried it on aluminum and a steel hole I drilled and does not cut. Seems the blades were ground flat. Had to return.	-1
works	1
A little cumbersome to use but works great..... what do you expect for the price	1
Sees good and sturdy, I didn't end up using this in the end	1
Tools are great.  DD	1
Thinner than what we need on some applications but works, and when pushed for time, just the trick.	1
Work as they should.	1
This are for light duty applications only.  Made in India.	-1
A good-quality grommet kit (made in India) that is affordable for small jobs. Depending on the fabric or the material, the most challenging part is usually punching the hole. The hole size needs to be precise and clean. For some materials, I trace the size of the hole, fold that material through the middle or diameter of the hole and cut out the semi-circle with a pair of curved finger nail scissors.	1
Seem okay.  can't use right away but package arrived fast and new.	1
Good product and right about price	1
Well for the price, but better on thicker material. Like other customers, they recommended going slow when using the cutter as well as "crimping" the grommets with a hammer, utilizing General Tools grommet kit. Installing these grommets on polyester shade material, the grommets cut through, but "installed" reinforced packaging tape on both sides, with the tool cutting a perfect hole. The tape worked very well. Used inside a green house so not worried about corrosion or heavy duty strength, very little weight applied on these grommets with no wind.	1
Reviewed directions for use in the reviews and questions, but used for a thin shade material and the outside of the grommet cut the material. The cutter worked well for it's purpose, and only needed it for light duty. Sure it would be okay for medium duty applications, and thicker material.	1
We bought this kit to use on a replacement awning we made.  Long story short: the grommets installed well and we ended up with a very sturdy end result. Don't be afraid to use some force when cutting/punching your fabric and the rest is easy.  Long story long: I did not try the cutter/punch straight out of the box. I felt I could sharpen it up a little bit first, so that's what I did. I chucked it in the drill and took a file to the cutting edge as it spun. I can't say it made a huge difference in sharpness, but I do believe it helped. When cutting your material, hit the punch hard with a hammer, rotate, and repeat. Usually 3-5 quick and heavy blows were enough to cut through my two layers of heavy material. I hit it until the punch was stuck in the wood behind the material-- then I knew I had gone completely though.  Actually installing the grommets was the easy part. Line things up and hit the big punch with a hammer to seal things down good. Rotate the metal punch with your fingers, hit again, rotate back a bit and hit one last time. It was quick and easy.  All in all, I was impressed with the professional look this gave our awning and I am very happy we used this kit.	1
These work great, We use them for our side by side rear curtain to keep the rain and snow off of us. These have help up just fine in rain & snow for over 2 years	1
Great kit	1
High Quality Merchandise & Fast Shipping	1
good	1
Hard to find relacement kit does the job. Shortage of rings remains a problem however the grommets do the job they are intended to do. Priced reasonably and delivered promptly. Recommended.	1
Simple, easy, works, priced right.	1
Good product	1
Last year, I purchased a #2-plain General grommet-repair kit from Amazon to compare it with the equivalent Lord & Hodge kits.  The contrast was remarkable!  The Lord & Hodge sets were domestically-manufactured and met all of my expectations.  The General set, in contrast, was cobbled together in India and was garbage.  A couple of the grommets were pitted on the margins, and one of the male components was bent.  Two more set imperfectly and had to be removed, a problem which I haven't encountered elsewhere.  I finally got around to weighing the respective grommets and found the General submission to be roughly 30% underweight.  Brass foil.  Although the first commentaries could be considered somewhat subjective, the weight differential isn't.  Additionally, I strongly suspect the setting tools are inferior to L&H's, a rough brinell test having indicated that the anvil material is softer.	-1
Excellent set for setting grommets that comes with everything you need except the hammer.  It even includes a little chunk of hardwood to use under your grommet setting anvil.  (That bit is greatly appreciated, since it protects your table or desktop, and I never take the time to go dig one out when I'm in a hurry.)  The punch is not sharp enough to cut through heavy canvas, but it marks it so you can cut it out with scissors.  Good value.	1
I used this tool to put eyes into a sheet of canvas to use as a sunshade. Works great, well made, no complaints. I thought the little square of hardwood they included would be redundant but actually it's really useful, I tried using pine instead as a backstop and it was way too soft.	1
This is a decent tool. I could have given a 5 star except for one minor issue I had with the hole cutter. The crimping section worked as advertised and rolled the grommet crimp as expected. The hole cutter was a bit dull. i sharpened it after the 1st hole because it did not cut cleanly. Overall worth the money.	1
It took a bit before I did all the pieces right side up and not backwards, but once I did I was very happy with them/	1
This kit has everything you need to install 24 grommets. I saw another reviewer complain that he thought it was 48 and only got 24, but the General Tool website says 48 pieces and 24 grommets, which is right. Another complained about lead. A trace amount of lead is often used for lubrication purposes to prevent the grommets from sticking to the punch, causing you to destroy the grommet to get it off. You'd have to suck on a grommet for a while to get lead traces into your system, so keep them out of your mouth and you'll be fine. It's a good little kit and will help you get more use from old tarps, or help you in other DIY projects that call for grommets.  The materials are good quality and the grommet halves are accurately made to fit together well. At a great price, you can't ask for more!	1
This sturdy tool does the job quickly and effectively. What more could I ask? It's so simple and strong it will out last me hands down.	1
I have been using these rags in a box for about ten years now for clean up in my woodworking, auto, and leatherwork. They are a great, tough, absorbent, cheap (around 0.06 cents apiece in bulk), disposable alternative to more expensive cotton rags.  No, these rags are not made out of cotton but are a felted wood fiber. They are super absorbent, better than cotton, and when you get them cruddy you can just toss them rather than face the wrath of your significant other after you run a bunch of oily rags through the washing machine! They are not affected by oils, alcohol,  or any solvent you might find in normal shop use. One great benefit, at least for me, is that they do not "shed" little pieces of fiber like cotton rags do when you are applying,  or cleaning up, stains or wipe on finishes. One final caveat is to be sure that you are buying these towels from "fulfilled by Amazon" so you get the 8 box case rather than the scam artist who is selling the single box  for the case price!	1
Been using these for years, very tough.	1
GREAT RAGS	1
Just what I needed.  Great price on lightning deal!	1
Not much to say about these, this was a great deal and I couldn't pass these up, these towels are good for anything.	1
best ofg this type product on the fahreakin planet--thanx---One of the best products of its type I've ever used	1
good product - fast shipping.	1
I buy for bike repair and maintenance.  Great, strong paper towels that are much stronger and longer lasting than regular kitchen paper towels.  I almost want to wash, dry and reuse them.....	1
I normally buy the Scott blue shop towels but I thought I'd give these A try they work very good. The price was cheaper then the blue towels. I gave five stars for excellent performing product. I would highly recommend this product.	1
love them	1
Nice thick rags and nice sturdy box. Throw one of these in my truck tool box.	1
I use these rags in the garage for clean-up and light cleaning as opposed to an old wash rag or towel. These absorb must better and then you throw away - simply. The costs is very low for the amount and number of uses you get from this box. Hope this helps.	1
rags in a box whats not to like	1
I really like these scott rags in a box.  They come in handy for my use.  I think they serve the purpose well.  Great for clean up for me.  A hard to beat product.	1
Happy I bought this at the price listed as I have paid almost $20.00 for the same product but with less quantity. These work great in conjunction with paper towels and sponges. These can actually be rinsed out and dries almost immediately. I have saved a lot of money on buying paper towels since I started using this product.	1
I use wipes of this exact brand extensively, which I usually buy by the case. I use these wipes for cleaning a variety of things, most of them disgusting or very bad for you. What I like about these wipes is that they don't tear easily, they don't shed a lot of lint and they dispense cleanly from the box (one at a time).  The box itself has some measurement guides, so that when you're trying to guess the exact size of a given nut, bolt or assorted part you can refer to the actual box. These can save lots and lots of time, from someone having to find a tape measure or a ruler.	1
These towels are easy, convenient, and strong. You get 200 in a nice dispenser you can carry around. They are great for everything and you can re-use them. Highly recommended!	1
Great shop towels.  I previously used regular Bounty paper towels in my workshop, and they worked fine except in rare cases where I needed something more "cloth like" and the paper towels would tear.  These towels have the extra strength to fulfill this role.	1
good	1
Not as durable as I expected. Lightweight.	1
Great product, easy feed until you towards the end, then they clump up and are hard to remove.	1
What I expected. Handy dispenser for shop rags.	1
Bring on the oil spills.	1
ok	1
ok	1
Nice, absorbent, low lint towels in a dispenser box.	1
I bought these for my home garage and they seem to work just fine.  They do tend to break down and leave a little bit of dust from the paper fibers after a bit of use, but they're still good enough for glass and Windex.	1
Being a retired auto/truck mechanic I've been using these shop towels for years and they work great for me. There great in the garage and around the home there very strong. I would recommend this product.	1
they last so much longer than the normal paper towel I realize they're normally only used with men but from a woman standpoint they're durable and reliable and seem to clean so much better and when cleaning they work perfectly	1
Excellent towels for everything.	1
A great compromise between kitchen-type paper towels and cotton shop towels.  I use these all the time when working with metal and wood projects.	1
My favorite disposable shop towels and I have tried many	1
:) No problems.	1
JUST KEEP MAKING THEM	1
good	1
decent. i have been using these for years. they work fine. not a huge fan of the way the towels come out but i think it's more a function of the hole design vs. the towels themselves. also, my box arrived like it had been used in a game of dodgeball. but, the box still works and the towels are tough.	1
Great towels for the garage. More durable than the standard paper towels. I tried buying those "recycled t-shirt rags" but they weren't great quality so I figured I'd try these and I'm glad I did.  I found that these work great for auto detailing because they don't leave behind any little fibers like some paper towels and rags do.	1
great	1
Fits in my garage cabinet perfectly and is uber handy. Good quality rag alternative.	1
Oh these are great these are always great better than the regular paper towel and I hide mine so that I have them when I really need strength and absorbency	1
As expected.  Good deal.	1
Great shop towels. Marked down one start because the quantity was low considering the price.	1
These are awesome.  Reasonably durable, and they don't leave any fibers behind on sensitive surfaces.  They'll absorb a good amount of fluid as well.	1
Love the shop towels, but prefer them on a roll (which I buy from Costco when they have it).	1
great shop towels	1
I have been using these in my home shop / garage for as long as I can remember and they are my all time favorite. They hold up to use and reuse as well. My only wish is that they would change the color of the towels to anything other than blue when you are something like 10 away from an empty box, otherwise you don't know you are out until you pull out the last one.	1
I use these for cat cleanups around the house.  no longer need to burn through regular paper towels.  These are super absorbent and easy to store.  I just put the box next to my laundry machine and can grab them whenever needed.  No more running out of paper towels.  Not much to say, these are thick, absorbent and reasonably priced.	1
As far as I can tell, there isn't a difference in the intended use of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blue-Scott-Shop-Towels-In-A-Box-75190/dp/B00004TBJD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blue Scott Shop Towels In-A-Box  75190</a>) from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scott-75260-Rags-in-a-Box/dp/B00004TBJF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scott 75260 Rags in a Box</a>. These is a big difference in their durability. Fact of the matter is, these things constantly rip like wet toilet paper when you put them to serious use. I've developed these expectations that it will be useful for work, in part due the product being called a 'Shop Towel'.	-1
I love irwin step bits and this one wasn't an exception.  Took out nice soft copper very easily. with no real signs of wear after going through about 1/4 of copper.	1
Contains all common size I need and the cutting edge is sharp.  I bought this to make a hole for gasoline can vent cap.  The bit was very aggressive through the plastic.	1
Irwin makes acceptable tools.	1
Works like a charm on tougher metals than the TiN coated bit.	1
Always a handy drill to have around.	1
Excellent product -- Functions as intended -- No complaints here --	1
BUGGA IS CHERRY!!!	1
Cuts holes cleanly and quickly,  I've mostly used it on aluminum which it cuts like butter, although it often leaves a large burr on the back side that has to be trimmed away. The distance for each hole size is quite small, so it's only useful for thin material.	1
I use it all the time; how did I ever get by without a step bit???	1
did the job	1
the best	1
I'd always thought these things were a gimmick.  No longer!  This is an awesome device for drilling through thin stock.  Quick, and nice clean holes.	1
works good	1
fast ship works good	1
This Irwin 10232 Unibit is a high quality set step drill, made in the USA. While it does cost more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.  The Good: Smooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood. Pointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole. No counterpunch or pre-drilling required to achieve accuracy. The shank is formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review). Markings are highly visible and easy to read. The quality workmanship of this product is obvious: sharp, finely machined, highly visible markings.  The Bad: There really isn't anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking The bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bit had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).  Summary: If you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.  If you like short reviews - stop here!  On the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on  The bit has a hex shank for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. This #2 bit also fits in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine has a six sided shank, also known as a hex shank.  Irwin Unibit #2: Irwin Item #: 10232 Hole Sizes: 3/16 - 1/2 Step increment: 3/8 Number of steps: 6 Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 3/8 Overall Length: 3-1/8 Shank Size Across flats: 1/4 Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4  I happen to own some low cost import step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.  When is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?  When drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced. Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough. When a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit. Its possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes. If you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 wider starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered. Smooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter). A single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.  When is a standard metal drill bit better?  When you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece. In thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just aren't designed to do this.  Other details and observations:  Use step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical. Enlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged. You can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole. I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 thick fir plywood when I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2 holes you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bit cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless. One review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction. In hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results.  If you would like to see more images of bits, test cuts, and so on, please see my review of the Irwin 10225 Unibit set.  I hope you found this information useful. If so your feedback would be much appreciated.	1
use this bit all the time as i find it is a very useful drill bit. i find it quicker to use than changing drill bits.	1
This is normally great tape, but I ordered direct from Amazon and the adhesive is all dried out. Plus, it won't let me return it.  What a waste of money...	-1
I really needed a momentary contact switch which this is not. This is a simple on-off rocker switch. Threw it in the garbage.	-1
Purchased 2 of these for my ATV one for a secondary radiator fan and another for 2 flood lights in the front. One worked perfectly, however, the second one which was connected to the lights decided to stop working mid ride in the middle of the night. I was left without lights due to this faulty switch. It was not until further examination at camp that I figured out the switch was the faulty link using my multi meter. I have replaced both switches now with a higher quality switch. Save yourself the horrible experience and just get a better switch!	-1
Photo cell is too low.	-1
Gave up on this one.  Turning lights off and on too early.  Light flickers.  Not worth the price.  Can only use with incandesant  bulbs.	-1
Not for man hands. Tools are tiny. The anvil and punch are ok but the cutter is useless. Using a 12 oz hammer I still couldn't get the hole punch or "cutter" to go through so ended up cutting a slit with a razor. Once the grommet is in place it seems to hold good.	-1
I ordered this to cut hole in fabric for 1/4" grommets.  It doesn't work.  Hole cutters for fabric need to be really, really sharp.  This one isn't.  If I hammered it 6 times it would only leave the impression of the ring.  I used that impression for a guide to cut the fabric with precision scissors.  These grommets spaces were too large to crimp around the fabric.  Luckily I had some Dritz grommets in the sewing drawer.  I used those instead.  The one part of this package that did help was the grommet setters.  That part I could use and the grommets fits nicely into the fabric.  It would probably be good for tarps, plastics, etc.  But it is not good for polyester fabrics.	-1
This is the worst gas can I've ever used!  Just received it tonight.  I temporarily working in CA.  Amazon shipping would not ship any other fuel container to CA, so I saw the great reviews and bought this one.  There is another traditional 5 gal fuel jug that says it's CARB approved, but they will not ship it to CA either!.  First, the lid mechanism is spring loaded to the closed position by two very large springs.  It takes quite a bit of hand strength to open the lid.  There is no way my wife or grandson could open it.  They wouldn't even be able to put gas into the container with these stout springs.  Second, the yellow funnel arrangement seems nice on first glance, until you try to use it!  It mounts to the spout on a 90 degree angle so you cannot get the gas can tilted enough to get all the gas out.  My cars fuel filler spout (and most others) goes into the car at a 45 degree angle.  If I tilt the gas can all the way (sideways/90 degrees) the funnel interferes and wants to pop out of the 45 degree fuel neck (the funnel then wants to point straight down).  I could only get maybe 3 of 5 gallons out.  I tried to turn it sideways but it will only go so far.  I finally was able to get 4 out of 5 gallons out while spilling it all over my shoes, the side of the car, and the ground.  There needs to be a way to swivel the spout for different filler neck angles.  They also need to reduce the spring pressure on the spout and maybe add a safety lock to hold it down instead of that 50# of spring.  Now the good:  Its made pretty well and the steel is not as thin as I thought by reading some of the other posts.  It is compact and at first glance it does not look like 5 gallons, but it will hold 4.95.  Find an older designed gas can at a yard sale instead of this new design.	-1
Too small not sure what you would move with it.	-1
The Wheels are too small to be useful on anything other than a perfectly flat surface. A crumb caused them to stop rolling.	-1
The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability. Unfortunately I could not find a better quality 2" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.	-1
while the dollies are advertised as capable of carrying 200 lbs, they certainly cannot carry this load with a furniture 'leg' centered in the dolly, which is the primary reason for purchasing this type of product. It is only when a load is placed evenly over each of the 3 wheels that this is possible.	-1
used it for a very specific purpose, once. it performed mediocre. did leave divots in floor, but not that surprising considering the wheels are small diameter.	-1
Don't plan on using these much.  They are much weaker than you would imagine.  I have an empty vending machine that totaled all 4 of them.  I'm not sure what else you'd use them on.  Nothing over 100 pounds for sure.	-1
Don't know how they measure these things, but this is TINY... I wanted to use it to move around some tall 1/4 barrel sanke kegs. Won't do it due to the small size. If you're looking to move something that will either fit on the tops, or in the recessed section, it should be ok. If you want to use it to move something else, look for something else. I'll probably end up getting a furniture dolly from HF at some point.	-1
We have hard water and lime, so I was using this with toilet bowl cleaner and it seemed to make the plastic bristles start to chemically melt.  It seemed to be well made though and I can imagine how it would have worked well to get into hard to clean places.	-1
These nails are well manufactured and safely packaged by Senco.  However, they are not the correct size for my Hitachi 15-Guage Angled Finish Nailer if you examine them carefully with a Mitutoyo caliper.  According to the directions, these are out of spec.  So I don't like them.  I don't like how Amazon recommended that I buy them with my Hitachi nailer, and I don't see the good in these thin little nails with their tiny head.	-1
These nails are not NOT for DeWalt  51276! They are not the 34 degree angle that this finish nailer requires. Bought some and am sending 4 boxes back the angle is not marked on the Senco packaging at all. A302000 and A302509 WONT WORK WELL IN THIS NAILER. I noticed the angle was slightly off but the first 4 nails came out just fine and BAM #5&6 came out at the same time and bent over and left 1/2" folded over on the surface. This is UNACCEPTABLE IN FINISH WORK!!!  Buy something else that is clearly marked 34 Degrees.  SENCO does not mark theirs, don't buy them.	-1
Bad purchase!! Don't buy any nails not clearly marked with the angle on the box! SENCO does not mark them.	-1
Quality is fine, but you're really paying a large premium for variety. Better off getting a couple of different size packs of the Dewalt nails.	-1
Tape is tape only as long as it sticks, using my precision digitally controlled hot air rework station and at 300 degrees (the lowest I tested it) it lost all adhesiveness.	-1
Good for all around low temp use where you need foil tape. However for woodstove temps, the adhesive melts and burns. I used several good-sized strips along the steam of the stovepipe. The adhesive was left in a pool on top of the stove and burned brown. I ended up taking it all off.	-1
Doesn't stick when exposed to low grade heating  (less then 100f). Wasn't  being used to hold anything  on, but whats the point if it peels up?	-1
I should have done more research before using this with my pellet stove flue pipe. This tape didn't seal my flue pipe worth anything. The only good thing about it is that it comes off very easily without leaving residue after you realize its doesn't work. I used high temperature silicone sealant instead.	-1
I used it on a pellet stove vent pipe and I had to seal over the edges of the tape with high temp silicon sealant after I found ash was blowing out around taped joints. Useless on flue pipe joints that never exceed 200F. High temperature flue tape? Not this one! I did clean the pipe with acetone before taping the joints.	-1
annoying to work with, hard to mold around the ac	-1
doesn't stick very well	-1
I got this vacuum for free as a throw in for buying a saw.  I'm real disappointed.  This vacuum in meant to be hung on a wall, if you don't it tips very easily.  Operation wise it is reasonably powerful, but very loud.  The most frustrating thing about this vacuum is the small diameter of the hose, which caused it to clog very easily.  Definitely not a 'shop' vac.  Best use that I can find is to vacuum the sawdust off my tools, everything else use a full size shopvac.  Update:  can't stand it anymore...gave it away.  Don't waste your money.	-1
My wife and I tried this after using another brand of whitening strips. To our dismay, it didn't whiten our teeth, it also has some mediocre performance cleaning them. At least with regular toothpastes, they clean at the same time freshen our breath as well. Waste of money. Like what the other reviewers state, their claim of false packaging may have some merit as the tube contains way less of toothpaste than what is stated. I suggest you stay away or try other brands...or better yet just go to your dentist if you really like to whiten your teeth.	-1
I bought these nails because I didn't need that many 3" ring shank for my Hitachi NR90 nailer. Very few carry over 2 3/8" in a ring shank, and those that do charge about $30 or more to ship. So 500 nails for $30 with free shipping was worth a try. The nails look like someone made them by hand. The coating is very thick and not uniform; so the "ring" portion is a hit or miss affair, leaving some nails looking as though they had virtually no rings at all. Some of the nails were also slightly bent; not an issue when using a hammer, but hopefully it won't jam my nailer. I test shot a strip, shooting a short piece of Timberstrand dimensional lumber into another piece of Timberstrand (I rarely use pine 2 by's). Nailing into Timberstrand requires more nailer power which my NR90 had no problem with. On the plus side, the nailer worked fine and the board was extremely difficult to dislodge from the other board using three of these nails; so I think they'll work for my purposes. For a comparision between these nails and my Hitachi ring shank nails; see the above photo.	-1
Pretty cheap stuff, not sure if I can use it for what I had intended to. RC heli stuff. Not really sure what I could use this stuff for???? I had some real heavy duty stuff that the glue failed on fairly quick and the stuff was installed inside the house. I'm living in regret.	-1
This is great tape, but the dispenser is way to flimsy to handle the larger rolls such as this.....  it flexes and it is way to easy to foul the tape.	-1
Does not stick to anything.  Bought a 6 pack and all 6 rolls barely stick to cardboard boxes, usually falling off in less than 24 hours.  This stuff isn't even usable.	-1
I read the negative reviews for this tape but since they were several months old, and the 3M company representative had responded to them, I took a leap of faith and hoped that Amazon's stock had been replaced and the problem resolved. Not so. I purchased four rolls of this tape, and so far one has absolutely NO adhesion, and the other I would rate as barely sticky. I got these for a little over two dollars a roll which was a great price, but I would have been fuming if I paid the $6-$7 these cost in retail stores and had the same problems. For a company like 3M, which generally sells some of the best products, to have such a lapse in QC and allow this type of inferior product to hit the market is sad. I will not be purchasing this tape again, or any 3M brand packaging tapes for a while, in the hopes that they correct this problem.	-1
I thought it was me until I read the other complaints about the Scotch Super Strength Tape not sticking to packages. While this may be a very strong (labeled 20x stronger) packaging tape, it's not much good if it won't stick to the package.  I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking. In fact the cheap tape was very sticky, so much so that if you pulled it off the package, it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it. On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape. So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much. Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products.	-1
I don't know what is happening, but I just tried out some tape I bought around December 2010 and it simply doesn't stick - about as strong as a post-it note.  They must be having a major issue with QC on this product.  I am not doing anything fancy - taping closed cardboard boxes.	-1
I did not buy 2-P10 adhesive from/through Amazon.  CA glues of any viscosity do not work well with wood as a means of making solid permanent joints.  Oh, it sets up in a few seconds and faster when an accelerator is used, but the bond/joint is easily broken especially when a twisting or torsioning force is applied to the joint, much easier than a true wood glue joint. 2-P10 exhibits all the positive aspects of any CA glue - and the negatives, too.  2-P10 is as good as any other CA glue for very small projects such as Popsicle stick crafts, and high gloss finishes for pens and other small turnings, and is more expensive than most brands.  There are dedicated wood glues that set up quickly and don't require accelerators or debonders (nail polish remover) or other additional chemicals to work.	-1
very disappointed in these bottles. first off you advertised them as being made in the USA (says in description country of origin USA) but right on the bottle they are stamped made in China. also, one does not spray a fine mist, the other you have to keep priming it and all three of them do not have perfectly flat bottoms so they wobble. bad product and misleading description, very cheaply made.	-1
Very short time til none worked.	-1
poor quality and they drip. I purchased three of these and they all leak. Spray pattern is okay.	-1
clorox cleaner ate through plastic, fell apart, stopped spraying and started spitting out in all different directions, got bleach cleaner in my eye	-1
The water that sprays through this smells like mold spores!  Can't get rid of the smell.  Had to throw them away.	-1
I won't buy these again. One didn't work when I received it. One stopped working after about a week. The last one lasted a month.	-1
These things are horrible, All three are just inferior crap. They don't spray well and seem to lose their prime so it takes multiple squeezes to even get it to squirt.	-1
I needed these for installing LP SmartSide-12" width. The "hook" end of these were not wide enough for the SmartSide (James Hardie is slightly thinner), and they would not work for anything BUT a 1 1/4" overlap. I have tried several brands with no success until I tried a brand sold here called SoloSider (see my review for them). These, like most Malco products, are quailty built, but will only work for certain siding and a fixed reveal/overlap.	-1
no comparison to the Gecko gauges just cheap and flimsy...if your a one time install they i guess you might get by with these but if your a two man crew skip the product and make facing gauges out of plywood.  If your a one man crew get the Geckos instead.	-1
Doesn't stay put	-1
This stuff use to be good. Now it won't cure. Perhaps it's no longer made by the hard working US taxpayer....	-1
Yellows, cracks and shrinks.  I thought it was caulk.  Switch to Sashco products unless you like re-caulking a lot.	-1
Hard to write an accurate review when they are so heavily censored. But we will try, here we have another Pr**e item that has doubled in cost and is no longer in any ballpark on price.	-1
This is some of the worst caulk I have ever used. I should have stuck with the GE silicone but this was cheaper and you get what you pay for. Does not flow well and does not stick well and does not seal well. Really does not do anything well. When I contacted DAP, they didn't seem to care and would not replace the caulk or refund my money.	-1
I have been using caulk for a long, long time and I can honestly say this was the worst experience I have ever had.  It was used to seal a window.  First off, minimum set up time is 7-14 days, (despite DAP online instructions stating it sets within hours) ridiculous.  After that, it is supposed to remain somewhat flexible like silicone, it does not.  It is gummy and easily punctured with indents appearing randomly even after your smooth bead has begun to dry weeks later.  Second, it shrinks more than any other caulk I have used.  Supposedly the clear shrinks more than the other colors, but I would never use it again anyway so I don't know.  What I do know is that it sets into a thin, and I mean ultra thin layer that is very difficult to get scrape off, which you will most likely do once you see how much it shrinks.  I even set up a dehumidifier to help the curing since it was used for a basement window.  (Two of the uses written DIRECTLY on the tube). The instructions on DAP's site are incorrect about set up time, and I have read of people getting refunds due to this.  That still doesn't pay me for my time of having to remove this junk and start over with another caulk.	-1
not great quality, spend the extra and get something that is good	-1
Exactly the same as those sold at Harbor Freight.  Does not clamp the gauge solidly motionless or even close, has at least .1" play - useless.	-1
On first use the threads in one of the tightening nuts stripped.  As I had not used this item before I was slowly creaping up on a the force required to secure the arm.  The thread stripped before I could get it tight.  I was unable to make even a single measurement.  The threads on one of the nuts, securing the arm to the shaft, stripped on first use.  I was unable to make a single measurement.  As I had not used this device before I was slowly creeping up on tightening the hand turn so as not to over torque.  The threads stripped before I could get the arm to stay in place.  I did not purchase the cheapest magnetic base with dial indicator for the reason that I did not want one that would break.  I did not go far enough up in quality.  I did not want a replacement as I fear that the new one might break in 6 months and I would be unable to return it.  The overall quality of this item is not particularly good though it would have worked for me if it had not failed.  If you want one of these, even if you don't intende to use it frequently;  get a better one.  Previously I returned a defective wood clamp to Amazon and my money was refunded with no additional questions.  I fully expect that to happen with this one which I am returning today.  This gives me considerable confidence when buying from Amazon.	-1
You can get casters cheaper at surpluscenter.com With standard 1/2" studs  The casters seem to be good but the metric studs and no nuts included sucks. I had to drive a minimum of 38 miles to get nuts.  How'd that work out for me? Not so well. I just as well drove to buy casters in the first place	-1
My lid was not cracked. I got about 3 uses out of this but after a month it turned into a gummy mess and had to toss it out. I guess I should have put it inside the house instead of leaving it in the hot garage? Even when it was brand new, I found it to be messy and difficult to work with, never was able to get a clean finish, always messy looking	-1
I have purchased four or five of these containers. EVERY one of them has gone hard and dry in spite of properly sealing the container after use. I contacted the manufacturer to complain about the early and quick demise of their product and request a replacement. They refused. They told me to contact the selling store for a free replacement and that the mfg has a replacement agreement in place with retailers. The manager of Ace Hardware innitially told me he has never heard of such agreement. Ace however DID exchange the can for me at no charge. The manufacturer also told me that the container is a "TEMPORARY CONTAINER" !!! They advised me to transfer remaining product into an air tight container! It is a little too late for that now it appears. I'd ONLY buy this product if I intended to use it ALL in one day. It works fine when the can is first opened.	-1
These wheels are functionally very useful and sturdy, however, that functionality is vastly overshadowed by their noxious and offensive odor. If you're planning on using these wheels in an open-shop environment I am sure they will work well, but any confined space or environemnt where air quality is a consideration should be avoided. The odor is reminiscent of petrochemical or tar production and is overwhelming if there is not active and forced ventilation. It's been over 2 weeks since I cleaned and attempted to let them off-gas and the odor just seems to be getting stronger.	-1
I mounted these on a wooden work table. They initially loved them as they are easily set and released and are rock solid. Unfortunately one of the lock mechanisms failed after a couple of months. They design seems pretty flimsy. I will follow up on this review after a few more months.	-1
First off, only one comes with this page, even though it says, "2-pack" with the little Amazon smile under it, so don't get your hopes up. I though I was getting a good deal and ended up paying twice as much as it's worth.  The inside diameter of the larger bell end is 3.977 inches. It tapers to 3.665 inches, which is the ID of the small end, which is straight walled as opposed to the tapered bell end.  The OD of the straight section is 3.91 inches.  Overall length is 3.98 inches.  It'll work. I'm a little miffed that it said 2 and only 1 arrived.	-1
Didn't do what I had hoped.  I wanted something that would fit on the exaust of the table saw and also the reducer to the vacuum.  Nobody seems to have such a thing.  Ended up using duct tape and that is only good for so long.	-1
Waste of money will never order any more plastic fittings, going to stick to metal ductwork and ground everything good.	-1
I have a Delta saw with a 4 inch sawdust outlet and I have not been able to find anything that will allow me to size it down to a Craftsman vacuum hose size.  I thought this was made smaller on each end to accommodate a 4 inch hose connection; thus, I could attach another device to this one to size down the saw outlet.  Wrong.  This is exactly 4 inches in diameter.  Another fitting that is also 4 inches will not fit it.  Guess I am stuck.  I don't see how this would make anything into a quick disconnect unless what it is attaching to is more than 4 inches in diameter.  AD2	-1
be very careful and seem to plug up after one use so not very good for small jobs	-1
Advanced Strength? I'd like to see what standard strength is supposed to be. Does not stick well and is so thin it has no strength. Do not use for anything serious like taping boxes. The biggest thing that sticks here is what sticks in my craw after wasting money on it. Worse yet they sell it in a 2 pack and have the gaul to call it contractors tape.	-1
This stuff really sticks, especially to your fingers and itself. As for anything else: maybe-maybe not. The most frustrating thing about this brand is that it doesn't tear clean and always leaves a stringer that peals back on the roll. This is pretty much for the know-nothings that heard a name so they get this. You are far better off with something like 3M of some other generic at the hardware stores. This junk is just not worth the frustration!	-1
Not really transparent.  It has plainly visible fibers running through it which make it non-transparent so I couldn't use it for applying it over labels like I bought it for.	-1
Not even close to as tough as the regular duct tape I bought this for multi purpose tape but it doesn't serve its purpose I am a tape lover I like to have some laying around. this is not transparent so it defeats the point of buying theres no going around it its not clear. and doesn't stick to anything I was hoping to give it a nice review	-1
Plug pops out like others. Clamp is too short inside unit. Works great otherwise, but don't expect the female portion to work consistently or properly. Inside just broke on me. Another poor product in the trash!	-1
The outside dimensions and design of this line splitter are fine. Both of my clamp -on ammeters fit the 1X and 10X holes well. And, the voltage meter probe holes are handy. But I immediately noticed that , when plugging into the female end, the plugs tended to spring back out.  This was especially true for two blade plugs.  Something was obviously wrong with the female receptacle contacts, so I took the device apart to investigate. Sure enough, the blade contacts were so far recessed into the housing that the plug blades barely made contact.  The internal shape of the plastic housing suggests that it was designed for longer blade contacts, but short ones were used instead. Also, one power wire was not soldered to the blade contact, as were the other wires. The unsoldered wire was simply pushed through a hole in the contact, but someone forgot to solder it. I modified the blade contacts so that plug blades would make good contact, and I soldered the loose wire. Still, however, the female plug receptacle contacts are weak, and will eventually break if this device is used often. To address that problem, I plugged a multi-plug adapter into the female end,  and I plan to tape or glue the adapter into place . That way, the unit's internal weak blade contacts will not repeatedly be stressed by inserting plugs directly into the unit.  Also, the stiff, solid wire inside is soldered to one of the plug receptacle flexible contacts. That joint is bound to eventually break as the receptacle flexes. How this device qualified for a UL listing, I'll never know. But, having spent about two hours modifying it , I do plan to keep it , and use it when needed.  ( The "Kill a Watt" power meters, also sold by Amazon,  are a better bet for most uses, and far more versatile.)	-1
I got these Fluke TL175 test leads not too long ago. Recently I notice a resistance fluctuation  when I try to zero the meter out.  Not the best test leads. Look for something else, like Probe Master.	-1
Wow I am so surprised at the poor quality control of these test leads. FIRST THE GOOD: Unlike the cheap plastic test leads that were supplied with my new Fluke 177 (which was frustrating,) these upgraded Fluke test leads have fantastic flexible wires, and they are somehow slippery so they don't want to tangle at all.  Five stars on the wire. BUT THE BAD: The first set of leads I ordered came with a perfect red lead, but the black lead was warped, slightly banana shaped.  What the heck?  These are supposed to be top quality.  So I arranged to exchange them with Amazon, and Amazon had a new set here the very next morning.  Kudos to Amazon!  But when I opened them up, this time BOTH leads were warped.  In opposite directions, so it's clearly not an intentional thing.  And besides, I got ONE lead that was perfectly straight.  See photo.  Also, on one of the gray probes, the "grip ring" towards the front of the probe was sort of distorted/melted somewhat (not seen in photo.) It just seems crazy that Fluke's quality control is so poor that they let such obvious defects get through. I might expect this from cheap Chinese knock-offs, but these are definitely genuine Fluke - the packaging matches all of the other Fluke products, and the listing says it's provided by Fluke. I'm at a loss of what to do at this point -- no other lead I've tried comes close to the flexibility and pleasure of these cords...but it's so annoying to pay so much money for a defective product.  Do I roll the dice and try to exchange them for a THIRD set?	-1
As a general rule, fluke makes top quality products.  My fluke multimeter and amp clamp I can absolutely count on to verify a component as good or bad.  This is why I willingly paid over 400 for my multimeter instead of getting a cheaper one.  Their leads on the other hand I've not had good luck with.  About every 2 years, they'll fail on me.  A couple of times, I was forced to run to sears or wherever to pick up a replacement pair.  So I have some by craftsman, extech, and such.  The flukes have this nice anti grip coating on the outside of the wires so they don't bind up knotted as easily as others.  The flukes are also very pliable further assisting in not getting knotted.  I'll continue using my fluke meter and amp clamp, and if I break them I'd replace with another fluke.  Their leads on the other hand, I'm giving up on.	-1
i recently ordered this online thinking it would help me cure my gingivitis, well 4 days of using this 2 times a day i am now starting to think other wise...  Because instead of my gums turning pink they turn a dark red after each brush and remain that way for an hour, then return to normal light red color.  This toothpaste is not for every one be cautious of GSE liquid concentrate..  if you are going to use it as a mouth wash, PLEASE DONT it will destroy your gum tissue	-1
In a word.  Junk.  I suppose they would be fine for roach clips but that's about it.  The joint was wobbly so the jaws never line up.  The arms were ground down crudely for some reason.  There were grinding marks through the finish.  That while it may have solved some previous problem with the forceps it made the arms so weak that they bend even when you close them on nothing.  these wouldn't even hold a fly while I tied it on the line.  Skip these and get a decent pair.	-1
I'm kind of surprised these got such high star ratings. For the utility, these are going to work for me just fine. The fit and finish is what has me struggling to even give these a 2 star rating. Some pits from rust, hammer marks, polish is very poor, teeth on self locking mechanism are uneven and jagged, hinge area is sloppily constructed, and it's not really straight either. The teeth at the end don't fit snugly together because of the uneven thickness of the metal so there about a 1mm gap in some areas of the teeth. These look as if a high school student made them in metalshop. Mine have a stamp on them saying Pakistan so I assume that's where they are made.	-1
poorly made, jaws do not align.	-1
Since I purchased both this and the Eva-Dry I will use this review to compare the two.  This pales in comparison to the Eva-Dry E-333.  If money or space is super tight maybe this is a good option but otherwise the Eva-Dry is superior in every way except that it takes up more space (it's about 6"x6"x1.5").  Reasons:  It holds 100g of silica gel  It has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hours  It has a hanger attachment  The window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the color  The construction is much better - This one was almost separating at the edges and pink fluid was leeching out of the sides onto a paper towel once it was full	-1
spit glue, Gorilla glue is more like spit glue, you spit in your hand and hope it sticks. same like gorilla glue.	-1
this glue does not work.	-1
No strong joint, no adhesion to plastics, metals, glass or whatsoever. No matter what seller says, this is WOOD GLUE. For wood it works nicely, but do not ever attempt to use it for anything else.	-1
I've used this over the past few years and many items have now come apart. The glue seems to get brittle and break. It also bubbles up to yellow/orange tint which is annoying. I guess if your using the glue to seal 2 pieces of carpet together or something that will be walked on, it works fine. But for items you intend on handling it's a joke. And I've followed the directions so don't suggest this. I now use E6000 glue.	-1
I am a pretty experienced hobby woodworker.  I personally don't care for this glue.  It's messy, it foams up, isn't as strong as other PVA glues like Titebond in tests.  Overall, if I want a waterproof glue I'll use Titebond 3.	-1
Try to buy only as much as you intend to use. My large bottle went south after one year. By the way, Elmer's is probably as good as Gorilla and costs less.	-1
Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle). I've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue.	-1
Mike says: November 4, 2009 at 11:15 am  I think Gorilla Glue is crap. I made a repair with it and it failed costing me a job and a client. Sure it sticks to wood but what glue doesn't. You want to do the job right use wood glue for wood and epoxy for anything else that really needs a good bond. Seriously I used this stuff for numerous glue jobs and it expands, foams up and really does not stick very well. I am 49 years old and was a professional carpenter for 7 years. I own a business that used to repair speakers and am quite experienced in the use of glue. Nothing sticks like a good epoxy.	-1
I had some previous 15 x 20 containers that fit my cabinets. These are MUCH bigger than 15 x 20 and would not fit in my cabinets. And the picture shows 2 containers, but there is only 1. Disappointed!!	-1
It fits as in bigger than necessary. Not remotely tight.	-1
Just set up a brand new Dillon Precision XL650 and darn near got a case stuck in a die right out of the gate using this stuff. Resprayed the cases with a friends lanolin / isopropyl mixture and no problem whatsoever. This product is not a good case / die lube, do yourself a favor and check on U-Tube for the lanolin / isopropyl mixtures, beats this overpriced and unreliable product hands down	-1
Too hard to read which makes it not very accurate	-1
Used this twice and then it simply stopped working - it simply would not turn on.  I would have returned it, but it was outside the Amazon return period.  Cannot recommend.	-1
not a very good product as it has only one stripe that goes under the product you are trying to carry --one stripe is not enough as it will not keep the balance at all where the safety comes to a question. Will not use it for anything at all. Wasted my money, had high hopes for it but disappointed.  for the safety aspect I will never recommend this product -- otherwise they used good material I have to say.	-1
The jack only has 4.75" of throw. This is the distance it will actually lift something. The length of the piston fully extended.  It also has a 2.25" screw out extension that will help you get the most out of the limited throw, but will not actually lift anything. If your sidewall is more than 5" high and you have a complete flat this little fellow will not raise your axle enough to get the new wheel and tire on. This jack will be fine if you are running 30 series tires but for anything taller I'd look elsewhere.	-1
Will not hold, leaks.	-1
Abutment to small that it could damage your car. You should use additional wooden pads. Also, not enough height. I have BMW 525	-1
I guess I don't have the smarts to work this thing. It seams to give the same tone all the time. It's not made well and just getting the 9 volt battery in the case feels junky. It is a tight fit and i was concerned with pull the wires loose.	-1
Not very good quality.  Doesn't always work as well as it should.	-1
Review for: Extech 480823 EMF Meter  OVERVIEW: -----------  Measures EMF strength of low frequency (30Hz-300Hz in this case) portion of AC MAGNETIC FIELD (NOT AC electric field, too) from ONE AXIS (direction) in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT).  Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies. You would want a separate meter for that.  The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings.  The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mg (+ 3 digits). Since the vast majority of the consumer use of EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.  This will do fine for noting the EXISTENCE of stronger EMF at lower frequencies, but appears to be a highly inaccurate choice for MEASURING it.  MAIN VALUE: ------------  - Measures EMF at 30Hz-300Hz low frequency range (Magnetic AC field only, not Electric AC Field), which covers most EMF generated by AC power in most homes/offices. 60Hz (U.S.) and much of the EMF generated by resulting harmonic frequencies .. 120Hz (2nd harmonic), 180Hz (3rd), 240Hz (4th), 300Hz (5th).  CONS: ------  - HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings .. a fixed +/- 8.3 milligauss (mG). Since most suggested defensive limits for extended exposure are 1mG-2mG or so, this greatly limits its utility. See paragraph above under "The Achilles Heal of this instrument.." for more detail.  - Measures only AC magnetic field (mG/uT), NOT AC ELECTRIC FIELD (V/m,mW/cm2, etc.). Adding electric field measurement with decent accuracy would have added greatly to the cost.  NOTES: -------  - Like other meters anywhere near this price range, the company doesn't claim this unit will filter out <30Hz and >300MHz EMF as well as academic/professional units like the Enertech Emdex II filters out EMF from outside its measurement range.  - This frequency range does not cover cell phones or cordless phone signals, microwave oven radiation, or other high frequencies often referred to as RF (radio frequency).  SAMPLE EMF MEASUREMENTS: -----------------------------  There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels). However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships. Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.  Here are some sample readings of LOW frequency AC MAGNETIC field EMF (Note: not electric field):  (1) Alarm Clock 3" 25mG 6" 10mG 1' 3mG 1.5' 1.8mG 2' 0.5mG  (2) Microwave Oven #1 (Home) Towards decent seal: 6" 10-30mG 1' 4-25mG 2' 1.5-5mG Towards questionable seal: 6" 160mG 1' 45mG 2' 15mG  (3) Microwave Oven #2 (Office) 6" 50mG 1' 20mG 2' 3mG 3' 1.2mG  (4) CRT Television (20" Sony WEGA) Down the middle: 6" 0.9mG 1' 0.5mG 2' 0.2mG Corners: 6" 5.5mG 1' 3mG 2' 0.7mG Sides/Edges in the middle vertically: 6" 7mG 1' 3.5mG 2' 0.9mG  (5) 2012 LED Television 3" 0.6mG  (6) Dehumidifier (Large 70pt.

Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.  As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.  Regarding Electric Fields of 50-60Hz (AC Power), there is some rough consensus out there to keep below 10-20 V/m and sleep at a spot below 5 V/m, though again opinions vary. 5 V/m was the recommendation in Germany and by the IRPA/INIRC for "private individuals", 10 V/m for "workers", with 25 V/m for "workers" for max. 2 hours. ACGIH recommend 1 V/m for those with pacemakers or other electrically sensitive implants.  The fields in the lower frequency ranges are sometimes referred to as ELF (see chart below for usual acronym meanings of this sort), or even confusingly as EMF which is also often used to define such fields at most frequencies.  EMF(RF) FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES:  At HIGH FREQUENCIES like those the high frequency meters measure, the magnetic and electric fields are coupled so strongly together that it is one field that is measured, usually in V/m or mW/cm2, etc.  For microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) biological exposure is often recommended to not exceed 5 mW/cm2 (milliwatts per cm squared), however again opinions vary.  Some school or hospital exposure limits for 300MHz-300GHz: - France, Italy 10 mW/cm2 in schools - Switzerland 9.5 mW/cm2 in schools, 4.25 mW/cm2 in hospitals - Belgium, Luxembourg 2.4 mW/cm2  For RF Fields of 900MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 4.5W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.  For RF Fields of 1800MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 9W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.  The higher frequencies are often referred to as RF (radio frequency) frequencies (think cell phones, microwaves, etc.) and thus you'll see some meters with "RF" in the title or description.  MAGNETIC VS. ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT:  AC MAGNETIC FIELDS are much harder to shield than electric fields. On the other hand unperturbed AC ELECTRIC FIELDS are much harder to measure accurately/dependably than Magnetic fields. IEEE tries to help with IEEE 644-1994. The inexpensive models don't pretend to measure this as well as the Enertech Emdex II's of the world, however they are often much less expensive and there's your trade-off.  Note that AC ELECTRIC FIELDS often remain as long as the the source is plugged in, whether it is turned on or off.  So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields? An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both. Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate. If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.  GENERAL:  Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement. Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz). Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.  The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office. This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that. Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so. However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.  Note that measured values can become less trustworthy as you get very close to the source of an EMF field, so measuring practically next to the source is often questionable.  Also note that pulsed EMF is usually not read accurately by EMF meters.  Note that if you need to take high radar frequency field strength into account (think Traffic Control Radar, Aviation, Naval, Military) because say you live near an airport and are wondering .. you'll probably need a meter that reads in the 8.5GHz-9.5GHz range.  Note: I can't imagine who might work so close to one, but keep CFL bulbs without specific UVB and UVC mitigation (think double-envelope eco bulbs, for example) more than 20cm/8" from people at the bare minimum.

IRPA - International Radiation Protection Association SCENIHR - Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (European Union advisory group). INIRC - International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee ICNIRP - International Commission on Nonionizing Radiation Protection WHO - World Health Organization International EMF Project U.S. EMF RAPID Program - 6 year working group put together in the past by NIEHS, NIH, and DOE. NRC/NAS - National Research Council / National Academy of Sciences by way of National Academy Press CA Dept. of Health Services - CA EMF Program IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers VDB - Association of German Building Biologists (Verband Deutscher Baubiologen)  Further future related research discoveries are likely to involve, or at least be reported on, by one or more of these organizations as they have been involved in such research in the past (much of it you can find on the web).  HOW TO GET 3D READINGS FROM FROM 3 XYZ AXES METER READINGS: ------------------------------------  While some tools take "3D" readings, to save money some folks buy meters that read 1 or 3 individual axes, not a composite "3D" reading.  To make a "3D" reading out of the individual axes readings you are supposed to put each of the three axis meter readings into the equation "square root (x-squared + y-squared + z-squared)".  However, here are some short-cut estimations for less demanding needs that some use:  Measurement Value:......Corresponding Guesstimate 1 High, 2 Low values....Use highest value 2 High, 1 Low value.....Use highest value plus half of second highest 3 similar values........Use 1.5x highest value  MEASURING SUGGESTIONS: --------------------------  Consider/test: - Keeping unit over 1ft away from any conductive material like metals. - Putting unit on a non-conductive holder like dry wood or cardboard. - Reading meter from 5 feet away. - If measuring over a bed, measuring 2" above mattress to take pillow into account and lessen the measurement effect of the springs (if there are any, of course).  SOME OTHER METERS: ----------------------  If looking for a high-end, accurate low frequency EMF meter, consider starting your research with these:  (1) ENERTECH EMDEX II Measures AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields in the 40Hz-800Hz range, 3-axis, 1-2% of value accuracy. Sold to power companies and universities in 50+ countries, this is a leading industry tool. It also has recording, event marking, and software capabilities consistent with the needs of consultants. It is also excellent at filtering out EMF outside 40Hz-800Hz and is unusually accurate in reading AC Electric Field. ($2,950 for base unit)  (2) GIGAHERTZ SOLUTIONS meters Made in Germany, sold in North America through Safe Living Technologies, Gigahertz Solutions has a wide variety of accurate affordable models that cover many frequency ranges priced from under two hundred to over a thousand dollars. Here are some of them, all these listed have HIGH ACCURACY and measure both AC MAGNETIC and AC ELECTRIC fields: 3030B 16Hz-2KHz ($175) This model is a value sweet spot for non-professionals, offering most of everything one is looking for in accurately low frequency magnetic and electric fields. ME3030B Electromagnetic Field Meter 3830B 16Hz-100KHz ($270) This model extends the frequency range to include a range sometimes controversially referred to as dirty electricity. CFL bulbs, switching-mode power supplies, electronic dimmers, and monitors sometimes fall in this range, too. ME3830B - Standard Electromagnetic field meter for Low Frequency 3840B 5Hz-100KHz ($400) The addition of frequency filters for source analysis is the important added feature here, not as much the extension at the lower range. ME3840B - Semi professional Electromagnetic field meter for Low Frequency 3851A 5Hz-100KHz ($540) Before the NFA1000 the ME3851A/ME3951 were the models most used by professionals ME3851A/ME3951 models have data outputs [Not Amazon listed atm] 3951A 5Hz-400KHz ($770) Before the NFA1000 the ME3851A/ME3951 were models most used by professionals ME3851A/ME3951 models have data outputs ME3951A Professional Electromagnetic Field Meter Low Frequencies Gauss Meter NFA1000 3D 5Hz-1000Hz ($2400) 3D AC Magnetic and AC Electric Field reading, a time saver for professionals Gigahertz Solution's competitor to the Enertech Emdex II Comes with data analysis software Accurate 3D readings of AC Electric fields is considered a tough task, hats off to the Gigahertz Solutions folks for upping the ante. Magnetic Electric Meters NFA 1000 EMF Analyzer-5kHz to 1,000,000 kHz  SPECTRUM ANALYZERS. To measure EMF/RF field strengths AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES you will need a spectrum analyzer. Some consultants use these for higher-end analyses, however there is usually much more expense and skill involved clearly. Below is the maker of an affordable hand held spectrum analyzer solution you may wish to read up on..  (3) Aaronia AG Spectran handheld spectrum analyzer I suggest reviewing their website for model options if considering these, there is a variety of models and bundles covering different frequency ranges, covering both AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields. The U.S. Distributor is Kaltman Creations (Aaronia AG is in Germany). - Low Frequency Range Examples: Aaronia AG Spectran NF-1010E (10Hz-10KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 5% accuracy) NF-1010E AARONIA Handheld Spectrum Analyzer (10Hz - 10KHz) Aaronia AG Spectran NF-3020 (10Hz-400KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields 5% accuracy) NF-3020 AARONIA Handheld Spectrum Analyzer (10Hz - 400KHz) Aaronia AG Spectran NF-5030 (1Hz-1MHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 3% accuracy) [Couldn't find on Amazon]  (4) If you are considering spectrum analyzers and money isn't much of an issue you might consider reviewing Tektronix, HP, and Agilent offerings, too, perhaps others, just to know what's out there at the high-end if nothing else. Of course, for most folks this is way out of budget and often skill set.  I hope this helps some folks serious about EMF/RF measuring get started.	-1
The information on this meter is inaccurate.  There is no external sensor to allow for accurate measurement.  The slightest movement will give different readings.  I returned this item.	-1
I have the 18" model. It ran 12 hours a day for 6 months then suddenly stopped. I turned the fan blade by hand and noticed it would hardly budge. I took the motor apart and the sleeve bearings on either end were almost dry. I packed some grease into those bearings and reassembled the motor and it is now working, but I don't think my fix will last long.  When I first got the unit, I noticed that spinning the fan blade by hand was more difficult than I expected. The sleeve bearings are too high in friction so you pay for electricity to overcome this as well as create a lot of heat that tends to eat up lubricant.  The shutter assembly is understandably very thin and light weight. Unless you mount it to an absolutely flat surface, the slightest racking of the aluminum frame will prevent the shutters from opening or closing.  Not too impressed with this unit.	-1
This toothbrush lasted all of three weeks.  Water gets into the battery compartment and ruins the batteries.  Save your money for an Oral-B toothbrush.	-1
It doesn't really work too well. It's a week old and I cannot hold it and turn it on with the same hand. I have to hold it with one hand than use the nail/finger of my other to turn it on. Also it kind of wiggles; wouldn't call it vibrating or pulsating or oscillating.	-1
I saw lots of really nice reviewing comparing to the more expensive toothbrush like sonic care. Let me tell you, the power is no where near a "real" the sonic care. It went into the garbage on the first try.	-1
This kit failed to tell how to DISINFECT the faucet end BEFORE one took water sample in order to make the bacterial test legitimate. I got a positive on the bacteria, which scared me. BUT, it came out negative when the local public health re-did it. The Public Health kit requires firing (sterilizing) the faucet with a barbecue or cigarette lighter before ANY testing, AND to run the water for 10-15 minutes before taking samples for any test.  This kit does not give any such instructions, not even to run the water for a while. Since this is a water well test, the idea is to get the sitting water out of both your holding tank and your pipes by running for a while. That way you'll get to the "real" water as it comes from your well.  If you use this kit, without doing the above 2 things, your results will not be accurate, and you'll have to pay the regular price for a pro re-testing! (over $100 in my area)	-1
Incredibly small. I've purchased much larger syringes with same material for same price at mechanical-supply houses. Barely had enough to do what I needed, let-alone have any as a spare.	-1

THE PHOTO OF THE PRODUCT WAS THE SAME AS I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MAYBE 20 YEARS.  WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS TINY.  THERE WAS HARDLY ENOUGH GOO FOR ONE CPU.  VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PRESENTATION ON AMAZON.  NO WARNING I WAS ORDERING  A SUBSTANDARD QUANTITY.	-1
Got this idea that maybe I could use this thing to hook my sander up to my rigid shopvac. Nope  won't work	-1
What I received was NOT what is pictured, not even close. The product picture clearly shows a thumb wheel adjuster. There's no thumb wheel on what I got. As if that wasn't bad enough I cannot believe what I received is a Brown&Sharpe. Talk about being cheaply made. I have an older Brown and Sharpe and I bought this because sometimes I need to have two calipers on hand and wanted a quality instrument. well I guess I'll have to look elsewhere. I am sending this POS back! For those out there who are content with second/third rate calipers and enjoy name calling GOOD for you I am glad you are happy with an inferior product and receiving something you didn't order. I saw a thumb wheel in the pictured product description so I want what is shown not a cheaper substitute the seller decides to send instead. I also own an older pair of B&S calipers that are first rate. These newer ones are a mere shadow when compared  with the older ones. In fact a pair of RCBS China made that I also own is a cut above.  So go ahead and be a cheerleader for junk. Buy a hundred pairs of these new B&S. You will need them. What I said is 100% true, ignore my advice at your own risk!	-1
These are the worst. They look lke they are use burnt marks on the clips.	-1
One of the leads failed the first time I used it.	-1
I was hoping for more but these leads are reminiscent of those sold by bargain electronics houses in the 60s and 70s.  The wire is of a very light gauge which has more meaning than just current carrying capacity.  They do not stand up to flexing and will break after a short period of use.  I became curious about how the lead wires were bonded to the clips.  I pulled off a few covers and couldn't see how this was done.  finally I saw the end of a copper wire sticking out of the crimp next to where the insulation went in.  I subjected one to destructive analysis and found that after the end of the wire had been stripped the copper wire had been bent back along the insulation and the clip was crimped on it.  Without being soldered the electrical connection won't be good for long.  Wear from bending will gradually soften the insulation and the force that holds the wire and clip in contact will weaken resulting in an a high resistance connection.  Also the crimping was not uniform from one clip to another, some of them being just barely holding.  This indicates a primitive manufacturing jig or maybe they were crimped by hand using pliers.	-1
I bought these to replace some of my old ones. I was using these today to test out some basic stuff and was getting a very unexpected result. I used my voltmeter to check connectivity on between the clips of the wire I was using and was surprised to see infinite resistance!  I pulled back the sheath to the allegator clip and found that the wire wasn't even connected to the clip. The wire's insulation was just crimped on without the inner wire core touching the clip. None of them were even soldered on.	-1
These test leads use small wires, which shouldn't lead to problems. However they connected the wires so loosely in the ends, and without solder, that the wires completely come loose from the end. This makes these single star worthy.	-1
poor attachment of wires.	-1
To small!!	-1
Very low quality,	-1
wire is way too small a gauge to be really useful in my application.	-1
Wires are too stiff. Wire needs to be much more flexable. More strands of smaller wire size would do the job.	-1
The wires are thinner than advertised - probably 28 ga. - I had a brief 12vdc low current short with one and it was red hot in 1 second.  The vinyl protective sleeves around the clips are so slick it's almost impossible to get a grip on them without the alligator clip slipping and turning inside the slippery sleeve so you can't squeeze it open. I wound up cutting them off and discarding the plastic sleeves and just using the bare leads  These are no bargain. Junk.	-1
These test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use. Ifter a couple of them pulled apart then I just threw the rest of them out. Low grade product.	-1
BOUGHT THESE WIRES AND ONLY 4 OF THEM REALLY WORKED. THEY WERENT AS GOOD AS ALL THE OTHERS BUT THEY WERE SIMPLY, OK. DONT RECCOMEND THEM BUT IF YOUR DESPERATE GIVE IT A TRY	-1
Items of EXREMELY poor quality; out of the bag, the alligator clips were not connected or pulled off leads.  Some leads were not adequately crimped, some leads were open circuit, vinyl clip insulators slip off easily and are difficult to reinstall. I would not buy these items again.	-1
These are the most pathetic excuse for jumpers I've ever seen. They look like something produced in a slave labor camp. The wire MIGHT be 28 ga. and isn't very well connected to the alligator clips. I only bought these to get my order over $25 so I could get free shipping. Since they have almost no value, that means I paid $3.67 for shipping. Could have been worse. At least I can salvage the alligator clips and MAKE MY OWN jumpers. If you need a good laugh, buy these.	-1
These are a bargain, I guess, but I just HATE how the clip sleeves slip off and don't allow you to get a good grip. Then it's hard to get 'em back on when you get the idea to slide them off the clip. Errrgggh! But they are what they are. When you get some bucks, go for higher quality clips.	-1
These are absolutely the worst leads I've ever seen.  They prove that the "cheap overseaas" moniker is deserved and --astoundingly-- devolving.  The wire is maybe 28 AWG, _maybe_.  It's uncoated copper, pre-corroded (turning green/black).  The plastic coating is a bit rougher (which initially seemed nice, versus the previous el-cheapo leads with shiny plastic coating).  The clips are of course awful.  The clips are crimped (not soldered) onto the wires and coating, with the bared wires folded back over the coating...meaning that simply "adding a dab of solder to the crimp" (which used to work on all previous el-cheapo leads) no longer works and instead causes a molten, stinky plastic mess.  Beware this product; they've actually made what was already horrible much worse.  I'd send them back if it didn't cost more.  I find my opinion of Amazon decreasing as I discover they carry such total garbage.  And the clowns who write positive or blaise or non-critical reviews of technical products, well, maybe they should go overseas, too.  It pains me that such garbage products have been put into place and have put out well-made products, American or otherwise.  The commentator Gerald Celente mentions a "Made in China" backlash that's been long brewing.  Total garbage products like this junk frenetically propel that eventuality, but not nearly enough.  These leads are total, absolute junk -- build your own.  Get American made Mueller clips from Digikey and some real 22 AWG Teflon coated wire from Weico and save yourself the trouble, cost and aggravation of discovering Yet Another piece of total overseas garbage.	-1
Never will buy this again.	-1
The instructions are outdated.  It's a minor issue, but not one that'll stop a seasoned electronics vet, but a noobie might trip up on it.  It has a few capacitors with higher voltage ratings than the instructions list.  For me or anyone not new to electronics, you can use the power of deduction and some common sense to figure out where they go.  No biggie.  Could cast doubt for a complete noobie who's just getting into electronics.  But like I said, minor issue.  The MAJOR issue on the other hand, is the front panel they sent me.  It's apparently for some other kit they sell because I had to drill out two of the slide switch holes and also the holes for the potentiometers.  (the holes for the banana jacks were they though, which is weird)  It definitely did not turn out as "pretty" as it could have had it been pre-drilled, but this is crap.  I'd ask for my money back but I had already decided to just drill it but after seeing the ugly results, regretted it since now I can't get my money back.  Apparently no QC goes into these.  As far as performance... it does work.  Fairly well I suppose.  The sine wave isn't very accurate at all.  Square wave is fine.  Ramp looked ok too.  So... all in all, if you want a good function generator, just get a "good" bench function/wave gen.  (Rigol and BK Precision have "cheap" ones that are pretty good for the price for entry level hobbyists)  It's not fair to compare this product to a real function generator, but it sort of is a fair comparison considering you can get a used Agilent, HP, or Tektronix waveform generator on ebay for $50-100.  The brand new Rigol ones start around $379 and they'll do arbitrary waveforms.  BK Precision has ones for $269, and a true DDS one for $309.  I'd recommend going with a used one on ebay or getting a Rigol or BK precision.  Happy soldering!	-1
They are not steel, they are cast metal. Cheaply made. Disappointed. Everything is junk anymore.	-1

The product description shows as galvanized nails, but the nails I received are standard nails. When I received replacement, I tried to nail a few and leave them them outside. To my surprised, every time I tried my DeWalt gun was clogged. It works with all other types of nails, except this one.	-1

I was using these on an oak face frame and the screws kept breaking. Not what I expected from Kreg.	-1
I bought this with two different calibrating fluids, 342 and 1000. At first it wouldn't turn on, but after several tries it did. I checked its reading in the calibration fluids. For 342, it read 330, for 1000 it read 700. Not acceptable. While I was testing it and calibrate it, the meter turned off by itself and I could never get it to turn back on.  Very disappointed in a unit that can't work long enough to test and calibrate out of the box,. Now I wonder if my old TDS meter that died after very light usage was accurate at all. Definitely not worth buying. Guess I'll be searching for a better brand.	-1
failed after a week,,,	-1
I bought this item based on the good reviews and I thought it would save me money by prolonging the filter life. However things did not go as planned. One of the units broke down less than 1 month of use. Luckily it was still in the return window and I easily got it exchanged. For those who wonder, I did not dip it all the way down , so it was not my obvious fault it broke down. Second one has been working fine in terms of getting on and off as it supposed to but the readings of the same sample within ten minutes is completely different. The variation is more than 10%, so accuracy is questionable. Besides, I change the filter and compare the before and after readings and do not see a change at all. You can say that the filter itself is not working and it may be true, but I feel the difference in taste while this machine sees nothing in numbers. So if I had a second chance, I would not buy this item, yet so far it has saved me nothing at all.	-1
The actual silicone delivered from this canister is excellent quality and performs well for preventing vibration induced loss of mechanical items. However the delivery valve and mechanism leave a lot to be desired. I use small quantities over a number of weeks and after about 5 screw-on-screw-off uses, the threads on the valve begin to overhaul, the valve fails to shut completely with consequential hardening of the silicone in the dispensing nossle and necessary removal and shoving a screwdriver into it to unjam the solid material.  I bought a box of these and although the dispensed product works well I would not recommend this and I will not be purchasing further items with this type of dispensing mechanism. It is a pain to have to start every use dismantling and clearing the nossle and using a pair of pliers to push the valve because the plastic threads have overhauled. I would not recommend this dispensing mechanism unless you intend to use the entire contents in one session.	-1
it does not work in any material :(	-1
I will not buy this again. It seems messy and not as good as the Museum Putty. I have to keep re-setting items that come loose for no good reason.	-1
Product is still gooey 24 hours later at room temperature.  Weak, and rather difficult to mix properly.  Will not buy again.	-1
This Subco uses a Positive Temperature Coefficient Relay (as stated on their website) not a Potential Relay.  Not Good!  Only use Hard Start Kits that use a true Potential Relay. The RectorSeal Kickstart (2 wire) and the 5-2-1 Compressor Saver (3 wire) hard start kits use a Potential Relay. I recommend the Kickstart (it uses 2 wires that connect to the Run Capacitor - HERM and COM). But the Compressor Saver is also good (3 wires with one connecting to the common / ground on the Contactor relay). They both work the same way - the Potential Relay detects the pickup voltage (back EMF). This causes the relay to disconnect the start capacitor when the compressor reaches about 75% speed (usually less than a second).  Note:  Supco does have hard start kits with a Mechanical Potential Relay (Models 3W1, 3W2, & 3W3).	-1
My capacitor only lasted 1&1/2 nights. It was attached to Analog dial Frigidaire FFRA05L1R1 5000btu AC. It cooled a tear droptrailer no problem,but cycled often so maybe that was the issue. It probably cycled every 1/2 hour. I was using a 2200 Yamaha generator and it wouldn't work with the AC on high until I added this so it did work. I'm thinking I need a bigger capacitor or use the low setting after it cools down so it doesn't cycle as much. Any ideas?	-1
Did not work for me- actually made the compressor on my RV camper (Polar Cub 9200) noisy and hard to start.  I checked and double checked the wiring-	-1
I bought the O'Berry 3233 Squeeeek No More Floor Kit to use with these screws.  I used as directed and had NO positive results.  I did locate the joists properly and I know I positively hit each one.  I must have used at least 125 screws in a 5' x 6' area with all the squeeks  remaining.	-1
This works fine in a vertical position but I purchased for a specific need where it would have to be almost horizontal and it doesn't work at all there.	-1
I initiated a return immediately after getting it.  It leaked oil and would not pump.  Terrible paint job all over and the relief valve was painted into position.  Obviously poor quality.  Thank God for Amazon returns.  It is all packed up and will mail it back tomorrow.  Looked for a higher quality bottle jack by reading the reviews on the site, seems they are all badly made.  So ordered a Craftsman, and will see.  Why isn't there a quality bottle jack at a reasonable price?	-1
Item arrived with cracked case. Jack too heavy for flimsy molded plastic case. Threads on release valve  leaking oil , had to tape with hydraulic tape. Cheap price but not the best quality.	-1
Once you start dispensing this stuff, it just keeps on coming out until the can is empty. Better have a big job and all of your ducks in a row. Due to the continuous nature of the flow you'd better have a disposable container handy to catch the overflow. If you get it on your hands, clothes or finish work it is there forever.	-1
Anyone who uses this knows how unforgiving this stuff is if you get it on places you don't want it, like your clothing. To lessen your odds of keeping clean, they thought of this nice trigger that screws onto the top, that constantly unscrews itself while using it. Then the foam starts shooting out the base of the nozzle all over your hands, floor and clothing. Most of the time I use this I don't have the luxury of keeping the can away from my body. I'm usually on my back shooting up in cracks or whatever. Please redesign this so the damn trigger stays put.	-1
Figured this would complete the tub job I needed to do. Nope. I though Dap was the leader for these things but I was wrong. Once the tube end was cut the caulk continuously pumped out, I had to press an old shirt around the tip to preserve the product as I worked. The stuff was watery and messy, stunk like hell. After peeling the blue tape the caulk came with it making the trim of white uneven and sloppy looking.  I redid the job with GE's brand, at least that dries in a few hours, not what I'm hearing from this kwik seal crap. Get in the game DAP..!	-1
This stuff is terrible. Only seems to cure *IN* the dispense tube. Made a huge mess in many places where the yellow spewage only hardened on the surface - the space behind was just partially full of sticky goo that never cured. "Re-using" the can is a nightmare as the nozzle clogs hopelessly and repeatedly, even with cleaned with Acetone, pokers, and compressed air. This is basically a "one shot and and hope it works" kind of product. It does say "single use" on the can...and they are not kidding. This doesn't work like a can of spray paint.  I've used one entire can and have sealed exactly *ZERO* gaps, despite having to clean up 12 sticky messes after all the re-trys.  And yes, I've shaken the can twelve billion times. James Bond would be proud.  Find some other way. This stuff SUCKS.  FOUND IT ==> Buy the Locitite "Tite Foam" product (also on Amazon) instead. SOOOO much better. Worked beautifully on the first try, nozzle straw is bigger and transparent so you can actually see where it is clogged. The Great Stuff can has a tiny diameter, completely opaque straw that is super difficult to clean out if you want to try to make a second run.	-1
This stuff is dangerous. If you get any on your hands you will have to remove skin to get it off, to me it's not worth the continued risk so I threw mine away after the first (unfortunate) experience with it. The black stains over my hands, which no solvent would remove, even after 30 minutes of scrubbing, will have to wear off, I hope. But there should be a very clear warning about this included with each purchase, not to do so is irresponsible.	-1
hard to press and wear out easily.	-1
Lousy quality item, arrived broken. Stuck me with return shipping. Parts are just crimped together. One was in pieces in the envelope, the other fell apart the moment I pressed the button.	-1
So I buy the 5 foot high lift jack. And of course I want the accessories, so I bought this wonderful item to give it a larger footprint. The picture shows it attached to the Jack neatly and they actually brag about it by including it in bold print!  When it arrives, there's a big wraparound cardboard piece that Says "A center hole is drilled through the platform so that you can attach it to the Jack!!!"  And they show a big color picture that covers the vast majority of this cardboard insert around the Jack because they are proud of this. Then in small print, it says "hardware not included..."  You have got to be kidding me? Are you serious? What is this hardware we speak of? A 24 karat gold nugget? Made out of diamonds perhaps? Maybe platinum? No no no, it's a simple $1 BOLT AND WING NUT. That's right ladies and gentlemen, they were too cheap to supply a stupid little small bolt and wing nut to attach it to the stand!!!  Just utterly ridiculous and being cheap beyond my comprehension. Nuts and bolts in our days cost what? $.50? You mean to tell me you can't supply a stinking little bolt with a wing nut?  SHAME ON YOU, JUST SHAME ON YOU. GO HIDE YOUR HEAD IN THE DIRT LIKE AN OSTRICH.	-1
flimsy	-1
Total junk. We ordered 8 for a class, and neither the kids nor teachers could hear a heartbeat with ANY of them.  The plastic heads warped immediately, too - rendering them useless.  This is where you really should spend money on a REAL stethoscope.	-1

Great customer service as we did submit for a return. BP cuff only kind of worked but the stethoscope did not work at all. Smooth transactions overall.	-1
cheap product, do not buy. I cant hear a single beat. I can hear perfectly with my classmates 3M brand.	-1
It looks nice but for auscultation purposes it is less than desireable. I generally use ADC brand. Not impressed with this stethoscope and I primarily listen to breath sounds. I would not buy another. Actually looking for something to replace this one with now.	-1
This item was purchased as a gift for me.  It has a 30 day manufacturer's warranty and Amazon's return policy expired in Nov of '12.  It is the #105 steth, but even though it is a budget model, it should still function properly.  Taps on the diaphragm are about the only thing you can hear.  I gave it one star because the sphygmomanometer works very well.	-1
Too heavy to push ...pads do not stay on rotating brushes	-1
This was a nice idea but it didn't work well. Not heavy enough to actually clean and the brushes stopped spinning almost instantly. I sent it back.	-1
Second time I've bought this stuff.  Does a good job and there's twice the quantity of other epoxy putties  I use it for all kinds of different things.  Makes good hole filler, sticks very well, dries hard as can be but remains sandable.  However it just dropped from 5 stars to two when it jumped within one month from $5.83 to $14+ tax.  That's more than a 200% price hike and difficult to justify.  It brings it from the most reasonably priced product-- to one of the most expensive (with equal quality and less pricey brands on the market).  I have to question what warrants such a price hike.  When that happens I start shopping for alternatives.	-1
I find this duct tape no better than the cheap duct tape you'll find on sale at The Home Depot or Lowe's.	-1
I found that these cups were not watertight. Urine cups have one job: to securely hold a liquid. These cups failed on that count. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know. The lids also get cross-threaded quite easily and are a pain to put on. I will pay the 80% higher cost to stick with Fisherbrand cups next time.	-1
Brand new hose leaks like a sieve where connected at the spigot. Absolute total garbage product. You had one job Camco, I am embarrassed for you. This experience is so utterly ridiculous I will never consider another Camco product.	-1
I just used this hose for the 4th time, and the mail end brass to brass connector leaks. I leaks between the 2 brass pieces there is a seam between them. this is not bent. I will not be buying this brand hose again!!  I have always stored in the basement clean dry and in a box.	-1
These hoses are extremely stiff and will not lie flat.  Possibly makes them more durable but they do not lie flat making them hard to use and a trip hazard.	-1
The first time I used it, the end fell off... let me say that again, the end fell off.  It was the male end, and it appeared that it didn't get crimped correctly. Perhaps it was an isolated incident, but perhaps because everything that says RV is becoming more and more junk.	-1
Leaks, even with new washers. I've done everything I can think of. Too bad I'm past the return window. Should have tested this sooner.	-1
Quality is not very good. Kinks alot.	-1
Pure trash, the hose gets a sticky texture after being out in the sun. The end fittings leak even after installing "new" hose washers. This one is dirt brown, and leaking (dripping) in my garden as you read this. Get the Blue Camco hose ( the one I have is great),....or better yet, go get a 100' hose at Costco for $20 (appx) and run the water for a few minutes before installing. If you have to have an RV hose go with the blue one.	-1
If you go to the Camco website you will find that their hoses contain low lead levels. They are not lead free. CSA low lead content certified and complies with California's AB1953 and Vermont Act 193 Low Lead Laws. This is false advertisement.	-1
Exactly as described. Fast shipping!	-1
Leaks like a sieve after 6 months of use.	-1
I had to replace the one end that threads on to the faucet after only about 6 months of very low stress use. I put it on my dogs water dish. It was theaded on to the hose fitting and left turned on. It started to leak about 6 months later and the end had to be replaced. I am disappointed in this product.	-1
I bought this knowing it would probably be very stiff in cold weather since the chemicals used to keep vinyl hoses pliable are not allowed in drinking water hoses.  But, even after stretching it out in the sun for a few days, it snaps into a tight coil, especially when it's cold out.  It's usable but you do have to wrestle with it and getting it out to it's full length take some work.  I do not know if there are more pliable potable water hoses.	-1
Cheep crap. Came apart the first time I used it. Fixed it with a hose clamp. Still in use though.	-1
Kind of a cheap hose.  I use this for black tank flush only but I don't really like this hose.  It's cheap.  Kinks.	-1
Does not work in winter use. Bought for year round use and it is too stiff for winter use and too cheap for it too. Darn bought two. Off to find a better option and better hose that is not too stiff for use in the cooler temps. I would have thought an item made for camping would be perfect. WRONG. Read the negatives and you'll find out just how cheap it is. I didn't and my bad. I gave two stars for not liking but it well work in one month out of two. In MT, ID, WY, CO and even WA you can expect cold temperatures even in the summer let alone YEAR round.	-1
I bought this hose for our camper. We went camping this pass week and our neighbors our camping had the same problem. They said when they get home they are going to get rid of their too. Once you TRY to roll it up it has kinks in it and won't roll. So three of us will not be using this type of hose, the other people through theirs in the garbage. The hose is strong but the end was bent on ours in the first place. Thank God we had another hose to use.	-1
Have bought regular setting for years (20min); a little too slow. This is suppose to begin to set up in 6-7min, it's more like 2-3; a little too fast. Going back to regular, maybe JB will get it right someday at maybe around 10 true minutes.	-1
Not as strong as steel..  Breaks under stress.	-1
I used it to fuse back an arm handlebar for my Schwinn Airdyne air bike and it didn't work.  I mixed it and applied it to the arm that attaches to the frame and waited 24 hours, then I added another coat of it, then I added a 3rd coat again 48 hours later.  Total time 7 days to let dry and 3 coats and it ended up lasting 3 minutes on the bike before coming off.	-1
Title says it all.	-1
Plastic bottle breaks, after repeated squeezing, because of its cylindrical shape and because the plastic becomes brittle. Because bottle breakage is almost certain and happens without warning, a disastrous spill is imminent with this glue.  A far better bottle design is instead oval in shape like this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Professional-Grade-Cyanoacrylate-CA-34-Super-Glue-34-by-Glue-Masters-Thick-Viscosity-Adhesive-for-Plastic-Wood-DIY-Crafts/dp/B00WHEM0UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Professional Grade Cyanoacrylate (CA) "Super Glue" by Glue Masters - Thick Viscosity Adhesive for Plastic, Wood & DIY Crafts</a>  When did bottle design become rocket science?

This is a great product but the exact same thing is about a buck less at most local stores. To make my shopping experience worse there was an issue with delivery too. I usually love my prime account but there must have been some sort of mix up in shipping. For some reason my prime order didn't even ship for over a week after I placed my order. I ordered thinking I'd be saving myself a trip to the store, instead, I went to the store twice for other products and saw this sitting on the shelf mocking me about my project that I couldn't start as I waited for amazon's shipping. Oh well, when it finally arrived the JB weld did the job. This stuff will stick just about anything to just about anything else permanently.	-1
Tried gluing two small pieces of metal together...nothing happened.	-1
This epoxy leaked out of the bottom after first opening, ran out over the top of a cabinet and ruined it. Needs to be stored with the tip down, but you will only learn that the hard way. Lousy packaging of OK glue.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
I used this on a few tool handles and also to mend some broken wires (apple charging cables and stuff) a couple months ago.  Stored it in a cool dark closet.  Went back to use it again just now and it's all dried up.  If you don't expect to use the whole can within the first couple days of opening it, you may want to get the spray-on stuff instead.	-1
Hey, they say this TINY rock is so many "counts", well if you think you're gonna calibrate your radiation detector with this - I gave up. And, as long as your Geiger counter says something- that's close enough for me ! Just scrounge up some Vaseline glass, luminous clock, or red fiesta ware, or whatever.	-1
Ok	-1
Doesn't do the job.  I bought this to use in calibrating a scientific Geiger counter but the specified CPM on the container are not even close.  I trust my factory calibrated counter more than this product.	-1
Thinking it was foot cream, I ordered this to combat my cracked heels.  Used it for a couple of years after my husband and I first got married.  Used it the entire time I was pregnant with both of my children.  Couldn't figure out why my kids had extra fingers and toes...guess I should have read the package more closely...	-1
This is a sample of uranium-238, not the much rarer uranium-235 that I was led to believe after visiting the vendor's website. If you want uranium-235 or uranium-234, you need to look elsewhere. On a side note, Images SI does have other radioactive materials for sale on their website.  I was particularly pleased to find some cesium-137. Be warned that it costs more than the uranium however.  To the reviewers who talk about making explosive devices using this as fuel -- good luck. You are looking for plutonium-239, not uranium-238. Unless you have a nuclear reactor in your basement, this sample isn't going to be of much help to you.	-1
I ordered 6 of these to make a bomb so that I could blackmail humanity for $1,000,000,000. It arrived no problem. However, I called the customer service number to find out how I could have it refined and enriched and they told me they only sold the ore. I asked if they had any suggestions at all, and the girl snaps, "Try Iran!" Are you kidding me? The cheapest flight is like $3000 round trip! You can bet I'll buy my Uranium Ore from a more customer service oriented company next time.	-1
We ordered this after reading the recommendation by A. Chalabi ("BEST YELLOW CAKE, A+++ WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH ANYTIME!!!"),  It arrived promptly, although the rest of the experience was a disappointment.  First, the picture is misleading - although we were impressed by the nice metal baking dish and tight fitting lid, the diameter is only about ~4 inches across.  This really was much smaller than we were expecting for the number of guests we were planning to serve.  The next problem was that despite the nice container, the cake inside was dry and rock hard, with a lot of crumbs.  This could have been a major disaster as we live far from town and did not have enough time to get another cake before the relatives arrived.  We managed to take the contents of the tin and with some extra frosting managed to make a passable birthday cake.  It's been a few months but I'm just now getting around to writing this review since we've had some sudden and unusual family health issues.  As soon as I finish this next round of chemotherapy, I'm going to ask Amazon for a refund.  We won't be buying this again!  We did, however, have a better experience with  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tuscan-Whole-Milk-1-Gallon-128-fl-oz/dp/B00032G1S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz</a>	-1
I purchased this product because I wanted to make a 5 megaton bomb to impress my neighbors at our fourth of July barbecue.  Unfortunately, when all was said and done, I was embarrassed when the yield was less than 500 kt.  No birds on fire, no boiling rivers, nothing.  I want my money back!	-1
How its a best seller i can never understand. Initially i was optimistic about it. Tried using it for cleaning and washing dishes. Tears without me knowing. Tried it for food handling as the question mentioned. Tears easily.. This is worse than the powder based gloves because it fails at its most basic glove function: that is being a barrier between your hands and everything else!	-1
These gloves don't give when trying to put them on. they must run small. they were delivered on time. If the gloves don't have powder in them or they don't stretch I have a hard time putting them on.	-1
If all you want to do is pick panels straight up off the floor then this is ok.  But any deviation from vertical the gripper loses its grip and the panel comes crashing down.	-1
This item is an accident waiting to happen.  When holding plywood as demonstrated the plywood frequently slips out of the gripper and heads directly for your toes.  If you are not wearing steel toed shoes this could cause a bad injury.  I can't help giving this item one star because the ratings don't go low enough to do otherwise.  It is well made and structurally strong but the physics of this method of carrying plywood just makes this device impossible to use safely.	-1
Wanted to remove some polyps... very dull	-1
This is the strongest suction I have ever encountered in a vacuum! Gobbled up dust, dirt and spilled water on the garage floor. But when I tried to get water out of a carpet, the intense suction would not allow the vacuum to move. Not forward, not backward! The info never said it was for bare floors only. I had never had a shopvac before, perhaps this is common knowledge.  If you need to clear any uncarpeted floors, this is for you !!! Unfortunatelyi, I had to return it because I need it for carpet too. Perhaps some sort of re-design would let it work on carpet. The brush on the one tool didn't hold it off the carpet high enough, and that suction just attached itself to the carpet!	-1
The Rubbermaid Service Cart appears to be very strong. It has very large wheels which roll easily over rough surfaces. The front wheels will turn while in use the back wheels are stable. The front wheels lock to stabilize the unit. It took just a few minutes to assemble the cart. It required attaching the wheels, the handle and the electric bar. It is very easy to maneuver and has a great table top surface for parts, etc. The only thing that I was disappointed about was the function of the drawers and door. They do not open and close as well as they should for the price. They have to be closed firmly and catch sometimes when opening. The drawers and door can be locked though I don't think they would keep anyone except a small child from getting into the unit. All drawers lock at together and they must be maneuvered into place in order to do this. It was the push one in and the another one pops out scenario. The drawer slides seem very strong. The unit comes with four keys, two for the drawers and two for the door. They all work for both. Overall the unit seems very tough and will likely not break. It rolls well and the design is good. 6-7 2016 - After using this cart for a time I have decided to redo my review. I found it hard to maneuver even on a cement garage floor let alone an uneven surface. It was loaded with tools, etc. The top surface of the unit has began to break away from the rest of the cart. There was nothing done to cause this to occur. The locks do not function. The drawer locks would no longer line up to allow locking of the drawers. Since they all lock together, they must line up. The locks broke and the drawers do not slide as they should. They slide and line up very poorly. It now can not be locked at all. The price is already way too high, but with the quality of this unit so low it is not worth purchasing at any price.	-1
Impossible to install straight. Cheap.	-1
Garbage	-1
This garage door seal is a pain in the neck to install.  First off, the instructions are not detailed enough. It seems like it should be simple, but they don't give any guidance on the recommended offset from the door to make the best seal. On the first attempt at lining it up and putting in the first nail, it seemed too tight so I pulled the nail and backed it off a little. That seemed better at first, but after a few nails, I had gaps in some areas, either at the garage door side or the trim side.  Hammering in the nails above your head wears out your arms a lot faster than one would think, and it's really hard to hammer the nails in straight since the door and/or trim are in the way, especially in the corners. But that's not the worst of it. After I got 3 nails in, I could already tell that there were going to be issues because there were some wrinkles along the nail line where I must have strayed ever-so-slightly off a straight line. Trying to correct it on the next nail was an exercise in futility and only seemed to make it worse.  The instructions say to cut the top strip to the width of the top of the garage door. I did that, and came up 1 inch short, likely because it was stretched along its length during fitting, then was not stretched as much during installation. That corner left a huge unsealed gap and there was no way to fix it without.  After installing the top and part of one side, I decided to just rip it down. I'll have to find something else.  - It's not easy hammering in nails overhead, and I had to take several breaks. Maybe a staple gun would work better, although I'm not sure how well they would stand up to seasonal changes compared to the roofing nails that come with the garage door seal. - Inadequate instructions - It's impossible to keep it aligned perfectly straight while nailing, which then causes wrinkles/gaps - Transferring dimensions directly from the top of the garage door onto the seal caused the measurement to come up short and leave a large gap  Installation tips if you do want to waste your money and time on this: - Instead of the supplied nails, use screws and washers, or staples - Cut the top a few inches long prior to installation, then trim it to length when you are working on the last nail/staple - Have a helper on hand to hold it in place	-1
Strips are very inaccurate. VERY... I compared readings to my digital PH meter. These things are way off, even when following directions exactly.	-1
Defective door mechanism. This is a known problem with this unit. Buyer beware.	-1
I had this microwave one time this modelI hated it it did not cook the food right.the food never was hot or warmI finally gave it to Goodwilland it was so heavy to I do not recommend this microwave it's a piece of junk buy a Sharp microwave instead they are the best.	-1
Some time it works-some times it doesn`t. Will be returning it. Will be getting a Kenmore. My last Panasonic one was awesome. I`ve had Sharp,Oster and Panasonic in the past and Panasonic was the best. This new one the key pad was harder to use in that you had to press hard on the number buttons. The display was harder to see as it was yellow and so was the back light. The ones b4 were much easier to see the display and had nicer buttons. I`ve had Emerson,Oster,Gold Star and Sharp. Panasonic has always been the best. Going to another brand. And yes-they have bad ones also. This  wouldn`t cook more than 3 minutes when it was working. It smelled like burning electricity. It finally caught on fire. Sent it back. It was the most quiet microwave on the market. I now have 2 Kenmore microwaves and really like them.	-1
This microwave was pretty much as described.  It worked right out of the box, and it warms and heats thing much better than my previous microwave, which was of the same power rating.  For the same rating, this microwave probably heats 30% faster. Unfortunately, this microwave comes with a few annoying features.  The hardware tolerances are a bit too coarse, and the door fit, and the body molding, tend to be mismatched in different places.  The door latch makes a huge sound when opening and closing, and if the microwave is not bolted to the counter (mine is not) opening and closing the door always moves the microwave. The fan and the motor are very noisy. By contrast the finished beep is very low and timid, to the point that sometimes I do not hear the beep. I know that it has finished when the noise stops, particularly since the finished beep does not repeat, as most other microwaves do. On balance, it you can ignore the running noise, this is a good microwave for the price range. If I can not learn to ignore the negatives of this microwave within the next two weeks, it is going back.  Update - after 21 months of medium use, this oven stopped working.  Very disappointing.  I am changing the original rating of 4 to 1	-1
I carefully researched before purchasing this oven. I received it promptly :) I used it for over a week. Because the inverter technology was new to me,. i thought that i was not using the oven properly., After stuggling, as i said for a week, it became clear to my husband and i that no matter what we did, the oven would cook correctly. It took over five minutes to make tea, when my old microwave oven that was larger and less powerful, lower wattage, only took 90 seconds! I immediate called Amazon. They were GREAT! They arranged for UPS pickup the following day, Monday, at their expense. My credit card was immediate credited. The only problem we had was with UPS. Save yourself a lot of aggravartion, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE. I have never been so dissatisfied with a product I've purchased over Amazon. It was defective right out of the box. CHEAPLY MADE IN CHINA. Others have had similar problems with this product. The microwave is made out of cheap plastic, poorly constructed. The fan malfunctioned and the unit overheated causing a small fire....and this was only after 5 minutes of use....RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. I'm filing a consumer complaint. Panasonic has really crapped up their products over the years.	-1
I purchased this Panasonic Microwave the end of MAY 2011 (this year) (It is now ONLY Aug Of 2011)  It Looked Great out of the box, as It should be when purchasing a microwave from a higher end Manufacturer or so I thought..... Let me just start by saying The issues I had was through NO fault of AMAZON, they delivered it just fine. The issue is with the PANASONIC CORPORATION AND THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDED. The Microwave started to display an error code 2 days ago.  I called Panasonic Directly.  I was Told in no uncertain terms that Panasonic WILL NOT REPLACE the unit even though it is less than 90 days old, regardless of defect! I tried to explain to the "Customer Service" specialist that this unit has a 1 year warranty, to which I was Informed by said specialist: that, It is "MY responsibility" to pay to ship the unit to one of Panasonics "Certified Panasonic service / Repair Companies" (that is 2 hours away.)  And.... after the unit is received, The repair company will decide if it is infact "in need of repair or  If it was damaged by me" ?!@ Really?? Then she had the nerve to tell me that the error code displayed on My broken microwave is interpreted as an " electrical current issue on my end". And , that she Recommends that I Pay to have an electrician come to my home and instal a designated circut for just this microwave alone.  Excuse me???  I explained again, that this was not my FIRST Microwave, and that I have NEVER heard of a "Non Specialty" microwave needing to have its own circut breaker and that My home was built less than 5 years ago, and that it was Ludicris to insinuate the failure was on my end!! I am more than upset, I did a lot of searching to find a worthy Microwave unit.  In today's economy, It is shameful for Big Business to take the money I paid for this Microwave unit, I expected more from a well known company but found out that both my MONEY and the "Panasonic company name" were both worthless!!!.  I will NEVER purchase another product from a company that puts out defective merchandise and in turn,  tries to blame the Customer for it!!  Terrible!!  Shame on you Panasonic!!	-1
This oven worked very well for two years, until it failed, showing an H98 code on the screen. It no longer heats. Not sure if I'll ever purchase a microwave with the inverter technology again , since this one didn't last but two years. According to Panasonic, there are no parts available, even if I wanted to have it repaired. Sorry Panasonic, you just lost my business.	-1
Bought a Kenmore microwave in 2003 that served us well until the rotary motor stopped working. Saw good reviews on this one and it was just the right size so we ordered it from Amazon (Great price and super fast free delivery). So far, this thing has performed fabulously. It runs quietly (even the beeper isn't too loud), has great power and power distribution, and the door opener has, so far, operated smoothly and with ease (although we are holding our breath on this item in view of all the negative feedback we see on the door opener).  The only negative I have with this oven is the height of the cooking cavity. The advertised size of 1.6 cu. ft. is right but that size is mostly due to stretching the length and width and sacrificing height. The ceiling of the cavity is so low, we can barely get some of our larger drinking glasses inside. I am seriously doubting whether we would be able to get a large ham or turkey inside.  Only time will tell if this item continues to perform well. Foreign production, poor engineering and shoddy workmanship seems to be the order of today's manufacturing. I just wish we could get better response from our manufacturing base to get making things back into the good old USA with US labor which we need so desperately.  Update 2/21/2011: Well, this appliance has let us down. It has been steadily going down hill since we started using it and my wife finally asked me to send it back; sadly, 1 day after the 30 day return period expired. It seemed to take longer to reheat and warm things and pop popcorn the first week we used it, and now it is definitely running out of power. It now takes at least 3 times longer to pop popcorn than when it was new and NEVER pops without leaving a large amount of unpopped kernels (it doesn't even have the power to burn the popcorn, no matter how long you let it run). The wife complains that it can't even soften a stick of butter in a decent time. Reheating food in either plates or bowls is frustrating. What a disgusting letdown. Good old foreign and cost saving manufacturing at work!!!  We are now paying a premium price to have our previous old reliable microwave brought back to life. It will certainly be worth it to get back to efficiency and reliability!  Update 9/16/2011: My wife alerted me to something about when we were using this unit but I never knew until she told me recently; We have DirecTV and she said that she had noticed that when the TV was on and this microwave was turned on, the DirecTV receiver gave a bad weather picture and showed an alert that reception was being compromised. I couldn't stand this so, I took this thing out of the garage, where I had stored it for emergencies, and plugged it in. Sure enough, every time I turned it on at any setting, the DirecTV lost picture and gave a reception warning. This was a good 15-20 feet from the TV. This thing may have a dangerous microwave leakage problem and I am reporting this to the proper authorities. I have also decided to junk the thing to get it out of my life.	-1
I mistakenly ordered this tape for mailing packages. I always ordered Duck EZ Start tape previously and the green label fooled me. Horrible. Curled and stuck to itself and I wasted about 25% of the rolls because of this. I'll pay more attention next time. The EZ Start may cost a few cents more but it is definitely worth it.	-1
Very thin with minimal adhesive strength. Will not be reordering. Very low quality to the point of being nearly useless.	-1
This is good tape, but the 1 star is because it is way overpriced at 8.88. As i recall it was only about 2.00 when i bought it here, and it is not much better than the 55yd wide tape i just bought for $1.00 at the local discount store (thank God for them), or the tartan tape at Ebay for $2.75 w. S+H.  Just wanted to let others know.	-1
I'll say that yeah, this tape does work but there are for sure much better tapes out there.  This tape is not the clearest tape and is definitely thinner than average.  It does come off the roll easily enough, but look out for static cling because this tape is so light it will double back on itself if you aren't careful.  Also note that when using a tape gun, this tape will have a lot of extra small little pieces coming off from the teeth on the gun.  Overall this is not the worst tape I've ever used, but I won't be ordering any more of this particular brand.	-1
The strap arrived in new condition and I imagine it will be useful if I ever need it to pull, or be pulled, out of a ditch/sand/snow.  However, it came in a hinged case which looked quite worn, as if it had been hauled arouond and slid back and forth on some flat but abrasive surface.  The hinge on the case was broken. If I were to order another strap, I would buy something different because this case was either defective or broken/returned without inspection -- or simply a bad design.	-1
I had this hooked up inline with a G20 pump.  Every time the pump kicked on those seals would blow loose and spray water everywhere.  They just can't handle high pressure (60 PSI) plus a 1 1/2" flow.	-1
While these hooks hold my tools in place if I don't touch them, the hooks don't always stay in place when removing a tool.  It gets really annoying to have both a peg and clip fall along with your tools when you grab them.  The whole point was to keep things in place.  I would say they work about half of the time.  If I am very careful about lifting them out of their place gently, they tend to stay in, but even then some of the clips still pop off leaving the hook in place but still need to fumble the plastic clip back into place.  Not what I wanted.	-1
The quality and ease of use is terrible. I'm still trying to get the "locking" peg hooks to lock.	-1
Threw them out. Completely useless. Hooks fall out when you lift the tool of the hook. The little plastic ties that supposedly hold the hooks fall out, break, and simply do not hold the hooks tightly. Buy the hooks that have two insertions on the hook itself. They are a little harder to attach to the pegboard,  but are firm and stay in place with no movement or wobble. I found that by "stretching" the bottom peg board hole makes it much easier to insert.  Just insert one of the hook retainers in the bottom hole  and wiggle it a bit too enlarge the hole some.	-1
Comes out easy, however does not dry solid for at least three weeks.	-1
Broke at the hand pump neck. Waste of money in my opinion. I went and bought another set that was only 18 dollars. It's the ordinary one you see doctors hand around their neck. Works a lot better and is a lot more efficient than this one. The reason why I say this one is less efficient is because you have to hold the pump with one hand and that hand is tied up. I find it cumbersome because of the pump. I'm faster with the cheaper one.	-1
I ordered this. When I reviewed my order it appears I was switched to a blemished one in bad packaging at $13. It probably works just fine but I don't appreciate the tactic. It will go in the trash as I don't know what else is wrong with it. Was too late to cancel. Would not order again.	-1
Hillman group normally supplies great stuff, but the galvanized coating on these bolts is so heavy that the specified 1/4-20 nuts jam in the first 2 threads.  With a headless carriage bolt, that means you can't just muscle through it...the bolt turns and cannot be tightened.	-1
I purchased this for my 6x D-cell mag lite, and relative to the OEM incandescent bulb, my light is actually dimmer now.  Its pretty sad, I have an insight m6x for a pistol of mine, this light takes two cr-123 batteries and is MUCH brighter than my 6 D cell light. all in all, if you are looking for an upgrade, look elsewhere	-1
Did not work in Mag Flashlite.	-1
Gave new life to my old Maglite. Ordered this one and one from HQRP at the same time to see which was better. They both seem to be of equal quality and brightness. Big difference is shipping speed. The TerraLUX I had in 2 days and the HQRP took a week and HQRP is quite a few states closer. 5 stars because of the fast shipping. I will buy a few more for my other lights.  ** Just got a chance to really compare the 2 brands. The HQRP is almost pure white where the TerraLUX has a bad yellowish tint. Not very desirable at all. I'm revising my rating to only 2 stars for the crappy yellowish light.	-1
When they work, they are useful.... when they work.  Bought two, one for a Maglite and one for a Snap-On branded Maglite variant.  It simply would NOT work with the Snap-On flashlight.  It just did not fit, period.  With the Maglite, it worked sometimes, but more often not.  The bulb simply did not fit well enough to reliably make contact.  It's not a direct drop-in replacement without modification on some lights.	-1
These are very thin washers, I felt like I should have used two on each bolt.	-1
Garbage! Doesn't stick well to surfaces	-1
I normally use the gold version of this tape, but thought this might be a little more aggressive. I think I must have wasted a half a roll. More of the tape ended up inside and all over the machine then it did on the artwork. I just couldn't seem to get it to stick to the back of frames for dust covers. I changed angles, pressed really hard, etc. and the tape ended up everywhere except where I wanted it. Complete waste of time and money to me. I switch back over to the gold variety, and had next to no problems. Never again for me!	-1
made a sticky mess	-1
makes a mess, takes to long to harden. would not buy it again.	-1
This is not Duck Tape, 3/4".  It is electric tape 1/2".  This is not what I wanted.  I wanted DuckTape the original.  You know 3/4 inch that you can Duck Tape anything in your house.  This is another case of Fraud by Amazon.  This is a joke.  I am not an electrician, Joke !!!	-1
These don't stick well at all. My old ones were why I bought these... Not at all impressed...	-1
I don't know if this stuff was just dried out, but it was almost a powder consistency and wouldn't mix well when trying to fold it together.  I finally got it mixed, but it did not harden very well either.  Loctite usually makes a good product, so I think maybe this was just kept on the shelf too long.	-1
SO far so good. Dries fast and not sure if this is any different from other silicone.  Update:  FOllowed instructions, silicone lasted a few month before water was getting trapped underneath it and mold started popping up. Going a different route now that i have to redo it once again.	-1
The barbed section is very short.  Getting it to seal up with heavy poly pipe was a chore.  Go get a good one at a landscape supply place that has brass fittings.  Hope I don't have to dig this pipe up because these fittings are leaking.	-1
Too big for standard screens.  Be nice to just get refunds issued for this without having to ask.	-1
I suppose that there are windows out there that actually require such a wide spline. Unfortunately for me, none of my 30-plus window and door screens do - and my house is only 13-years old. I ended up returning these splines.	-1
Worst glue ever. It's like Elmer's.	-1
Brads arrived with the ends rusted had to clean off with penetrating oil and remove the nails on the ends.  Using rusty nails in a pneumatic gun is a sure way to cause mechanical problems.  Won't order these from Amazon again.	-1
Not worth the money. I purchased one of these because today's plastic cans take forever to empty. I wanted something easy to use and fast, but safe.  The lever that you have to squeeze to get the fuel to flow out is a pain to deal with. You must have a strong forearm just to keep the fuel flowing. If you ne to pour fuel at or above your head (boat), you will likely pour gas all over yourself (through the safety release valve).  I only purchased one due to price. If I liked it, I planned to replace my other 3 plastic gas cans.  That isn't going to happen.	-1
Well it's white, it's silicone acrylic, and I used it around the bathtub.  It's a simple cut the tube tip to a slant (larger or smaller) depending on the amount you will be need to squeeze out and VOILA really!  It was a good price and pretty easy to use.  Two weeks later, it's still there so I can't complain.  3 Weeks later update:  This silicone is no longer white. It is now cream/off-white color now and has a matte finish.  Just letting you know:)  I will not be purchasing again.	-1
Did not work.  Tried to repair the sole coming off my New Balance sneakers a couple times.  Really wanted this stuff to work. Followed directions carefully. Let it cure 48hrs before using.  But it just completely failed to bond the sole to the sock. Honestly, hot glue worked better (and that didn't work too well either).	-1
Glued some leather moccasin with this.  they did not last one wearing after drying for a few days.	-1
Does not hook as well as one's I had in the past.  Disappointed.  I manage to use them with a dab of glue on the ends but I guess I could have done the "glue" without these.	-1
These are not consistent in their ability to stay in place, about 1 out of 3 worked the others are useless on my 1/4' pegboard.	-1
Not spaced for pegboard bought at Home Depot	-1
This is the worst super glue I have ever used.  It has absolutely no adhesive strength at all.	-1
this was yet another bottle of super glue that was ruined by air betting into the bottle. Now the caps can only be replaced ONE way, there is no secret way to replace the cap so it does not get ruined buy air getting into the bottle. This is exactly what happened and I had to throw the bottle away - I have found that no matter what brand or container that I purchase - air is the common denominator that causes the early tossing of every bottle of super glue that I purchase.	-1
Did not work in my applications: plastic - plastic and plastic - fiberglass. Back to the old and TESTED two part epoxy !!!	-1
I purchased this glue thinking it was the same stuff as liquid nails in a tube. It is not, as it did not hold a wooden wine rack together after 2 days of drying. I heard a crash and sure enough 2 bottles fell and smashed to the floor. Dont buy this stuff.  I now tried Gorilla glue which is far more superior to this and holds like nails.	-1
The barbed section is very short.  Getting it to seal up with heavy poly pipe was a chore.  Go get a good one at a landscape supply place that has brass fittings.  Hope I don't have to dig this pipe up because these fittings are leaking.	-1
Jams constantly.  Threads chowdered up.	-1
tip was not in properly and broke off as i tried to unscrew itnot very good returned	-1
Mine only lasted 2 1/2 years on a 3 way bedside table lamp.  I know this because when I selected this item Amazon told me I purchased one on April 5, 2015. This is many years shorter life than expected for this type of switch,  which is only used 2 or 3 times daily. I'm buying another brand this time.	-1
not only does this NOT fit #10 or #12 AWG stranded wire it is also NOT 1/4" - not even close.  So now I have 16 totally worthless pieces of useless junk.  Every claim made is a LIE and now I have to drive 60 miles to the nearest hardware store to buy a dozen actual 1/4" x #10 terminals to effect the repairs I need to do.  Recently, there are far more lying fraudulent thieves selling total garbage on Amazon than there are vendors selling accurately described products.  And if anyone reading this hasn't figured out by now, every 5 star review, regardless of product, are either paid shills or clueless morons.  Amazon used to be far better than this.  Now its 90% junk, fraud and liars.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
Cant hear anything and terrible construction. Save your money and buy a quality product.	-1
I read the reviews before I bought this, and I got to say that the sound quality is way less than I had expected. You can barely hear anything, you have to be really really quiet in order for you to hear your heartbeat. Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive one or one with better quality.	-1
sprays like theres a clog in it, shook it like crazy, still a bad uneven spray. they make a break cleaner thats great, the grease can needs some work, also the red nozzle to attach to it would hardly go on. I'll be going back to wd40 brand	-1
The idea is great, and it works great for installing new shocks but forget about it for removing old rusted shocks.  You'll just strip and ruin the insert that sits on the flat of the shock.  The metal just isn't hard enough..	-1
Similar to another buyer - my jack came missing key parts and as such is useless. The box was undamaged so it wasn't a case of something being lost in transit.	-1
I don't know if I received an older roll or what, but it did not stick well. I applied pressure to it and within hours, it fell down. I am not impressed and would not buy again.	-1
Adhesive isn't particularly sticky. Maybe if your surface is perfectly flat it would be fine, but getting it to make curves and corners is tough.	-1
Made out of cheap tear-able foam. The adhesive is barely present.	-1
Terrible! This is NOT the duct tape of yesterday!! This is cheap Chinese made garbage.  This tape comes loose with the smallest amount of moister. I read that this tape is covered in adhesive, this is NOT so.  It's not that sticky, I have silver duct tape that could stick a person onto a wall, this is NOT that tape. I am very very disappointed with this tape. So much so I wrote the company,  Gorilla tape used to be very sticky and my go to tape for projects, this is not the same tape.  They are pulling the wool over our eyes by raising the price and dropping the quality.	-1
Disappointed with the lack of adhesion. Was trying to cover a few wasp holes in the bare wood frame that I made for grape vines. Sure I could have used many different substitutes to fill/cover the holes, but I thought that this brand would at least keep the peskie yellow jackets out of the holes until I acquired something better. The wood frame is bare, dry and smooth and thought that it would be good enough to attach a few pieces of the tape over the offending holes. But within a few seconds the tape started to curl at the edges and although it did not fall off altogether, it simply made for an open door for the annoying intruders.	-1
After a month or two, it no longer sticks. I had a simple application, tape some small telephone wires to the inside of a new cabinet. The telephone jack ended up inside a cabinet and I mounted the phone on the outside. I routed the wires in the cabinet and used 4-5 pieces of Gorilla tape to hold the wires. It has been 1-2 months and the tape is no longer sticking to the cabinet walls. Keep in mind these are very small telephone wires. I have found this to be true a number of times where after 1-3 months, the tape simply no longer sticks to whatever you applied the tape to. I've used other heavy duty black tape such as Nashua or 3M and they stick much better and a lot longer. Another case where the hype doesn't meet the reality.	-1
This tape sucks when compared to regular duck type. I would not buy it again. Regular duck tape is cheaper too!	-1
I bought this tape thinking it would be better than duct tape.  It wasn't.  Yes, Gorilla tape is sticky.  And yes, it's probably stickier than duct tape.  But that doesn't mean it's as strong.  I taped a plastic crate that I use for hauling packages to the Post Office.  The side of the crate had cracked and needed to be repaired.  I used a a good three foot strip of tape that extended half way around the crate.  After a few weeks of use the tape completely failed - it literally split in two like masking tape.  I simply pulled the crate out of the back of my car and one of edges of it (the crate, not the tape) caught on the bottom.  I tugged a little and that little bit of pressure popped the tape right in two as if it were nothing.  I have never seen duct tape behave like this, not once.  One more thing - this tape has a horrible odor.  Think wet dog or old socks stink.  Whatever you use it on will stink for days.  Not sure if I just got a bad roll or if other reviewers used the tape for other purposes.  But there's no way I'd ever buy another roll of this.	-1
THIS PRODUCT STATES IT CAN BE USED ON RV'S AND SOME APPLIANCES.  WELL IF YOU READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION (WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT ON AMAZON) THEN YOU CAN SEE IT ACTUALLY IS ONLY FOR RV'S.	-1
Did not work for me.  It was a waste of money.  I ended up purchasing GORILLA glue to finish the job.  Don't know what type of glue this is, it did not deliver what it stays, and would NEVER buy it again.	-1
I order this black stethoscope but got a blue non related one instead I have uploaded pictures because words cant describe what I got...Not even the same manufacturer it looks like a toy...I am just like...wow	-1
I read the reviews and noted the scope worked great and was a nice "adult" size.  I was thrilled because it's a needed item and in my daugther's favorite color.  In the end, the scope really isn't long enough to work comfortably on patients and the sound wasn't the best either.  When outside noises are a distraction, the scope isn't the best. My daughter uses her scope everyday and needs quality not novelty.  I returned this item with no trouble at all from the vendor --- but in the end, you get what you pay for. This, unfortuantely is $20 for orange rubber....	-1
It is very tricky to perform the test. i could never find out how it really works. They need to find out a simpler method /equipment for this kind of test.	-1
We bought this to use for home brewing, cider, mead, etc., but every time I measure any batch, of any liquid that should have an alcohol content it reads .99.  Mead, .99, cider .99, 40 proof rum .99.  I would look for another brand, I don't trust the thing~  It is packed well, I got a hydrometer tube to do accurate readings, I've waited 2 months and the batches never change, then I tried it with a known item, store bought rum with a tested and listed alcohol content, measured the same as everything else.  Disappointed	-1
Clearly marketed as "1/4" pegboard pegs. These are not they are 1/8 and will fit with slop in a heavy dirty 1/4 pegboard. See attached pics, peg on right in both pics is a real 1/4in peg. Peg on left is what was sold here from this seller.	-1
Seems like a good product- threading is correct and it sealed well, but it doesn't actually act as a check valve. When I received it, I tested it just by blowing through it and you can blow air through both directions. I tried cleaning it which still didn't help. I installed it anyway thinking maybe it will seal low pressure water better than air, but unfortunately it didn't function as I expected.	-1
funky threads and cancer warning label on product.	-1
Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare FlexCare. The newer FlexCare models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.	-1
I had an older model Sonicare that lasted years. The newer e9500 seems to last only a few months before the power button seal breaks. This has happened twice. My second unit which was replaced by Philips just developed the same problem as the unit it replaced. Otherwise this would be a very good toothbrush but with this major flaw, I am only giving it two stars. See the photo I uploaded that shows this.  Also, on another note... water gets into the brush head. It builds-up "junk" after awhile. Not pretty.	-1
These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.	-1
Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.	-1
Hello fellow Amazonians: We purchased a number of these items based on the seemingly positive reviews it has. Unfortunately, they were constructed with poor quality materials and rather shoddily put together. I wish we had an option of not buying poorly made Chinese made products or products other countries who don't really have our interests in mind other than to sell thing to us. Unfortunately we'll be returning these items in search of a better quality product state side. Shame.	-1
Had there previous model for years of trouble free use. Left cheap batteries in too long without checking & they corroded so bought this latest version. Whoever thought the constant blink, just to let you know its working, obviously wasn't a working electrician. There should be a way to check then switch the blink off. Its sooooo annoying. I am actually taping up the most of the tip just leavening enough to see when hot wire detected. There are just some thing that don't need improving so I will search for the old model even used it would be better that blinking - EVERY 2 SECS for goodness sake.	-1
Fluke makes excellent multimeters, but this voltage tester has an annoying flaw - the plastic end of the probe is a little too wide to fit into some standard 110 volt north American outlets. And it's not sensitive enough to detect if the socket is hot from the outside. Otherwise, the sound indicator and light indicator is ok and seems well built as expected of Fluke products.	-1
Due to Amazon's bizarre policy of combining reviews this review is practically useless.  Normally I find Fluke fluke to be a good brand. However this voltage tester lacks sensitivity. One has to bring the head with in about 1/2 inch of 120 VAC for it to trigger.  My Extech will trigger about 1-1/2 inches away from 120 VAC.  Made a comment is China.	-1
Sensitivity is horrible, barely detects voltage when you place the device directly on live wires and outlets.  I would not trust this device at all.	-1
Does NOT perform as described.  Supposed to have a steady glow and beeping sound when detecting a hot spot, but no sound.  Sensitivity level is terribly dangerous.  Like others have commented previously; this unit is a Chinese knock-off with the Fluke name on it.  If that's not the case; it's simply poorly designed.  I'm sending it back.	-1
Fine for 110v but 220v LED only blinks one time. Also, does not beep. Using a different brand in my tool kit. Don't like this model/functions. Possibly defective.	-1
Stopped working after using it four times in a two month period. Replaced with a GB tester that had really crappy reviews, and it has worked for over 12 months now. Looks like its a coin toss as to which one will last.  The fluke was so bad even when it worked that you never knew if power was on or off. Must have just been a bad one. Others having good luck so give it a shot.	-1
This unit is over rated. The Klein Tools NCVT-2 is way better. For starters, the plastic tip is too large and you either have to file it down or accept that it will wear down your outlets prematurely. Secondly, you can't hold it up to a light switch to test for voltage, so it is not that sensitive. Lastly, there's about a 250 ms delay before it detects voltage. I find this annoying. The Klein NCVT-2 has none of these issues and you can set it to a low-voltage mode to detect live switches. The 1AC-A1-II will serve as a door stop.	-1
Inaccurate, battery drains quickly, movement not smooth.	-1
I've the same exact type and the display fails often as though the battery is dead - but it's not.  It also randomly begins to blink in a fault mode until it's turned off and reset.	-1
Battery cover is very poorly designed and continuously falls off, allowing the battery to fall out.	-1
Amazon deletes what matters anyway!	-1
The calipers worked at first but now they keep adding or subtracting .2 inches to some measurements	-1
Do not rely on this digital caliper for accurate measurements.  Unfortunately my return window has closed so it is a just a loss for me.  I really do not understand the high ratings from some people.  I took measuring bars from Rockler and used the calipers on them.  I would continuously get a different measurement simply by remeasuring the exact same brass bar from the same place on the caliper.  Sometimes as much as 0.01 (note that is hundredth, not thousandth) in difference.  Mostly I would see about 0.003 to 0.005 in difference by simply measuring and remeasuring the same brase bar.  It simply is not consistent.	-1
I must have a defective unit, but this thing will not keep a reading. It jumps wildly over and over again, never stopping on a single measurement. Pretty disappointed after reading all the positive reviews. Will be returning.	-1
This digital caliper is the worst I've ever owned or used.  The numerals are not uniform in size with the first being larger followed by 3 more which are much smaller.  It is thus hard to read and not convenient.  This, in my judgment, is a substandard unit and I'd never buy it again.  In fact I'd really like to return it for a refund and for the first time ever I'd state without equivocation.....DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.	-1
i really hate when an item is listed as coming with a battery and a spare, only to find out it came with no batteries!!!! aghhhhhhhh!!!!"" also came with a hand written not saying" cheap meter" ;\	-1
Arrived broken - display never turned on. I tried both batteries.  Additionally, be warned that Neiko is not a particularly helpful company in the sense that they provide almost no consumer resources such as customer support or relevant documentation. It seems they exist to sell cheap products B2B and that they've opted to keep their distance from the end user.	-1
I gave this only 2 stars because it was working well but now it is not. I am not sure if something is caught in it or what, but it constantly stays on and the counter runs through random numbers. When it is working correctly, the digital display is very accurate down to the tenths, but I do not trust it anymore because of the issues I am having. It still works fine using it as a regular caliper and not using the digital display.	-1
The locking screw was bent when it arrived. Beware.  Any movement will turn it on, and this causes the battery to drain quickly.  Everything else seems fine	-1

(Video Size and Quality was reduced to meet Amazons limits, Watch the full video on my YouTube GadgetClass channel)  The Neiko seems to get decent reviews, probably mainly because it is the cheapest one and soo many more people have bought it, but compared to all of the other calipers in the roundup it actually scored low across the entire data set. The build quality and accuracy is not all that great compared to the iGaging EZCAL. There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which renders all internal measurements inaccurate.  Summary: Spend $10 more and get the iGaging EZCal which was the best digital caliper in the $30 and under group. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iGaging-IP54-Electronic-Digital-Caliper-0-6-Display-Inch-Metric-Fractions-Stainless-Steel-Body/dp/B001AQEZ2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iGaging IP54 Electronic Digital Caliper 0-6" Display Inch/Metric/Fractions Stainless Steel Body</a>  Cons: ~ There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which makes all internal measurements inaccurate.

I ordered this caliper to have an inexpensive one for my range bag and to be able to measure something in millimeters. It holds zero. I checked it against my "older" Browne & Sharpe caliper and they read the same. Comes with an extra battery which is a nice plus. Certainly not as smooth as my "older" B&S caliper, but in this price range I didn't expect that. I am hopeful that this caliper will hold up reasonably well it seems to be "not too shabby" and I am pleased with it so far. November 16,2014 update. I have to downgrade this caliper to two stars, Initially I was pleased but recently they started sticking when trying to open them from the zero position. I tried "cleaning" the slide and applying a small bit of lube, this helped but the more I thought about it the less I trusted these things. I am replacing them with something better.	-1
It had a solid heavy feel, but I was mistaken.  This thing kept draining the batteries while turned off in storage.  Now, my Neiko caliper is dead, something is blown inside the circuitry after only a few uses.  This same junky caliper is sold under several different brand logos.  I keep learning my lesson over and over again to avoid tools Made in China.  Now I'm buying Japanese made Mitutoyo 500-196-20 as a replacement.	-1
This item was smashed and it seems that it was smashed before it was put in the envelope because there are missing parts that should have been in the envelope if it was smashed in shipping. I really do not know why someone would ship a tool like a Digital Caliper in an envelope in the first place.	-1
i tried it on rusted nuts, not working at all	-1
My first 2 star review ever. Sure they arrived ahead of time and packed in a flimsy envelope but the quality and stiffness are terrible. I know they're inexpensive that's why I bought two. One looks rough in the handle and blade and other has a worn handle and tarnished blade. They don't look used, just tired.....unkept. Are they worth the price, sure but look else where. I bought these as backups to my medical kits I keep for my bobs so they won't be saving lives. PROS: They arrived in "off the shelf" condition stuffed in a bag. the handles fit my hands are relatively comfortable enough. CONS: Everything else. Uneven bladed that are tarnished. Rough edges all around and a cheaper than necessary feel.  Bottom line. Buy a good set if you need to (I did and I'm happier for it) but consider these backups or throwaways.	-1
BOXWE OF GLOVES DO NO FIT	-1
Toothbrush worked great for less than two months. Now it won't turn on. I've tried replacing the batteries to no avail. I guess you get what you pay for. Will no longer purchase Philips products.	-1
Good idea, but not designed very well. The brush goes too fast, the brush is too small and the hard plastic handle hits against your teeth, and rattles on them, if you don't have the angle just right. Also, when you brush your teeth normally, you turn the brush around and up and down; thus, water running out of your mouth, goes all over the housing which allows water to get inside the housing.	-1
The lifespan of this device seems to be quite limited. A couple of years ago, I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. One of them stopped working after a couple of weeks - was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement - and the other stopped after a little over one month. The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.  The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.  Pros for this toothbrush: - low price.  Cons: - short life due to almost inevitable water damage - use of 'throw away' batteries  My recommendation: avoid.  Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare. You won't regret it. I've been using Sonicare tooth brushes for almost 10 years now. My first one was replaced after more than 5 years, mostly because I wanted a new one. My current is alive and kicking and it's likely to last for many more years if I don't choose to replace it.	-1
Let's do the math... what would you say if I told you that, if you paid three times as much, you could buy a quality Sonicare toothbrush&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Philips-HX7361-Sonicare-Elite-e7300-Power-Toothbrush/dp/B0015INAVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Philips HX7361 Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush</a>&nbsp;that lasted 20 times as long and never needed a battery? Or, if you paid about twice as much you could buy another quality Sonicare toothbrush&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Philips-Sonicare-Advance-4100-Sonic-Power-Toothbrush/dp/B00008BFXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush</a>&nbsp;that lasted probably 10 times as long and, it too, never needed another battery?  I rest my case.  We bought 2 of these for the kids. One of them stopped working after a couple of days. Amazon sent us a replacement. Then, both of them stopped working a few weeks later. Eventually, we  bought our kids some good quality Sonicares and they never failed.  My personal Sonicare experience:  - My first one, the 'original', lasted some 6 years. - I bought an Elite 3 years ago in December and it's almost as good as new today (minor wear on the rubberized sides). - I bought the kids their Elites about one year ago and they are as good as new.  Go with the Elite and be happy or buy these and you are likely to be sorry.	-1

I wanted to learn to take my blood pressure, but when I tried using this stethoscope I could not hear anything, even right over my heart. I figured it was user error. But then I came here and I see that many others have had the same problem. This stethoscope seems to work when I tap on the diaphragm, or use it on a mechanical watch, but not for a heartbeat. My wife had the same problem. The earpieces are also very uncomfortable.	-1
I just bought one identical from Walmart, under the name (12" Schwinn Roadster Trike Red)  price $74.97 + Sales Tax:  $ 4.20  Order Total:  $ 79.17, free delivery pick up in the store. The seller in Amazon has overpriced $18.98 compared with Walmart. My Grandchild 32 months old 39lb at 38"high has 2 bikes: 1 - Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red 2 - 12" Schwinn Roadster Trike, He is using both under my supervision, so that's my Opinions: Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red Pros: Solid Built, almost immune to the corrosion, very good torque to the Active Wheel 9"diameter vs. 2.4" length of pedal arm. This provides a smooth pedaling, and easier to go up heel, and control going up through inclined sidewalks. Cons: The center of gravity isn't to low, and combined with "The pedal always free spin backward regardless of the locking position" makes it impossible for the kid to control the speed, using pedals, to slow down, going down through inclined sidewalks. This bike has no brakes, and pedals are the only defense for the kid. So this is a very serious safety flaw. 12" Schwinn Roadster Trike. Pros: Solid, built, with very low center of the gravity, no free spin pedals, and wide range of the sit adjustments. Cons: This Trike is prone of corrosion if it is wet, or kept in humidity higher then 60% for long time. With active wheel 12" diameter, vs. 2" length of pedal arm, this has 50% torque compared with, Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike. This makes hard to pedal on the grass, up heels, and for long rides creates a lot of stress to the kid's legs, unless the surface is strong, flat and HORIZONTAL. Any time we go for a Ride, after 50 feet trip, mu grand son stops, turns around, go back to the home, drops the (12" Schwinn Roadster Trike), picks up the (Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red) and enjoy the ride. Why: because 12" Schwinn Roadster Trike creates too much stress on his legs. This nice bike is a bike For Show but not To Go.	-1
You do get a lot of pieces in this kit but 60 are 1/16" which is too small to even be useful. 35 is 3/32" which is not much use either in my opinion. 25 1/8" may have some use. The 1/4" and the 3/8" you only get 10 each of those. This kit is not worth even the little it cost. I would not have purchased it had I known the sizes and quantities ahead of time. Hope this list helps others looking at this kit. I would not recommend this kit for any one needing it for Auto electrical. It may be useful to someone working on telephone wires.	-1
This stuff sticks all into the threads and gets torn up into tons of little pieces, so if you ever unscrew the fittings you applied it to, it's nearly impossible to remove properly.  When you then screw things back together, perhaps with new tape on the male end which is easier to clean, the tiny pieces all get pushed out of the much harder to clear female end and foul the gas line, potentially damaging whatever appliances you have connected or clogging a filter at best.  I had a propane distribution arrangement constructed of several T's and such, and when I needed to remove one fitting for a change, this fact forced me to deconstruct the entire arrangement so that I could effectively get all the little bits and pieces out of the fittings.  What a pain!  I wasn't about to do that again, so this hit the trash and I picked up some liquid PTFE thread seal, which works MUCH better.  Not only do I not worry about contaminating the gas line now, but the liquid sealant helps lubricate the fittings making it possible/easier to tighten them down further.  Search YouTube for a comparison of PTFE tape versus liquid to see others in agreement before you buy this!	-1
The ID is actually smaller than most other brands.	-1
The product itself was OK but it's pretty ridiculous that they don't say you will get separate pieces that add up to 10 ft.. If I order 10 ft., I expect to get 1 piece that is 10 ft. long not one that is a little under 9 ft. and 1 that is a little over 1 ft.. They do not say that in the description. If you used that method they could send you 120 pieces that were 1" long and say you got 10ft..	-1
The picture is misleading. Super thin walled. The tubing burst on me first use. Save your money and look for something else!	-1

I bought this for my granddaughter, who wants to be a vet.. I purchased a pink stethoscope, some pink surgical face masks, made her a pink lab coat and got her some books on being a vet.. I ordered this because it's shown as being pink and I thought it'd fit in good with the other pink things. Unfortunately, it's actually red, and looks used.. The handle is tarnished with little bubbles in the finish.. It didn't cost much so it's not a huge waste, but just not what I ordered and won't fit in with the rest of the "pink"... Wish I'd ordered from someone else...	-1

I purchased 6 pieces of PC for a project and upon arrival, every panel was warped and cut very poorly. It looks like whoever cut the panels used the wrong blade or tried to cut too quickly, which generated heat and warped the panels. I was going to use the panels for a project that required precise tolerances, which this product is far from. Returned the item as they were quite expensive for such poor quality panels.	-1

Gardner Bender has switched to a plastic lid. It looks like they have no longer have any quality control in Mexico. First bottle of white was semi dried out and lid was not tight. Amazon sent a second bottle and it too was semi dried out and lid was not tight. It is less than a 1/2 full bottle, Solvent evaporated. The black with a metal lid was fine. The black weighed 1.2 ounces more. Problem reported to Amazon support. They might not have any good ones on hand. This problem has been going on all year from the reviews Ive seen. March 24, 2017 September 1, 2017 July 25, 2017 February 17, 2017 from 9 months ago Amazon comment about leaking (loose lid?) Hello, We've spoken to Amazon on this issue and it has been resolved. Please work with Amazon on a replacement unit. If you have any further questions or issues, I recommend you reach out to our Customer Service Team. 800.624.4320 customer.service@gardnerbender.com I emailed G B Tech support and this is an excerpt: This failure would be the first complaint we have heard about our liquid tape. And yet Amazon comment on another customer: Gardner Bender Customer Service 3 months ago Hello, Thank you for the information. You should be receiving a full bottle when you make a purchase. Based on your feedback I believe the bottle might've opened a little during shipping. This could've caused it to be thicker and a little dry on the top. If some leaked out this would also explain why the bottle was not full when you received it. If you let Amazon know about this, they will send you a replacement free of charge. If you prefer, you can also reach out to us directly and we'll help you out by sending a replacement as well.  Tech.support@gardnerbender.com 800.624.4320 Either the lid is not put on tight or the design of the lid is bad. Shame as when it is good it works better than the other brands I tried. When fresh this has a nice balance between too thick and too thin as some other brands. I had to repair some burnt wires 4 years ago, in my jeep when the bracket came loose and the harness lay against the exhaust manifold. I put on 4 thin coats letting it dry a couple of hours between applications. I just discovered that the harness has disintegrated because of heat and exposed the wires. The liquid tape did their job as the wires are fine. Bottle had a metal lid.	-1
Too thick compared to Starbrite.  Impossible to get an even coating and difficult to get a continuous coating.  I have plenty left over, but buying a can of the Starbrite version because i am not satisfied with this.	-1

i got these to try to find a smoke alarm that is beeping that is hiding between my floor and ceiling...weird i know. anyhow, these hurt my ears so that i can't wear them for longer than 8 seconds. well, i can, but then my ears really hurt, so i prefer just 8 seconds. on the plus, they were super inexpensive.	-1
HORRIBLE, broken upon delivery, tested its work-ability anyway and couldn't hear a heartbeat clearly at all	-1
Tough to say "I Hate" a stethoscope that cost just a couple dollars. Bought this to keep in the shed to use on horses. Big loud heart tones and resp sounds in a horse. You don't need monster amplification and you're not listening for heart murmers or respiratory rales and ronchi, you're simply counting pulse and respirations. This SScope works "OK" for that BUT, there seems to be no difference between twisting it to small or large diaphragm/bell. It hears the same out of both sides, no matter what setting you choose. So expect to hear ambient noise from the "other" bell as you press the business end against the patient.	-1
Toy like not for a pro	-1
Looks good for the costume but do not expect to hear anything through it.  You can hear better if you put your ear up to the person's chest.	-1

This simply did not work.  I tried a sample. I mixed it between my fingers, pressing, folding, pressing, kneading, pressing, folding, for about 1 and a half minutes. It was uniform in color It was getting a bit warm. I pressed it into a strip 1/4 inch thick, and let it harden for 24 hours. The next day I got two pliers, twisted the strip, and it crumbled! What the heck!  This product appears to be complete false advertisement.	-1
I tried cutting a 3/4" hole in 1/8" steel. The drill didn't make it past 1/2" hole and I was using cutting oil. This was the first of 6 holes I needed to drill. Returned for a refund.	-1
Had to drill an 1-1/18" hole into four, 1/16" thick, aluminum plates First hole was fine. Second Plate hole to be drilled became difficult at the 1" Step and couldn't get to the 1-1/8" step. Third and fourth plate holes to be drilled almost reached the 1" Step, but again, not to the 1-1/8" Step I needed. I used a Drill press, at a slow, steady pressure, to no use. No directions included. Didn't think of using "coolant". Didn't read ALL the reviews to find this out from other buyers. Really didn't think I had to turn my workshop into a machine shop and have "coolant" or cutting oil(?) dousing the step drill to drill 1/16" aluminum plate. Really?	-1
Possibly the worst tool I've ever purchased? Can't cut polycarbonate/abs blend plastic to save its life. I've never seen anything quite like it. See attached photo comparing this thing to a quality version (smaller diameter, but same basic design) made in USA (Made in U.S.A. is laser engraved right on the bit) by Milwaukee. Quite a difference, no? I mean, maybe I got a defective one? I guess I have to spring for the large Milwaukee bit after all. Should've known better?	-1
Bought this to drill a couple of holes in some small gauge sheet metal (24 ga) and the bit lasted for 3 holes until it was completely dull. It started to melt the metal and bend it and stopped cutting, even though this is advertised to work fine on metals like that.	-1
Unable to try it	-1
I had some trouble going through stainless. I have cut one pilot hole and it was difficult. I tried the 2nd one going fairly slow and using cutting fluid.. The bit never got hot at all but still will barely make a dent in the stainless. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I wouldn't recommend it for stainless steel. There are plenty of positive reviews on this bit, that's why I bought it, but it's not working very well for me.	-1
Lasted a whole hole.  Get it, yeah, lame all around the board.  Butter knife likely better.	-1
it takes to much torque to cut ok for the first 3 sizes then it just stops and i have 1 hp drill press	-1
Even using cutting oil, this bit burned out on the first hole I cut. I should have known better.	-1
Based on a real-world example explained here, I recommend seeking a stronger and more expensive drill bit unless you are drilling a very soft and thin item.  I bought this drill bit to drill 1 3/8" holes (the max diameter of the bit)  through two items made of steel, which also were bought from Amazon. It worked on one of them made of 29 gauge steel, and did not work on the other which is a little-bit thicker, and it is stainless steel. Here are the links to the two items:  1. A 29 gauge steel lid for a bucket (It drilled through without problems): http://www.amazon.com/Vestil-LID-STL-LL-Steel-Lever-gallon/dp/B0052P1QBU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1402917254&sr=8-6&keywords=vestil+bucket  2. A stainless steel cup (It did not drill through the bottom of the cup*): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NG9DUK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  *Actually, I have persisted drilling, but for people with other options who are not trying to "Escape from Alcatraz," it would not be worth the time and energy. The following is my progress.  The ad for the drill bit states: "Self-starting, no walking and center punch is not required." When I started to try to drill through the center of the bottom of the cup, there was no "self-starting," there was a lot of walking (I presume this means instead of forming a hole where the tip of the drill is applied to the metal, the tip of the drill slips all over the surface without forming a hole). So I got out the center punch, and finally, after about an hour, I was able to focus the tip of the drill bit in a little tiny pin-prick hole in the steel. After about 1/2 hour more of drilling, the hole was visible to the naked eye in a good light.  This was about a week ago. I then thought that, just as a trickle of water eventually can carve the Grand Canyon, so too would this drill bit eventually drill a 1 3/8" hole in the bottom of this cup. Therefore, every day I drill for about 90 minutes while I watch a movie. I am drilling by hand without a drill press,  but I have attached ankle weights to my drill for a less-taxing downward force on the drill bit and steel.  So in a week, my hole has increased to 1/4", and I hope that today I will break through to 3/8." Since the diameters of the holes are in layers on the drill bit, I am hoping that although one diameter may wear out the sharpness of the drill bit, I have proven, with the first 1/4" layer, that after a lot of work it can "break through," then I will start on the next diameter where the drill bit sharpness is brand-new. (Pretty sad that I have this sort of time, but that's another story.)	-1

I don't like to write bad reviews but I do always want to be honest and honestly this item is a bit of a let down.  I can't really complain as it was just under $3.00 but it isn't quality by any means.  The light itself is not very bright and the button to turn it on is right under the end of the clip.  This may be a common place to put the on button but here the clip is pretty tight so it seems to turn itself on even with the slightest unwanted pressure.  As far a pressing the on button it is very small so you have to make sure you press down just in the right spot or you'll be fiddling with it for sure.  On the plus side I do like that it is reusable so you don't have to just throw it away - just pop in a new battery and it is good to go.  Overall it is worth what I paid but not what I had hoped. I don't recommend the product I think there must be better lights without the issues I described maybe for a little more.  Cheers!	-1
The strap I ordered was described as "One Person". There is no description of length anywhere. It is only 12 inches long including the buckle so unless you are Barbie it is pretty useless for anything personal except perhaps securing your paddle to your kayak. The buckle is over 1 inch wide so it is ridiculously large for the length of the strap. Overall this strap is pretty useless. I obtained a 3/4" strap 24 inches long with a more appropriately sized buckle for less cost. All other NRS straps state their length and the "One Person" is shown after the 3ft, 12ft and 20ft so the assumption is that the list is in size order. Despite complaining there has been no change to what i consider a VERY misleading description and it would cost more to return than the price paid. I am a VERY dissatisfied customer.	-1
Not for outdoor use.  This stayed up about 2 days before falling off.  If the sticky side gets wet or even if its slightly humid it will not work at all!  the Industrial stuff is amazing for outdoor use or wet locations!	-1
This works fine in a vertical position but I purchased for a specific need where it would have to be almost horizontal and it doesn't work at all there.	-1
I initiated a return immediately after getting it.  It leaked oil and would not pump.  Terrible paint job all over and the relief valve was painted into position.  Obviously poor quality.  Thank God for Amazon returns.  It is all packed up and will mail it back tomorrow.  Looked for a higher quality bottle jack by reading the reviews on the site, seems they are all badly made.  So ordered a Craftsman, and will see.  Why isn't there a quality bottle jack at a reasonable price?	-1

I suppose that there are windows out there that actually require such a wide spline. Unfortunately for me, none of my 30-plus window and door screens do - and my house is only 13-years old. I ended up returning these splines.	-1
The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability. Unfortunately I could not find a better quality 2" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.	-1
I didn't count to determine that I received 100 washers, but it is in the ball park - no complaint.  However, the washers were all lumped into a single package, requiring me to sort them.  On top of that, they all seem to have the same inner diameter, although different outer diameters.  I needed something on the order of a 1/4" or 5/16" inner diameter, but they are all much smaller.  The manufacturer should (1) sort them, and (2) let the buyer know what the inner diameter is.	-1
Received the product promptly and was very pleased to find 3-prong T nuts inside the box, but as it turned out, they were the wrong size despite the labeling on the box and in the listing. Instead of 1/4", 20 TPI, they were smaller...the outer diameter of the T nut was 1/4" instead of being correctly sized to accept 1/4" bolts. Maybe it was sized more for 3/16". Returned these and bought a different brand, which did turn out to be the correct size.	-1
Defective straight out of box, and I guess it's non-returnable? End of scope won't stay locked into one position, which I think is affecting sound transmission. I could hear very little, no matter what I tried. The color red doesn't match what is online. either. Instead of candy apple red, it is an orange/red color. So disappointed! I had a prestige scope in the past that I loved! Quality control must not be the same anymore. Maybe I'll use this one for spare parts. Update: Although I am still unhappy with the product, customer service was excellent. Because it was defective out of the box, I was offered my choice of refund or replacement.	-1

came without a stethoscope , not good for me	-1
What a piece of junk. The photos deceive you. These pieces all have to be put together. From the cheaply made tubes. Yes you have to put the stethoscope together, by trying to put the tubes together and connecting to the ear piece. The gage has to be placed on long enough for it to stay. I rarely write one star reviews. But this is a one star product. I am returning it. You get what you pay for.	-1
I guess you really do what get what you pay for sometimes.  This bundle sounded like exactly what I needed.  What I got was a lot of very small tubing and only a few larger ones and all of them are the absolutely cheapest quality heat shrink wrap that you can possibly find.  I used it once and then tossed the remainder because it is basically garbage.  I can shrink wrap cabling better using a plastic garbage bag.	-1
Guess I was expecting more for the price. Could have had a piece cut at my box store for half the price	-1
Coating works, but they really need to change the packaging - I had some left over and tried to be sure that the can was re-sealed, but the stuff ended up hard and unusable anyway.	-1
I've owned two of these and with both the float split in two, rendering the float valve useless. Both lasted just over a year before failure. NOT a "Commerical" product. Go with the Little Giant float valves, they fit the Rubbermaid stock tank and last forever.	-1
These are absolute junk. The plastic they are made out of is way too soft and pliable. I have gone through several of these in the last few years on my stock tank (I use it to supply water to my pigs). The cost is also ridiculous.  For half the price you can get:  Item number TF125P-E Body and Nut Polypropylene Washer EPDM Internal sealing washer Polyethylene Color Black Thread 1-1/4" FPT Hole dimensions 2-1/4"  Now, with the above, you will have to ream the hole a bit. Takes about 10 minutes with a spade type drill bit, or a couple of seconds with the right size forstner bit. On the inside of the tank, you will have to use the drill bit to remove a very small amount of plastic from the support ribs on either side of the hole. The plastic used for the one I listed is like PVC. It is hard and tough. The nut also threads on much deeper and has a much better grip on the bulkhead "passthrough" portion of the fitting. Buy the alternative and save yourself a bunch of money over the long run.	-1
Good luck, I only received 1 of the 25 promised.  On the bright side, it seems to be really make well made. ;)  .........still waiting on my refund.	-1
I wasn't sure about the size and the price.  This is 24 yds at $8.50.  Homedepot is 35 yds at $8.98.  I paid $4.25 extra for these tapes.  I can't pick on any physical faults and return will cost me $7.  I'm keeping these but I'm letting you know.	-1
Not as great as the hype....no better than cheaper Duct Tape in my opinion.	-1
A tape job came along today. I received my few months old roll of Gorilla. Barely adhesive now. It was stored inside the house, by the way. Had to throw it away. Useless. Just doesn't seem to last. Won't buy again. Ever.	-1
I was looking to buy the  1.88-Inch by 35-Yard Tape Roll which is 10.54 & eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping, but mistook the  1-7/8" x 12 Yard Roll  which is  9.89 (with  FREE Super Saver Shipping).  I originally had the 35-Yard in view but lost it after looking for another item with Super Saver Shipping, and was in a rush when i ordered it later, and unless you look at the product details - which I should have done (!) - you can easily mistake the 12 yd roll. My fault, but  9.89 is  quite high for just 12 yards. (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026V4FOI/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_2)	-1
Junk, these last for about 1 to 3 minutes each before its used up, I'll stick with better brands from local hardware stores from now on.	-1
HOLY FLYING NEEDLES, BATMAN!  These wire brushes are DANGEROUS.  In Vietnam, we had a shell called the Beehive.  It was fill with 8000 flechettes and fired from a 105 mm howitzer.  Thats what these brushes remind me of sans the explosion.  However, in this case, these wire bristles fire out continuously like rounds from a tiny M60 machine gun.  WARNING!  WEAR FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.  Even when wearing face and eye protection, tiny shards of wire will stick into your clothing and contaminate your entire workbench.  I had to rub my shirt, pants and shoes with a powerful magnet used for picking up roofing nails and it still didn't collect it all.  Dont worry, if you get a 2mm strand of wire embedded in your tender skin, it will rust out in about 3 days.  I just came up from my workshop to write this review.  I laid my arms across my stomach and a piece of wire stuck me in the navel.  When I asked my wife to wash my work cloths separate from our underwear today, she gave me the look.  Some things are best left unexplained.	-1
The FTC aught to outlaw selling these to the public. They come apart and the bristles fly around in such a dangerous, destructive manner that they are a definite danger to whomever is in range of the melee of flying pieces. What a terrible waste of money and energy.	-1
you very off buying the ones you need	-1
Product quality reflects country of origin. Biggest issue is the cheap rivet that connects the ground strap to the grounding plug. One of three had to be replaced with a small screw and nut. Be sure to ground the box and fixture if using these.	-1
Simply put, this isn't well made. The plastic case comes with a hole in the top, and one on the side so you can choose where to mount the eye bolt, but the gap you have to weasel the nut into is too narrow to fit a socket into, and too wide to lock the sides of the nut, so you can't really tighten the nut all that well.  The magent, well like many other reviewers have posted 100lb rating is pure bunk. 25lb pull at best. Their rating is false advertising at best.  It will do one of the tasks I bought it for just fine. Picking up screws and nails off of my wood shop floor. But beyond that, it is a waste of money. Albeit not all that much money.	-1
Delivery was prompt and Amazon fullfillment made a return easy, but the unit did not work as received. I am pretty familiar with these types of devices but readings were eratic with swings of multiple hundreds of RPM's, an approximate 30% varying error. I tried painting a large flat black backdrop before placing the reflective tape and it made no difference.	-1
I only ordered these because the ones I was getting in a set with the stapler look cheap & small. So I ordered this one too and it is the exact same thing as I got in the set very small and all metal no handles like shown. Misleading! They should have a model # to compare.	-1
Not  12X12 inches, It appears to be metric size (30cm) being passed off as 12 inch.	-1
I purchased 6 pieces of PC for a project and upon arrival, every panel was warped and cut very poorly. It looks like whoever cut the panels used the wrong blade or tried to cut too quickly, which generated heat and warped the panels. I was going to use the panels for a project that required precise tolerances, which this product is far from. Returned the item as they were quite expensive for such poor quality panels.	-1
The piece is well cut, square corners and undamaged, HOWEVER, it was NOT 12" x 24" : It was a bit smaller. Also, it was bowed. The bow was about 3/4" in the center of it's long axis. I will still use it, but THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO TELL THE TRUTH: if it's less than 12" x 24" SAY SO! Also, pay attention to what you send; don't send the bottom one of the pile, that someone's been sitting on during lunch break.	-1
Too bad they don't supply the product as advertised. The sheet was undersized by .20". It's called dishonesty.	-1
It said it was 24" and it is not.  It is 23 3/4".  My design called for 24" so I had to redesign my project.  Other than that the product is fine.	-1
It arrived undersized. Ordered 12" square, it arrived 11-3/4" square	-1

WD-40 is outdated, but every house seems to have one due to tradition/habit. Most people haven't questioned why things they lube only stay lubed a week or why things they use WD-40 on seem to end up gritty, grimey, and stuffed full of crud that's been attracted from unknown places.  The only use for WD-40 is water displacement, and other products still do a better job. Lubrication and rust prevention don't last longer than a few days to 1 week with WD-40 AND it attracts grit and grime like a magnet, making the problem worse AND compounding the problem if all you're doing is spraying on more WD-40.  In my house hold, all WD-40 cans have been replaced by Breakfree CLP or Corrosion X. With either product, and for the same price, you get a penetrating oil that will get into stuck nuts and bolts and free them up. The lubrication will last much much longer than WD-40: squeaky indoor hinges will stay quiet for 2 years+ AND stay grit free. Rust is also prevented much much better. I use CLP to coat my outdoor padlocks and they stay shiney and operate smoothly for at least a year in rain or shine.....they would rust up heavily after 1 week if only coated with WD-40, and all sorts of dirt gets sucked into the mechanism.  WD-40 has no place in the home. It should be sitting in a museum. It's an inferior lube and rust preventer. It attracts grime and grit like a magnet. Not only does it suck as an oil, it will negatively affect moving machine parts. Use other oils and greases available.	-1
Good.	-1
I was very disappointed when I received this product.  I thought it would be of higher quality and material.  I own a "human" otoscope and was hoping this would be similar.  After attaching the head to the handle, the head actually "rattled" and moved.  It was not a secure or a tight fit on the base handle.  I took it apart a few times and tried to adjust it, but it stayed the same.  It also came with broken, plastic ear pieces which would not attach to the light head.  I sent the entire item back and have not purchased another item yet.  If you have any experience with medical equipment, this item does not even come close to professional equipment.  I wouldn't even keep it for home use because it just seemed cheaply made.	-1
a nice toy.	-1
I gave this 2 stars because this shut off ball value to stop the fuel when tank is full is a joke, it just doesn't work. Ended up removing the shut off value and putting a electric value in fuel line to stop the fuel when I see the tank is full.  Would not recommend this to anyone, way over priced for something that doesn't work.	-1
Works as agreed.	-1
Seller ok but the quality of the snap rings left a little to be desired! Not to mention the box they are stored in has lose dividers allowing the real small snap rings to be mixed, it  is a mess to straighten out!! Would not buy them again that's for sure!!!	-1
there is only one type of 5/16. pretty much useless.	-1
1/4 inch all 20 no 28. Contacted seller but only got partial reply. So I got a lot of 1/4 20's and no 1/4 28's. OK quality for price just want to use another seller.	-1
This is GREAT 100% Silicone.  Exactly the same as the original GE Silicone Sealer that was invented AGES ago. The problem is the pathetic tube that it comes in.  If you squeeze it too hard, it BURSTS and you Silicone all over your hands,. If you squeeze it GENTLY, you will never get all the silicone out of the tube. .You can't roll it like a tube that toothpaste comes in, TOTAL disregard by DAP when they designed the tube. IT SUCKS and you are going to have Silicone all over your hands when it bursts OR a crumpled up tube that will have PLENTY of silicone in it, to throw into your garbage. I'll stick to the Silicone tubes that are used with my caulking gun,	-1
i ordered 1 to use on my 9 in south bend but sold the lathe before i had a chance to use it. when i got my new (30 yr old) lathe in broke it out to center a 3 inch piece i has turning to make a ball turner. after several minutes of use the dead center developed a wobble (about 30 thou) .I don't think it was a good buy at all.  after several months and a poor memory i ordered it again, I hope this one works better. I will let you know	-1
I tried to like this center. I really did. It's big, it feels substantial, and it's exactly what I'm looking for. The first one felt like it had positive stops every quater of a turn. I figure in any production line there will be duds, so I had Amazon send me another one (thank goodness for Amazon's easy return system). The second one is better, but I can still feel the bearings grind when I turn it. Hooked up to the lathe, at slow speeds, it feels and sounds like a pepper mill grinding pepper- not the smooth, quiet live center I was expecting. Still hopefull, I called PSI directly, figuring they would find me a good one and send it to me, I don't doubt all the other reviewer have good ones, I'm just seeing some poor QC up the chain. Anyway, I could hear the technician's superviser talking to him in the background, and he basically said that's how it's supposed to run. Maybe it will get better with time, he tells me. He said if I wanted a quiet, smoother center I should look into their more expensive package (~$80). I was pretty surprised since they advertise it as a "smooth running" center.  Oh well, the replacement is headed back to Amazon. If you want to risk it, just make sure you don't tear up the package it came in so you can return it if you need to. Off to find another cone shaped center...	-1
This is a cast part. Poor QC on the parts since threads on one were malformed (won't thread) on the male end and the opening for the female end was not properly cut. Won't buy again.	-1

Junk, do not waste your money	-1
This don't waste your money , Should be a Law made if you sell this Cheap Crap	-1
This picture is very misleading.  You think you are getting normal sized hooks but you are not.  See that piece with a top and bottom hole?  A pen would fit comfortably inside.  Those red tipped hooks are too short for a garden hand trowel .  Plus, they are too thin for the peg board holes so they hang down too much.  Even if they fit a bit better in the smaller peg boards as mentioned, they are way too short in length to serve a purpose anyway.  Return.	-1
DIDN'T NEED.  NOW IT'S A PAPER WEIGHT!	-1
got the metal board, didn't come with pegs so i got these and none fit right , all are loose and cheap and i guess for the money it makes sense, not worth the hassle of returning now that i have hung them up but don't buy them or don't try to use with the metal board sold on amazon	-1
Cheap, not well built.  Tried using the ones with two hook in points that were bent a tiny bit.  They broke at the brazed point.  Probably would recommend trying to find someone that builds good ones	-1
Junk. A wheel will slip with this thing, and if you overtighten, it will crack or distort. Go with Metal!!!	-1
Very poor quality.  The numbers in the center of the caliper were worn off and almost impossible to read.  I cannot recommend this product.	-1
This product was flimsy and cheaply made preventing it from being of any use. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.	-1
Well made with a price to match, as you expect from Fluke. Stiff, durable tips.  My disappointment is that they are incompatible with my Fluke leads, a fact very hard to establish from all the model numbers they have. Is it too much to ask for all their leads to be interchangeable?	-1
Based on the three five-star reviews I read at the time of my purchase, I gave this a try.  Two of the three reviewers were using it for the same purpose and me - Attaching a cyclone dust deputy to the top.  Here are the problems: (1)  The bottom is convex so it does not sit flat on the floor.  I will be using the "ONEIDA AIR SYSTEMS Super Dust Deputy Molded Cyclone Only" on top, so I need a steady base.  Otherwise it will be too unstable. (2)  The lever-lock ring is hard to close (it's very tight).  This is good for a one-time use of hazardous materials but not good for a product that will be opened to be emptied repeatedly. (3)  It is very bulky as another reviewer mentioned, making it a poor choice for something to be picked up and truned over to be emptied repeatedly. (4)  Mine came with a bent locking part on the ring.  Another example of poor Amazon packaging. (5)  The lid is also convex making the seal to the dust deputy challenging.  The price of this durm is great and for another use it might be OK.  I will spend another $50 and buy the ONEIDA AIR SYSTEMS 17-gallon Steel Drum For Super Dust Deputy which is already drilled for the dust deputy.  I guess it's best to stick with a product that's engineered for that use.	-1
not what was expected from description, returning. very think and lightweight, more like the tubing that goes under casts.	-1
It must be working because it sticks my fingers together. But, the objects needed to be glued do not stay.	-1
A lot of glue in there	-1
It does not work as described.	-1
Every tube that I have used so far were filled with more air (60%) than glue (40%).	-1
Glue is fine, but it is the most ridiculous packaging on the face of the earth.  Enough of a reason not to buy it.	-1
Adhesive is perfectly acceptable, but the tubes are very risky to work with. I've had one explode out the back and one spring a leak in the side.	-1
Wat idiot thought of this packaging? I've been at it all day and STILL cannot get this blasted thing open. I'm sure the Super glue itself is find, it's the getting at it that I am far from impressed with... I guess I'll grab the crowbar from the garage and try again. You think I'm kidding, I'm NOT!	-1
I have just returned this product.  The switch was working well until, after less than a month of use, it quit.  I took the unit apart and found that a tiny - REALLY TINY - white piece of plastic was what connected the top of the foot switch to the electrical device.  It was the trigger that make the switch go on and off.  That pice of plastic had broke.  IF they had made the switch with a metal piece instead of plastic the thing might have lasted a lifetime.  This will forever be a mystery to me.  Why would a designer make a critical part that will take stress both small and plastic?  Why not increase the diameter of the part (in this case very easy to do) and make it out of something that will last?  The plastic part was about 1/16 of an inch square, maybe less.  Why?  A 1/4 inch piece of good plastic would probably last 10 years.  A 1/4 inch piece of quality metal would last forever.  What would that cost?  Maybe another dollar or two max?  Incredible.  AD2	-1
Pedal switch is good for  ON-OFF Only....this does not give a variable speed option and for $22 it should...or maybe i am asking too much?	-1
This ladle works but... The metal portion is too short to rest on the big dipper furnace without resting the wood portion on the heated surface. Love the smell of burning wood but not in this case. It is also very difficult to dip beyond about the half-way point. The metal portion is a very poor fit into the wood handle and tends to fall out. Don't I would buy this again.	-1
it just too small.....i just made me one...	-1
complete junk fitting	-1
The batch I got was runny despite my "kneading" the tube before applying.  It dripped and dropped and generally made a mess when I tried to apply it.  Don't recommend.	-1
Way too runny to use for much of anything, more like syrup than silicone like it should be. Not sure if I can return it just because it sucks? Also didn't dry in the 4 hours I had the door clamped closed gasket came right off when the door opened.	-1
Don't buy this, I had for 3 weeks and this valve was stuck and would not open when was needed during bad storm, lucky she had a backup pump that pushed water out through a separate pipe and valve, buy from a local plumbing supply bc u only get 30 days to return, from Amazon, plumbing supply will warranty for years	-1
1st, the rubber was a little tacky with no shelf-life data available on the product.  I worked for the government for many years & all rubber product has shelf-life data.  I will assume, since the material is tacky, the shelf-life has expired.  2nd, I fabricated gaskets for my Harley's Carb (Weber 48 IDA) and the rubber under stress during compression split in certain areas & leaked.  I wouldn't recommend this product to use for automotive or motorcycle gasket fabrication, especially, when the rubber is tacky as the one I received.	-1
I've noted that the original Kimberly Clark made gloves got thinner over the last few years and my last batch, with the Halyard name, rip more easily and are also significantly uncomfortable after having them on a few minutes.  About 1 in 10 now rip at the cuff while trying to put them on.  I found an older batch of the original KC branded gloves sitting on the shelf and noted that they are significantly thicker and also slightly larger.  Another decent commercial brand bites the dust.	-1
The picture is misleading, as these are the standard KC500 purple nitrile gloves from Kimberly Clark, and they do not have the 4 or 5 inch wrist extension shown in the product photo.  If you're ever had the KC500's, that's what these are, deep purple and not lavendar as shown.  These gloves are pretty durable and good for most household chores and situations in which you don't want to get your hands dirty.  I use these when I clean my tires and rims on my car to avoid getting that nasty black residue under my fingernails and all over my hands.  I also throw on a pair of these whenever I don't want to handle something nasty, greasy, dirty, oily, etc.  Not bad for the price, and far better gloves than a lot of alternatives I have seen.	-1
Wrong manufacturer sent...switched products on me.  Not kimberly Clark as wanted.	-1
The first one I used went dull in about 20 seconds.  It barely left a mark on the glass I was working with.  The next one I used was on soft metal.  Very unimpressive.  You get what you pay for.  Buy Ryobi drills if you want to grind through glass.	-1
