The plastic ones I had would eventually get chewed through. Up until this point, this thing has worked great but as of late, the mice are avoiding it like the plague. Not sure why. The only thing I don't like is that it rattles really loudly when a mouse is caught and trying to escape.	1
Works well!!! Killed all the mosquitoes within range. Had an outdoor party and set this about 20 feet away from our guests and we could hear it zapping the bugs. We had so much fun listening to the zapping!! I know, crazy, right?!!	1
work great	1
This live catch mouse trap , is very well built , ( made of metal ) , not cheap plastic ! I bought this for my girlfriend , who does not like to kill anything , and this mouse trap did the job !! We live in a state where the temps get below freezing and although she caught her terror mouse , as she was taking it to the dumpster for disposal , it froze to death before she even got there !! But if you are like her and are squeamish about killing animals , this mouse trap will suite your needs !!	1
When I pulled this out of the box I had my doubts about how good this would work.  It says you can opt to put bait in it or just use it empty. I tried it empty the first night and it caught two!  Since it is so cold outside I decided to put them in an old (dry) aquarium until it gets a little warmer.  Otherwise I would have gotten the kill traps. The thing works!	1
good	1
it rained and rained here recently so we are now inundated with mosquitos.  I know these lights don't "elimiinate" bugs.  They might attract them if they are nearby anyway, and "IF" the bug flies into it, obviously it will kill it.  What I am saying is this:  If you had a million bugs in a 1 cubic acre area before you had the bug light, you will still have the same number after.  This does nothing to the bug population--its huge---and it doesn't make your yard bug free and might even cause you to have more bugs--assuming they are attracted to the light.  The only satisfaction is hearing them get zapped.  Otherwise, its a waste.  If bug lights solved anything, they would be placed in large numbers in malaria, yellowfever, and other horrible mosquito borne disease areas.	1
This will zap lots of bugs and all kinds not just mosquitoes which is the main reason I bought it.	1
Very pleased with the product.	1
I placed glue traps with peanut butter inside and caught a mouse the very first night. I live in the country and they are coming into the chicken shed and garage looking for warmth now that winter is coming on and I have no intentions of accommodating them. Good trap. I bought 2, one for the shed and one for the garage.	1
Arizona is famous for blue skies, sunshine and bugs! This year has been especially buggy and we needed to find a way to control the bugs without pesticides. I remember a friend having an electronic insect killer and thought I would give it a try.  Well, we plugged it in and right away it started enticing insects to its warm blue glow. Sap! Sizzle! Spark! The next morning we found a circle of insect remains on the ground under the light. Needless to say I'm happy with our purchase.	1
AS DESCRIBED	1
I usually use Victor snap traps, but I thought that having a repeating trap would be handy.  I loaded the Tin Cat with the same bait I used on this round (which happened to be marshmallows), and I also put in some poisoned mouse bait; I don't think that a live mouse trap is remotely useful, since dropping a semi-domesticated animal (they are HOUSE mice, folks) out into the wild is none too humane, and in fact in my state it is illegal.  And I just want them dead, thank you.  So the snap traps I set caught three mice.  At least one mouse got into the leftover poison bait that I left in the original box, up on a shelf.  No mice were caught by the Tin Cat.  I think that a mouse would have to be really, really hungry to force the doors open -- there is quite a bit of resistance.  The mice in my house aren't really all that hungry (if they were, they'd be easier to catch in any style trap, y'know?).  So if for some reason you want to catch live mice (cheap pets? cat toys? understandable but misguided notions of humane treatment of animals?), and the mice you intend to catch are really, really hungry (or Japanese-movie-monster strong), this might be a great product for you to try.  I'm sticking with the snap traps.	-1
good tool......	1
Dosen't work !!!! A month later the mice are dancing around this thing.......total waste of time	-1
Last month, I returned 3 Eaton Tin Traps since the first one just allowed mice to run in and out. I kept the Victor because the ones used in the past had worked.  This new Victor Tin Trap DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.  It is the same as the Eaton ones, which require the inhumane and cruel glue boards.  Is this new design a trick to force customers to buy glue boards? Why can no company design a tin trap that actually works?  OR an electronic device that actually stops mice? OR a synthetic urine spray that actually deters mice?  Rockets to Mars and Killer Drones, but nothing to stop mice.	-1
I have used it outside a few times. It did get some flies which is what I was after.  I think it will do better in summer when it is dark out and things still flying around.  It says not to use it indoors? I have and it works. It makes  a low humming noise I like it .  It beats fly stripps .  It also doesn't cost a lot to buy either.	1
The Victor Tin Cat is a really good product.  It works with very little effort, bait it put in the area you want to catch the mice and walk away.  The only drawback I see is having to empty the trap, it can be difficult to pop open and if there are still live mice you have to be ready.  I recommend checking the trap every few days and if there appears to be live mice, submerge it in water to drown them before you open it.  I have purchase similar traps from other companies and the do not hold up as well as the Victor trap. So much easier than the snap or glue traps.	1
This is a very well made trap and will be used when needed and Victor is a good name brand as well..	1
Works great	1
This works so well it quickly creates a problem with disposal.  I placed this in our feed room between feed bags and the feed bin - I caught about six mice a night for the first few nights.  Our barn cats were shamed.  Disposal -you will either need to come up with a way to dispatch them or drive them far from home to drop them off.  Remember, if it's winter out - dropping them off may just be a cowardly way to kill them because they won't have shelter.  Until it got cold I took them for a ride.  Now it's tougher to figure out what to do with them so I've retired this trap for the winter.  A friend puts her trap outside in the snow to freeze the mice to death.  She thinks this is humane, I know someone else who rigged up a box to his muffler - probably dropping them into a water bucket would be the most pragmatic but I'm a little squeamish about that!  By the way - putting this trap away means propping the lid open because mice find it up on the shelf too!  REMEMBER YOU NEED TO CHECK AND EMPTY THIS EVERY DAY because there's no food or water inside so they will end up cannibalizing each other.  If this happens you get super bad karma for life.  PLUS the mice will come back in your dreams and eat your brains!  (plus the trap is nasty to clean up after that)	1
I have used this product for a season! I am impressed with it.	1
As advertised	1
I like it so much. It work.	1
this is the product i have been looking for.  i hand it in the corner of my kitchen (kids and pets open the door a lot).  it keeps bugs free inside of the house.	1
Kill bugs it work great	1
We purchased this trap along with the similar Eaton trap; they are almost identically built.  The plus for the Eaton is that it has a clear plastic window in the lid so that you can easily see if you've caught a mouse (although you can usually hear them first).  The Tin Cat, however, is a bit sturdier.  We caught several mice in each trap; both traps are easy to open for release and easy to clean.  BUT...the mice quickly learn how to get out as easily a they get in!  My husband made a minor adjustment to the openings, and we then caught and released several more mice who apparently could not get out.  We haven't caught one in two nights, so I'm hoping they're gone!  I recommend the Tin Cat for humanely getting the mice out of your house, garage, etc.  **I would ask both companies (Victor and Eaton) to refrain from suggesting the additional use of glue strips or drowning...that's very cruel.	1
Want to know who's does not read the instructions to a product..look at the negative reviews. These trap rock !!! I have over 16 placed around my property, and in my house (2 1/2 acres). First the ramp is NOT spring loaded lol lol (you won't see engineer next to that guys name). If you do NOT periodically clean these traps, you will get sand, leaves, spider webs, etc etc in them. This is a repeater mouse trap..mine are over 7 years old (recommended by a Feed Store owner (Ken Swapp)). I can only imagine that the negative reviews are members of PETA, or the Humane Society (which I donate to). If you negs. don't like your tin cats, email me and I will buy them from you (via Ebay). They last forever (I am surprised victor invented these) Like the saying goes it is better (more profitable) to TREAT a disease,than to CURE it. These CURE the disease (being mice). YOU MUST PUT THESE AGAINST THE WALL AT THE BASEBOARD !!! (WITH THE SIDE THAT HAS THE OPENINGS AGAINST THE WALL) mice like to hug the walls when they travel. If your mice are avoiding these traps...their retarded, or super super smart (time to move)lol lol	1
I find that the J. T. Eaton 421CL is preferable to the Victor. The two traps appear to be identical, except that the Eaton has a plastic 'window' in the cover that makes it much easier to see whether there are mice inside. The disadvantage of the Eaton's plastic window is that it is not very durable for outdoor use, since the plastic shatters easily once the trap is a year or two old.	1
Received it right away and as described. We had our mouse caught safely within the first night and released it into the wild ;-) It's a little tricky to get the mouse out o the trap, since it's trying to hide.	1
Great product.  Kills bugs by the thousands every night.	1
Works good for small bug light. Easy to clean with blower.	1
OK, here's the scoop on the Victor Tin Cat. It works very well, IF you use it correctly. You are only thinking about buying it because you don't want to blast your little mouse invaders into the next life, right? Because nothing beats snap traps for efficacy and ease of use. But the Tin Cat can work and work well if you deploy it wisely. Here are a few suggestions on how to get the most out of the live trap and how to prevent invoking suffering on its rodent inmates:  0. USE DISPOSABLE VINYL GLOVES WHEN HANDLING THE LIVE TRAPS. Seriously, you have to do this to protect yourself and your family. Hantavirus and other infections can result from exposure to mouse droppings and urine. Most people who are exposed to the virus have come in contact with rodent droppings in their own homes. Let's not get sick because we choose to not vaporize mice who are trying to cohabitate with us.  1. Bait the trap generously. I use a half of a peanut butter cracker per trap, split it in half again and put a quarter at each end of the trap. There are vent holes that the mice encounter when they inspect the trap from the outside. Make sure your bait is right up against the vents. Refresh the bait every time you clear the trap of a mouse, or every few days if you have not caught anyone yet...  2. ...because you're going to check the trap every day. EVERY DAY. If you don't have the discipline to do this, then just use the conventional wood and metal Victor snap traps. Otherwise, you're going to turn your well-intentioned live trap into a killing machine ... a very slow, torturous killing machine. A few things can happen if you neglect the traps more than 24 hours, including their painfully dying from lack of water, lack of food, hypothermia, or cannibalism. Mice have a very high metabolic rate, and will painfully perish after a day or two without food or water. Yes, your bait is in there, but if you've got more than one prisoner, it's party over, man, party over. Second, the metal floor of the trap is an excellent conductor of heat and will rapidly transfer the life out of a mouse if the trap is in a cold environment like a barn or garage. I put some cover in the trap, like dried grass or hay or leaves, enough to ensure that they'll be able to sit atop it yet not enough to make it not easy to see if someone's come to visit.  3. When you clear the trap, take the mice at least 100 feet away, further is better, or try to release across a couple of habitat transitions. Distance is best, but if you can't do that, you might be able to get them across the street, or in that woodlot next to your yard, etc. If you've ever seen a mouse hauling tail on a paved surface, you know that they can cover distances in a flash and be right back where they started. In your house or barn. So, again, more distance is better. Remember, mice leave their nest sites to forage ... they know how to find their way back. Their trails are marked with cues, so you have to break that chain so that they cannot find their way back.  4. Another note on emptying the trap. These little guys are scared in the trap, and they look for dark, narrow spaces to hide. So make sure that when you empty the traps, you look into the two little entrance chutes on the inside to make sure that there is no one in there. It's easy to do... the chute area on the inside of the traps is not much longer than a mouse. But just make it a practice to peek in there so that you don't forget someone, only to kill them due to the factors detailed in #2, above.  5. Clean it, clean it, clean it. Mice leave a mess, it's a fact of life. The amount of droppings a pair of mice can leave in these traps is nothing short of amazing. They have the market cornered on healthy bowels. Every time I clear the traps, I tap them a little against the ground to loosen the droppings ... some leave, but some are stuck, but it's OK because you're going to clean the traps every week. At least. I use a two-part cleaning process: first, I place the open-top traps on the lawn and spray them with a power stream of water from the hose. That blasts out a lot of the stuck stuff and starts to soften the droppings that are really adhering to the trap floor. Then, about a half-hour later, I hit them with the water stream again, and voila, perfectly clean. I let them sit out in the sun to dry, and then they are good to go. About every two weeks, I spray the traps using 1 part bleach to 10 parts water in a spray bottle to sanitize them. After a half hour, I hit them with water again and air dry. This may seem like a lot of trouble, but I want to the traps to stay serviceable, effective, and not become an undergraduate microbiology project that causes havoc and societal collapse as seen in the movie Outbreak.  6. Deploy them correctly. You have to get your Tin Cat up against a wall or some structure that will lead edge-running mice into it. Place it out in the middle of a floor and the fat lady is never going to sing, brother. My traps reliably catch one to three+ mice every night that they are set out. I run three Tin Cats in my barn that is in a rural forested area with a perennial brook running just 50 feet from the garage ... lots of mouse potential. The traps are very reliable. If they stop producing, and you've followed the rules, then move them to a new location ... even if only a few feet away. You can also change bait ... mix it up a little bit. If you've had a mouse die in your trap, clean it out and spray with the 10% bleach and sage the darn thing to drive out the spirits of the departed Mickey Mouse.  Finally, don't use glue sheets/traps inside of your Tin Mouse. Dude, that is like the most cruel thing you can do. The bloody things should be illegal. It would be kinder to just nail the mice to the driveway and back over them slowly with a steam roller. That's right. So why take on the guilt and bad karma if you can avoid it? They work GREAT without them. Don't get upsold on something that's not necessary.  Oh, and if you store these things, don't just stack them on a shelf somewhere. Because when you go and get them to put them back to work, you're going to have fossilized mice in there. To store, I clean and dry them, mist them with a little fog of WD40 or 3-in-1 oil, and place them in gallon zip lock bags. When I pull them out, I give them a quick degreasing and washing with Joy dish soap and they're good to go.  I'm a power user of these things. I'm an ecologist living in the backcountry and I just don't like to kill things if I can avoid it. In the house, an old 1890 cottage, it's snap traps all the way, because I need to set traps in the nether parts of the house where I'm not going to see them but every few days. But in the brookside barn/garage where I have a workshop and keep my cars, I'm in there daily and can clear the traps. I've had a problem with minks trying to live in my barn... and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why they want to live there: ample food (mice), water, and brookside digs ... and now you know why I take my mouse trapping seriously - area-denial warfare against mink!	1
Kills a lot of bugs	1
they are very cheap and they do not work one was broken upon arrival the packaging wasn't good, and the other one was crushed and broken	-1
This is the second Flowtron Insect Killer that we have purchased and they are very effective.  Our first was a 1 acre model which we used at our cottage in Maine.  Now we are back in Arizona and low and behold we are being pestered for the first time with mosquitoes in the desert.  Watch out mosquitoes the insect killer is being installed tomorrow.  Just hope the neighbors don't get upset with the snapping and buzzing during the night because we are declaring war against these pesky insects.  You can't go wrong with one of these insect killer lights in your yard.	1
I use this in my barn where mice seem to invade.  I have found the secret to these is to use bird seed as an incentive, and to wash out the trap after every successful catch, so the workings do not become jammed.  The mice are released into the wilds at a remote site on our ranch.  Sometimes I think they beat me back to the barn...they are looking kind of familiar!	1
this is doing a great job in our yard	1
Not the black lite one expects with a bug zapper,  this thing  lights up the whole yard,  very distracting,  its like looking at a 100 watt bulb..	-1
We get a lot of mice when the weather turns cold.  I've tried every type of mouse trap on the market, including spring traps, repeating traps, electronic traps, etc.  The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution, but they can be a bit gruesome.  This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.  The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.  A few important notes:  - This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily.  You can't expect to catch mice, leave them in the trap for a week, and expect to find live critters the next weekend.  If they die in the trap, you'll face a smelly clean up task.  - I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.  In a nutshell:  This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades.  In my experience, the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning.	1
We had tried 3 other traps with no results. This one finally caught out tiny friend and I was able to let him go free in a nearby field. I was happy knowing that the mouse didn't have to die just because he dared to come into my home. He was happy to be living and not with a broken neck.  Its a win/ win!	1
I ordered two of these mousetraps in August of 2010. I chose the product because it was very similar to another brand I purchased months before. That product caught mice, but was made of plastic and after emptying the trap three times (It caught five mice for me) the little buggers managed to chew enough damage to render it useless.  Unfortunately this promising metal trap is unattractive to mice. After five months with it in the same location I've only caught two mice. I started putting conventional baited spring traps in the same area and I have to empty them every day, so I know the expensive metal traps aren't doing the job.	-1
I put my bait (peanut butter) on the top of the entrance box so it gets between these and the lid. Attracts great and the mice can't get to it so the same bait works for months.  No setting required, you don't even really need bait if well placed. I keep these under garage shelving, under stairs, in the floor of the pantry, etc. and just let them sit until successful.  There is another model with a clear lid, not needed and these don't have plastic to break. An unadvertised benefit is that these have a "built in alarm" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.  If you want to release live, thats great, but if you want to dispose of the mice, just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly.	1
Does not really work again mosquitoes but catches everything else. Missed my window to return.	-1

Does a great job!!  Very bright to attract insects.	1
while my snap traps in my garage caught 10 mice this caught none.  had some droppings inside however!!!! this was over about 6 weeks. jan 2012--------------this is an update........  this unit is being used outside around the house-----------caught about 4 after a few months, following the instructions.  after loading it up with peanut buttrer, I had more success. now caught about 18 total.  so not so bad.  3 stars perhaps.	-1

Exact replacement for the "John Deere" filter in my L118 with the Intek 22hp V Twin.

Have bought a number of these before. and these are our favorite kind.  Even though the bugs still have to be blown out or gently tapped out, they don't stick to the electric grid like other bug zappers we've had.  Zillions of bugs, mostly mosquitoes, fall out onto the ground underneath.  Like the other zappers, these only seem to work for a couple of years, but they're worth their weight in gold for controlling mosquitoes.	1

Bought this for our 3/4 acre back yard with pool to fight off all those flying nuisances. It works really well but I highly doubt that it attracts in a the huge specified radius. I observed an interesting opportunistic development: Right underneath the lamp where all the burnt insects (dead or alive) fall an ant colony was happily dragging them away as food source! Anyway, we started to enjoy the "ZZzzaaPPP" with time because we know that another bug won't bother us!	1

Absolute bug killing machine. I have this set up on a timer at night and it draws in bugs you never knew you had flying around. It literally cooks them with the amount of current. The big ones really sizzle and smoke. Ten thumbs up.	1
This works great in hawaii, I have killed a ton of mosquitos with this, I have the ocetenol in place so I cannot comment on its performance without it...Its a bit loud however when bigger things get stuck on it..  I have my own compressor so cleaning it is not a problem for me, I also give my fish the bbq in the morning.  Needless to say im very very happy, dam mosquitos was biting my animals, swarms of them...	1

Repair Clinic and E-Replacement Parts have parts. E Replacement Parts has exploded views of equipment. Stens has a FULL-LINE catalog for ALL kinds of 2 and 4 cycle equipment. It is a VERY good catalog! Amazon has it. Get Amazon's 12" hemostat pliers or the 45 degree hemostat pliers to replace fuel lines. Cut lines at a slant to ease installation. Work them back and forth to loosen. Set the lo mixture for highest RPM's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM's at full-throttle. Set the idle just until the chain just stops on a chainsaw.	1

Really like this little bug zapper. I got it hanging in my large garage.  PROS: - Price - Size - Works well against flies, even little fruit flies. Seen dead moths, and skeeters, also - Power use...low. It actually uses around 25 watts according to my Kill-a-Watt meter - Fascinating zapping sounds...reminds me of my neighbors bug zapper growing up in MI in 1976  CONS: - Transformer is up top and the unit does not hang straight up and down (weighted topsy-turvy). Had to tie a string on the lid to make it hang level - Power cord needs to be at least two-three feet instead of 10 inches long - Dunno reliability yet or cost of bulbs. - Can get messy underneath because it kills so many bugs (not really a "CON" but may be a pita for some)  OVERALL: - Great purchase and it works well at killing bugs. I am considering getting another one for next spring.	1

Fits well, use it on my John Deere L118 lawn mower.  Only complaint is that the shape, while fitting well, doesn't fit perfectly.  In my car, when I get the air filter seated just right, everything closes up just right.  On the mower, even when its seated just right, there's awkward pressure on the flap as if it's not quite right - but it is.	1
Nice thanks for the speedey delivery	1
Thank you for your fast shipping service. It fit my mower just right!	1
Good Item!	1
ZAP, ZAP, ZAP, and a billion bugs are dead. What can I say, except that it works great. A side benefit that I didn't anticipate is that every morning the Orioles show up to eat the dead bugs that are sprinkled on the ground around this zapper. I see a few lizards chowing down too... I have had it a few months, and it continues to work flawlessly.	1
Good	1
works like a champ, also works as a night light in patio off bedroom, and is zapping all night	1
Nice clean air filter to replace the dirty one.	1

It's a basic filter and for the money is a good value in that it doesn't fall apart after a year, can be cleaned and reused to extend life, and doesn't choke carb.	1

Fits as expected for my B&S Intek 24HP lawn tractor (inside my Craftsman mower).  Exact replacement and it traps the dust and grime that gets sucked in the front intake.  The pre-filter requires oiling so as to capture the fine dust).  My mower creates a cloud of dust if I ride thru the bare spots and weaker patches of the lawn under the many trees, and it all rises up near the front of the hood where the intake is for the engine. Not the smartest place for the intake so it makes the pre-filter definitely work to do its part.  I've been able to clean (both) and rinse (pre-filter only) a few times and get some hours out of each.	1
Use for my Cub Cadet Zero-Turn riding mower. Good price.	1
Now my tractor can breath. Fits prefect on my D140	1
exact replacement for my riding mower.  the other was in really bad shape after 9 years..lol	1
Good fit and works well.	1
Really kills the bugs.  We did unplug it- because I was gardening close to the area and the bugs were drawn to it.  The only issue was: they wanted to stop and have me for a snack on the way.	1
Cheaper than Home Depot	1
John Deere OEM at a great price.	1
Perfect fit, just like it should have been. It even came with the foam prefilter. Amazon saved me a trip to town. Those guys never have what I need anyway.	1
Great!!! Highly Recommend!!!	1
Perfect fit	1
think you fore the air filter it's hard to get it where I at.	1
Why buy at Sears or the big box stores like Home Depot or Lowes? This is the same identical product for far less money. I buy them by the case so I always have them on hand as I mow acreage and in a dirty environment. It takes less than an ounce of dirt to destroy an engine. Protect your investment. Great buy and great protection. This is an actual Briggs and Stratton product not an after market product.	1
Perfect fit and a great value	1
We have a large back yard that is surrounded by woods. The woods are only about  25 feet deep and then houses on the other side. "Asian tiger" Mosquitos attack us day and night. They are relentless. I bought a Burgess propane fogger which works but it only lasts so long. I put Dunks in our retention pond and they work great. This thing Kills bugs because I see them dead all over it. Does not seem to make a big difference though. We still have Mosquitos biting us day and night. I'm sure it helps but I'm not sure anything can kill them all. The "attractant" thing seems like a waste. I think the light is really what attracts them. However I think this is also why they never seem to all die. They just keep flowing toward the light. So the close ones die that night and others come closer and then settle wherever they are when the sun comes up. It seems to be of good quality for the money and it kills bugs. It did really even help my problem so I could not give 5 stars.	1
I think all this killed where beetles. :-( we bought it in hopes it would get the flies and Mosquitos. Our yard was filled with Mosquitos and black flies we where desperate. I wish it would have worked!!	-1
Fits and works just fine	1
OEM	1
Fits just like it should, exact OEM part.	1
As shown	1
This one fit my Deere D130 B&S V-twin perfectly, and was much cheaper than the Lowe's store price for either the Deere packaged or B&S packaged version.	1
I went by just the picture that it would fit my JD equipment as the ad said it fit 18-26 hp engines.  It was exact fit and in just a minute, out with the dirty and in with the new and I was on my way to mowing.	1
This OEM air filter for my lawn tractor mower fit perfectly, You can tell these are high quality than some off brand replacements. This package comes with the all important prefilter that helps extends the life of your main filter.  The package had clear instructions on putting oil on the prefilter to help it clean the air.	1
What's to say? It's an air breather for my lawn mower. It works fine at a very affordable price. would recommend it to any one. J Wheeler	1
I needed an air filter and this one was perfect replacement.  I didn't realize how bad my original one was till I took it out to replace it.  This fit my John Deere Tractor perfectly.  Quality is fine and will be buying more in future	1
Fit my machine just like oem parts and is doing the job its designed for, price was really right  too	1
This filter and housing were a poor design that allows dust leakage. I had a craftsman with a dusted engine because of this filter design. Briggs stopped talking to me about it and quit returning my emails. If you have one of these engines and it isn't dusted consider yourself lucky. I sold that mower and bought the same model with a Kohler.	-1
I bought this for my B&S in my Craftsman riding lawnmower. Direct replacement and I had no issues with the fit.	1
Kids like to hear it zap bugs through the window	1
I have had this unit in service for many months. It is on a timer that turns it on at dusk and off at dawn. It happily "zaps" bugs all night long! There is something really satisfying about listening to bugs "fry". It's almost like the smell of napalm in the morning... This is an excellent unit that appears to last. Definitely recommend!	1
It's a good zapper, cuts down on moths bit haven't really noticed it zaps mosquitos very much Update: 8/17. The bulb both burned out.  I replaced them both and now only one bulb works and it no longer zaps the bugs, too bad I spent the money in the bulbs.... I would not recommend this product.	-1
Ive always wanted one of these and am so happy with it. The biggest problem I have is how to clean all the dead bugs off the screen. Almost no mosquitos left in my yard. I actually caught a tree frog eating the fried mosquitos out of it once.	1
Unit has worked well but its hard to judge if it reduced insects as we have had a cooler than normal summer.	1
Would get 5 stars if the mosquito bait lasted longer and were less expensive to replace.	1
I have always had trouble finding these kind of filters in th past; and when I do they seem outrageously priced. These were the exact filters required for my mower. While shopping recently, I saw this filter pack on the shelf at Lowes....they were priced over $16.00. I will reorder soon.	1
perfect match for my mower w/ the B&S Intek engine.....comes w/ filter and pre-filter combo.  Shipped fast and installs easily.	1
great filter for my tractor fits better then the old one	1
This is an oem part and is cheaper than all the rest of the aftermarket parts. Fits great and works like original. Great buy and great value since the shipping was free. No one that I could find sells this part for less money.	1
Great product, lower price than buying from the dealer. I have been needing to replace the old filter and screen for some time and this is the first place both were sold together.	1
OEM spec. After 10 years of cleaning-out the filters with an air compressor a new filter is always a welcome treat.	1
Perfect fit on my Craftsman Dy4500. with 24 HP B&S Intec motor. Great price. Exactly what you get at the Sears store, but much cheaper.	1
works like it should and seemed to really cut down on the bugs hanging around the house. i put it out on the utility pole off the patio on a daylight sensor timer so it comes on for a few hours each evening and i love it. autopilot is the best	1
At first I was afraid it wasn't working.  Then all of the sudden, I heard pops all over the place.  I learned very quickly not to place it around the house, as the next day, there were bugs all around and in my sunroom.  I bought a six foot Sheppard's Hook, but it ended up being to short when it hang.  So I purchased one that screwed in and hung it up on the very top post of my fence.  It worked perfectly!  I can barely hear it when I sit on the patio on the other side of the yard, and I was able to bury the extension cord under my garden rocks and hide it along the fence post.  It could, of course be better and easier if it were battery powered, however I'm sure it wouldn't last longer.  The last time I used it, there were tons of bugs surrounding the fence post, so it is definitely doing it's job in attracting the bugs and moving them away from the porch.	1
Touted as a mosquito control device, it's worthless.  Used as a device to kill moths at night, it's great.	-1
Put it up, plugged it in and it went to work. Does a great job of killing those pests.	1
Living in Texas, we are use to a LOT of bugs. I have both my front porch light and the light between my garage set to auto on when motion is detected and then go to dim instead of completely off when the motion is on. The result was that we could not walk out front without getting accosted by dozens upon dozens of bugs. I put this up about 25 feet from the front porch and within a week, all but a very few of the bugs are gone. We live near a creek, so mosquitos are always a problem here but the mosquito attractant must be working because I have not been bitten since installing this. It is quite obvious how effective it is.. it is constantly zapping away at bugs, almost without cease. The june bugs are a bit to big and stupid to be zapped by it (they just crash into things), but it seems to take care of everything else. If I had know how well these work, I would have bought one years ago. It has been out in the Texas sun all day and is showing no sign of not holding up. I simply couldn't be happier.	1
Kills lots of bugs.  Need to clean out often to maintain good operation.	1
Works great.  We left it on all night.  Good bye mosquitos, gnats and other nuisance flies!	1
Great. Works well. Never knew I had so many flying bugs around patio. Keeps the insects away from us.	1
Seems to do the job. I have not had a huge mosquito problem this year due to dry weather.  The Flowtron seems to work on the few that I do have.	1
This is 3rd unit in 20-30 years.  Effective, well made.	1
***PRODUCT UPDATE*** 5.27.2015 Almost one year later and I went to put the zapper out in the usual place in the back yard. Plugged it in and like a champ ....until it died! That being said I just contacted Flowtron directly since the 30 day amazon warranty was clearly over. (Flowtron has 2 year limited warranty FYI) I explained what had happened... they responded via Email with in 2 hours and it appears that it was the transformer that could be the issue. So I just sent them a copy of the invoice and they are sending me a RMA slip to ship it back to them to repair / replace it if that is what in fact is the issue.  So fingers crossed. I did check their website and just for reference although i do believe it's the transformer since I checked the leads and there was no power going to the fence or bulb. I  hope this helps. I do enjoy this product and  it works really well... it just  Zaps them like crazy especially since we are nestled into the side of a Michigan State park and the bugs are more than bountiful.  ***ORIGINAL POST*** July 2014 This sucker ZAPS them all night long!!!!!!!!!!  now to be honest I do not notice any difference when we use this and we are outside at the bonfire..... that being said this puppy is frying bugs all night long!!!!! so it certainly works VERY well but Perhaps I have not put it close enough to me to benefit... it says to put it a fair distance away from the gathering since it is an attractant but that's OK one bug zapped is one less bug on me :)	1
It works	1
Works great for all types of flying insects.	1
The first one I got was dead so Amazon sent me another. This one worked. I swear this style of bug zapper hasn't changed much since the dawn of bug zappers. The grid is a little bigger so it doesn't clog up. This is a classic old school killing machine. Sit out on the porch with some drinks and the bug zapper on and just enjoy fried bugs. Nothing better than that.	1
Bye Bye Skeeters, worth the price. Works well as a night lite and it kills the bugs that come to it. I got 4 and am happy happy happy	1
Been using for most of the summer and take it when we go RVing. It is big and bulky, but super durable.  Every morning there is a pile of bug residue on the deck around the base.	1
This unit has been working for me for over a year now. The ones I was getting from Walmart and Lowes didn't make it through the summer.	1
Very satisfied with whole transaction and product.	1
This product is doing a great job.	1
Had to order this one since everyone was out of the bulb for my bigger one "BK-40D" it works for a smaller area. Will replace with the larger one, when the bulb arrives and stick this one in the shed.	1
Really good zapper. Set it out in the yard about 4 ft high, grab a six pack, and enjoy your redneck entertainment system. Always a big pile of dead bug parts under it the next morning. As an added bonus, really large insects that cant get in it will come to get free food. Had a huge female mantis on mine eating the moths that were coming in. Price wise this was half the cost of one at the local hardware store.	1
Bought this bug zapper to hang on my pool deck inside the screened room. Works great. I plug it in every night and in the morning I find about 500 dead gnats, flies, mosquitos, moths, and other unidentifiable critters on the floor under it. It works great. If anyone is having trouble with bugs getting into their house this is definitely the solution. I'm going to buy another one for my garage. Great product.	1
Looks and seems to work ok so far.  I don't think it gets every bug out of your hair but for the price, hard to beet.	1
Works great for me!!..........z	1
Excellent product.  I really like it.  Recommend it highly	1
Best bug zapper! plugged it in next morning i had a 4 inch pile of bugs on the ground dead under it	1
Bought this to replace my year old junked out stinger bug zapper and it works great. Even bought one for my dad	1
great	1
Best electronic bug killer out there. be sure to use octanol if using for mosquitoes. Very sturdy and this is the second one I have purchased since the first is 4 years old and going strong. Use timer and only run during dark hours. Use consistently and you will see big decrease in mosquito population in several weeks.	1
Plugged it in and goodbye to most of the bugs. Rarely have a problem with bugs while in the yard. Live in Florida and that tells you this works well.	1
I like it but hard to find a spot that is not close to the house.	1
Kills skeeters!	1
It works!	1
OMG we had sooooo many bugs in our back porch area. Would practically breath them in there was so many. We briefly had these monster mosquitoes too. One night I set a sticky fly trap near a light and the next morning there was no more room on it! Completely covered in bugs! I had enough, my grandparents used to have a bug zapper when I was a kid. I always thought it was fascinating. Anyway, this has drastically cut down the bug population, we still have a few here and there, which is good. I'm sure some bugs serve a useful purpose, but an overwhelming amount is just unbearable. It comes with a mosquito bait, I did see some mosquites dead after getting this, but since then we haven't had mosquitoes. I'm sure the bait has lost its potency at this point so I cant say for sure if this made a big difference or if the season passed for mosquitoes. Anyway, we don't have a mosquito problem now, so well see next year if they come back and if this will work for them, But the other bugs were the real issue, and this fixed it! We live on about 3 acres in the middle of the country, I was only concerned about the area around the house so 1 -1/2 acre seemed to be a good fit,  We also had a fly problem at one point, i put a fly bait trap and hung it next to this thing, I figured any flies that didn't get in the water trap have a chance of flying in and getting zapped. I was right, I did see a good amount of flies getting zapped, although it doesn't directly attract them.  Anyway, highly recommend if you have a bug problem!	1
I went with the 1-acre (40 watt bulb) unit and I am pleased with the results.  After 3 days of use the mosquitoes have been reduced to nearly nothing.  The flies aren't as interested in it as I would have liked, but there may be some fly attractant to put on the unit in place of the mosquito stuff that comes with it; I bought it more for the mosquitoes than the flies, so I am very happy with the results.  I would recommend this to anyone with a mosquito problem.	1
My Mosquito Magnet broke -- again --, and this time I got tired of spending a fortune to get it fixed. After reading reviews this device looked great, and so far I'm quite happy with it. I bought 2, one in front of the house, and one in the back, and I keep them on all day. Every evening at dusk, you can begin to hear the mosquitoes getting zapped. A beautiful sound, indeed... Like the Mosquito Magnets, you can't eliminate ALL mosquitoes but it makes a big difference.  The light is VERY bright, so you may want to consider where to place it.  Only flaw: The way the octanol pellets are attached I am sure could be improved. They're stuck to the bottom of the Flowtron with double-sided tape. Pain to peel the tape cover off, and I've had at least one fall off.	1
This product works great ! ! !	1
This thing really zaps the hell out of some bugs.  The only down side to the unit is that the grates are too small to let the big miller moths in to get fried...for that reason -1 star.	1
works great	1
Believe what the other reviews tell you... this works great!  We've had a really bad mosquito population this spring/summer and this helped put a dent in their numbers around my house.	1
This helps out quite a bit if your in direct line of site of it. Stay some distance away as well because it does attract the mosquito's and if they see you on the way to they trap they still like people better than the light.  It also gives a source of entertainment. We have found that a couple of toads around the house prefer their meals cooked and hang out under the zapper for a meal.	1
The light is per the manual supposed to some with a part that attaches to the bottom with a wing-nut that hold the chemical that attracts the bugs. Instead, this part is replaced with a snap in piece that has no bottom. Since it has no bottom the chemical came with a sticky bottom which is used to hold the chemical. The chemical has to be near the light so it heats up to release the chemical. With this new part the chemical is too far away from the light and once the sticky part heats up the chemical pack falls off and out the bottom.  Your only option is to put a piece of tape on the bottom, but then once it falls, the chem pack is an inch from the light and doesn't heat up enough on cool summer night.  I used this in northern Michigan near water where there where hoards of bug.  It didn't attract them and was only killing one every couple of minutes.  If it came as described in the manual it probably would be better, but apparently some MBA decided it would save a spec of money to remove the metal parts in the bottom.  I have had ones in the past that were great, this is not one of them	-1
I use it in the garage {garbage cans} and it is working to control insects in the area. GREAT	1
Bug light works great. Delivery was good and within scheduled timeframe.	1
Only gave this rating for the use for flies as it does not attract them at all.	-1
Good bug zapper. It's much better than Black Flag as there's less clog, hence less cleaning needed.	1
love it so far. kills bugs all night. our backyard is now comfortable to use without being attacked by mosquitos or gnats.  highly recommended. but you must use the octenol. don't skimp on the chemical attractant. increases the effectiveness of this by 10x	1
Amazing how quickly the zaps started. I got the 1.5 acre unit and I live in town. Can't exactly say that it covered that much ground. I most certainly don't have that big of a lot, and still had the lil bloodsuckers!	1
On time.  Perfect.	1
WATCH THEM BUGS FRY!!!!!!!!!	1
Thank You	1
Whatever effect the UV light and mosquito lure have, it is a very weak one. The lure (which is ridiculously expensive) seems to have no effect even when it was first unwrapped and installed.  One website suggests that the proper lure for mosquitos depends on the region of the country as different species of mosquito dominate in different areas. This manufacturer (Flowtron) doesn't offer a choice of lures, and apparently the Florida mosquitos doesn't respond to the lure I was provided with.	-1
My bugs are very fond of this zapper, and their carcasses are easily removed by poking a screwdriver inside the screen.	1
Works great.  I have it in a tree near the front door and I use it almost every evening.  I've notice less and less bugs near my door over the past 3 weeks.	1
I've had this plugged into a light sensor for a month or so now. The mosquito population has dropped noticeably and I can enjoy my back yard again. The rods do get fairly well covered but I think that's a byproduct of just how many bugs this thing is killing. Always great to hear the zap of another blood sucker going down.	1
Industrial insect removal device.  Killed thousands of bugs overnight and only had to be used occasionally to eliminate insects near our home.  About once a week is all it takes with this thing.  Piles of insects inches high underneath after one overnight each time.  No more in the air for several nights afterwards.  Really works great.  80 watts of pure killing prowess.	1
The unit works great. The only thing I can question is the short length of cord coming off the light. Its a foot long at best. Why?	1
So far works as advertised.  Was not aware of having to use an attractant when I ordered.	1
I've had these for years, running them 24/7 between April and October, and they typically last about 5 years or more. I unplug them and use a hose to spray off the bugs, with the bulb still in them (make sure it is cool). I have NEVER had a problem after doing this, so I continue to do it, usually at least once per week. Also, you DO NOT need mosquito attractant. Like a few other reviewers have said, I get thousands of mosquitos just from the light. There are piles of dead ones under the zappers. Our mosquito population is almost nil with 2 of these, 1 placed 100 ft behind and 1 to the side of the house. But if one fails or I unplug and forget to plug back in, within a few days we are being innundated with blood suckers. These are the best units, as they don't clog as easily. They DO clog, but not as bad as others. I haven't tried PAM on them yet, sounds like a good idea.	1
works good, lots of dead bugs, do think a bug catcher on the bottom would make it nicer and leave the patio clean.	1
In just a couple of nights we've killed a pretty good size pile of bugs. After a few months, we have seen a definite reduction of flying insects at our patio.  The Flowtron definitely attracts bugs, so be careful where you put it. We made the mistake a first of putting it on our patio and ended up having more bugs than less, as the chemical released actually attracts bugs. But then when we moved the Flowtron about 40 feet from the patio down to the edge of the lake in our yard, there was a noticeable reduction in bugs on the patio.  At least 5 other people we know have purchased one since they've seen the effect our Flowtron has had	1
Working like a charm! Great product. Zapping those bugs away makes me very HAPPY!	1
This is a great product. Unfortunately it makes BLUE light which kept me awake. I solved that problem by putting it on a timer to coincide with my time sleeping. (there was no other place to put it but near my bedroom, as I have a U shaped house). I immediately noticed a decline in mosquitoes and flies. This is very important to me as I live in a West Nile infected place.	1
I live by a pond so sitting outside would be impossible in the summer without this, I am very pleased	1
It works well at zapping bugs. Does it really cover 1 acre? I highly doubt it. I had it out in my yard & the effective attraction radius is not big enough for an acre, but it is plenty for a normal suburban yard & a yard party.	1
bought this to help get rid of the mosquitoes and moths that seem to want to take over our yard. It works pretty good. the only downfall is that octenol attractant is not cheap and doesn't last very long. but I guess it's worth it to not get carried away.	1
Great product for controlling mosquito's  down here in Texas!! Works even without the attractant!! I have mine set on a timer to work only during the night saving the bulb and electricity!!	1
We have a really big backyard and a creek flowing through our property so the mosquitoes really come out at night. Based on the reviews I bought this product and the first time I used it , I set it up right before we sat on our deck and it didn't seem to have any effect but as the night went on I felt like the zapping got more frequent and we were not getting bit that much.  The next time we wanted to use it I set it out about an hour and half before we even wanted to sit outside and this time it really came into effect, by the time we sat outside there was a lot of frequent zapping and we were not getting bit. Why 4 stars ? I wish it has a little more of a stand and not just a hook to hang it on	1
This thing zaps anything  Need to get more mosquito attractant	1
This zapper really seems to do a good job for the money. Between using it and mosquito dunks I have hardly seen any mosquitoes this year.	1
Wanted this to help with our mosquito problem...it is not a cure all, but a lot less expensive than the propane burner units.  It is OK, but still use the repellent to be on the safe side.	1
I bought two of these, which worked so well killing mosquitoes that I then ordered two more. The only negative is that I must scurry to get them powered down and under cover when it rains. This has caused me to find methods to shelter the zappers and leave them outside all the time.	1
very good	1
Worked well for my need	1
With cases of West Nile Virus and other mosquito-transmitted viruses such as Chikungunya (87 confirmed travel-associated cases in Florida in 2014, as of July 19.) cropping up in the U.S. and our area, I was proactive in helping when visiting my daughter in rural Baltimore, MD and encountering alot of flying insects. My daughter has a huge, covered back porch that runs the length of the house and a smaller one in front. There is a lot of foliage surrounding the house and bugs, particularly biting ones, tend to be bothersome. The porch is not screened in, so I bought bug zapper to see if it would help and it does!  We had used one years ago at our cabin in New Hampshire which was also surrounding by trees and foliage and mosquitoes were a particular problem since the region used to be a swamp. It seemed to be working since we could hear the zap sounds of insect victims. My daughter says that bugs seem to be a lot less prolific. Indeed, light-seeking insects, and other flying ones that happen to fly in its path) will be killed by this zapper (moths, et al). Still, zappers tend to be ineffective in killing biting mosquitoes even though other insects will be killed by the score.  Bug zappers attract insects using ultraviolet light and the low voltage current surrounding the mesh cage kills the insects that attempt to reach the light. The problem is that mosquitoes are not attracted to light; rather, they seek out carbon dioxide to locate blood proteins which are used to develop eggs, so only female mosquitoes need to draw blood and bite. Some mosquitoes prefer bird, snake, or frog/toad blood and others like plant nectar. A few don't even need blood to hatch eggs. Along with CO2, perfume, sweat, and body odor also can attract mosquitoes. Hence, the substance that comes with the bug zapper designed to attract female, biting mosquitoes.  So, we heard tons of bugs being zapped at our cabin in NH and numerous studies have shown that bug zappers are rather ineffective at killing female mosquitoes. What bugs were being killed then? One 1997 study (1) determined that the mosquitoes found in zapper collection trays were non biting midges (look like mosquitoes) that are attracted to light. I also recall giving my daughter a DEET-based product to spray the area surrounding the house to repel mosquitoes. Perhaps she used that in addition to the zapper and that is why she has noticed a difference.  Using DEET products and eliminating breeding habitats like standing water (e.g., after it rains) will help to reduce mosquito populations. Wearing protective clothing is also a deterrent. I provided more detailed information about mosquitoes since the mosquito-borne virus threat is serious and a current menace and I thought that people should not rely on this zapper to protect them from it. Anyway, I have no complaints about this bug zapper and recommend it for reducing flying insect nuisances - just not for effectively combating female biting mosquitoes.  (1) Snap! Crackle! Pop! Electric Bug Zappers Are Useless For Controlling Mosquitoes, Says UF/IFAS Pest Expert)	1
This has worked extremely well.  Bugs are not in my backyard anymore.	1
zap zap zap... it gets clogged.. it's kind of gross to clean.. I wonder if I can just stick it in my chicken coop and let them go to work...  oh- it works. I can have my lights on, doors open, and get few bugs- before, I' have gotten 40+ little beings crawling and biting their way through my happy home.	1
Great area coverage. Noticed significantly less mosquitoes in the backyard after stetting this up. Please note, you have to keep the lamp on 24/7 for it to be effective.	1
This product is heavy duty and works great in our huge lawn and garden. The downside is the mosquito attractant is so expensive we can hardly afford to buy those to put it in as needed. However, the bugs that get into the Insect Killer are definitely dying.	1
Not as good as I expected.	-1
good one thanks	1
Two weeks in and we have significantly less mosquitoes. I hope I don't have issues like the 1 star reviewers. I'll amend this review if anything happens.	1
Been using it for a month now.. it definitely kills bugs. Doesn't seem to clog or anything. it isn't overly loud but definitely noticeable when it is zapping. Love it.	1
Zapps away killing bugs all night long.  So far I haven't noticed any mosquitos and with West Nile virus being a concern, that is important.	1
DOES THE JPB	1
The moths almost catch fire and turn red when they get zapped. Can smell them frying....	1
Works great.  Easy to hang, barely uses any power.  I put this up and within 2-3 days I noticed a drastic difference in the bugs that would usually buzz around my porch lights.  This thing pulls anything in range in to it, and kills it.  Clears out about a half acre of annoying bugs.	1
I haven't install it yet, it's raining everyday in Florida and unfortunately I cannot leave it outside.	-1
This bug zapper really works well. I posted it in my garden and it gets all those pesky moths, whose offspring were feeding on my plants..Low energy use, about 13 watts. Not for mosquitoes. Sturdy and well constructed.	1
I have total of four mosquito zappers installed around my house.  I live near lakes and ponds, as well as a grove of trees.  The mosquito have been a serious problem in the past, where I dare not venture out during the summer months without full body protection or usage of DEET.  I have used 1/2 acres, 1 Acre, 1.5 acre, 2 Acre zappers.  I believe the best overall kill ratio of dollar is to use 1.5 acre Flowtron from my experience.  The 1 acre zapper gets clogged with scales of dead mosquitoes in day or so.  The 2 Acre size is just simply too large; it does it's job, but uses 2x40 watt bulbs for total of 80 watts just for the lamp.  One caveat is that these zapper seems to last about 1.5 seasons on the average and the Flowtron seems to be more robust and lasts longer than the Stinger models.  Now, does the use of the zapper leave my yard completely free of mosquito? No.  But,  with the zappers with proper baits and intermittent cleaning (I use battery based blower every other day, such as B&D cordless blower), the porch is usable.  I do not have to worry about these bits most of times outside.  Over all good product, but be prepared to purchase one every 2 years or so.  I have used propane based mosquito capturing system, but even that did nto last more than two seasons.  These devices must endure thunderstorms, hails, side way winds, high temperature, etc.  Investment of 100$ every year or so, is worthwhile investment for using my porch and being able to do some gardening in the summer time.	1
This has been a awesome Insect Killer. Has a good warranty. It must have gotten wet and Flowtron had me send back the flowtron and replaced the transformer or what ever was wrong at no additional cost. I might have had to only pay for shipping there.  I feel safer knowing it is killing hundreds of mosquitoes!	1
Over the years I've used a number of similar insect killers, and I find that they work well.  They don't control everything, but they definitely have had an impact on the flying insect population.  We have a large second-story deck (16' x 40') on the back of our condo and I wanted a solution that would help draw insects away from us.  We don't have a great deal of grounds around us, so I mounted this at one corner under the deck, and it works great.  I'm continually amazed at the quantity of insects it eliminates.	1
just OK	1
These out perform the Blackflag and Stinger bug whackers by a large margin; perhaps more than double the insect kill.	1
My yard is no longer infested by mosquitoes and I can use my pool again.  I've had my zappers for over a year now and they still effectively control the mosquito population in my south Florida yard.  What they do not tell you because they can sell more units, is that when it seems like your bulb has burned out you replace it and it still doesn't work.  Well, there is another tiny bulb under the top (get out your screwdriver) and for about $2.50 you can replace the "starter bulb" and get more years out of the zapper.  My experience is that the starter bulb (available on flowtron website) burns out faster than the u-shaped bulb that you can easily see.  Now this unit will also fry flies, lizards, and anything else that crawls or flies into it.  Follow the instructions and do NOT hang it near your door! It does not get 100% of all mosquitoes, so I use smoking coils next to my door ways to keep stray mosquitoes out of the house.	1
Excellent!  "All that, and a Bag of Chips"	1
Works great	1
There are not enough words to tell you how much I LOVE this product!!!!  When I can save money I will be purchasing another.  The first night, like others, I was like----uhhhh it isn't working! But the second night the mosquitoes came in droves and the zapping fun began! :) You definitely will want to put this away from your seating area. It's a blood bath. (Pun intended). Also the zapping sounds can get a lil obnoxious but to be able to sit on my back patio of several acres and NOT be eaten alive..........HEAVEN!	1
Didnt do much for me.  And as the item needs to be connected to an electrical source, unless you have multiple terminals around your yard, you will need to run extention cords.  Unsightly and needs to be undone everytime you mow in order to mow safely.,  A battery or solar powered version would probably be much more convenient.	-1
works great	1
does a great job considering how many mosquitoes we have!	1
Works as advertised.	1
works great!! love to hear those squitters get zapped	1
Its been a week or s - I haven't heard this thing zap NOT ONE BUG	-1
it works extremely well for 2 summers now killing off the pests.  I enjoy watching the flames licking it at the beginning of these two alabama summer.  fry them.  I have to fight for my backyard every year and the flowtron is my secret weopon.	1
I am now killing mosquitos by the millions and love it.  I live on the bay in Panama City and mosquitos make life outside miserable almost year around.  I bought this thing a few weeks ago and after a couple of nights it started popping and killing them my the multitudes.  I have to take air tank and blow out the mosquitos every few days  because killing so many of them.  I can already go outside and not be bitten immediately.  I bought the 1 1/2 acre one because I have a large lot with a lot of trees and water all around which is mosquito heaven.  Brought them a little surprise and it is now lights out for the pest!  I suggest you put it on dawn to dusk timer which will extend life of bulbs for long time.  Does not work during daylight anyway.	1
This bug zapper really works great!	1
This baby has some zap and I can't see anything working better.  It is VERY impressive that the price is inline with other units yet is MADE IN THE USA.  They don't make it clear on the box but it is MADE in the USA if you check the label on the inside of the unit (under the top).  After much research, I chose this one because it had better feedback than a similar priced unit (STINGER) which was made in Mexico.  Using the provided attractant, it worked well for getting the "NOSEEmS" in my back yard.  I have a half acre of land and this puppy arrived just in time to let me enjoy our deck.  Unlike some other units that you can't hear them working, this puppy lets you enjoy the WACK of hearing them die.	1
this unit really works and I some other brand the performance is not even close this. After the first night of use and see close to 50 bugs bodies on the floor at the balcony.  I follow some people's advice to add the Flowtron MA-1000-6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant as well. It is a very useful unit to me.  Will buy again.	1
zap, zap zap zap....BUZZZZZZZ Zap!  Die suckers!!  Finally I can sit outside!! I live on 1/2 an acre but was so tired of the moths and other night 'attackers' that I bought the 1 1/2 acre so I could kill the neighbors night bugs too =o) (evil right?) ha!  Works on mosquitos but not enough for me, so I also sprayed my lawn with an all natural, safe lawn spray - Cutter Natural - the combo of the two has made sitting outside on my deck at sunset with a glass of wine as enjoyable as it sounds	1
Great price and it attracts bugs. It is on the side of our house and it seems to be helping.	1
Super Zapper!  Got this and put it up the same day, around 7:30 pm, when the mosquitoes really start coming out in hordes.  I stepped outside a couple of hours later, and it was zapping constantly!  I mean it literally was killing 100 a minute.  The next morning I checked it out, and I can say this to all the bugs cruising around my backyard:  If you fly, you DIE!!"  I just ordered a timer for it, so I will probably run it from about 5:00 pm until 8:00 am, although I am sure it would still be zapping a few more during the day,  Great product so far!	1
Very impressive. Worked great! We have 2 ponds and lots of bugs. Worked on all flying bugs. Use at dusk and dawn.	1
This thing works very well and better than the other brand I bought for over $50 at Lowes. You will tell an immediate difference!	1
A+++++	1
great product	1
Great price, quick shipping, "Made in the USA". Mine been up and running since last summer, so a little over a year. Rain or shine, it still works great.  My point is, this unit is solid build. It has a bright UV light and a grid that zaps every time. But with so many types of bugs out there it might not work in every situation.  If you are looking for this type of electric UV zapper, this one really is the best.  So, what kind of bugs will this thing zap?  I mainly run this without the mosquito "attractant/lure". We have tons of moths and other big bugs. It zaps TONS of those. I've seen tons of other random bugs, including termites (winged) getting fried on the grid.  We do not have many mosquitos, the reason I usually do not use the attractant (The attractant, is attached to the very bottom of the unit). With lure, you'll see way more mosquitos getting cooked.  BUT, depending on where you live, regular/most common octenol lure might not work for you. If you live in the southern half of the country, you will likely have tiger mosquitos. These guys unfortunately do not care that much for time proven octenol.  P.S. -Do not put it too close to the house. Yo want the bugs away from the house and zapped. -Check out other "E" sources for buying the lure replacement cartridges. There is nothing special about them, so just go for the best price. - If and only if you are willing to take the bulb out, carefully spray the grid with pam. Less bugs will stick. I use leaf blower to clean of the grid every now ant than. BUT IF YOU DO SPRAY THE GRID, MAKE SURE THE BULB IS OUT. DO NOT GET ANY SPRAY ON THE BULB ITSELF.	1
Awesome, incredible, and what you want. I had bought the little Flotron at my local Home Depot.  It was what was available and what was recommended for my normal suburban sized back yard of maybe 60x80 feet.  It did nothing really.  Before we got this big boy it was a myriad of timing when to grill, avoiding the patio chairs from dusk on, and trying to find bug spray that stayed on in the pool. Yuk.  I saw this on Amazon -saw it was Prime - and had to try it.  Now THIS is a bug zapper!  We leave ours running. It still zaps 'em in the daytime too. At dusk and dark though, that's when it really does it's magic.  We have led patio lights and pool lights and I was a bit worried this would get lost in all that - but have no fear - it works SO great!  Mostly we have music and talking and folks in the pool or the waterfall running...so we don't hear the zapping...but at times we do too.  Very big smiles come on all faces!  In the AM at times when we first got it there were wonderful gray spots on the grass beneath it. Ahhhh....countless thousands of the little enemies!  Very satisfying!  We have had ours two plus months and run it all the time. It was really cut down on the bug bites and made our backyard a fun place to be again without having to resort to having cans of Off on the tables!  I read on the box this was for an area many many times our yard size. In this case, overkill is EXACTLY what we needed!	1
Very effective for destroying Mosquitos.  As the instruction state, "set up at least 25 feet from people." I did not find the mosquito attractant cartridges of any help.  In my opinion those little lure packs are to expensive and not needed.  Your zapper will work well without them.	1
It has a very short cord so plan on an extension cable with it.  It comes with a packet of mosquito attractant and will not do much against mosquitos without the attractant.  Note that use is prohibited "indoors" (occupied space) because of the nasty odor of the attractant and the UV lamp exposure.  But I have found it useful in the garage without attractant for all the other flying invaders (Florida) almost ever time I open the garage. The attractant was too much even in the garage.	1
Works perfectly for my needs. I would buy more if my needs require it.	1
I bought this because the yard spray's seemed ineffective and my wife always complained about the evils of chemicals. This works very well and I'm sure it has decreased the mosquito population in my yard, however, not to the point where they are non existant. I can still get bug bites on a daily basis.  As others have mentioned compressed air will help keep it clean. After the first two nights it was completely encrusted w bugs. I brought my small air compressor out and after a couple blasts it was mostly bug free. Since then the bugs seems to fall off much easier. I can simply tap the outside cage a few times and most fall off on their own.  Others have also mentioned that it can be quite loud. I tried sleeping with my windows open the other night but the zapping sound was pretty distracting. I have it on a timer w remote so I can easily turn it off on nights that I don't run AC.	1
It has significantly reduced the number of mosquitoes and other insects in my yard, but has not eliminated them	1
Bought this during early spring. Haven't had nearly the bug problem this year as we did last. This includes less flies during the day and I have yet to have a mosquito bite all summer.	1
Got this a few weeks ago and hung it on the same bracket the other ones I have had hung on the patio. First night up the wife came in and commented you ought to hear the zapper, I went outside and she was right, the light on this one is brighter than the ones I have had in the past. After a few weeks it seems to have helped the mosquito problem we have this year quite a bit. It still does clog up with dead insects but not nearly as often as my past lights did, thats why I gave it a four star!	1
Works as advertised.	1
I bought this zapper at one of those warehouse clubs a long time ago. 3 bulbs and 28 years later it's still going strong. I keep it clean with compressed air every few weeks, have it partially under the eave of the garage, and run it everyday from 6pm-6am from June till September. I don't know why all you 1 star review people are having all these issues.	1
Pleasantly surprised at the numbers of crispy remains each morning. Before hanging this the skeeters were driving us in doors, now they're tolerable despite the wet weather. One night it stormed and the gutters overflowed onto this device. I was resigned to it's loss but it survived good as new. Didn't know it was made in the USA but that was a nice bonus. Going to get one for the camper.	1
Great gadget!  Took the Mosquitos out of the backyard in less than 3 weeks!  It works for us!  Well worth the money we spent!	1
I have had this for right at a year. I love it. It's really important to have it at least 25 ft from where you are, however I have it attached to my deck. It really does keep the bug population down. I live about two miles from a lake, and I get millions of mosquitoes. Millions. I love to BBQ and grill out and having this has helped me reclaim my backyard experience. I have 4 bug zappers - 1 Flowtron, two rechargeable stingers, and a plug in stinger. This thing attracts and kills everything that's going to annoy you at night. And yes, it does attract mosquitoes. I don't know how since scientifically mosquitoes are not attracted to UV light. I clean it out periodically and there are tons of mosquitoes in the grid. I also like that this company stands behind their products. I recently had an issue where my grid quit working. I emailed the company, the next day sent me an RMA number to send back to them - they fixed it and sent it back. Plus, it's made in the USA which is a major plus for me.	1
We moved to a property on a river in norther Wisconsin in deep woods. Yeah, ka-zillions of every biting bug you can imagine all summer long. We lived last summer through the swatting,itching, and being held captive in the house after dusk. We decided this year that we had to do something different. We put up this unit the day it arrived. It is a mean killing machine. By morning, it is so full, the mosquitoes fly in to kill themselves on it, but there's no room. So every day I clean it off. Cleaning is so easy - 30 seconds with the blow dryer, done, and it's ready to zap those nasty devils again. We can sit outside a few feet away and there's an occasional biter, but this thing is a lifesaver. This one hangs by the garage in the front. I'm buying another for the back. Love, love, love this killing machine. We are sitting outdoors, enjoying summer s'mores. Life is good.	1
Lots of reviews, I'll just add mine to the pile. I think it's great. We're in Florida. We have lots of bugs.. Mosquitoes, moths, flies, gnats. And we see the evidence of them every night when we turn on the security light next to the front door. Since installing the Flowtron, the cloud of flying insects has diminished considerably, or, at the very least, relocated to the unit. And I can tell by the zap... zap... zap... that it's working.  As an aside, on the first night after hanging it from the side of the utility shed, a found that a frog had attached itself to the wall below the unit. I guess it thought it had found a buffet...	1
Bought this for our cabin in northern Wisconsin. It gets plugged in at sunset and never stops zapping the whole night. Don't know yet if we're putting a dent in the Mosquito population but it's satisfying listening to them getting zapped!	1
I read a ton of negative reviews about this bug zapper. How it killed everything else but mosquitoes, how it got clogged up, how expensive it is to replace the bulb, how many beneficial bugs get killed, and so forth. I live in Houston, which is swampy and humid and a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. I also live in the middle of the city and we have no use for bugs around here, even in a 30-mile radius it is all an urban area. So I figured I could zap at will. I always had a problem with mosquitoes on my back porch. In the summer they would swarm around my pets and make them miserable. We had citronella candles, we have multiple porch fans, but nothing seems to stop the bloodsuckers. I installed the Flowtron zapper on a wall bracket about 15-20 feet from the porch. It kills a decent amount of bugs. The dead bugs look mostly like mosquitoes. The bad reviews said these were not actually mosquitoes but some other species which just looked like mosquitoes. In any case, I notice a significant reduction of my mosquito problem. I would even claim that I may have solved my mosquito problem for the time being. I also noticed that the zapper killed some drywood termites, which I take a bonus.  Note: A pretty serious design issue with this item is that the cord is only 6 inches long. I don't know why they did not include at least a 3' cord. It makes no sense. I had to run a special conduit and install an additional outdoor outlet to be able to plug it properly. Since it is outside, I would recommend a CGFI-protected outlet. I also installed an on/off switch for it on the inside of the house, so that I can conveniently turn on this lantern at night. Happy zapping.	1
Oh I'm in heaven. My first night without being attacked by bugs. I read the reviews and I knew I needed something heavy duty and strong as I'm in an open valley with a stream 20 feet away and full of flys, mosquitos and all kinds of bugs and it was driving me insane and ruining my evenings. You probably will need an extension cord with this as the cord is just a few inches but now i have one. Put it up today and NO BUGS. No Flys, mosquitos nothing and I help my neighbor. Actually I hear it going off right now. I've heard it's really important to clean this regularly. This is a major zapper and it's going crazy now.	1
I this is the third bug ZAPPER I have purchased, I bought the smaller model and I can only imagine the path the destruction the larger models would do.  This model from FLOWTRON actually ZAPS and fries the bugs,  you can see em glow and smoke which makes this not only practical but entertaining.  I got the Stinger equivalent model but it is silent and the bugs don't always die, I also got the stinger rechargeable & it does make the ZAP but it just won't run all night.  All of these need a chemical insert to attract mosquitos, I suggest if mosquitos bother you that you purchase a Thermacell mosquito repellant unit.  If you want to ZAP bugs especially the lawn munching kinds, get this one.	1
works pretty good not sure on the anti clogging feature though. turned it on and in 2 hours the thing was packed with insects to the point where it was smoking, so I just took leaf blower to it and its fine again overall works good keeps insects away	1
very convenient timer system on the zapper. heavy duty works extremely well just have to remember to clean the dead bugs off it every once in awhile because it does do the job well and they do cake on it. so i brush it once a week all of about 5 minutes	1
So, quick lil PSA, we have a small organic farm and usually these zappers and frowned upon because they kill a lot of the beneficial insects too. You need those beneficials to keep a lot of the bad guys in check. So, installing one of these can actually make your problem worse.  That having been said!! Most of our beneficials here are not attracted to this (ladybugs, bumblebees, etc).  This year our whole area (Northern Nevada) is having a major Army Moth problem. They are here in numbers that multiply any previous year. Is it the drought? Is it the lack of competition for food sources? Army moths eat pollen and nectar. And as of late the US is pretty much zilch on the butterflies and bees. Thanks Monsanto!  The moths themselves are not a threat to plants. But their little caterpillars WILL eat your garden!! Plus, we have honeybees for whom we painstakingly maintain pollen and nectar sources for and these moths are moving in and out competing the honeybees.  Back story in place, check. We have to get the moth numbers down. We started with a much smaller Stinger brand unit and it worked for about a week but was too small and quickly became overfull and less effective. We read more reviews and settled on what we have affectionately named, "The Big One." The grid is much larger, the ZAP sound is very satisfying, and the spaces between the plastic slats to the outer cage are big enough to allow the bigger bugs in -- like moths!  We originally set this under our roof eave near the house. We had power there and it was protected from the elements. But that meant our shinning beacon of bug zap-dom drew all the moths to us. We did have the sense to place a bucket under the zapper to catch the bodies so we could feed them to our chickens. MMMM moth BBQ. It took us a week or so to move the unit to the tree by the chicken coop. We now have basically no moths in and around the garden...and a constant tasty roasted snack supply for the chickens. Woot.  Go for this one. It's worth it.	1
This works very well to keep bugs away from my backyard patio.  It is a very high quality unit and works very well.	1
I have three of these working around the clock at different spots around the house.  Last year I couldn't go outside for more than 5 minutes without getting eaten alive.  This year I haven't gotten bit yet and I was even out while it was getting dark cutting my lawn.  I would say these work. My other two units have bigger lights but not sure that its necessary.	1
I feel this is a great value and it delivered as promised.  The complimentary ocetnol cartridge that was supplied does not lure Northern California mosquitos so don't buy additional cartridges.	1
Anywhwere you live with bugs, buy these. Works amazing. Buy the bug attract for extra emphasis. The bug attract has stayed on. Both came in perfect condition. I have one in front and one out back. Run them all night. Yes I have a significant cut in flies, mosquitos and blood suckers since these came in. At night I hear it frying things, sometimes for several seconds. I don't even want to know whats so big it takes that long to electrocute. Fields of dead bugs? Havent noticed any. Bugs clogging the screen? Nope! Maybe im paranoid about the initial bug population but yes this will put a big dent in the insect population.	1
Have had this up for about two weeks and it has done a fantastic job of sweeping the sky of pesky bloodsuckers!  I have about an acre which backs up to a large wooded area with creek and pond, and in the past as the weather warms up the pests begin to emerge.  This year decided to take proactive action and hung this up about the time the bugs get started.  After a couple of days, you could tell the difference.  Now in the evening you can sit out and have very few problems.  You must set it up per the instructions about 25' away from your sitting area to get the greatest results.  Very effective and seems bulletproof.	1
Set this baby up last night along with the mosquito attractor. I don't have mor ethen the one night so far to give for a review but it started zapping shortly after and me and my guest didn't get bit for once while we chilled outdoors. The blue light was brighter then I anticipated but not an issue. Everything was exactly as described. In case you didn't notice it is mad eof plastic not metal. the power cord is like 6 inches long so be sure to buy an extension cable, I also bought a timer for dawn to dusk, check out my reviews you can see which one im also sati=sfied but that is short also so you still will need an extension cord most likely.	1
Wow. Can hear the zaps from quite a distance. This thing really works. Have had other brands but this one is much better.	1
There's nothing quite as satisfying as striking a temporary blow to the teeming masses of the insect kingdom as you attempt to enjoy your outdoor space in the nice weather.  It doesn't seem to have any effect on the "nice" bugs, as nary a "lightning bug" has found its way to the juice as far as we can tell, and we have so many bugs even the neighborhood bats don't seem to notice we've taken a few out on our own.  Apologies to the insect kingdom, but this thing is the best.	1
This kills flies and moths well.  I still have the mosquitoes, even with the sticky papers. It handles the lawn sprinklers just fine. Replacement bulbs were pricey.	1
I found that store-bought ones by a different manufacturer to have very short lives. They quit within about one year. I don't mean the bulbs--they can be replaced.  I mean the complete units. So I ordered two of these Flowtron units--and they failed in just under a year. When they work, they're great--they zap tons of bugs. But...then they quit.	-1
I bought this specifically to rid my patio of mosquitoes ..to make a LONG story short....IT DOESNT work . I have just as many mosquitoes as I did before, it is loud , scares my dogs with the snapping noise when other bugs get caught . I would NOT recommend it to any one . Save your money and buy the mosquito coils , that  light with a match , from Dollar Tree ...much better and cheaper .	-1
Here on the High Plains of Colorado, we get infested with these damnable Miller Moths that can really mess up the house and are a great nuisance.  I bought this to try and clear the inside of the house at night, and it pretty well does.  Some moths are only stunned, but that makes squishing them a lot easier.  It is a bit loud, but that's not an issue for me and where I set it up.  I haven't notice any files yer.. there was one or two in the house, but I do not want to load up any smelly attractant to see, as flies aren't the problem I bought it for. Same for mosquitoes. If the attractant doesn't smell, I may give it a shot too.	1
Works great, this is a replacement for my old Flowtron which quit working after 10 years. If this one lasts like the old Flowtron  I will be happy.  I replaced the tube about once every two years.	1
Works great. Seemed small but does the job!  We had larger size in the past so we were pleased that it performs just as well as the larger ones.	1
I'M SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS "SHOCKING" UNIT, I MUST HAD KILLED OVER 100.000 BUGS IN A TWO WEEK TIME. LOVE IT.	1
Straight out of the box, this didn't work.  Yes, it sat in the box - inside our house, not in a garage - for a couple of months (not so many bugs out in November, when I bought it), but that shouldn't matter. I would love to return it, but of course it's past the return window. Live and learn. Won't be buying from Flowtron again.	-1
THIS BUG ZAPPER WORKS WITH OUT A PROBLEM, nice size hangs on a flower hook keeps the bugs on the porch under control with the yellow flood lite,  gets a spider or 2 also	1
This a great Insect Killer I am still evaluating it. I only have it up a short time. I will give it another judgement.	1
However I had to cut off some lames in order to make easier the entrance for the bigger ones there. to big deal and did it because they are hanged way out of kids reach	1
<div id="video-block-R2O5TIOKGMA55X" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BHdosf6jS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wHGfraicS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;I rarely give 5 stars but if this keeps working as well as it has out of the box, this summer should have a lot less pesky bugs flying around our back porch on those warm, summer nights.  I purchased the 1 Acre Coverage model because the smaller one was actually more expensive at the time plus it didn't seem like it would be as effective for my particular use. I have this plugged into a 50 feet, green outdoor quality extension cord and it is exactly 35 feet away from where we sit in the evening and night. (Never really planned it that way but that seems perfect so far) I have a 50 feet long row of hedges that stand a little over 4 feet tall and have been on my property for more than 45 years.  They are great to have and separate my yard from my neighbor's.  They are the perfect breeding ground for gnats, flies, mosquitoes or any type of bug that likes to bite you when you're trying to enjoy your evening.  Rather than spray poisonous insecticide on my hedges, because of obvious reasons I purchased this and within seconds after I plugged it in it started snapping the little critters. I don't have mine on a timer but instead I thought I'd use the remote control electric outlet that I used to turn on and off our outside Christmas lights.  (Hey, it works great plus I don't have to bend down and I can turn it off and on from inside my house if I want. Also had back surgery and bending is not good for me) The light is kinda brighter than I thought but that's actually good because it will attract more to it plus help even my neighbor's out. I do not plan on using this in the rain or even a light rain because it just makes more sense not to. Even if it doesn't hurt to I'm sure it will last longer if you take it out of the rainy weather if you think to. Not a hard thing to do plus a high wind might knock it down if not secured well.  I have mine on a Shepherds Hook that was used for a bird feeder in the winter. Sorry I got off the main subject but was trying to give you ideas on how to place the zapper since it works so well but yet you wouldn't want it drawing bugs to you but instead away.  The replacement bulb seems a little expensive too from what I seen so take care of the unit and do common sense maintenance on it and hopefully this will last for years, outside of buying those bulbs. I am trying to include a short video. Do not be afraid to purchase this bug zapper.  Unless it arrives broken or defective you will be very happy with the results.	1
Works great. Plugged it in across the yard so the bugs weren't coming to us. Zaps em constantly. But no matter how many of these you put up, bugs and skeeters will always get to you.	1
I love this thing. I love hearing all the bugs zap themselves into oblivion! It keeps the yard fairly clear of insects. Keep it away from where you will be spending time; it will have a swarm of bugs around it and can get kinda loud (big moths don't die immediately and can fly around burning for a bit...) sorry to put that image in your head but hey, it kills bugs.	1
Seems to work as good as other higher priced models. Make sure you get the mosquito attractant. Really attracts the mosquitos.	1
This works so well in getting rid of the mosquito's on the back deck area. I use the bait provided.	1
As I sit here listening to the sweet sounds of those menacing, miserable little flying  blood suckers being ZZZapped, I wanted to write a quick review.  I ordered this bug zapper because I was thoroughly disgusted being tormented by mosquitoes whenever I ventured into my backyard.  I've been doing extensive yard work over the last month or so and I have been bothered and bitten so much that I was desperate to find a solution.  I knew it would only get worse and worse as the summer progressed.  Early morning and evening ( really starting late afternoon) is of course the worst time.  Which coincidentally is the time gardening here in New Orleans is even remotely tolerable due to the heat and humidity.  I started carrying OFF spray with me and it helped....as long as I sprayed it as a shield around my body every 20 seconds, choking me and inhaling God knows what chemicals into my lungs.  I also rubbed all kinds of lotions over me that promise relief.  All of that helps but really it's just a band aid on a gunshot wound.  I wanted to try to eradicate the little suckers.  I came to Amazon looking for bug zappers.  I found this Flowtron with almost 2000 (!!) reviews with an average of almost 5 stars.  I ordered the one for 1/2 acre ( I just needed for my backyard which is about 50'x 150').  It came within a few days and I couldn't wait to plug the thing in.  It comes with one cartridge of Octenol and I stuck it the bottom of the zapper.  The instructions say not to place the zapper within 25 feet of human activity but we won't be outside much in the summer ( too hot and humid) so I ignored that instruction.  The cord is short so I used an extension cord and put it at the end corner of my patio on top of the BBQ pit.  It started zapping away at dusk and never stopped.  I couldn't wait to see the all the little corpses in the morning and I was not disappointed... I had nice little pile of dead bugs!  When we do brave the outside to the patio, I'll hang it from a shepherds hook out in the yard to avoid attracting the blood suckers near us.  Another benefit is that I don't have 50 bugs flying to my house as soon as I open my backdoor to let our 3 dogs out during the evening.  I unplug it in the morning and turn it on in the late afternoon.  I'm thinking I'll put a timer on it to make it easier.  If this thing lasts through the summer I will be ecstatic!  It's cheap enough that I'll be happy to pay $28 bucks every year to have a fighting chance in the battle of the bugs vs humans! I've only had it a week so we'll see if it lasts...like I said, if it can last a few months that is fine with me.  I'll update my review in a few weeks ......	1
Love this product! after 2 1/2 years I just replaced the original bulb. It does what it should and more!	1
have had this for over a year we even take when were camping the pile of dead critters is huge you can hear it zapping all night big bugs or tiny they are goners buy it saved 8 $ over local big box stores	1
Yes, this will zap those bugs every which way, its too early before they come in force to attack me	1
We have a huge bug problem on da island and this has been amazing!!!  Helped so much with the mosquito problem..	1
For instance, if you want the bugs off of your patio, do not install it on the patio.  Install it about 25 feet away, and you will be amazed at how well it works.	1
This one has one bulb (versus 2 in the larger units).. I've found that these last a couple of years with regular (daily) use.. My last one lasted about two years - and when it went out, the problem wasn't the bulb - it was the transformer in the top of the unit.  It runs silent (no audible humming from more than a few feet away).	1
1st I would not recommend this 2 anyone the bulbs are expensive & you have 2 buy only the light that fits 2 this sapper only which it did not last long always look for a bug sapper that has a ordinary blue light that twist right in...	-1
Best price i found for this was on amazon by far.  Works as described.  Really keeps mosquitoes out of my yard.  Just remember that this will also kill beneficial bugs too.	1
I have used this nightly for 2 years with no problems. I bought a second one for backup. Key is to hang away from house to attract bugs away. 30 second cleaning as needed every day when I turn it off.	1
How is it that appliances know just when the warranty is up? The product manual says it has a limited 2 year warranty. We bought it November 2011 and it lasted till January 2014. Checked the troubleshooting guide in the manual and first we ordered a replacement bulb which didn't make it work. Checked the outdoor GFI socket, it works fine. Its not the house fuse/breaker. Only thing left in the guide is the "starter", so we've determined that its broken. As to its performance while it did work, it was on nearly 24 hours a day for just over 2 years and it did its job well. Lots of bug zapping, mostly at dusk and all night. In the last couple months without, we've noticed a huge spike in skeeters! We are buying another one! If the next one lasts as long, that works out to $15 a year in bug control. (if the bulb lasts too) You can spend that in a snap on lots of other ways to kill bugs, so we will stick with this. We already have a spare bulb!	1
This is the second one I have ordered.  They other lasted a full season before the bulb burned out.  Turns out the cost of a replacement bulb is about 70% of the cost of a new unit.  Since the electronics were exposed to the elements for a year, it doesn't make sense to purchase a bulb and find out the unit is kaput.  It works, I just replaced it.  I DO THINK THE BULBS COULD BE CHEAPER - unless, of course, it is technically better to just replace the whole thing.	1
This was purchased to replace the same model of twenty five years, which got rusted and failed.  My fault, for letting it get wet.  As before it kills anything which bumps against the electrodes. ZAP!!! They're  gone or at least French fried beyond reconnection. After reading many of the of the reviews it was apparent that killing Miskito's is only accomplished if the bait container is touching the lamp at the bottom of the unit.  ( Square indentation below the lamp at the bottom of the unit )  Warming the bait container is, in my opinion, the secret to vaporizing the contents and attracting the little buggers.	1
This thing kills some bugs! I have been very pleased with how this machine attracts and kills. The moths are extremely attracted to this thing, but it also gets the mosquitoes which is why I bought it. There are Definetly fewer blood suckers in the back yard now.	1
This bug zapper is amazing.  Anywhere I put it outside has a pile of dead bugs under it the next morning.  I am ordering the 1.5 acre one next and putting one on each end of the property.  Its a shame to have to move them so far away from view though because it sure is fun to watch and hear the annoying bugs get zapped.  My 3 year old loves it!	1
I give it one star for people who want to know what it DOESN'T do.  It doesn't control mosquitoes.  Had it for months, with an octenol cartridge - and there was no effect on our backyard - which is small.  Killed plenty of harmless bugs though - ones that are good for birds and other pleasing backyard animal life.  So - if you are covered in swarming critters - it might do the job.  If mosquitoes are your problems - hope they bring DDT back soon.	-1
worked great! Kind of a pain to get apart and clean out though. this one you actually get to hear 'em FRY!	1
We hear the zap zap zap all evening, so we know it's getting those pesky insects. Just make sure that this is away from your house or porch or whatever because the bugs are attracted to it and you don't want to be sitting near it!	1
Although mosquitoes not heavily infesting area, we do have some.  The bug light attracts and kills them.  I will reevaluate when we get later into Soring.	1
We love this bug zapper!  It works great and is made very well. I bought one for my son too and he loves it!	1
We live in Tidewater Virginia, and the mosquitoes last year were terrible although the city sprayed.  The back yard was nearly unusable, and they were so numerous that many made it into the house as well.  The Flowtron unit was so effective that it was actually funny.  The first few nights, it popped nearly nonstop.  When the activity slowed, I moved it to the opposite corner of the house with a different field of view, and the nonstop popping resumed.  We still had a few mosquitoes, of course, but we weren't guaranteed a bite if we were outside for 20 minutes.  I should add here that I think the bait helped a lot, enough that I plan to continue using it even if there is a little expense involved. If you've ever been hounded by mosquitoes, you'll understand my glee when I noticed a fine, grey filament dust on a rock at the base of the unit--dead mosquitoes.  Also, this is just anecdotal, but it seemed to do an especially good job on Asian Tiger mosquitoes, the ones that raise such big itchy welts.  They disappeared after I bought this.  I know that some sources say these units don't work, but it helped us.	1
These are small enough to sit on a coffee table (or such) indoors and control moths at night.  It is too bright to sleep with, of course, but it wouldn't presumably be on in the same room while you're sleeping.  It is flat on the bottom and is reasonably stable.  But the chord is ridiculously short, so an extension chord is almost certainly required (unless you sit it right next to a power strip). That is the only reason for subtracting one star.	1
The Flowtron Insect killer has brought the mosquito population in our yard under control. At one time we could hardly walk out the door without being attacked. Now there are a few but they don't last long. The unit clears the large yard of most of the mosquitoes and is easy to clean after the fact by blowing it with a leaf blower. Worth every penny invested in it.	1
I haven't had this very long, so I'm unable to comment on how well it knocks down the mosquito population, but I do know that it puts off enough light that it should blind them at the least.  I'm looking forward to seeing how well it works.	1
Great price for a medium sized zapper! Seems to do the job killing mosquitoes too! I hope the bulb last awhile!	1
It works.  It kills insects.  It doesn't kill all the mosquitoes. They are small enough that they can fly through it. However, I placed this away from my patio. Therefore, the insects are attracted to it instead of me and my guests.  My girl friend was willing to sit outside since she wasn't being eaten alive:-)	1
It was in use for half a summer season and then it just quit.  No one could figure it out. So it hangs there non working and I use the cheap one on the deck that I have.	-1
Great bug light.  My dad lights it up every night for the last three summers - makes good bird food they LOVE it.	1
Can't say enough good about this unit. I did a LOT of research before buying one and have to say i'm very happy with this choice. It make a big difference on our back porch so long as you follow the directions. You want it mounted AWAY from where you're relaxing so it attracts the insects away from you. This thing zapps them non-stop. Sometimes we just sit on the back porch and laugh at zap after zap. :)	1
Used this at a party for my daughters birthday and seemed to work great, we had no complaints from our guests outside about bugs, flies, mosquitos, etc. the backyard area was about 4000-5000 sq ft. and we're backed up to a greenbelt too.	1
This thing makes piles of bugs under it.  If the house gets too infested here near the lake, I take it inside and let the pile up begin.	1
This thing fries the bugs. We live in mosquito country so it can't do a bang up job with the flying devils but it does a good enough job all the way around. Catches a lot of annoying moths, stink bugs and flies. We have kept in on more often than not for over a year and it is still going strong. I am happy enough to give it 5 stars.	1
Mosquito bites drive me crazy, and it's a short drive, so I got this bug zapper to hang on the front porch for when I'm working on things out there, and each time I hear the "Zap!", I smile.  I even bought an extra bulb because I'd hate to run out of ammo right in the middle of a bug fight.  I live in the woods, in a log cabin (honest) and the bugs around here are pretty relentless sometimes and this thing really does the trick for me.	1
BZZZZZTTTT.... ZAP ZAP.  Dead bugs all over the place.  I didn't use any of the mosquito attractant packs or anything but this thing does get rid of all the bugs around that are flying around if you have any lights on outside.  Its fun to catch beatles and throw them into the zapper  :D	1
My back garden was infested with mosquitoes, and it was not possible to enjoy it in the morning or evening hours. I hung the insect killer in the back garden yesterday afternoon. This morning- no mosquitoes, not even one!!! It was highly effective for the 1/4 acre lot. Packaging excellent, delivery very prompt, received within 2 days! Really pleased.	1
easy to setup however the power cord is a bit short (10") it does the work, zapping the flies, mosquitoes and bugs away	1
I was shocked by how many bugs this device captured! Has made our pier tolerable without having to use bug spray. My husband hung it slightly over water so fish would be attracted!!	1
This gets the job done.  Bugs were killing us over summer and this helped a bunch.  We used it outside and inside.  It buzzes a bit loud for inside, but better that than mosquitoes.	1
This replaced a Stinger brand 80 watt Bug zapper bought new the previous year that didn't last longer than 20 days. Started with one tube, then a loud pop and the whole thing quit. Sent it to the manufacture and they told me it was hit with a surge. I don't see how, it was plugged into a surge protector. So I got the Flowtron, bit more pricey but it survived the entire summer without a problem. And unlike the Stinger brand, this does not clog up. Best of all - it's AMERICAN MADE!!	1
Rating based on my opinion and product use. The rating needs to be a drop down only and not require someone to write an additional response. You will get better data with the multiple choice questions.	1
Had it for a year now, never fails. Lotsa dead bugs including no see ums.	1
I love hearing the zap zap zap.  Have been using this thing in South Florida for over a year now, and left it out to brave quite a few storms, and it's still going on strong.	1
Kills mosquitoes at the best value too...and is still going strong after years of use....better than that 'stinger' brand I bought which after a month, two that I bought at a local hardware store had stopped working...Coverage is great on my front yard a whole 170 by 180 foot area.	1
Nice when they work,  They don't seem to last all that long.  They do a great job of killing all the small insects .	1
Works absolutely wonderfully. Even use it indoors in our shop (without the scent) We will use it all the time.	1
I was so happy to find an affordable insect killer living in a place that is infested with mosquitos every summer. I hung the Flowtron next to my chicken coop and near the above-ground pool where I am certain there was plenty. I loved turning it on every evening to hear those mosquitos get zapped away. I can say that I saw an obvious reduction of pests in my backyard, but they weren't completely gone. I used an old dry toothbrush to clean the metal grate when it would get blocked up with carcasses. But many did end up on the ground and I think my chickens enjoyed the treat when I let them roam.  I wish there was a way for the cicadas to not meet their death in there as it sounds very scary when they are frying in there.  I did not give it 5 stars because the product arrived broken. Some of the plastic on the bottom was broken off and was unable to fix, but it did not effect the functionality of the zapper, so I did not return it.	1
Works very well and definitely zaps the bugs.  Reasonably easy to clean.  I was able to place it easily where I needed to attract the bugs and it worked very well.	1
Works great! Draws all of the flying bugs away from our pool area and down the hill. Makes our time outside more enjoyable. The evidence is on the ground - pile of dead bugs.	1
Finally a bug zapper that lasts longer than 3 months.  I got tired of returning them to the big box stores.  It never failed, I went through three of them.  This one works great and lasted all year.  It does not have a photocell, so I'd recommend a timer.  I ran mine dusk to dawn.  Even without the mosquito bait it killed a ton of them.  They were over powering this year though.  I could not help myself but smile a little every time I heard it 'ZAP' :)	1
VERY CHEAPLY made.  Arrived broken.  The outer housing is a soft plastic and bends all over the place.  Mine was so easily deformed that one side was broken off, so the outer housing was hanging on with only one anchor.  Furthermore, the electronics, when plugged in, did not work.  My recommendation is to go to the local hardware store and get one.  The low price of this makes it look like a great deal, but it is just money thrown away.  It arrived in a nice box and packaging with NO evidence of damage, so I am not sure how it was broken.	-1
This works great. I had the previous version which had small openings for the insects to get in, but that issue was fixed in this version. It would be nice to have some sort of control built into this (timer, switch, light sensor and etc.)	1
I had a bad mosquito/moth problem in my yard during the summer, partially because I have a lot of trees.  This solved a lot of the problem and made it bearable to sit outside again.  I also saved quite a bit of money by purchasing on amazon	1
It was inexpensive and works well we call it the West Virginia Entrainment center .  We use it in central Florida were the bugs are killer this time of year	1
This kills bugs.  When larger insects, such as moths fly into this insect killer, it zaps the life out of them.  When the larger bugs fly into it, the zapping noise lasts for five or ten seconds.  I hate bugs, so I enjoy hearing the long zaps.  With each zap, that's one less bug flying around in my house.  Yes, I keep it indoors.  Not an issue until a lot of zapping starts taking place.  Then you've got a bit of a smell problem, but I'd rather have the smell of burnt bugs than the bugs flying around inside.	1
So far works good.  the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star, is that it doesn't have a bug catcher on the bottom.  A small removable plate or something would have worked.  If its outside, not a problem, but I have it in my garage since we were having mosquitoes get in our garage and eating our kids.  After a good night, I have a pile of dead bugs on my floor I have clean.  I usually just blow them out with the blower, but a $.25 piece of square plastic on the bottom to catch them would have made it great.	1
Ok well this thing fries insects all night long.  Fun to watch and quality seems good.  Not sure about it's effectiveness against mesquites but it fries anything it touches.  It cleaned up with water no problem.	1
Seems to work pretty well. Have only used it three times so far. I think the one acre coverage claim is a tad overstated	1
This is my second bug zapper unit.  The first one died after two seasons but given its reasonable cost, I didn't mind replacing it.	1
I am with a very small number of reviewers here that I have to wonder how this silly thing got that many positive reviews. I have a small backyard, but was constantly attacked by mosquitoes everytime I went out. I have no standing water or what so ever. My neighbors might, but this thing is supposed to cover an whole acre.  I followed the instruction, hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go. Oh, I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom. A few zaps here and there, but nothing spectacular. I left it on out there for a week, and saw no difference. Still got attacked by mosquitoes. Two weeks, same thing. After a month, I gave up and took it down. There is no point to waste electricity. Oh, it served one purpose: light up that corner of the yard some.  So, don't waste your hard-earned money on this thing and electricity. I am almost sure you will be disappointed. This thing will go on my next trip to Goodwill.	-1
Was a bit skeptical  of any 'bug zapper'.  Bought this Flowtron after reading reviews on other brands.  Took it camping; hung it from the camper and also a tree.  Worked beautifully for a 'bug free' evening by the campfire.  Pretty entertaining, too ;)	1
Have been using for 2 years now with no problems.  Does not clog up like many other brands, kills bugs and especially mosquitos like crazy.  Noticeable difference in number of bugs around the house.  Best way to use this is to place somewhere at least 100ft from your house, to attract the bugs AWAY from your home and zap 'em.	1
The last bug zapper I had I could never tell if it was working.  This one works extremely well and covers a wide area.  I'm actually able to sit out on my patio and enjoy the evening without worrying about unwanted bugs!  Would definitely recommend.	1
Had one for many years. Dropped it while cleaning and completely trashed the plastic cage frame. Looking forward to many years of a great bug fryer.	1
Lol...I absolutely hate mosquitos and little biting flying bugs, so, in order to sit outside and enjoy the outdoors, I need the bugs to go away. Since they won't go away, a bug zapper needs to be employed. Sorry bugs, I tried to reason with you, and tell you to go away, but you won't, so, I hung up that there Flotron. Seriously though, great product, fast shipping, and I'm very happy.	1
It kills flying insects and bugs but you should use bait for best results. It also clogs. It could also catch fire if you don`t clean it. Keep it 3 ft.away from the house. The smell could reach 5 ft. Spiders will spin webs on it then fry themselves. It killed a large praying mantis. Mount it in the air. A replacement bulb runs $10 or more so keep that in mind. I had the earlier version of the BK-80D programmable and it fried the bulbs too fast. Replacement bulbs were $28. However it did seem to kill more bugs. The newer BK-80D seems to be an improvement and worth the purchase. The bulb is only about $15. Shop Wal-Mart first.	1
Best few bucks I've spent, hours of cheap entertainment. Bugs have been bad this year for some reason, so time to wack 'em with the big weapons. This ain't your Walmart bug zapper, this is a GOOD one. Quality build, and an incredibly satisfying ZAP noise whenever one of the pests goes to meet the Maker. Hilarious. It has definitely cut down the population of the skeeters. they are still there, but probably 75% reduced from previous. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS: -Place AWAY from where you set out -Don't spray it with water!! -Cleat it off with a light knock & compressed air from time to time	1
Can't speak to the 1 acre coverage, but, it does the job for the back deck. Not as loud as other bug zappers we've had and that's a good thing.	1
I have a Flowtron and a Stinger. The Flowtron gets packed full of burnt up bugs quicker. It has been running in the rain for several weeks now and on it's third season. Just ordered a new bulb.	1
I needed a replacement.  I normally buy refurbed ones from Flowtron for more money.  These look new and worked fine.	1
So I'm going to keep this short. I'm through one season with the Flowtron. I've been useing it in combination with two packs of octanol which i have been changing regularly. The mosquitoes arn't gone, but I have definitly seen a decrease in their numbers. I plan on useing it again next season.	1
This zapper is fabulous, of quality construction.  I had a terrible moth problem at my back door.  The moths were attracted to the outside, back-door light.  When I opened the door to let the dogs out, swarms of moths would fly into the house. I could not just turn the light off because it is dark as a cave and spooky back there.  I placed the zapper about 25 feet away per instructions.  This zapper lures the moths and zaps them.  I now keep my regular back-door light on, and the moths are not interested anymore.  They go directly to the zapper.  This excellent product has wide grid openings so the bugs can easily get in.  The numerous electric zappers inside are vertical so the dead bugs fall off easily.  A little bit of wind takes care of blowing the dead bugs out.  I am ordering another one for my front door area !!	1
This is a great item that attracts bugs and zaps them dead.  I bought it for the mosquitoes.  I have noticed a lot of dead mosquitoes but it really didn't solve my mosquito problem.  I give it 5 starts because it attracts bugs and zaps them dead.  I think this is a good supplement for insecticides.	1
We have had a very wet summer here in Georgia and the bugs have been horrible. This was a great price for what you get and does the job.	1
I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this model.  This is a great value for the $.  Highly recommend.	1
I bought this "Zapper" based mostly on Rick V.'s review. We had an older zapper that wasn't helping, but I had tried everything else.  We have a 2000+ gallon pound that we love, it turns our suburban yard into a wildlife refuge and is a constant thing of beauty! We have dealt with mosquitoes for years though, and I couldn't figure out the solution. We used "Mosquito Dunks" which killed the frog larvae, although the mfgr says not, but no frogs anymore, and after 2 years, they didn't cause a drop in mosquito population. We adhered strictly to the theory that moving water doesn't allow larvae to grow, but although I also religiously checked the yard for standing water and made sure the pond water was always moving, we had an intense problem. After 2 years of not being able to have barbeques and even with every bug repellant and many citronella and mosquito coils still had a big problem (two of our kids are the type that "attract" mosquitoes. Must have good blood!) and even neighbors had complained, but not to us. :(   When I read Rick V's review, I had to try this.   I did exactly what he and the manufacturer suggested, put the zapper about 15' out from the patio, and plugged it in about 5PM. The first night, the ground was littered with bodies, maybe not as dramatic as his, but nice. I hated that I might catch some moths and Praying Mantis and other beneficial bugs, but got over it when I remembered the last time we tried to talk on the patio, and what misery it was.   After about a week, the mosquito population was down enough that I could work on the pond or yard without having to constantly smack the little monsters. After two weeks we started sitting on the patio! What bliss!   I have been using the zapper every other night now that the mosquitoes are mostly gone. I have my son go out and let me know if they are back. I haven't had this kind of success with ANY other method of mosquito control!  Oh yes, we have burned citronella  torches, used garlic granules, tried a  number of pesticides, which I hate to use, as the chemical companies have to recall their products often due to adverse effects like killing species of fish (runoff) causing algae blooms that kill creatures necessary to the ecology and so on. We put up a Bat House, but never had any tenants. I also bought 50 Mosquito Fish off of Ebay, they don't seem to like our mosquitoes. I would say there are about 500 by now. They enjoy the pond, though.   So if you have a mosquito problem, read Rick V,'s review and try this great Flowtron zapper!  Update: 7/1/2015  Not working. I can't figure out the problem, but we are losing the battle, no, actually the war. The Flowtron is zapping moths, which I don't want to kill, and the mosquitoes aren't interested. I bought the bait from Zoror.	1
I estimate that this thing has reduced the bug population in my backyard by at least 80%.  We used to have beetles and moths crawling all over our back door and window, and usually one or two would get in each time we let the dog out at night.  Well, after about two weeks of having this thing set up, we've seen a huge difference. I built a small stand out of 2x2 pressure treated lumber.  Cost me about $4 to make.  And I hooked it up to a photocell timer (like this one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Woods-2001-Outdoor-24-Hour-Mechanical-Outlet-Timer-with-Light-Sensor/dp/B00002NB2X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Woods 2001 Outdoor 24-Hour Mechanical Outlet Timer with Light Sensor</a>) that we usually use during Christmas-time.  I have the zapper turn on at sunset and run for 6 hours each night. I've had to clean it a few times because it's been so clogged with dead bugs. That "zzzzzzap" sound is so satisfying.  Totally worth it.	1
I got this to take care of the black flies that were coming from having chickens in the backyard. It worked OK until the bulb went out only after a month and a half if that. Now I have to spend almost 15 dollars for another bulb. Not very happy with that. I would go with another company that uses better bulbs if I were you. Will be writing another review on KnittingwithOlof.com	-1
Updated 12/4/2015:  this was my second one.  The first lasted almost two years. This one just went out after 4 months.  I'm going to try to guy a new bulb (only because it's cheaper than the entire unit) to see if this works.  I sure hope so.  Purchase in August:  I moved into a new home and the mosquitoes were a nightmare.  This insect killer works better than I had even hoped for.  My sister is so convinced that she is buying one for her home as well.	-1
Powerful enough to fry the crap out of our biggest winged pests termite.  I have noticed a decline in the mozzie population.  Could just be the season.  It won't do a thing for flies.  What should I do to kill those?	1
Cord is only 8 inches long. Replaced cord so I don't need a extension. Stinger I had lasted 11 years and had a 4 foot cord. We will see how long this lasts.	1
This product was broken on arrival.  The outer plastic grill was broken at one of the screw attachment points, two clips supposed to keep the grill in place do not lock into the metal top because the plastic grill is warped, so the grill is dangling by one screw.  The plastic grill is the only part that keeps you from touching the high-voltage grid and it's about to fall off.  I will not plug the product in, because it is hazardous in this condition.  A note in the package says not to contact the store for warranty problems, but to call the factory directly, we'll see how that works.  May improve the rating if I get a good response from factory (or vendor).  UPDATE- Called Flowtron today, described the problem, their rep immediately offered to send me a replacement plastic grill.  We'll see how fast that happens and how easy it is to replace the part.	-1
Wow wow and wow! First night we turned on it zapped like crazy, left on over night and next morning looked like a BEARD!  I got this as a gift and he is thrilled. Works great. Just need to find a good price of the bait traps on bottom of unit.. Thanks	1
The unit is certainly getting a workout after the wet summer.  I have not had any issues with the unit becoming clogged.  I used a timer to save the unit from operating during the day to limit electricity use and save the bulb life.  An unintended consequence of this unit was that I was able to light up a fairly dark area in our yard that gives an added sense of security.  I would recommend.	1
This product really gets mosquitoes,  especially when used with the attractant.  We can finally be in our yard without being bit by bugs!	1
It is definitely killing bugs, becasue I hear it, but I don't think the insect population in my yard has been reduced any.  But I'm still positive.	1
I have this an my wine barrel fountain on a dusk to dawn timer and it has worked great so far! I will see how much I like it when it comes to replacing bulbs, but I'm very happy with it as of now.	1
received this yesterday and installed it. it replaced an old one by flowtron I have had for 10 years. this one is for 1 acre and the light appears to be very intense. it was zapping last nite.	1
So it is doing a good job both out near the deck and also down in the garage. It does attract and kill probably 90% of the flying stuff around. However stuff are getting clogged a lot and cleaning it isn't a very joyful task.	1
I put in north side of my back yard, and I did see it killed many bugs. Now I put in in the south side garden hoping it to kill those insects which bite my veges.	1
I just threw away one of these  that I've had for over twenty years. I later found out that what I thought was an electrical issue, was really only a bulb gone bad. Well, anyway, I bought a new one and it looks a lot better than the old one, and seems to work just as well. Not sure just how many mosquitoes it's killing, but there's a pile of insects on the deck below it every morning.	1
This zapper is the most low maintenance zapper out there at a great price.  I have it on a timer that turns it on at dusk and off after dawn.  It has even helped with the garden by killing the buggies that would otherwise snack on my fruits/veggies.  I don't even use the chemical for it and I've noticed a HUGE reduction in the mosquito population (not to mention free protein for the chickens!) I've used it the last half of the past summer and didn't have to clean it out at all as all the bugs fall right through the trap.  Yay!  Like others have said, keep it away from hang out areas as it does ATTRACT before it can kill.	1
I had a Stinger 40 watt zapper until ir died after about 4 years, and always had problems with bugs sticking and clogging up the square grids. I would have to blow it out all the time with an air compressor or it would sometimes smoke heavily and even have small fires.  No such problem with the Flowtron 80 watt zapper. The straight up and down electric grid design is far superior. No clogging problems at all. Bug get zapped and fall straight down and in the morning there is a nice pile of fried bugs on the ground which my chickens love to gobble up. I have had a few nights where the humidity has been very high here and a fem bugs have clung to the electric grid but a slight tap on the zapper the next day and they just fall off and out. The 80 watt output (two 40 watt bulbs) put out lots of UV light which really draws in the bugs to their demise. The octenol lures are very strong, much stronger than the one I used to get for the Stinger zapper and really draw in the Mosquitos. Mosquitos seem to love me and will find me in a crowd, but with the Flowtron on and the octenol lures in it I don't get bothered by those blood suckers anymore. Only design change I would want is a photocell which would turn it on at dusk and off at dawn but I think I can purchase one that will plug into the power outlet which will solve that otherwise happy to plug and unplug for now. Also be sure and follow directions and place at least 25 feet from your deck or patio so bugs get drawn to it and not to where you are. It will draw bugs to there doom, seems to always be a cloud of bugs around it until it kills them all off in the area. Best bug zapper there is in my opinion.	1
I ordered it, they shipped it, its doing a great job, what more can I say. Should have ordered two, much better than the ones that walmart sells.	1
when installed as instructed it does what it claims to do.  Zap bugs.  I live in the woods and the zapper fills up in 2-4 days with dead bugs.	1
My only complaint is that is makes a low humming sound. My Bug Zappers in the past were totally quite. Seems to be doing it's job.	1
So far so good, has drastically reduced mosquitoes, don't know if it is the attractant or the device but it works. The attractant is not inexpensive and I have seen mixed reviews on it so I am a little confused. Hard to put some science behind it without a lot of with/without testing which I will likely not do. Bottom line, with the attractant in it I have far fewer mosquitoes.	1
So the start of the summer, young kids get eaten. Wife gets attacked endlessly. In comes Flowtron 1-acre. More then what I need technically.  I managed to set this up off center of my yard. After the first night myself and my whole family have not had a mosquito bite since.been 45-60 days now. Seriously. Not one. Completely took out entire hordes in a 2 day period. Still going strong. I turn on a dusk and off in morning.  I used to see swans in the air at dusk in certain areas... Not. Any. More.  Worth every penny.	1
The bulb on my old Flowtron Mosquito zapper went out, so I purchased this new one not knowing they also just sell the bulb for my old model, I believe.  Amazon doesn't say what model the Dark UV CFL is for so I have no way of knowing.  I didn't hear as many zapping sounds with this Flowtron as I did with my old Flowtron.  However, when I checked the zapper after a week, I did notice a lot of dead bugs, mosquitos, inside the octenol lures.  The light blue color UV CFL does not seem to be as effective as the old dark purple color UV CFL bulb.  I'm not sure if they are compatible with both models, I do not believe they are.  Overall, it works, but as good as the older model, eehh.	1
So far the Flowtron bug killer has worked very well.  I used the Stinger bug zapper for several years, but had to purchase a new one every year since the Stinger electronic would play out each year.  Hopefully the Flowtron will last longer than a year.  Well it is less than 3 months and the bulb went out. Now, I would Rate it as 1-Star.	-1
We have a B&B and a farm.  We didn't want bugs on the deck while guests were out nor did we like all the flies that were in our barn this year.  We placed the unit, as directed, 25 feet from the deck and also in line with the barn door so it would pull the bugs out of it at night.  The first day we saw a lot of dead bugs.  Still, we had flies in the barn.  The next day, the unit was so full of bugs we thought it had burnt out! It hadn't.  The barn was almost cleared of flies!  By day three, we can actually stand in the yard and on our deck without being chased into the house!  Twilight is bug time, as we have ours on a dawn to dusk timer.  Once it goes on and is dark enough, the deck is virtually bug free.  Several people cut out the grate to let moths in.  We didn't.  We have had several species gathered around the unit in the morning, including several luna moths. My garden in now filled with colorful moths that come at night to the light and stay for the flowers in the day!	1
This has to be the best bug zapper on the market. I loved it so much. that I bought two more for family members. They love it also. My sister told me she can now enjoy going outside again without having mosquito bites all over her body. My other sister gave it to her son who was having a huge mosquito problem in his backyard. He said his wife and children could not enjoy their pool because they would be eaten  alive, and at night forget about ever going outside. Well with this zapper they are able to enjoy the outdoors again. The price is great for the results we are getting, and even better we are not spraying poison all around anymore. The poison did not work anyway. Buy it, use it, and you will be amazed.	1
it is working just fine .  no problems.  it was right on time.  it does what it said it would do.	1
I used it for a couple of days and can feel the difference. It killed so many insects every night. Very effective.	1
The reviews for this were somewhat mixed but good overall.  In use, it actually kills many moths and few mosquitoes.  When I searched to order a second attractant cartridge (it comes with one, but there are slots for 2), there were reviews for this product under the attractant that were less favorable than under the actual product.  I am/was using the largest model.	-1
Just remember to follow the 25' rule and don't sit right next to it. Keep it out of the weather. otherwise this zapper works great. Coming from south Louisiana that's saying alot.	1
This bug zapper works wonderful.  When we turn it on at night, we stand there and watch for the bug to come.  In the morning the grill is full of fried bugs.  We purchased this bug zapper because we could not see any bats flying around in the evening.	1
Not what i thought it was. didn't know it was an A/C powered unit. Was expecting a battery operated unit.	-1
Fast service This is ridiculous to fill out all of these boring words of non wisdom. four more words to go. yea I did it.	1
The Flowtron works well in our place. We had a lot of mosquitoes this year and that prevented us from being outside. Once we set it up it attracted and killed a lot of the bugs. It got full of the bugs but didn't have to worry about it. They all fell to the ground eventually.	1
Flowtron electronic insect killers are very well made to last for many years , and work flawlessly. We had one at our last house and left it there. Bought this one and can sit out at night again.	1
-- Update 6/10/2014.  So before a year in service, the device died.  I initially thought it was the bulb and blew $30 to buy two new bulbs to figure out it was a mystery fuse. There is a unlabeled fuse that blew in the device and I can't seem to figure out what amperage it may be to replace it. It does not look like a serviceable part because it is soldered to the wires covered with tape. I'm not afraid to cut it out and replace it if I could just figure out what it was. Frustrating.  Here's my original review:  Pros: It works. Cons: Still need to clean bugs off.  I purchased a dusk to dawn sensor to go along with this so it'll only turn on at night. The device works really well, but bugs still get stuck on the kill rods. It not that big of a deal - I use a leaf blower to periodically clean the device. I think it has to do with the type of bugs. The dominate type of flying bugs in my area appear to be moths -- which seem to come very large. Perhaps if it were killing smaller mosquito sized bugs, the sticking issue would probably be less of a problem.	-1
Works very well.  I set it up about 25' from my entrance door under a carport.  Draws bugs in with the light and kills them away from my entry door.  Does a very good job.  We live in Louisiana so there are lots of bugs flying around.  Highly recommend this zapper.	1
this item has survived fierce weather without problem. it works well attracting mosquitos and moths, but not totally eliminating mosquitos, see my  review of flowtron ma-1000-6 attractant cartridges	-1
Well it does work.  There are bugs being killed.  But if you expect this to sit off in the corner of your yard while you sit on the deck but free, don't buy it.  I purchased a cheap dusk to dawn plug in sensor for it and let it go to work.  I have heard the gasps of friends when they found out I bought this.  People seem to have had many bad experiences with bug zappers but so far this has worked very well and doesn't make much of a mess. One caveat is that the mosquito attractant seems useless.  If that is your main culprit, I might recommend getting some the old "PIC" insect rings and burning a few of those.  We burn one each night we are out with the bug zapper.	1
STOPPED ZAPPING! I set it up and plugged it in and it zapped bugs like crazy. 30 minutes later I went back out to the yard and everything was suspiciously silent. The bulb was on...bright as when I first turned it on. Bugs were still buzzing all around it, but the zapping noise had completely stopped. Upon closer inspection, I saw insects crawling around the grid with impunity. I'll take a closer look in the daylight, but for now I'm very disappointed.  UPDATE: I took it apart today. Fairly simple affair. Doesn't seem to be much to go wrong. Couldn't figure out why that little transformer wasn't electrifying the grid. Tried to call the 800 number they tell you to call first before sending the unit back. That's when I found out that customer service ends at 4:30 PM. I was too late. You would think their customer service works on an early evening shift considering that anyone running into a problem with this thing would do so AFTER sunset. VERY FRUSTRATING!  UPDATE: I'm upping my rating from one to three stars. Flowtron IS responsive if you leave a message with a call back number. The RMA procedure was quick and easy (kudos to Amazon on that). The replacement unit is up and zapping. It's killing everything that flies into it. Don't know yet how much of the casualty rate consists of mosquitoes.  UPDATE: Back down to one star. The replacement unit lasted two evenings before the grid stopped AGAIN. I wanted so badly for this to work. I'm giving this thing one last try.	-1
It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.	1
....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em.	1
I purchased this a year ago and still rave about it. It kills and kills and keeps on killing--This is a great machine which will kill the crap out of bugs---just great	1
I received my Flowtron BK-15D shipment on the 5 July (order on the 2 July). Had the device out of the box and into its temporary place (awaiting Achia TSW-37 91 single pole for hanging) at 3pm. Turn device on and left it running until 7:30pm. Enjoyed a bug free afternoon on my recently renovated patio. I highly recommend this product for those looking to purchase a bug zapper that works as advertise and doesnt cost over $50 dollars.	1
Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood. lol.  We have a pool and a pond, along with wetlands on our property, so we simply have a lot of bugs.  This thing is working constantly while it is on.  The zapping can get quite loud, but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck, and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer, as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short, so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.  I hung mine on  a trellis, but if you don't have something to hang it from, you may need a sturdy stand...this things is pretty massive, and has some weight to it.	1
I had this for 3 weeks and it was actually on turned on only a half dozen times and stopped working.	-1
I bought this insect killer to replace the one I received from my Mom after my Dad died in 1992. I don't know how long he had it, but it worked fine for me for another 20 years, with one bulb replacement. I have it hanging in my garage and there are NO insects in my garage.	1
We got one of those since June 2011 (flowtron BK-15D, 1/2 acre). It works as a charm, best killing machine ever. I forgot to put up this years but I can not go to the backyard because of the mosquitos. Daisy want to play, Bill want the back door close because of flies and mosquitos. Just found the unit in the utility room and place outside and the mosquitos and flies started to fall dead immediately. I am ordering another one to place in the front door (flowtron BK-40D 1 acre). If you live in Florida, this is a must. Personal note: Try to leave away from where your bees are. Any fly insect seems to be attract to this thing. Nani	1
I purchased one of these for my backyard that is about 1/2 acre and has lot's of foliage and a koi pond.  I built a stand for it and placed it about 20' from our patio, on the oppsite side of the koi pond and it seems to work very well.  It utilze's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light.  There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars, the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there isn't sufficient insect left (burnt up) to continue the arc.  Generally this is a fairly quick process (ZAP) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is "gone" to break the arc.  Maybe it's morbid - I enjoy hearing the zap and the occasional sizzzzzzzzle because that is one less nusuance bug to bite my family, my guests or my dog.  I can whole heartedly recommend this product!	1
First off, this bug zapper WORKS AWESOME!!!!! Is it clog proof like it says, NO!!!!! For the average yard it probably is but when you are killing 10-20 bugs per second (yes per second) it has no choice but to plug, I live in the country, and after a month of every day rain equals lots of bugs. I am about to purchase at least 2 more, not sure which size yet but mine is 10+ years old and have never replaced anything. If you are looking for a bug zapper this thing WORKS!!!! UPDATE!! 7-6-13 I bought one more 1/2 acre and a 1.5 acre. The Bk-80d (1.5 acre) is a BUG SLAYING MACHINE!!!! I believe this this is as close to being clog proof as any bug zapper on the market. Like I said earlier the bk-15d is absolutely NOT clog proof or even clog resistant, while still great not even in the same league as the 1.5 acre. I wish now I would have bought more bk-80d (1.5 acre). It is like the 4th of July every night. Don't be cheap like I was, BUY THE BK-80D!!!!!!!! I wish I would have known what a MASSIVE difference there was!!!	1
This unit lives up to the reviews I read before purchase, got two of them to cover 1 acre and works great.	1
I like buying the best of the best when I get things. I did a lot of research and this is pretty much the best personal bug zapper you can get. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have gotten a smaller one. This thing is huge and a little bit of an eye sore. The smaller one would still have been more than enough and would not  have drawn as much attention. This thing looks like i'm trying to have a black light party at my house.	1
This is by far the best and cleanest bug killer I've tried. No more temporary, sticky, smelly sprays. You just plug it in and wait for awhile. After about 15 minutes this zapper went into high gear killing bugs. It was like non-stop for a good 45 minutes. Mosquitoes, gnats, flies, moths, everything that buzzes and annoys you!! Altough there is some cleaning involved afterwards because not all bugs fall free from the grid, it did a great job of making my huge patio area safe for an evening of relaxation. The mosquito attractant pad helps to bring them in for their final flight! I would have given it 5 stars if it had a longer electrical cord so there wouldn't be this large electrical connection hanging in the breeze. Just a cosmetic observation I guess. Excellent product that I would recommend to anyone who hates having to go indoors in the evening due to those winged "terrorists"! I also ordered extra mosquito pads and a spare bulb.	1
I have been using the BK-80D for about 3 weeks now and so far I am impressed with its performance.  This model is bright and powerful and destroys every bug that is lured into it, it slays mosquitos.  I actually have a much smaller yard than 1.5 acres, however my theory is that at dusk when its slightly light out, I wanted the light to be bright enough to make the bugs choose the light and not me.  It is set up about 35 ft from our deck and that theory has worked great so far.  This design also has not clogged up at all with continuous nightly use.  Most bugs, especially mosquitos, fall to the ground after hitting it which is why many people don't think it works with mosquitos.  If they don't see them stuck to it, well it must not work.  I doubted it at first also until I stood next to it in the dark and saw the swarm around it.....which it continuously zapped.  Tiger mosquitos will not be attracted to the octenol bait but should still go after the light, at least mine do.  If the BK-80D is not working for people they could always step up to the Flowtron Diplomat, which is just awesome!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Flowtron-Diplomat-Outdoor-Indoor-Fly-Insect-Control/dp/B000OUSP12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Flowtron Diplomat Outdoor/Indoor Fly & Insect Control</a>  This unit kills more bugs than the M Magnet that I also have and is much less expensive to operate.	1
work very good to kill insect. after putting the Flowtron MA-1000-6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges under the bottom. need 2 pieces.  it really can attract any flying object, spider and ant when i put the machine on floor.  only one problem is the killer sound so loud.	1
Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.  I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.	1
Okay, bought this one recently to deter bugs for a graduation party. Had to clean the thing three times the first day, it literally took out thousands of mosquitos in one evening!! Of course to clean it you need to use an air compressor to remove the dead bugs that do not fall. I have several other units which are the Stinger brand but the Flowtron way out does them in performance.	1
Zapper works great, set it up outside and it started killing the insect population within a day or two. It needs the attractant to work on biting insects. Has to be blown off with the leaf blower every few days because it's full of dead bugs and moths.	1
We found the 80D not much more to buy than the 1/2 acre 40D, and it likely does provide a wider area of coverage.  It will use more electricity, but I intend to put it on a sensor, so it will run dusk to dawn.  As others reported, we found a pile of carnage after the first night....mostly mosquitoes.  Read the instructions about locating and baiting....ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub, patio, and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us, and intercepts those coming from upwind.  Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported, and the "zapping" is not obtrusively loud. Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray.  Investigating, I discovered a self-tapping screw had cross-threaded during assembly, breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage.  This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron.  I contacted Parts and Service.  They had me email my Amazon receipt, and immediately sent me a replacement cage.  Nice service!	1
This is the best money I have spent all year. We have had a very wet spring. After just 1 week with the zapper, we have almost no mosquitos. This zapper is working overtime. We plug it in around 7 PM and unplug around 7 AM. I would highly recommend this machine.	1
Sit around good people and hearken upon this story of legend and honor. The tale of BK-15D.  There was once an evil clan of fierce and sadistic warriors who called themselves the yellowjackets. They made all around them fearful of their wrath.  One day, an innocent young man was going about his day when the yellowjacket clan attacked. The young man had been keeping his distance, having been weary of the yellowjacket's presence, but to no avail. Their assault was ruthless.  A call went out from the townspeople. "Who will help us vanquish this horrible foe!?" When out from the faraway Amazon came a hero overnight. The BK-15D!  Using a rope the BK-15D suspended itself from a ladder and called to the townspeople to beat it against the great wall the yellowjackets had made their home. The townspeople were weary. Was this bravery or stupidity? Surely no entity could withstand that sort of punishment! Nevertheless the townspeople used a great pole and proceeded to bash the poor BK-15D against the wall. The yellow jackets did not take kindly to this intrusion and went not unlike a swarm of angry wasps. They quickly found the perpetrator. The venerable BK-15D.  Their onslaught was merciless but the mighty Flowtron proved nothing to be trifled with. It laughed off their futile attempts at stinging, it relished in the chance to act as a battering ram again and again against their fortress, it gleefully issued issued forth a battering cry of "BbzzzzzZZAAATTT" as it put on a show for all of us mere mortals.  The townspeople stood in awe of the sight of sparks flying as if summoned by Thor himself, and billowing smoke rolling off the foolish assailants. Yellowjackets, it was supposed, had keen sense of smell. It did them quite the disservice as the aroma of burning comrades only made them attack with even greater vigor. The BK-15D, with a warrior spirit that would make a Klingon blush, basked in the added challenge.  After 30 minutes of this clearly not manufacturer recommended pummeling, the BK-15D finally met its end on the field of battle as it shocked its last yellow jacket.  I jest! Our champion kept zapping and zapping until there was a pile of charred black and yellow corpses underneath it. The BK-15D, having tasted victory, would never again relinquish the chance to meet glory in battle. The next day it reported bright and early ready to face the enemy anew.  After several more brutal engagements the enemy had been exhausted. The several year long struggle was over. Where good citizens once knew only tyranny and oppression, the BK-15D smote their foe and gave them freedom to once again pursue such humble trades as "Washing the car" or "Using the weedwacker" without fear of being swarmed.  Having suddenly come to the realization that it could no longer be of use to the townspeople now that the land was safe once more, our hero the Flowtron BK-15D withdrew to live the rest of its days in peace in a faraway land of Garageandia.  However, there are some who say it still sits in watchful contemplation, awaiting the day should an old soldier be called upon to battle once more.	1
I purchased this to kill mosquitos... Little did I know that it was also entertaining to watch!  Works great -- bugs beware!	1
Straight out of the box, item would not work. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with orders through Amazon.com here lately. I think they are abusing the items during processing and causing stuff to be defective upon delivery. Recommend to just go to a big box and pick one up for about the same price and if it doesn't work, your not out of the hassle of re-packing, ect.. When one needs a bug zapper, one needs a bug zapper................... not next month!	-1
My house is in Nausau county NY. Our back yard is 12,000SF and close to highway. We have a beautiful fish pond. Before we bought this equipment, I can't go out in summer. Too much Mosquitos, bite like crazy. After I bought this little  thing, I can sit by my pond whole evening and won't get any bite. Beautiful! It needs to work with the mosquito attractant  cartridge, otherwise won't work. Love it!	1
I live in a very swampy area prone to TONS of mosquitos.  In fact, sometimes I haven't been able to open my front door without all lights being off and first spraying bug spray.  It's awful.  So I put this thing about 20 feet from the door and set it up to go on for an hour after dark using a timer (not included).  There are so many dead bugs on it, I'm amazed.  Really works.  And unless the mosquito population is low this year or I'm forgetting when they actually come out, it's cut back significantly on my "house entry" troubles.	1
Nothing kills bugs like Flowtron. It have been like July 4th in my backyard since the day I installed Flowtron. I moved into a newly developed area with forest and creeks around. Mosquitoes are everywhere. When I open my door at night, they swamped into my house and it's scary. 2 days after the installation, I can open my door and only one or two would fly in. then,  in house zapper took place and killed them all. I have recommend this to all the neighbors and soon, this block will be a mosquito-free section of the neighborhood.	1
Thus far after a week has done a good job but have to use a blower every day to blow out the debris, Bulbs are good and I run it24/7 thus a good buy, Having lots of mosquitos I bought to ofthe 1/2 acre ones thus put them in different places around the home here, Big plot of land here in rural area of gulf coast, Does not get them all but sure helps a lot	1
Update 2016 We've had it three years now and have been thrilled to have it. I have replaced the bulb only once. It's tremendously improved my summer nights because I can stay outdoors in the evenings now without bathing in deet first. ________________________________________________  Mosquitos love me. I joke that people don't buy citronella candles, they invite me to a party instead and all the mosquitos will come to me and leave them alone.  I've tried millions of things to repel them. I always have citronella candles, many of them, and Deep Woods Off, and other bug sprays and things to keep the mosquitos away. I live in a cold and dry climate and they still always find me and I get lots of bites. Nothing has worked very well.  We just purchased this Flowtron bug zapper and started it 3 nights ago. We have it on a timer to come on at dusk and turn off at dawn.  It's bliss! I love it. I don't have to move and light a million candles and position them around my lawn chair. I can just go outside when I want to and come in when I want to. It is awesome. We're still in May so I know there will be more next month, but so far, no mosquito bites!!! I'm so glad that we got this! I'll update again later in the summer.  -------------------------------  Update I still love this! Still no mosquito bites for me!!! I've been so so happy that we got this. I still haven't cleaned it yet, but I plan to soon.  The only negative issue we've had so far is that when it's raining a lot, the zapper will start zapping nearly continuously. The electricity seems to be arcing to dead bugs that are still stuck to the outside. Once I clean it, I imagine that problem will cease.  This is a great addition to our yard. The light is quite bright and so to avoid annoying our neighbors, we've hung it below the fence line. That means the top of ours is only 4 1/2 feet off the ground. It still works very well.  -------------------------------  Update 2 Still very happy with it. I've found that it definitely helps to use the Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges as well. If we replace them every 45 days or so, we're fine.  Cleaning the bug zapper was fairly easy. I needed a flat-head screwdriver and a Phillips head screwdriver (kinda silly that they have two screws of each kind) to disassemble it. I used a kitchen scrub brush (like for cleaning dishes) to scrub all the dead bugs off. Then, I reassembled it. It didn't take long at all.	1
For the flying yard insects-you should consider the Flowtron Electronic Insect Killer. I have had this type of thing before and they barely made a dent in the bugs but this one is amazing! I did my research and read reviews before ordering one and am not disappointed. I live in NW Georgia and with all the recent rains, the mosquitos are already out in full force. I have only had it up about 5 days but we have yet to even see a mosquito near any of us and we stay outside a LOT! There are 3 sizes-I got the big 1 1/2 acre one (we have 10 acres).  It has "attractant cartridges" and every morning there is a huge pile of bugs under it. Only drawback is it sounds like a mini machine gun so hang it at a bit of a distance from your outdoor sitting area! lol	1
I purchased the BK-80D and I've been using this product for about a week - only when it gets dark.  It attracts ALL kinds of bugs and does leave a whole bunch of dead bugs on the floor (as stated by others).  We had been infested with mosquitos and it was getting hard enjoying the outside.  I can't tell how many actual mosquitos it zaps since they are kind of small, but i can say that we've been outside all week long and so far have not been bothered by mosquito bites anymore.  I can't say the zapper has done it all since some days have been windy and there are less insects anyway, but other nights without much wind have actually been very enjoyable and mosquito-free.  Just one week ago - before the zapper - we were actually running to get back inside with all the mosquito bites.  This week has been amazing.  I hope it continues to work.	1
I rent a funky little cottage in South Florida that is awesome but completely infested with termites. The landlords don't want to tent, so in the Spring the little suckers are everywhere. I decided to buy one of these to turn on at night to keep them under control.  This unit is much cheaper than Flowtron's 'indoor' unit, and it works great indoors. I won't comment on if there are any safety regulations or anything, but its been killing bugs just fine for weeks now.  We did get a broken unit the first time around. Wouldn't turn on. But Amazon replaced it lickity split. Hence the 4 stars, as there may be some quality control issues. Enjoy zappin'!	1
I'm certain this item works well, I decided to not use as my cats were very interested in the light and noise it produced.	-1
i have not taken this out of the box yet but it looks great. note: it is recommended that this be located a certain distance from the house it protects...and it requires power.	1
Used it based on other reviews because the energized plates are vertical and the dead insects can easily fall, rather than getting caught up in a horizontal grid.	1
I live in the FL panhandle and mosquitoes are horrendous around here. I have resorted to everything, even buying one of the Solo 451 backpack foggers. Upon other reviews I decided to give this unit a try. I use bug zappers in my garden to take care of corn earworms and other pests that derive from moths but the ones I have used in the past (Stinger) were jokes and hardly lasted a season. I put up two of these Flowtron units and was working in the barn after the sun went down and I noticed I could hear this light zapping sound coming from the garden. It wasn't loud enough to be moths so I went out to investigate. I found a cloud of mosquitoes swarming around the Flowtron and so many were diving into the light and getting burned to a crisp that is literally smelled like burning hair. We must have taken out tens of thousands of the pest that first night alone. I have already ordered replacement octenol lures and plan on doing what others have suggested and put out a new one every two weeks. I am very pleased and have already suggested these units to neighbors. Buy with confidence.	1
This is a great product that works just like it is suppose to.  I bought the scented stuff that attracts the bugs and I have never had a problem with it.  I have had it for 3 years now and would still recommend it.	1
I had a Flowron for over 20 years and it worked like a charm. Unfortunately I did not bring it with me when I moved. I bought this one because of the name. What a mistake! It had only been in use for a couple of weeks when it seemed to develop a short somewhere. It was arcing so I unplugged it. I checked to make sure the grid was clear and when I plugged it in again the bulb just flickered and hummed. There is no way to repair it. I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
As of 07/09/13 the replacement finally failed..... Cannot exchange cause past 30 days...  As of 05/03/13 the replacement has had no issues. Gave it 4 stars cause first one worked for a short time then kinda had a hard time starting up and now failed. My parents had one for a couple years without a problem hoping just an isolated insident and awaiting replacement.  The grid is perfect where the bugs just fall out (unlike the stinger gets all clogged up)  Lack of quality control minor things that won't affect it performence (grid looked like it was kinda bent into an oval during assembly but it might have been designed like that so I can't really say much, I had to clamp the ring to close the gap that was excesive that it hangs on then took my mig welder and closed it permenet.	-1
I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy. Sorry to get rid of it. The new one was not really working right. hardly kill bug.	-1
I bought 2 of these and they are killing tons of bugs and I do not have a problem with the mesh clogging up with dead bugs.  This is a great zapper.	1
This bug zapper works great, I have had it about 2 years not and it is still working fine. I leave it on when the bugs start being pesky and within a couple of days all the bugs are dead.	1
Ok..for full disclosure, this is the only bug light I've ever owned.  We have about 2/3 an acre, about 1/2 is trees.  I put this thing on a timer and it is on from about 4 PM until 6 AM mon to friday, whenever the temperature is above 50 degrees.  It never stops zapping.   I also have the mosquito attractant on it.  We live in a swampy area of Virginia and the mosquitoes are abundant.  There are still mosquitoes around, but the population seems to have dwindled.  Whereas, I might have gotten 12 bites in 5 minutes, now i'll get about 4.  I will def be getting more of that in the spring. Is it wrong to be gleeful about hearing the zaps?  The negatives.... This thing ends up nasty.  I suppose all of them do, what with them being covered in bug corpses. I've seen the birds eating the crispy critters on the ground, but they won't pick them off the grid.  I use a stick and just poke the bits out.  oh, turn it off first and don't stand downwind or you will get covered in nasty bug ashes.  This is not how the manual says to clean it, btw, but it works for me.  I've prob just voided my warranty. I didn't coat it in Pam as another reviewer suggested.  Still no problems for me to clean it.  My kids wanted me to tell you that the fire flies are gone too.  That makes me kind of sad, but they can go play in someone else's yard....	1
I have this outside of my house which is situated on a 1 acre lot and this does a terrific job of keeping the mosquitoes away. The only downside I've found, which isn't really directly related to the product itself, is that one of my dogs is absolutely terrified of the zapping noise.	1
works good, easy install  I have had good luck with the items I have purchased here and usually fast ship.	1
The product seems pretty solid but after daily use of 3 months the bulb burned out. Now it's just hanging there collecting dust.	-1
This is my second flowtron insect killer. I would not be with out it. This product is hanging in my garage. It is ammazing how many flying insects it zaps everyday.	1
i got this to cut down the moth population.it works.i planted about 1 acre of corn and this helps cut down on other bugs as well.	1
Works just as it should, plug it in and it kills the bugs. We plug ours into a timer so all we had to do is find a good spot to hang it and it zaps away.	1
This device works pretty well.  I had a reduction in bug population this summer. Thank you very much for carrying this item.	1
This worked better than expected especially with the mosquito scent lure. Works so good that I have to clean the grids almost every other day to remove the poor unfortunate ex- beings. Besides, there is something about hearing the snap, crackle and pop that brings back memories...	1
Very disappointing.  I have seen no effect on the mosquito population since I have been using this lamp.  They are still everywhere, and seem to entirely ignore the lamp.  Perhaps one or two have flown into it by accident, but the lamp certainly does not attract or kill them in meaningful numbers.  Don't waste your money.	-1
after having issues with bulbs short life in a competitor product a few years ago I was hoping that would not be issue with this one. I am very Happy to announce that there have been no issues with this Flowtron unit and I will not hesitate to recommend it over the other unit, replacing the tube in the other brand(see my other review) will more the make up the price difference in short order.	1
I have gone through many electronic bug killers over the years.  I feel this unit is the best of all the ones I have tried.  I have had to replace bulbs periodically, but the zapper continues to work well.  Not the easiest to clean, but none of them are.  Would buy this one again if the current one stops functioning.	1
This is a very good bug zapper.  It kills mosquitos every night probably better than any other method out there.  The only comment I can make is that this same unit is sold at Sam's Club and Walmart for the same price as Amazon.com however the one at Walmart and Sam's includes a light sensor/timer so that this can turn on and off automatically.  The unit that Amazon sells does not have this feature. After learning this I felt a bit cheated to be honest by Amazon.  They did not have the "BEST" deal.  Walmart has the best deal and that is the fact!  Go to walmart.com and look it up yourself and you'll see what I'm saying.  I'll only give this 4 stars because I feel Amazon cheated me on this.	1
I ordered the Flowtron electronic zapper and a solar zapper at the same time. I should have bought two of the electronic ones---I AM going to order another one.  This Flowtron zapper is well worth the money. The post top solar zapper----USELESS, USELESS, USELESS!!!  I would recomend the Flowtron BK-15D Electronic bug zapper to everyone----Cause I love it when things work like they are supposed too!!!	1
Our property is such that traditional methods like chemicals or water management won't work (although having children means that chemicals are out of the question in the first place).  First of all .. the Flowtron won't elimate your heavy mosquito problem but will probably make it more managable.  After 1 month .. here are my observations:  1. Hang it away from your desk or any object that you would linger around at.  Since it attracts the bugs .. it will be the hotspot for them .. so no chairs, benches, playstructures or anything in the near vicinity. 2. It catches a lot of bugs .. mostly moths .. but I was pleasantly surprised that it is catching quite a few mosquitos. Is it because the light or the ocetonol .. not sure .. but I've had to clean the thing twice already because it was pretty darn full. 3. Most bugs will fall out of the bottom .. but a good can of air will take care of the job to clean up the remainder 4. A timer based on light didn't do the best job as the mosquitos tend to come out before its dark enough that a light sensor would kick in .. thus I changed it to a fixed timer.  It hasn't eliminated the entire mosquito problem for us .. but at my guess .. its 90% less and on many occasions we can sit outside without even the need for spray.  Highly recommended thus :)  <Update Nov 2012>  So I used the system for an entire summer and here are my observations further.  Again it didn't eliminate the problem 100% but made it significantly less.  It took a while for the zapper to catch up with the large amount of mosquitos but by the end of summer the zapping started to get less.  You have to clean it regularly which might take 20 or so minutes to complete.  Dirty job and maybe the tip of spraying it will aid in the removal. I am glad I bought the device.	1
Took this unit camping last week. Flowtron BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer.  Set it out about 50 feet away, and I wasn't bothered by mosquitoes all night. Good Product.	1
My husband and I love these things! We now have 2, placed on either side of the house, such that they catch bugs from either direction before reaching us on the porch.  Although we can simply relocate them if needed, we still may purchase a few more - one to put back by the garage, and one by the back door.  I don't care for the octenol packs however, as I can smell them and they seem to choke me up a bit (they don't affect my husband).  However the light works so well, I'm not sure they are needed.	1
bought this big yard bug killer and it works great...easy to hook up and easy to maintain...quick delivery...love it...amazon makes it easy to order and pay for and will be ordering again soon...thanx...	1
What they DO NOT disclose,- is that this unit comes with a 3 inch cord IF that.  After receiving and reading the instructions, you are told that this unit should be set up over 25 feet away from humans. Well, unless, you have an electrical socket 25 feet away-you are out of luck or already have an extension cord that you can use outside.  We bought two of these, one for our residence and one for our business. Neither of which are working, whilst we await our new order and $15.00 per unit extension cords- Read: Another $30.00.  Oh * Another little side note, that this company does NOT disclose. You Will be needing to buy packets of their bug repellent every 30 days or so. Frustrated that I could not use either one of these units until purchasing two all-weather extension cords.  Just so you know...	-1
OK--I have had this unit for only one day, however I am so impressed that I am writing a review earlier than I usually do. I ordered the 40 watt --1  acre unit and that may have been an overkill as the Stringer I am replacing is far smaller. I am switching to the Flowtron due to the high price at the local hardware for a replacement bulb for the Stringer. I note the replacement bulb for this unit is less than the Stringer by several dollars and is three times as powerful.  Within the first three hours of use, the unit had attached loads of mosquitos as well as  some other  bugs. At the rate it is "zapping" bugs I will no doubt have to clean in a few days. I took the unit out of the box and it was operating within minutes. I already had a hook attached to a wall in the courtyard. I know the instructions recommend putting the unit away from walls, however in my case that was just not possible. I never had a problem in the past with the unit being close to a wall and I don't anticipate such as problems with this unit. I never turn the unit off thus it is working around the clock to attract bugs.  That leads me to my final comment. The Mosquito Attachment Cartridges are very expensive. A six pack is more than $30 and can be over $40. I frankly think that is far out of line for a small strip that attracts mosquitos. Replacement strips can cost almost as much as the unit itself. If Flowtron wants to keeps customers and attache more customers they should take a look at that pricing. Thus far we very pleased with the insect killer and it is doing the job exactly as advertised.	1
Nive size zapper. Works very well. We have had it on for 2 weeks straight hanging over our pond. The turtle and koi love it. Fried, fresh critters. Will buy another frrom site.	1
Well I should have listened to my first instinct and not of purchased this. I have had this on all day and all night,It has cost me hours of wasted time. I moved it literally twenty times all over in different places in my back yard. Even up high and low. Then I even hanged smelly food on the outside grits to attract all the flies that are annoying me and my pets. NOTHING WORKED!!! It literally killed only three flies in a twenty four hour period. There is nothing that I could of done that I did not try to get this to work. Not to mention the power cord is ridiculous how short it is. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HIGH REVIEWS. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM. I AM RETURNING. And once again a company with a cheap plastic expensive product that is a piece of CRAP.	-1
Very poorly constructed,arrived with broken bulb. Amazon Supervisor assistance was required for return. The second item was terrible as well. I rebuilt it myself and will not purchase another, manufacturer was unpleasant when I telephoned for assistance.	-1
Tried two other brands from another store and both died within three days. They would have to be cleaned everyday. My Flowtron just keeps on working. Highly recommend it.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Flowtron-BK-80D-80-Watt-Electronic-Insect-Killer-1-1-2-Acre-Coverage/dp/B00004R9VV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Flowtron BK-80D 80-Watt Electronic Insect Killer, 1-1/2 Acre Coverage</a>	1
I have a camp in Michigans Upper peninsula.  In spring, the mosquitoes, midges and black flies are in swarms, beyond verbal discription really. I have three of these; 2-15 watt units and a 40 watt model.  Running these between 8pm and 2am will clear 95% of these winged pests in a two acre area, within three days. The first night,  each will accumulate mosquitoes an inch thick . second night, about half that and downward to where I run the zappers every other or third night (on a timer) to maintain things.  I can't tell you if the chemical attractant helps of not. I get great results without.  The only downside to these, especially in my application, is they get impacted with dead insects to the point it takes compressed air to really clean them  back to full operation. I removed the protective plastic screen (left it off) to clean them with a paintbrush. Obviously, this should only be done when they are unplugged and safe to handle.  You may get better coverage using several smaller wattage units versus a single large one.  Tested, proven and recommended!	1
Seen these bug zappers around and thought it was time to buy one to help zap mosquitos and bugs in back yard and patio area. Read reviews and even though there were considerable NEGATIVE reviews, decided I'd take my chances on one anyway since the alternative to doing nothing but keeping mosquitos was not an option.  Unit received in good coindition and put on patio on Friday night. Saturday morning there were a pile of dead bugs under the unit; HOWEVER one of the two UV bulbs was out.  I followed the instructions NOT TO SEND IT BACK, but to call the compnay first, so come Monday (they are closed on Sat/Sun), I called the manufacturer.  Call went to voice mail, hung up and tried an hour later.  Call went to voice mail so left message.  About 3 hours alter got call back asking me to open the unit up and check the two small glass tubes (they called them starters) and see if either one was black.  They also asked me to allow a drop of water to drip on the grid (while plugged in) to see if the grids were still working.  Monday nite I took the unit apart and followed their instructions.  One of the glass tubes "starter" was black and unit did pop when hit with drop of water.  The next morning I called and left another message for them to call me back.  Waited till noon, no call.  Called factory back and left ANOTHER message on their answering machine.  About an hour later received call from lady at factory.  Told her the past history and one of the small glass tubes (looks like an old style neon bulb) was black  The factory lady asked where I bought the unit. Told her amazon, and she replied that before she would send the part I needed to FAX her a copy of the invoice from amazon, afterwhich she would mail me out the part  (the postage probably costs them more than this pencil eraser sized bulb).  As I told the factory customer service lady,  "I didn't buy this device to be a factory repairman",  "I bought it to hang up and work".  So much for FLOWTRON.  They should know they have an issue with this part since all the negative reviews have the same story;  Doesnt Flowtron have a QC department?  Why don't they resolve this issue and sell a quality product?  What a same.  (Hope their President reads these complaints and makes some changes).  So, bottom line,  this one is going back to Amazon (sorry amazon, it's not your fault, but, thank you for being the greatest store in the world)..	-1
I received the Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2 Acre Coverage. I am so happy I got this before Mother's Day because. Mosquitos and flies have been a pesky critters. I put it in my back yard. It really works fast zapping the Mosquitos, moths, and flies. I am  100% satisfied with this Zapper. I have gone to Lowes, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and they were all out of this Insect Killer. I wished I would have ordered this first before going to all these locations and being dissappointed. Thanks a lot.	1
We hung this in a wooded area near our dog kennels and it does a great job! I have seen a vast reduction in the mosquitos and we are heavy into mosquito season in GA. It doesn't clog but does leave a nice big pile on the ground under it so beware of ants and other creepy crawlies swarming the dead carcasses when you check on it.	1
THIS IS A PIECE OF **** (FILL IN THE BLANKS)the product worked GREAT until a rain storm when the 'starter bulb' (fuse) burned out!! now FLOWTRON will not HONOR their TWO YEAR "Limited" Warranty. the unit is just two months old. had to purchase a new starter bulb @ $2.32 plus $8.95 shipping. the unit is not wired together safely - they just use tape not wire nut or other approved electrical code or common sense to connect the electrical connections - just fiber glass reenforced tape, not electrical tape!!!!  just repurchase their products & not to worry about their TWO YEAR WARRANTY!!!!!	-1
...and fries the bejezus out of various flying insects. I have it connected to a photosensor so that it activites at dusk--works beautifully (I have yet to try the mosquito attractant, but it can only enhance the performance).  Only practical issue is the unit hangs slightly off balance due to the weight and awkward placement of the power cord.	1
Was very surprised to see this attracting and killing large numbers of south Texas mosquitos.  I figured without the bait it would be of little use in that area.  With the bait I did some counts (kill rate over 10 minutes) and estimate I am killing 10-12,000 mosquitos a night. This does not include all the moths and other pests that are being zapped.  There is a carpet of mosquito corpses under the unit every morning. I live near a swamp so I will never be able to eradicate them but I can now enjoy the pool which was impossible at dusk previously.  I am very happy with this purchase.	1
Ordered two of these.  Arrive very quickly.  Well packed.  The right tool for the job of taking care of the flying insects that are prevelant out in the desert.	1
I have owned one of these units before and its still working after many years and a few bulb replacements. The bulbs should be replaced yearly for optimum performance. This unit does the job! The 40-watt size doesn't work as well. I started out ordering 2- replacement bulbs for my current unit from Amazon at a total cost of around $36. I ordered the bulbs and then realized that the cost of a new unit INCLUDING BULBS was $55. What a deal. I ordered the new unit and donated the still working old unit. I highly recommend this product. I live in California and the bug problem is not as bad as on the East coast. However, I spend time in my backyard relatively flying insect free.	1
Although the pool has a cage, which keeps out most mosquitoes, the no-see-ums (sand flies) are small enough to squeeze through on occasion, and opening and closing pool cage doors lets in some insects.  This thing kills anything that comes near it!  And when paired with the Octenol patch (one tab included) it does a very good job of clearing the deck of remaining beasties.  You just have to remember that its not expected to do this 100%.  It attracts most insects by the UV, but mosquitoes need a smell to follow, like CO2 or your breath.  Thats why you need the Octenol, which mimics it.  In the time I have tried it (around 3 weeks) it has definitely worked wonders and I can see the electric grid bars filling up with the insects.  I oiled the steel grid lightly before use (with a spray of WD40) prior to inserting the bulb.  I did this to cause the insects to stick less on contact when they get buzzed.  It should make blowing them off later, a little easier.  Overall, its worth it for me - just keep some anti-insect spray handy as you'll still need it a bit.  Also, site the Flowtron a fair bit away from you - 25 feet or more.	1
Mosquitoes are focusing on human body and have the tendency to stay away from the trap... on the other hand we are catching all kind of insects. I feel that I am taking the dinner away from the bats and other predators. The company should create new look, new scent or new color to outsmart these most disturbing insects.	-1
BUYER BEWARE: It appears Flowtron currently has quality issues with the starter bulb that starts the fluorescent tube in the most recent units.  Bought three of these from two different sources in March 2011, one source being Amazon.  Within one week, one unit from Amazon and one from another source had quit working, leaving only one of three working after a week.  The bulb simply stops lighting and that causes the grid to not energize too, rendering the zapper useless.  The third went in about 4 more weeks so after a month and a half, my small sample of three has a 100% failure rate.  Flowtron sent me some starter bulbs (a $2.50 part) and that DID fix the problem.  I'm hoping that the fix will last as replacing the starter bulbs on a new unit is a nuisance and some people might not be comfortable with the repair.  When these work though, they attract/kill more bugs (and many mosquitoes) than any other electronic insect killer I've used.  And I've tried three different brands.	-1
I live on a lake in Michigan and at night time we have a significant bug problem - not just mosquitoes, but lots of flying bugs.  I went to the local big box stores and saw what they had to offer, and all of their products had poor reviews.  I got this Flowtron and it has just been a killing machine.  There are all sorts of bugs in there from mosquitos to moths to lady bugs, etc.  It seems to be very effective.  I simply put it on a timer and run it every night.  The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is because it does actually clog.  I don't know if it is just the overwhelming number of bugs it is killing or what - but I had to clean it the first few nights as to not have any potential fire hazards.  Just to show you how effective this thing is - here is how many bugs it killed in the first night.  Remember a lot of these bugs are TINY but they add up!  [...]  UPDATE:  When these things work, they work great - but I have gone through two of them already.  I have no idea what makes them die, but both of them lasted less than a year.	-1
This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.  Unfortunately, the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet.	-1
Fist of all, they could add about 4 more foot on the AC cord, Never see anyone only have a 1 1/2 cord. Looks very cheaply made. Only 2 little screws to hold all the weight of this unit. The hanging ring is not solid, Had to weld the ring together so it won't let go in a strong wind. Could of use a On/Off switch on it too.	-1
This only worked for a day.  The next day, the light did not come on when I plugged it in.  I live in southeast USA where we have a lot of bugs so after reading all the great reviews, I decided to order one.  When it did work, it did not kill a bunch of bugs like the reviews said.  I saw a fly get zapped a few times and then escaped.  I'm so disappointed and still have bug problems.  We called the number the included - they said to go back to Amazon and check their policies.  My husband had to call twice since they did not return his phone call.  This has been an absolute disappointment so far and we'll never buy another one of this brand.  In fact, I'll go through a store next time.	-1
The box says it works for flies, but in our yard flies seem to complete ignore it.  It kills moths (hmm, moths are attracted to light, who knew?)  But our issue is backyard flies (both tiny ones and middle-size) from god-knows-where and they seem to ignore this device, day or night.	-1
I was happy when this hose cart arrived. It is easy to set up. However, it is very flimsy. With the weight of the hose, the cart was difficult to move around and the handle eventually snapped out of place. This is not a very durable product.	-1
Easy to set-up but it leaks internally.  It's going back.  My old Ames seemed to be built better than this one.  Update After One Season of Use: The replacement works as very well.  Amazon return policy made returning the old one easy and fast.	-1
First, the concept is flawed.  With your knees between you and a bed that's more than a foot or two wide, you aren't close enough to garden, and it you try to, it stretches your back worse than bending.  What a fool I was not to have just turned a bucket upside down and tested the garden-while-sitting concept before wasting the money! Second, the product is not as advertised.  The "tool clips" for a rake or shovel (which looked too small to be useful anyway) are missing, and there is no internal tray. Third, it's a ripoff.  The price is now $8 lower than when I bought, but shipping is $7 more, so you're still paying over $50.  After ordering, I found exactly the same product at Ace Hardware for $40, and yesterday exactly the same product at Lowe's for $30. It's also incredibly noisy, even on grass.	-1
This is a handy cart, and we used it a lot for about a year before the plastic gave out and the handle fell off.  If you're going to use it lightly or don't expect it to last it will be fine.	-1
I thought his would work well, but found it too small for my needs.  It is however very sturdy.	-1
I paid $25 for the sprinkler head and the base.  Very disappointing as the nut that secures is constanly getting loose causing the adusting spring to spin.  I have found it watering my windows more than  once.  The base is rusty on the inside (only bought last month) and sprays rusty water when turned on for the first couple of seconds and it doesn't drain after hose is turned off.  $25 is way to much to spend for something that has so many problems.  Wish I had tried the Melnor 3900H Heavy Duty Metal Pulsating Sprinkler which has lots more postive reviews.	-1
does not rotate	-1
New version of the water master valve from a few years back. Unfortunately requires more water pressure to completely shut off. That sounds counter intuitive but that's the way these work. I had to just use the diaphragms to repair my old valves due to low pressure on my property.	-1
doesn't work properly	-1
I purchased two of these sprinkler heads for our church. Both of them failed within a month.  They appear to be solid, well built brass units. They worked well for a while.  We do have particularly hard water, which might have contributed to their failure. But the return mechanism is simply not well built. The return spring is weak, so them mechanism is not held positively to one side or the other.  I replaced them with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rain-Bird-20-to-41-Foot-Coverage-Radius-Brass-Impact-Rotor-Sprinkler-Head-25PJDAC/dp/B00002N8NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rain Bird 20 to 41-Foot Coverage Radius Brass Impact Rotor Sprinkler Head 25PJDAC</a>. This sprinkler head has a much stronger spring in the return mechanism. I would recommend it over the Orbit, even though it costs a bit more.	-1
Not good.  Buy the one from Mexico.  True Tough.	-1
There were scratches in the metal and slight specks of rust.  The wood handle broke after only a few uses.  A complete waste of $25.	-1

After 10 minutes of raking the handle came off.  Supposedly it was "bolted on", but no it wasn't.  The wooden handle did not go far enough into the collar for the bolt hole to line up.  I hammered it in as far as it would go, but the rake handle widens as it goes up and I couldn't get it to the bolt hole.  So, I used it with the handle held on by friction.  However, it's "no clog" promise was also a joke.  It clogged as much if not more than my cheap old rake.  Unfortunately I bought it in the summer and by the time raking season arrived it was too late to return it.  This is a piece of junk - not only improperly assembled but also flimsy.  I don't know if Amazon was filling the order with seconds or what.  Very disappointed!	-1
Weak tines..... spring action is great. Already have similar rake from many years past. The tines are sturdier and is an excellent thatch rake. This would suffice as a leaf rake. It is over priced. Found the same rake at the hardware s tore for $10 less.	-1
recieved this t-day  went to install it in my well's pump house -- fit nicely  got it all installed and turned on the well pump -- promptly srayed the whole interior of the pump house :(  the hose gasket, part #11 in the exploded parts diagram, failed to seal the connection satisfactorialy.  Tightening the connection with 2 pairs of pliers slowed, but didn't stop the leakin. borrowin other washers from other water equip I happen to have didn't help either.  wasted a LOT of time fartin around with leaky fittin till I finally hit on a solution -- squeezed a bead of clear silicone round the inside of the female supply hose connector -- then seated the rubber gasket into the siliconed connection and tightened it up to pump male hose connection -- let it set up -- turned it on -- whatta ya know?  NO more leak ;)  cain't understand why a *fitted* hose gasket wern't supplied WITH this product -- one that came with it fit poorly -- as did others I tried -- didn't seal completely  Hmmmm  that's *MY* rant fer the day  NOW we'll see how well the reel performs over time ;)	-1
I bought this today at my local hardware outlet... and three frustrating hours later, returned it... Here are my pro's and con's:  Pros: * Nice color, blends into any house or garden * Inexpensive * Doesn't cause skin irritation, vomiting or hives (ok, that's a stretch, but I couldn't think of a third pro and I wanted three)  Cons:  *  Flimsy plastic, cheaply made *  Connector to water supply line is plastic, not brass, and despite much tightening, mine dripped and dripped. *  Does NOT hold a 100 foot 5/8" hose.  Not even close.  I'm going to order a metal "professional" model on Amazon that's about 3x the price of this...but reviews are very positive and it looks like it will last.  This thing will NOT last.	-1
I quit using Orbit valves because they are not maintenance free and couldn't go a year in my drip system without needing some sort of maintenance.  I switched to another popular brand and haven't had to touch them in three years.	-1
I thought orbit was a brand to spend on,. But not for these...  They are not reliable and don't last.  I have the 57223 models which I think are the same as these.  Valve sucks and won't turn on.  Just thump thump thump until you loosen the solenoid.  Thumping stops, valve works, but then solenoid leaks.  Tighten the solenoid and when you close and reopen the valve, the thump thump thump comes back.  It's like is trying to open the valve, but can't quite get it opened.  Maybe the solenoid plunger is slightly to long ?  Just not reliable.  Is there a recall on these, or an upgraded part that doesn't have this problem?  All 4 of mine have this problem when I first start using them after winter is over. And they sometimes act up randomly throughout the year..	-1
I suppose if you only have 25' of low end garden hose (light weight) it might hold up. BUT, for a normal 75' run of good quality hose, forget it. It will leak and I mean big time.  It's only supported on one end of the reel which is 50% of the problem. Add that to the fact it is plastic and you have a poorly desugned product.	-1
After one week, three stopped work or leaking.	-1
The reel will hold 100 feet of 3/4 inch garden hose, but revinding and pulling the hose out is a challenge. The hose guide at the bottom of the reel acts like a brake. It would be better not to have this guide, or it should have rollers for allowing the hose to slip through. The O-rings did not seal well because imperfections at the molded O-ring seats. Otherwise the reel looks REEL good on the wall...	-1
These Anti Siphn valves are crap.  I recall buying these a few years ago at Home Depot and the guy next to me was like, don't buy orbit valves, they are horrible. It was about all Home Depot had that day and he was going elsewhere to look for an alternative brand.  I wish I had too.  I got home that day with 3 of these and read some reviews, but installed them anyway.  I really didn't know a lot about irrigation systems at the time.  2 years later and I am replacing all 3.  Why?  Leaking sprinkler heads wasting gallons of water a day, muddy spots around the sprinklers. When the valves turn on, water squirts out from the solenoids.  I have checked all three valves to make sure they weren't closing properly due to sand or something else jamming them slightly open. They were all fine.  I see some Orbit products get decent reviews but I won't risk them again. The issue to me isn't the cost of doing the replacement, it is the time to do it.  I have enough on my plate. THhese things should last more than 2 seasons.  I'm going to an irrigation specialty store to buy something that will last, screw Orbit and Home Depot for selling this crap.	-1
Bad product	-1
Before we got thru the first season with this product, it was leaking water from the inner connection.  We've tried uncoiling the hose to it's fullest extent so we could make adjustments to the leaking connection, but to no avail.  We just could not stop the water from pouring out of that connection, no matter what we tried to do.  What a waste of water!  We're looking for a replacement product, or a less leaky way to store the hose itself.	-1
I should have listened to the other complaints.  You cannot program the second times.  If you set it foe early morning, the next watering will be mid day, the worst time to water.	-1
As others have noted, these bend and crack right at the seam under where the hose attaches after a few uses.  Buy only if you have no intention of moving them around or you have very soft dirt. Any ground that needs force to push in and you will crack these in a week or so and have water spraying out.	-1
Unfortunately these are very poorly made, one strike with a weed waker breaks the little green hose connections, The adjustments are a JOKE, easily strip with large flat blade, small flat blade or quarter. These adjustment strip in both ways the threads strip so it won't close all the way and turn off water and the flat blade slit strips so you  can't adjust it at all. I have about 30+ of these units in my yard and over half have at lease 3-4 of the adjustment stripped and/or 2 of the ports broken.  This is a DO NOT BUY, The seller is great nothing against them at all, I've bought other things from this seller and I'm perfectly happy with all those items.  All I can say is this brand SUCKS and  you will have to replace them regularly which I'm sure is great for the damb companies bottom line, but really P!sses me off.	-1
I was disappointed when 2 of the 3 I ordered cracked around the seam  and were spraying water all over within a a couple weeks of owning them. One is still working fine, but unless your ground is extremely soft they bend when putting them in as well.	-1
My initial review was five stars and: "Seems to be what it is purported to be.  Seems to be good quality and built well." That impression has changed. I used it for light duty stuff only for about two hours, nothing more than 1/4" diameter stems and branches (I carried a pair of gardening shears for larger stuff), never abused it or hit anything solid with it.  It broke for no apparent reason other than simply swinging it.	-1
Works very well and feels well built.  Handle is contoured to help me get a good grip and I can swing through weeds with ease.  Small saplings up to maybe 1/4" get chopped with one swing, and I wouldn't really use it for much bigger on purpose.  I just wish the blade  face was a little longer...  I had one years ago that had to have been a few inches longer.  EDIT:  Later last season, maybe the 4th use of the grass whip...  The metal part separated from the wooden handle and went flying about 60 feet.  I am just so glad it was aimed towards the woods, and not the house, cars...  kids.  Uggh.	-1
ok	-1
Very dull. Didn't do the job at all.	-1
I found almost no local retailer who carried this item although they did carry the type with the frame attached at both ends of the blade, and after trying to use it I think I may know why.  I was quite willing to sharpen the tool, and did so three times in slightly different ways.  Although it had a very sharp edge I most often could not make it cut well.  Performance seemed to depend upon what I was trying to cut; with just the right vegetation it did well.  But more often than not it did not do well. I tested it by trying to cut the vegetation growing in roadside ditches which was mixed, but all tender shoots, not hard, woody stems.  I did my best to find a proper technique and never did.  It may have been my fault, but the tool did not work well for me as I hoped to use it.	-1
Have one of these to replace an older model.  If you are on the short side this does not work well.  The grip is on the wrong place and my old one did not have that funky angle.  My old one was like a golf putter and you could easily swing with one arm.  This one is harder to grip and ..again.. Unless you are taller, can hit the target in an awkward way.  Why can't they make an adjustable handle???	-1
I tried and tried to use this, but it just does not work easily.  I would not recommend this product, it does not cut very well at all.	-1
Tcha! I need to really practice my golf swing, since it isn't really sharp	-1
The handle is so short, only a 4' person can use it!  If you are 5'5" tall or taller, it's way too short to you'll put stress on your back.  It also doesn't cut much.  Very disappointed; waste of money.	-1
too small to be useful for the purpose I originally bought it for.	-1
Bought this to replace an old style weed whip that I have had for 45+ years. The old one was built like a tank & was still cutting well but, the metal rod finally broke where the wood handle was riveted through it. It didn't have serrated edges (was flat) which was good because it was easy to sharpen. The edges on this model are NOT sharp - and they are difficult to sharpen due to the serrations. But, the #2 rating is because after the 3rd time in use, just cutting some thicker weeds, the metal rod actually bent sideways between the wood handle and the bottom turn. I was able to bend back but it bent a second time & is now much weaker at that point. If I could return it, I would. They just don't make 'em like they used to. I'm trying to think of a way I can modify it to inc. the old rod/cutter into the handle of this new one. I would recommend against buying this product. UPDATE: More recently I had found and purchased a MUCH BETTER whip. It was a Groundworks brand/model (made for tractor supply). The rod/handle is about 30% thicker, it is slightly longer, and the cutting edge is removable for sharpening. Also, it cost 25% less.	-1
Absolutely useless.	-1
This thing is lame. NOT sharp... killing my arms and hands just doing a very small front lawn. I should have just bought a machete. I know how to cut grass with a machete and it certainly works better than this thing.	-1
Couldn't seems to get the hang of how to use this. Wouldn't chop down the weeds in my alley. Ended up in garage sale.	-1
I do not like the grass whip . It is not rugged at all and does not cut through grass and weeds very well .	-1
Now I remember why I hated using these things as a kid.  They don't really cut grass well.  You need a lot of bat speed on them to get them to cut, so make sure that no one is too close to you.  I thought this would be useful in clearing grass around the edges of my gardens, but it looks like I'll be back to using the weed wacker.	-1
My house was built on old pasture land.  As a result where I didn't cut it with the mower, tall grass grew up.  I bought this whip thinking I would make short work of that patch.  Nada, nothing.  The only thing this whip did was knock the grass down - until the next rain.  Going back to the weedeater.	-1
I have several areas that need trimming that I cannot mow in so I bought this in the expectations of being able to sling cut the grass and weeds. From the other reviews I thought this would fit the bill but I am really disappointed in it. It will cut (actually it is more of just a rip and tearing) the weeds and does an even poorer job on the grass itself, but it certainly does not leave a nice appearance. This will be only used when and where I have to. It is brand new so the blade should be sharp but it certainly makes a mess of the area you use it on. Plus, it is a bear to use and I am very active and stay on the go all the time, yet using this for just a few minutes almost wears me out. If I still had the box, I would return this as I am very disappointed in it all the way around. I relied on the positive reviews but I sure don't know what they reviewed or if they actually ever used this product.	-1
The edge is so blunt that tool would pull the grass out with the roots, rather than cut it.  I found that sharpening serrated edge without specialized tools is quite a chore, I wish manufacturer would charge more, but sell the tool pre-sharpened.	-1
This tools is useless. It won't cut grass and it won't even break weeds. The blade is serrated so I cannot sharpen it. It is light so it won't move fast enough through the grass. I will buy a real scythe.	-1
These solenoids physically fit as replacements but they do not work, my valves do not operate or they operate to open and then do not close.	-1
product did not work	-1
Not very happy with this rake. The long wood handle came separated from the metal rake. This really pissed me off! Maybe this one was just made poorly. I used this rake 2 times before it broke. I should have just went to the hardware store and something from there...	-1
These type sprayers never last. They clog up at some point, and have to be taken apart. Good luck with that. You're better off buying a cheap metal sprayer with no adjustments.	-1
Was raking some dead leaves and grass away after mowing and broke the handle in half! While it was still in one piece it raked well, but broke way too easily. I also paid way less for mine at a home improvement store. Ultimately I think its a good rake but be gentle on it.	-1
Arrived broken and felt really cheap.	-1
bought two, both broke bought another and it broke.  not hardy, and cannot be dropped on wooden deck or front concrete porch, even from my towering height of 5 foot 1.  plus they all required additional washers, because they all leaked.............but were fine with two washers.	-1
You will need to bring it inside and never subject it to freezing conditions, or else it will begin to leak uncontrollably. I've bought three of these, and all were irreparably leaky come springtime.  If you live somewhere where it never freezes, then yes, the adjustable settings make this a good product.  But I live in Vermont, so this is a deal-breaker for me.  EDIT: I am taking off another star because the last one of these that I bought broke over this winter.  I had it stored in the garage, so it was largely protected from the elements and the worst of the cold!  Absolutely worthless!	-1
Not really much else to say...bought a different one at Home Depot, but I expect these things to last a bit longer.	-1
This nozzle started leaking after less than a seasons' use - I purchased it in May of last year and by August, it had completely fallen apart. (The black plastic pattern thing on the front fell off, the handle broke in half, and it was obviously no longer functional.) Go with something more durable if you don't want to replace your hose nozzle every 4 months.	-1
I really liked the features but this guy leaked.  Perhaps another washer would have done the trick but I didn't have one.	-1
Don't bother with this one! Get the Dramm. I have purchased several of the wimpy sprayer listed here and all have broken within a very shsort time.	-1
I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.  I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.  I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it.	-1
Worked good for a year then wouldn't shut off. I took it apart and the metal spring inside was rusted and falling apart. Clearly made of cheap metal.	-1
Bought it in May of 2010.  Did not use it from November to April.  That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable. Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy.	-1
I was very disappointed with this tool. It is very hard to use and is not adjustable. I would not recommend this tool to anymore.	-1
This nozzle is made of metal, which led me to believe it would be good.  It worked fine for the first few months but after about 5 or 6 months, the on/off valve began leaking; not so much that the nozzle keeps spraying but when it's turned off, water leaks out by the valve itself; and it's getting worse over time.	-1
This thing must be made for the lightest use possible. The entire rubber coating of the wheel ripped off after 20 minuets of use. It only did half my driveway and my weed whacked never has an issue edging. Thought I could use this to clean up the edges but it sucked!	-1
Very difficult!	-1
seems hard to push...thought it would roll easier	-1
So disappointed......I live out of town, don't drive, elderly lady! Be prepared to sharpen before use! Now I have to find a way to town, buy a round file, put on a vise and sharpen the cutting edges. Wish I had known before ordering. Live and learn!!!	-1
After using this for 10 min so tired I went back to amazon web and purchase an electric push model so unless you want a good work out don't buy this buy electric model of your choosing,	-1
cheaply made....total piece of crap	-1
Did not edge well at all	-1
very manual and grass gets caught in it constantly.  not sure if meant for St Augustine grass in Florida	-1
Waste of energy and too difficult to use~!	-1
The manufacturer uses a black plastic pipe to connect the bit of hose that connects to the water source to pipe water into the main hose. Unfortunately, the black pipe is so narrow that it creates a lot of back pressure. This back pressure forces a good amount of water out of the smaller hose despite o-rings (spraying irritatingly all over the place) instead of out of the main hose. Yes, water does come out of the main hose, but when almost half of the water comes spraying out of the wrong place....it makes this hose reel useless.	-1
If you're looking for a quality hose reel, look elsewhere. This reel is cheaply made and literally falls apart every time you reel up your hose.  For the money they charge for this, it should be capable of lasting more than 1 season. This one won't.	-1
Pros: Looks like a hose reel. Went together easliy. Holds hose. Cons: Fell apart easliy. leaks like crazy. Blew apart completely after about the 2rd use and perhaps 3 months later. If you don't have the cash to buy a real reel, just save your money and you'll be a lot happier. All of the Ames and Suncast products likes sprinklers and spray nozzles and this reel are total garbage. You get what you pay for with this item for sure, so don't act shocked when it fails. I am looking for a $100 plus reel now and haven't found it yet. for now I have the stationary non rotating rack that hangs the hose on the wall by draping over it, no moving parts, totally manual operation, only thing to fail is if the hose leaks, which isn't sold by Ames.	-1
I saw this in a store. Fair idea but not good enough. The handle is to short. The steel is the same as a hand weeder (not strong enough for the handle length). It does not have a cross piece for your foot to push it into the ground. I'm going to welding shop to see if they will make me one with a longer handle and better weeding end. I'm 73 and have hard soil and other weeds that get in my lawn with tough tap roots. People that desighn these things have never pried out a weed in their life.	-1
I should have checked Amazon before purchasing this at my local garden store.  I have a short handled version this style weeder and I was tired of bending over to weed.  So I decided to try the long handled version.  The handle seemed sturdy and I was aware that this is *not* a pry bar, despite the long handle.  So I made every attempt to use it as a digger.  I would attempt to push it into the ground along side the root of the weed, do the same on the other side and hopefully I could then use a small amount of forge to pry the weed out.  Boy was I dumb!  Despite taking care to not bend this item, it bend after the second use.  The another annoying thing about it is that it has no cross piece that you can use to push it into the summer dry soil.  You would be better off buying a long, thick, heavy metal pry bar of some sort to use.  This weeder is horrible.  I'll stick to the short version and a shovel.	-1
Got this for our camper where space is a commodity. Loved the idea but it broke the first time I used it. I fixed it but it broke again. The rope actually came undone at the big knot which makes the hammock useless.  It sits very low with the bar & everything. It laid about 1/2 down between the cabinet & counter. So it doesn't really save space. I mounted it without the bar & that held it up higher.	-1
As others stated, falls apart.  I pulled on mine gently and one side came undone.  There is no "knot" to hold the hammock ends on the wood.  Just a string wrapped around each end and held by friction.  Also the string is very thing and cheap.  I found it cheaper just googling it.	-1
I ordred two of these for holding fruit in my VW camper van.  They would be perfect if they were better made.  One of them broke after just one week, and now I don't trust them to hold much fruit.  The rope loop end that loops around the dowel pulled out.  Rather expensive for something so cheap.  :-(	-1
The handle top arrived cracked, but that was not my problem with this fork. I am a woman 5'5" 125 and I found it to be way too heavy for me to use. It has an ultra long handle and nice tines, but I also ordered another fork at the same time that worked so much better for me. Truper 30330 Tru Tough 30-Inch Manure/Bedding Fork, 10-Tine, D-Handle,  It cost more but I love it.	-1
Disappointed. Had mine for about 2 months, one of the little side braces broke and hangs crooked. Gonna take it down and try to glue.	-1
Received this for Christmas year before last.  Finally threw it away last fall.  Plastic seed holder  would not sit properly to let seed fall out onto the tray.  The plastic cracked within a few months, the wood shingles on the roof separated and the whole thing became a mess to deal with.  Into the garbage it went!	-1
I was initially very impressed with these shears and quickly bought two additional pairs. After about two months of regular use the plastic nut that the pivot screw goes into would not stay adjusted letting the shears become loose and useless. Fiskars has had a reputation of being the leader in quality scissors and shears and I have to say I am very disappointed with these units. I hope to get in touch with their customer service dept. (if they have one) and acquire replacement units, however the plastic pivot nut is a bad manufacturing flaw that needs to be addressed.	-1
grip openings were too small to hold easily - sent them back	-1
The item broke on about the fourth or fifth use. It's cheaply made and though the handle is a good idea, the item just didn't work well. Don't recommend it. Get something sturdier.	-1
This feels very flimsy and weak, like a kid's toy, rather than a real tool. The hand-held one I bought from Lowe's feels so much studier and works much better.	-1
I've used Fisaks Micro Tip Pruner for years. I don't understand why a simple spring mechanism gets WORSE over the years. Engineers can't improve the simple spring to stay in place longer than a month of light indoor use? Or the open and close mechanism? It's a race to see which will break first. YEAH----The open/close mechanism won! Just boggles the mind!	-1
I anticipated a great product from Fiskars. However, this isn't one. The spring in the handle is too weak to open the shears when the blades get gunked up. This makes them a waste of time.	-1
I am 5'4" and after less than 10 minutes of using these I have an ache in my back from stooping over. They are too short for comfortable standing use.  Plus the blades are too short to make much headway trimming borders and such.  So if you'd like to stoop-over whilst trimmer your borders at a snail's pace, have at it. In my opinion they invite a chiropractic emergency without much to show for your suffering.  Annoyed because I really wanted a scythe but chickened out at the prospect of sharpening the blades and swinging those blades near my legs. This seemed like a good alternative, but they're not.  If only this tool had a longer shaft and longer blades.  I'm returning them.	-1
Does not cut plants of any thickness, significantly less than a pair of hand shears would cut.	-1
They fell apart literally after one season of light use.  I was able to prune 4 tomato plants with these and they were great  until it fell apart (blade just fell off from handle.)	-1
case cracked at sharp end first time it was dropped from arms length ,  cheap cover	-1
They were great for 1 season then on a seemingly small stem the blade broke.	-1
I wanted a alternative to gas or electric trimmers. These are hard to maneuver.	-1
Cheaply made. poor quality steel, not worth the money	-1
Mine broke in less than a year. One blade broke of. We regularly cleaned them and only used them to clip tomato suckers and tomatoes off the vines.	-1
This is designed well for those with back problems, but a poor trimmer for my weeds. Probably just intended to cut grass.	-1
Can't even cut fresh cut flowers. Stargazer lilies had rough edges after underwater cut.	-1
nah.  ackward and too short. i gave it away.	-1
These are flimsy and I guess if you're pruning African Violet leaves it would be ok, but for anything thicker or stronger than that, these things struggle!  I believe in the Fiskar name, which is why I bought these in the first place...but I have buyer's remorse.  Not sturdy enough to cut pepper branches of even some tomato branches.  I was hoping for more from Fiskar.	-1
I saw other reviewers say this pruner isn't good for small hands; it's not good for large hands, either. I tried using it wearing my gardening gloves, but it was too awkward, so I tried a few snips without gloves. Bad idea. There is an edge that rubbed uncomfortably against my knuckles; on the other side, if you are not resting your thumb on the top (which makes for a bad grip), there is a nasty pinch point where the handles come together. It ripped a bit of flesh off my thumb. I have only been using them for a couple of hours, so I haven't had the problem others have with it falling apart. If not for the terribly uncomfortable and awkward design, I could recommend it. It does seem to cut well.	-1
I've split less than a cord with this thing and the blade is already chipped. I also tried sharpening it with the Fiskars brand axe sharpener and that didn't help much. Lesson learned.	-1
SCAMMED--IT WAS PLASTIC	-1
Shown as brass and metal , all plastic junk , leaked and couldn't  be tightened .	-1
It leaks	-1
They don't last long, the rotating handle gears are just plastic and after very few uses they rotated on the gear to be one tooth over, meaning they would no longer be able to be locked shut to put in your pocket. Obviously cheap plastic construction where metal was needed to cut costs and utility at the same time. I regret this purchase.	-1
very hard to hold and use for arthritic hands.	-1
I bought these thinking they were the best. Wrong! My son had bought these and said they were great. He has a small yard and a few plants. We have a 2 acre orchard and cut fairly thick fruit tree branches grape vines etc. The rotating lower handle is awkward to say the least. Very cheaply designed. Really chincy. Just gave them to my wife as I know if we cut anything more substantial than a rose bush the silly rotating lower handle gears will break along with the thin sliding plastic blade lock. Big disappointment. Ordering a Corona Classic Cut Forged Bypass Pruner. I have Corona loppers and extended handle loppers for taller trees and am pleased not only with their performance but the ability to get replacement parts.	-1
These new FISKARS may look similar to the original but they are nothing more than a very cheap knock off. Go with hydro pharm or one of the others for the extra few bucks you"ll get far better tool.	-1
Regardless of how tight I screwed in the clamp, it still sprays water everywhere.  I tried it on three different types of standard hose and all of them had the same issue.  I was able to put a bunch of waterproof chaulk in it and that has helped quite a bit - but i have to renew it every month or so.	-1
I have been doing yard work for 40 years, so I am no "backyard rookie".  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The "PowerGear" fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.  Despite what a few other reviewers might say, everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews, both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.  I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said, I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly.	-1
I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.  8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands.	-1
Not what I envisioned. I bought these to trim my pond plants. The rigid non adjustable blade made them impractical for this purpose. Made for a nice pair of grass shears though as I didn't have to bend over.	-1
I have always been impressed with the high quality of all the Fiskar tools that I have used over the years, but this one is not for us that are left-handed.  It cuts very well, but it has accidentally locked while I'm pruning, and unlocked accidentally. The annoying blade locking design engages too often when I'm cutting flowers or trimming plants.  I am also critical of the way the handles awkwardly move when pruning.  I'm confident that it's a very well made pruner, but is poorly designed.	-1
After 2 years of regular use, the orange plastic in the hinge and gear crumbled and the tool fell apart.	-1
Wife didn't like this.	-1
I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas. I tried it out but decided to return it. Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer (18 volt) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do. I wanted it to work for me but no way!	-1
Fell apart after an hour of use. As with other Fiskars products, quality has fallen off a cliff. Much better options out there.	-1
Chipped the first day using after splitting a log and hitting a small rock on the ground. Use for strictly wood!	-1
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner	-1
I bought this for pruning crepe myrtles. Most of the branches are too large in diameter and using hand lopper with handles on a ladder is much more effective. And for really large limbs an electric chain  saw works, too.	-1
These used to be my go-to trimmers, but for the past year or so they have been breaking, a lot!  Mainly the little spring - I have 6 pair of trimmers in front of me with broken springs. Two of these are one month old.  I don't know if they started making them cheaper or what but I've had it. I'm going with another brand from now on.  The blades don't hold an edge so well, but it's not too important for me. What IS important is that they don't break!!!  I can't recommend these anymore.	-1
Found it for half the price a week later at Home Depot....	-1
Action works well enough, but the blades only cut if you use the very tips.  I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools.	-1
Broke within the first pickup load of wood. The axe head went flying and could have hurt somebody very easily. Not safe. Didn't show any signs of damage until complete failure.	-1
Used for one summer, the next summer the sprinkler now gets stuck after one pass of water, once it reaches the chosen width one one side using the yellow tabs it stops oscillating.	-1
bLASDES TWIST WHEN USING	-1
of this coupler.  It seems to be more trouble that it is worth.  Just as easy, if not easier, to screw two hoses together.	-1
I used it twice and the top of the cutting section fell off and the line pulled of the handle.	-1
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!! It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade. I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this. I'll give it to my brother.  :>) Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.	-1
The information about this does NOT make it clear that you are only buying half of the needed parts to make it a quick connector!  I bought this and then found out that the part that is needed to attach to the hose is not in the package!  Now I have to return it since it will cost almost double to buy the parts separately!  I feel cheated and I'm very disappointed in Amazon!	-1
Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.  First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!  I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?  I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.	-1
VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK STANDING UP. THOUGHT THESE SHEARS WOULD BE EASY TO HANDLE, RATHER THAN THE HAND SHEARS THAT YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO SIT ON GROUND TO USE...GUESS I WILL HAVE TO USE GAS POWERED EDGERS TO DO THE JOB...CAN'T SIT ON GROUND ANYMORE....OR ELSE HIRE SOMEONE...GETTING OLD!!!  LIFE GOES FAST,  "LIKE A JET" !!! REMEMBER THAT !! I DID RETURN IT, CAN'T REMEMBER IF I WAS CREDITED,,THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT GOES  "YOUR MEMORY"	-1
The pruners are sharp and blades line up nicely, but the whole design of the locking mechanism makes them unusable! How Fiskar released these is causing me to have second thoughts about their products. I purchased an expensive pair of Fiskar shears that had a similar issue. But, the design on this is just terrible! You cannot make more than 2-3 cuts before the locking mechanism engages. It doesn't stay in the open position and the design is such that it stutters, stops and makes cutting difficult. The locking mechanism is destroying itself every time this happens, and I expect they will be trash in a week. Asking for refund! Don't waste your time or money on these! Fiskar should recall them!!!! Shame on you Fiskar!	-1
First time I used it, small branches from a rosemary bush poked right through the boatto, which seems to be madevfrom a very thin, plastic material. I have had a WORX pop-up bagebformtwo years and never had a hole. Fiskars is supposed to make quality products, and the overall quality is excellent.  I also like the larger size of this bag. But the bottom is it's Achille's heel. If you never put anything but rose petals and leaves in it, I guess it's OK. But the bottom is very fragile.	-1
Get the Titanium ones these don't stay sharp very long	-1
I started chopping firewood a long while ago, but broke my axe and had to borrow my father-in-law's splitting axe. He had a Fiskars, brand new, axe and I was eager to try it out. Unfortunately, I can't wear gloves because I'm extremely prone to blisters(I've tried them all an no-gloves lead to less blistering); without gloves this axe is very slippery and the plastic handle makes for a bone-shattering vibration. I actually damaged my elbow from this axe because it slipped into the wood and slammed into my elbow causing swelling in my humeral fat pad. I'm sure it's a great axe for people who have never tried a wood handle with griptape; but, for me, it was an expensive axe head with a cheaply made shaft. Needless to say, I immediately went out and bought a real splitter with a wood shaft.	-1
I bought this axe to break up some chunks of mulberry that were just too heavy to lift onto the hydraulic log splitter.  The first couple went great, splitting pieces of with a single blow.  Then I hit a soft spot and the axe head split off and flew into the yard.	-1
The metal broke cracked	-1
useless product.  its made of cheap plastic that broke very quickly.  Spend a little more and get a good quality metal one.	-1
Spring in the middle broke in a week and just another cheap piece of junk that somehow got good ratings.	-1
They are TINY. They are not comfortable to use and they seem to get lost in my hand. I never imagined they would be so small. Should have gone for the cheap, larger, no name types. And not even a holder or belt clip. Too small and Overpriced..	-1
plastic piece that locks it when you are done using breaks and the blades remain open all the time.  Also, the spring comes off.	-1
I had great hopes for this.  I've long searched for ways to cut weeds without having to bend over.  This tool is lightweight, enough so for one-handed use.  Perhaps durability was sacrificed for weight, but after being used for only a short time, the spring in the mechanism up top dislodged somehow and the blades would no longer open correctly.  No amount of trying to grab the end of that  spring with longnosed pliers would work to pop it back where it was supposed to go.  The tool is riveted, not bolted together, thereby preventing me from taking it apart to try to fix it.  I had to toss it in the trash as it was useless, taking up room, and irreparable.  I've had other stuff from Fiskars that I was happy with, for example a bypass pruner with long handles and a gear mechanism for leverage.	-1
quit working after a couple weeks	-1
This is the best oscillating sprinkler I have ever had HOWEVER, as others have said, it breaks after a short time. The plastic tabs that adjust the oscillation and width of spray break off and then it is simply a fixed oscillator - stuck in whatever position it was in when it broke. No better than the cheapest one from a dollar store. Melnor - get with it! Make these tabs out of metal or stronger plastic so they don't break off!	-1
Worked great until after 3-6 months it just exploded out the edges.	-1
Cheap and it broke soon after I got it	-1
This seemed to be a very handy items for leaves and misc lawn debris.  However, after only two uses the bottom started to tear out (see photos).  Fortunately Amazon will take it back.  I think this item would work OK if kept entirely on a lawn or other soft surface.  If you intend to use it on your patio or walkways I would think twice, because of the very thin fragile bottom.	-1
I generally am pleased with Fiskars products, but this one I don't like at all.  Before ordering this, I read most of the 1-star reviews.  I ignored them, because I believe the majority of the concerns  were the result of using this splitter for the wrong job--concerns about breakage and safety, but they were using this for a job that requires a splitting maul, not a small splitting axe--i.e., serious chunks of wood, or even cants.  An axe this size is designed for small stuff and kindling.  Okay, so here's what bothers me.  One, the handle is too long.  It just isn't right for, say, holding a board and splitting it for kindling.  Two, and much more important, the plastic handle is dangerously slippery.  It's prone to flying out of your hand unless you're wearing some serious gripper gloves.  This is simply unacceptable.  So, I'm going back to one of the Estwing splitters.  We gave a friend (a logger) the Estwing E3-FF4 blue one-piece as a gift and she loves it.  I had their EFF4SE splitter for years (the one with the leather ring handle), and loved it, but it has gone missing.  Sorry, Fiskars.	-1
These are okay, but they are so small that there is not much that can be cut by them.	-1
Pretty sharp but the pair I received have a definite drawback in that the little orange slide lock has a tendency to ride up while in use which makes them unusable until you stop and push the darn thing back down. This happens over and over again which is very frustrating. For this reason I cannot recommend this product.	-1
Arrived with bent blades that rub at the tips. Poor quality control.	-1
Only shoots water four feet.  Possibly because the product box inside the shipping box was crushed and taped up.  It's all plastic and cheaply constructed.  Don't buy.	-1
It worked for a day then completely stopped oscillating.  The sprinkler will only spray to one side and will not resume the oscillation cycle.  The spray width adjust functions but otherwise the sprinkler is useless. It's lightweight plastic and apparently its  not built to last even for a few days.	-1
Junk! have purchased 3 over the years (my mistake). ALL have broken off at the spigot connection. The company refused to honor the 2-year warranty.	-1
These r great IF you don't have many hrs. of work to do. For me, any spring loaded snips r prone to give me numbing in hands. I prefer the ARS brand, have collection of varied ARS snips and some decades old but oerform like those right out of the box. Better than other bonsai or botanicals snips, ARS brand stays super sharp and admit have no problems if cutting fine, fine manicure or thru that massive main stem. For all your oils, butters, tinctures, salves, lotions..use code for discount http://magicalbutter.refr.cc/G88G4CL Happy!	-1
I started using this in June. Two months and maybe 30 uses later it no longer oscillates. At $20 this makes it a bad buy. Find something metal, not %100 plastic. I liked the features, but only if they work.	-1
Junk.  Do not buy these .  Bottom wears out in one season.  needs to be re-inforced.	-1
I bought it to repair a standard rubber hose.  Unfortunately there is no way that you could fit a 5/8 inch hose into the gripping mechanism unless the hose was made of the cheapest, and thinnest possible material.  Even if you did the nub in the mechanism that the hose slides onto is no more than a half inch wide and would surely leak.  To top it all off, theres no way on god's green earth that the twist on flange, designed to tighten the whole fixture, could slide over the standard rubber hoses I have.  I have to assume that these are just mislabeled as 5/8 inch sizes.  Leaving the size issue aside, there's no way this is made of brass unless we've all suddenly been transported to the moon and brass weighs less than it has my whole life.  I'd probably take a pass on this and buy the Gilmore twin on unit instead, which while wider is at least properly sized.	-1
Well i had this for past year except it broke in two because I been using it a lot for my plants so yeah it worn of so quick there and also it is very sharp to cut things to be very gentle with using this one.	-1
Yellow plastic loop for adjusting arc became brittle from sun (UV) damage and broke off. Come on after just 1 season of use! Isn't this made to be used outdoors?	-1
Junk.  It oscillated for ten minutes the first time I hooked it up and then quit.  Now it sprays but doesn't move at all.  I don't expect much from these - a season or two, but ten minutes is a new record.  Save your money.	-1
WHEN ...am I going to stop forgetting to read reviews! This "heavy-Duty" "metal" twist nozzle weighs in at 1.7 ounces. My REAL HEAVY DUTY twist nozzle sprayer I thought it looked a lot like weighs 5.7 ounces. I thought I WAS getting a deal with the words used to describe this..."heavy Duty".."Metal" . Looks like brass to me. But, after scraping away some of the coating it is a silver "metal"...Aluminum? Not even stainless steel...WOW!	-1
When it worked it was great, but it stopped working after just over a month. It sprays to the point where it would normally change directions and just stays in the position, flooding a small section of my yard until I notice it.	-1
Terrible piece of equipment. It lasted about a year and the internals went bad. It would not screw in and out and leaked Niagara Falls on a rainy day.  Don't buy this thing. I threw it away and just bought a much better similar product.  I have the old-time brass nozzle my father had on his garden hose and it is over 60 years old. It works great without leaks and there is not much quality in anything these days. I wish for the 1950's again.	-1
While made well they don't perform well. When you open it up for the jet spray you get a kinda jet spray with a lot of broadcast. I've had cheap Dollar Store nozzles work better	-1
Advertised as brass but it is the thinnest brass I have seen in my 67 years. I tried it 1 time and threw it in the trash, not even worth returning.	-1
All the advertised functions had me excited and all worked EXCEPT the main feature... It doesn't Oscillate as designed Yes I had plenty of pressure. Build seemed cheap to me and wasn't surprised when it didn't work.	-1
I bought four of these last spring and all of them are broken. It absolutely infuriates me that so many garden supplies are made of plastics that deteriorate in the sun. It's an outdoor item! Make it durable enough to withstand outdoors! ERGH! Such a waste of money and space in a landfill.  They work great when they work. If you are willing to put the oscillator inside between uses it will last you much longer. The width adjustment would probably break anyways though, it's flimsy plastic and a poor design.	-1
I've piurchased four of these sprinklers; only one lasted more that a season and two not even that long. The plastic that controls the spread of the nozzles gets brittle very quickly in the sun and break when you try to adjust it. That featuers is therefore useless pretty quickly. After that they will start to hang up and you have to walk over and give it some help. The nozzles also clog easily. One thing that helps is not to let the sprinklers lie around in the dirt or mulch because dirt and debris gets into the system and clogs the mechanism.	-1
Not to Sun Friendly ! Plastic drys out and breaks	-1
Used it for one day and sprinkler quit oscillating. I bought 2 am not happy..	-1
Bought two of these to help with grass seed germination around a new farm pond. The first one worked only a few minutes and the second one works off and on, hangs up every few minutes and is very unreliable. I gave them a good review after a quick trial but these sprinklers are a genuine piece of junk. Dont waste your money.	-1
I would LOVE them if they would ever get here... I have used these for years, every year they are the perfect tool for trimming & fine work at a great price so ordering several sets doesn't break the bank (its a good idea to order 3 per person so that the other 2 can be sitting in alcohol being cleaned while your using the nice freshly cleaned pair) Yea, the spring is crappy & falls off sometimes, so does the latch, but really? who cares, its cheap & sharp and does a great job.  I had to write what is written above because Amazon wouldn't post my initial review of where the heck is my order? unless my review talked about the product, so that's my review of the product that I still haven't gotten! I ordered many of these on Sept 12th because I like them and need them right away and I'm still waiting! Prime 2 day shipping  yea right....Its now Sept 24th and they are still not here.  I got one notification LAST week saying they would be here TODAY, Now today I got another notification saying they will be here on OCT 1st? Why would you offer 2 day shipping and advertise "need them in two days, order by this time..." when its obviously a LIE! Where is my order?  **UPDATE** After posting this review and complaining to Amazon, I now have a "Guaranteed delivery date" of Friday Sept 26th, we will see if they actually get here by THIS "Guaranteed" date & I will then update this review to more stars & better comments if they do....I'm not holding my breath....  **UPDATE #2** Yes, it is now Friday Sept 26th & even after emails from Amazon promising their delivery...they are still NOT here! I finally called Amazon and spoke to an actual person who FINALLY found the problem with my order (which someone should have found & made me aware of WEEKS AGO!) and they are NOW Guaranteed to be here by TUESDAY...as for now...I'm still waiting....	-1
On the second use a small tear appeared on the bottom; now after 4 uses the bottom is like a sieve.  I'll probably get 1 more use before 2 holes join up to become a tear.  Too bad.  It's really handy, but needs a much stronger bottom	-1
not as pictured in the description photo.  I've used this model before and was interested in the one pictured, which had a different texture on the handle.  Was sent the smooth style handle.  Also, the package is taped sloppily around it's center, holding the plastic covering and cardboard backing together.  Looks like it was returned and re-packaged.  It's pretty dirty inside the plastic, too.  I've seen amazon sending out more returned items lately and it's a bad practice and will not do anything for customer trust.	-1
Returned it.  I have excellent water pressure.  I have a 3/4 inch hose.  The front area I was trying to water is about 1,000 square feet.  Nope, it did not cover that area.  It does not oscillate low enough as it goes to the side; and it does not for whatever reason put out enough water.  And, there are not enough nozzles!  At the edges of the watered area are stripes from where the nozzles are too far out.  And I adjusted it in some; as the area I was watering was narrow.	-1
This product broke during pruning.  Use heavier gauge.	-1
I really don't like this class of products.  Too much plastic.  I threw this one out and went for the one that was green.  I cannot remember the name.  I don't expect any of these to last any more than five years , not just because of the internal parts, but also because I find my long hoses (50-100 feet) getting yanked sideways and am waiting for the day this thing snaps.  I've tried it inline with two hoses.  It also works, but again, the yanking problem concerns me.  I would not buy again.  BTW, buy a rubber hose, not these "garden" hoses.  They cost 2x and will last at least 2x the life and save a lot of foul language.	-1
Only lasted 2 months	-1
Don't buy this kind of timer no matter how cheap it is. I v bought 4 at homedepot. Three of them went down in a week. It will stop working properly under one super slightly incorrect operation.  It's a bad product.	-1
I had one that seemed to get inaccurate then failed altogether, now it's relatively new replacement has failed.  I'm trying another brand.	-1
I thought it was pretty basic and would last but I was wrong. After 3 months of use the dial now spins freely and nothing can be set. Also when it was operable it shuts the water off in a very abrupt way causing a quick bang through my water pipes. Other timers should last longer although this one was not expensive.	-1
I would rate it zero star if I could. I bought two of them. I had them for less than 4 months and it is falling apart. Will never buy again. I have other gardening containers from another brand which have lasted 3 years. Avoid this product by all means.	-1
The sprinkler is nicely adjustable - best oscillating sprinkler I have ever used.  But the timer doesn't work and that was my reason for buying this particular one.  Looks like you either get a timer that works or one that doesn't and I lost out.	-1
Updated review. Stopped working after 3 months!!!	-1
I bought and returned two of these. The first was missing the plug at the end which contains an unnecessary plastic pin to clear the jets (don't people own pins anymore?). The second had the missing part but that didn't help much. The tiny tabs which hold it in place were no match for the o-ring which relies on their strength to compress and seal it in place! As soon as the water was turned on one tab broke off and it leaked as if it wasn't there. In an attempt to add an unimportant feature the entire usefulness of the product was sacrificed! Trying to hit a price point, not produce a useful product!	-1
I have owned 2 of these previously; over the years the spring rusted and clip broke (my bad, I forgot outside far too many times).  went to HD recently and saw these for a pretty good price, and decided to replace the old ones.  soon as I opened the package, the spring fell off and the lock clip got stuck.  they still cut well, but if the spring and lock don't work, I can simply buy a small pair of scissors.  going back to the store.  somebody mentioned Hydrofarms - hopefully they are a better product.	-1
Got this locally at the beginning of watering season because I wanted a GOOD sprinkler.  I did not have trouble with it oscillating unless it was turned very, very low.  Good coverage, loved the flexibility of all the different adjustments.  Unfortunately one of the plastic adjustments at the center bar broke off making the adjustments very limited.  Too much $ for only part of a season.	-1
I liked the curved blade that hydofarm makes. I have ordered many pairs of the Fiskars soft touch I find that I always lose the springs for the scissors. I love the other products that Fiskars makes tho.	-1
Design is great, but the plastic is not at all rugged. The handle used to adjust flow broke after just a few uses.  Treat it like cheap plastic and you will be happy I'd return it / exchange it if I could.	-1
Contrary to glowing reviews, I did not find that the X11 measured up to my expectations.  Let me preface my remarks by saying that I used to heat my home with a wood stove for 10 years.  I cut, split and stacked all of the wood with plenty of experience with a splitting maul.  I am retired now and my wood stove days are over.  I now have a Chiminea on my patio and buy bundled and rough split wood.  I needed to split some of this wood for kindling.  I purchased both the Fiskars X11 and the Estwing Fireside Friend from Amazon.  I found the X11 to be well made, light and comes with a handy sheath.  The problem is that the wood must be straight grained, and fairly dry.  Any knots or wet wood presents a definite splitting issue.  Now I realize this is not a splitting maul, but it just does not perform.  If your wood is fairly dry and straight grained, no knots, it flys through them.  Now the Eswing is simply an animal!  It goes through straight grained wood like warm butter mainly because it weighs 4 lbs.  For those logs that have some knots, or is wet like the Home Depot wood that they store outside, a 2 lb. sledge hammer will split virtually anything.	-1
I will have to differ with others who rave on this. The loop that let's you button the thing flat broke the first time I used it.  After a reasonable amount of use, the spring started coming through the sides.  Pricey for a less than well-made piece of equipment.  Wish it could be tougher	-1
Failed after less than 5 cord of wood. The head bounced off the log and went flying.  I liked it until then. See picture; their claim of unbreakable handle is nonsense. Temp was below freezing... maybe it is more brittle in the cold?  I'm sure they will send a replacement but i'll be slightly nervous using it, especially in the cold.	-1
The technology in this sprinkler is quite wonderful, but for me, it has one fatal flaw: the oscillation is very fast, about once every 2 seconds.  That makes it impossible to set the width and pattern without getting completely soaked.  The mechanism for setting width and pattern are unique and better than other oscillating sprinklers, but high oscillation rate is why I'm returning it.	-1
Like so many others have commented, this unit's concept is fine, but after only a few uses it has stopped oscillating -- making it useless.	-1
Bought 6 of these last year to make a poor man's automatic sprinkling system for our freshly planted grass.  They worked great for the first year, and I was very pleased with them.  This year, I re-planted a smaller area and needed them again.  So far, I've only taken out two of them (the rest are still in storage), but the two that I've taken out both have problems.  On the first one, the plastic for the width adjustment control was so weak that it just broke off when I tried to adjust it, but it is otherwise still functional.  The other one no longer oscillates *at all*, although it was fine when I put it away at the end of last summer.  These were stored indoors, at ~60 degrees all winter, so it's not due to cold weather.  Garbage.	-1
If you like getting so mad you take a sledge hammer to your sprinkler then this is the sprinkler to buy!  Seriously - at first it seems like a great deal - you get it all setup, turn the water on to the correct pressure you need - things look great, it has very good coverage, it's moving back and forth - so you go inside and set your timer but..... when you return to move the sprinkler to the next area you find the stupid thing has stopped moving and has flooded one area making mud puddles and soaking your wooden fence and wasting TONS of water and most importantly NOT watering the lawn you bought the darn thing for in the first place.  Forever thinking all bad things are 'my' fault I decide maybe it's where I set the sprinkler - the lawn isn't real even - maybe that's why it stopped turning - so I move it to another area trying to make sure it's flat - nice and even where I set the sprinkler.  Then I go through the whole process all over again.  Sometimes it works fine - but the next time it doesn't - you never know if it will work or not.  I got so mad I smashed the piece of plastic crap to pieces with a sledge hammer - didn't fix the sprinkler but I sure felt a heck of alot better!!!!  :)	-1
DULL AFTER 2 CUTTINGS JUNK , I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE ARE GARBAGE I WISH I COULD RETURN THESE BUT DULL AND IN TRASH!!!	-1
After watching several videos with people easily splitting wood, I thought this would be a breeze.  Turns out, it's not so great with dense wood like maple.  Wood doesn't pop apart like you see on the YouTube videos.  We ended up getting a pro wood splitter to come in and do the job in a day.  Manually, with large pieces, it would've taken weeks.  Perhaps it works if your wood is already broken up or the diameter is smaller.  But for big chunks this isn't the right tool.	-1
This is a review on a Melnor Deluxe model lawn sprinkler. I paid more hoping to get more. The "Deluxe Model". Didn't work correctly right out of the box. It will not oscillate. It is brand new! I don't know about you guys, but I just love buying brand new products that don't work. Or, maybe I don't. I should have read the reviews first. It seems that almost every product out there today has been cheapen out to the point that nothing you buy today works for long if at all. My 33 year Johnson Outboard works perfectly, my 30 year old Lawn Boy mower works perfectly, my two 35 year old Homelite Chainsaws, yea they still run great. But you can't buy a simple lawn sprinkler that works when it is new. Junk is Junk, but is seems to be the only thing Corporate (or would that be Corp Pirate?} America has to offer these days. If I could buy a reliable product I would. I'm probably not the only one out there that thinks this way either. Anyway, this lawn sprinkler is junk.	-1
This worked one season.  Now it's junk.  ANY sprinkler will work for a year--the problem is getting one that doesn't then break.  Don't listen to anyone who's had it for less than a year.	-1
I ONLY USED Fiskar soft touch trimmers, pruners, loppers etc because IMHO they HAD made the best. Most recently I had to replace two pairs of the Soft Touch Pruning Scissors that are approx 8+ years old and had ben sharpened professionally a few times over the years and were my favorite pair, so much so that over the next year or two of buying my first 2 I then purchased 12 more pairs for other gardeners in my family and for some friends. When I received the 2 new pairs I bought I was in shock, right away you can just feel how cheap they feel in comparison to the original model. The old model was made in the USA and Ill assume the new version is not since the imprint "Made in the USA" is no longer on the package/scissor blade. After the 2 full day of use the spring popped on the one pair and the same day while using the 2nd pair the plastic slide which locks the blades popped off as well!! I went back online and purchased Hydrofarms equivilant to Fiskars, not only are they a cheaper price, they came with a free belt holder to hold the scissors while you are in the garden.	-1
Yes, this is a great sprinkler, when it works, but as many have stated, it will stop working, likely in less that a year. Mine stopped oscillating in about 6 months. I don't recommend it. Those of you that wrote great reviews when you first got it, make sure you follow-up when it breaks.	-1
Axe head broke during -14 below weather.  Not recommended for cold weather.	-1
I had the model before this.  With it you could adjust independently the streams on the sides.  With this model you adjust both sides at once.  With the other one, as you shut down the streams, the length of the remaining streams increased.  This doesn't do that.  It is not as durable.  I ordered this in April and this weekend I broke the tab off the adjustment lever.  I am stuck with it wide open now.	-1
the lock/unlock slide, pinches hand between the slide lock and against the other handle (the lock slide stays attached to one side, sliding up and down, and it pinches skin against the other handle when using cutters wheither the slide is in lock or unlock mode, it pinches in either position when cutting or pruning).  they are not as sharp as other brands either.  just not a commercial or 'use on a regular basis' type of product.  the pinching will make you throw them in the garbage, the cutting is actually not too bad, but i only use these for emergency, when i can't find my other pair.	-1
I got this for me, but gave it to my wife.  I wanted something heavy-duty for cutting vines, etc. in our wooded area, but these work better for gardening / cutting fresh flowers.  I was looking for something more "beefy", but this seemed a little delicate for my use. My wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden.  It was likely my fault for buying this product for something that it was not intended for; and it does work very well for what it was designed to do.  I liked the rubber tip cover for when you throw it in your pocket.  I do wish that you could hang this up on a peg-board, but there's no opening to do this with, and the blades are heavier than the handle so it would hang tip down.  Instead we have to throw it in the "gardening tool drawer" where it is slightly more difficult to find.  UPDATE: after one season of use, my wife has broken these sheers cutting in the vegetable garden.  She admits that the item that was being cut was too big for the sheers, but they should be more durable.	-1
I've used these Fiskars micro-tip snippers for over ten years.  Back in the day, the handles were darker gray in color and they lasted a long time.  Ever since they started making them with lighter gray handles with a more pronounced stipple grip, the quality has deteriorated. The spring in the middle is now a very flimsy plastic, which breaks after prolonged use. I'm not positive if the older pruners had a metal spring instead of plastic, but I do know that the older version of these lasted 3 - 4x longer. The springs break on the newer types after a month or two of use.  There are more heavy duty types of these snippers available, but I always preferred the Fiskars brand due to them being ultra light-weight.	-1
I used these lopping shears a few times before they just broke right in the middle of a cut.  I'm not sure where all the good reviews come from, because all the one-star reviews demonstrate the same basic weakness of this product, which is the low quality of the metal. It appears to be a low quality pot metal, which is a weak and brittle metal. Not a wise, or practical thing to use in lopping shears, which put pressure on the metal during routine use.  I can only assume that the positive reviews were left by people cutting their rose bushes.  For tree branches, this is a VERY BAD CHOICE.  Steer clear if you're pruning anything more than roses!	-1
Very poor design. You have to open the handles to wide for larger branches.  Doesn't work in a tight spot.	-1
Overpriced, blade is made of cheap metal- have to sharpen after every single use.  Would never buy again	-1
It actually split pretty well about 70% of the time. I found myself grabbing my 8lb maul to get through Alot of wood, mostly mulberry. To be FAIR most of it was wrought with knots.  The steel could definetly be of higher quality. The edge seems to chip easily. If not for that l would probably give it 4-5 stars. l guess l will have to split a different type of wood to really see.	-1
I hate these loppers with a passion.  Using this tool is slow and cumbersome.  They are difficult to use because the handles have to be too far apart before even fitting a  inch branch.  Prefer to use my $17 worth garden lopper as my go to tool. Can clip through twice as many branches in the same amount to time with my cheaper tool	-1
Handle broke under moderate pressure. Not impressed even a little. Submitted claim to Fiskars...we'll see what happens and I'll follow-up. BTW, handles are plastic. Ours broke INSIDE the cutter head portion. How that could happen is a mystery. Not abused - my wife was using them at the time.	-1
Works great.	-1
The blades are great, but I find it almost impossible to use for my purpose.  I got these so I can cut away unwanted bamboo around my huge prickly pear cactus. I was super excited when it came in and ran out to test it just to find out that it's almost impossible to cut the bamboo around the cactus because in order to grip the branch (or bamboo in my case) you need a lot of open space around, which defeats the purpose because I have cactus thorns in that space which I am trying to avoid! And even with regular branches - you have to get really close to the branch (because you have to open up the darn thing real wide), so the length listed is deceptive. I want to be able to cut a branch that's two feet away without the need to get within 5 inches of it!	-1
Plastic.  What else can I say?	-1
the blade is already dammaged	-1
Love the convenience and how easy it is to connect and change hoses and sprinklers. But haven't had these even a year, used very lightly, and the connectors all have developed leaks and spray water all over when under pressure. Not surprising since they are all plastic, but I sure don't want to have to be constantly buying new ones all the time as easily as these break. Will be looking for a similar system that holds up to use a bit better.	-1
The geared action makes this lopper really easy to use.  Unfortunately, the cutting blades are too thin and soft.  Cutting a few dead branches that were 1.5 inches thick -- a size this unit is supposed to handle -- left large dents in the blade.  Back it goes.	-1
Not recommended - The slightest side pressure on the hose at the Gardena quick connection results in a leak.  Not very pleasant to have cold wet feet and hands on a cold windy day. Makes one wonder why the quick connects were purchased.  You are better off spending the time using standard threaded hose connection.	-1
I love how this kind of product works.  I was disappointed with this brand.  It leaks at connections.  The version in solid brass from home depot, with additional lever shut off switches at each connection are far superior.  If you can deal with leaky connections,  these are really convenient.  once attached to ends , everything connects and disconnects within one second..effortless!	-1
Broke after first use, thank god for Home Depot hardware not it's good.  The pressed in bolt holding both halfs together gave way and pulled through during its first use.	-1
I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy, but I gave them a try anyway.  After only one month at the end of a light duty hose, the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup, it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope, or pumping benzene through it.  I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years, but never snap in half like that.  Next time I'll listen to that little voice.	-1
I have used Gardena for 35 years and it is the only way to go. Anybody who does not use quick connect for their hoses is simply struggling for no reason. Even in AZ they stand up to the sun although if you drop the hoses on a concrete surface they do crack as they become a little brittle. Not generally known is that Gardena make 2 types of accessory adapters - gray as a universal (European thread) and orange as the US thread. Having come from outside the USA I have both. The gray thread works in the USA but leaks a little and it drives me nuts as it drips while using various sprayers and nozzles. This set comes with gray adapters and being sold by Amazon to US customers should have the correct adapters. Amazon also sell a 2pack of adapters (i bought them not realizing) and they are also universal and not US. The correct itemk is a Gardena 2922 to be found at [...] Not sure where to find the orange ones, but be aware. Amazon should get it right. I give Gardena 5 stars, but this pack is incorrect and I mark it down .. a lot.	-1
...and then is came apart...soft use in a meadow...was not dragged over anything harsh...rim is coming apart...VERY DIFFICULT TO HOOK THE CLOSURE...	-1
Doesn't Drain, bottom rips easy	-1
Lasted a year and half then broke.  Have been in touch with customer service though and I believe they will replace them.  Will update this after I deal with them.	-1
I have had two of the Fiskars 10 gallon containers and neither lasted more than 2 years - the bottom blew out of both of them very quickly - an expensive waste. I was disappointed with the 1st one I bought but, I thought I might have been hard on it so I decided to take it very easy on the 2nd one. No difference in longevity. The fabric abrades fairly quickly and the spring pops out of the bottom. The strength of the spring continues tearing the bottom out. It wouldn't take too much effort to design a sturdier bottom. Or, put a hard shell on it like the one on the 30 gallon Fiskars container.  I purchased the 30 gallon Fiskars container with the hard shell in April of '09 and it's still in great shape, 4 1/2 years later. No rips, tears, or worn (abraded) areas. I routinely stuff it with bougainvillea and citrus branches - both have thorns - there are very tiny punctures from one variety of bougainvillea that has 2 inch thorns but so far the container is still in great shape. It gets weekly use throughout the year. The hard shell on the bottom makes an enormous difference on longevity. This is the superior designed container, although a lot larger in size than the 10 gallon product. I understand that the 30 gallon may be too large for many folks.	-1
These Kangaroo totes are not made of as durable material as years ago.  The 9414 is especially bad.  The 9404 a bit better. But not a tough canvas.  The handles far INWARD, not outward like the picture. Someone needs to make a better version of a lightweight tote for garden use with handles	-1
The metal shafts only extends a short distance into the plastic handles and aren't locked in place. After one season the plastic handles kept coming loose over and over while cutting.  Gluing works for awhile, but they eventually work loose again and have to be glued again.  Very poor system for attaching the handles.  Also, the handles have to be opened very wide to do even small cuts.  On the plus side it cuts very easily when the handles stay on.	-1
The idea of a pop-up bag is great, and the button down tabs also excellent. While others complain of the handle pulling out, my experience was that the buttons ripped out of the seam after only a couple of uses.  Eventually, the bottom fabric wore out leaving  the springs exposed.  Would be great to have a durable version--double or triple sown seams--of this item.  Thought it was too expensive for its short life.	-1
I hung this on my garage wall using the supplied axe holder/carrier and within 5 minutes, the axe slipped out of the holder and came crashing down.  Luckily I was 3 feet to the right and the axe blade fell onto a bag of sand which it sliced open so I wasn't hurt, but if the holder is made specifically to hold the axe and it just drops this thing, that is a terrible and dangerous hazard.  If they stop selling the axe with the holder then I may change my rating, but as long as they continue to say  that the carrying case can also be used to hang the axe on the wall, this rating remains at zero.  I just cannot believe how this got past quality control.  3 minutes on the wall, the holder was latched closed, and the axe just stretched the latch and fell out.	-1
This lopper requires that you open the handles really far in order to get a 1" plus branch in the jaws. That, I feel is is wasted motion, especially if you have a lot of pruning to do. Also the gear is not like that pictured in the add. The gears look flimsy and easy to mis-align. The handles are ovalized, therefore your hands must press on the narrow edges of this oval, therefore will dig into hands. I returned it an found a traditional scissor type with long 36" handles for leverage.	-1
The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers.  if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.  If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot.	-1
Most of the gardening tools that you can buy online or in the stores are just toys. Unfortunately this is no different. The handles are made of plastic (the metal handle inside is very short) and they broke after a couple of months of light use. I can understand people giving this a high rating because it's light and easy to use, but if you want a tool that would last don't buy this. I am still looking for a good long lasting lopper tool... Pros: light, good grip Cons: breaks like a plastic toy, price (for how long it lasts).	-1
The PowerGear feature is this product's achilles heel, which can make cutting larger branches (say 1-inch or more) very difficult or impossible.  PowerGear works by using a reduction gear near the blade.  This means you have to open the handles much, much wider than other loppers.  For example, to cut a 2-inch branch the handles need to be opened literally 180 degrees apart, i.e. all the way open.  This means pruning a branch that is in close proximity to other branches (the usual case) just isn't going to happen.  I will say the price is good and the blade seems very sharp and durable.  In my experience however, this simply is not a tool for serious pruning.  At this point I will have to buy a traditional loopper to maintain the trees in my yard.	-1
I've had this for four years.  It leaked from day one.  Finally took it down to see if I could fix it.  The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $9.50. On a 4 year old item, replacing the part doesn't make sense. Since this hose is right next to my front door, I have to have some sort of reel.  I'll look elsewhere.	-1
I wonder how people buy this and think it won't eventually leak. Maybe using a cheap, lightweight 25' hose might be ok, but for any real heavy duty 75 or 100' garden hose, forget it.  Besides it's only supported on one end, the other mistake.	-1
We just bought and installed this today - it leaks like a sieve! We are taking it back to the store - I do not recommend this product at all. I had to give it one star to post the review, but I wouldn't give it 1/2 star.	-1
The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.	-1
Cheap cheap Cheap. Tese must be tin or aluminum. Just go buy a new hose	-1
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  Half the usual price.  Very cheap.  The amount of threading is less than a good set.  We'll see how it holds up.	-1
This does not work so well.  As another reviewer stated, one side seems fine (the side further from the water pressure) while the other side leaks profusely.  I tightened that clamp so hard that the flathead screw started to strip (hand tightened as hard as I could turn!!).  That slowed the leaking a bit, but it still leaks.  Not sure what the problem is, because the design appears to be good, but something needs to be resolved with that leakage.  I would have given only one star, but it was easy to put onto the hose and since I was able to slow the leakage, I figured a second star was in order.  If I knew of a better product, I'd probably buy that one instead and return this one.	-1
The Brass couplings seem well made, but one of the Stainless Steel hose clamps broke (came apart at the 'crimped joint') within one month.	-1
Title is wrong - description is correct - this is for 1/2" hose.  At least when I purchased it.	-1
the design of the valve employs 2 sharp angles which reduce the water pressure to very low, too low to use the hose to clean a patio for example. a shame 'coz the item looks reasonably good.	-1
Returned this after reading reviews. Not heavy enough, have to step on it when winding hose. More convenient to use a $3 hose hanger !	-1
Way too small, the website said it would hold a 100' hose, I doubt if a 50' would have fit on it.	-1
I have a 50 ft hose in this and in about a year it broke in an essential place. The connection of the hose to the inside drum is a 90 degree elbow and you screw your hose on to it. I guess after some use, the weight and pulling/dragging of the hose was too much for it and the elbow broke from the base. One day I just turned on the faucet and it gushed out from the hideaway. I had to unroll the whole length and of course the problem would be right where that main connection point is. So needless to say...it's done. Not happy with the price you pay and the less than stellar durability of it. I gave it 2 stars - 1 for each year, the second really should be half of a star. It was ok when it didn't break but I can certainly think of better. I was just waiting for this to be done then buy the others I had my eye on...ironic, now I can do that. FuNnY	-1
We bought one of these and have been utterly disappointed the whole time.  We've tried many times to fix the myriad problems with it, and finally decided to just give up.  1. It leaks - at both ends.  No matter how tight you connect the hoses, it seems to leak.  (And yes, we were following the instructions to wind the inside hose the right way.)  2. If it doesn't leak, then as soon as you move it a little bit (putting a shear force on the hose connector), it will start leaking.  3. It weighs very little, which means it's very hard to wind, because it tries to rotate, flip, and tip over constantly.  (You have to either put a huge weight on it - which is ugly and unsafe - or tie/stake it down, which is ugly.)  4. Even if you fix problem #3 (we did by tying it down), as you roll up the hose, it all bunches up on one end or the other; you often have to open the lid and manually guide the hose to make sure it's not bunching up on one side (...if it does, the hose won't fit, and you have to unwind and wind it back up again, this time guiding it.)  We haven't purchased a replacement yet, but I would imagine that similar products that don't enclose the hose would be a much better solution.	-1
Ive had this thing for a while, and it sort of worked. It recently blew out the connector on the side. The areas you connect the hose are sharp angles so it kinks and leaks constantly. Plus - almost worse - its got lots of nooks and crannies inside so it's always full of spiders and debris! I'm always afraid I'm going to reach in there to tighten the crappy connection and get a bug on me haha.	-1
This turned out to be much smaller than I expected and had an odd place for the foot to hold it down.  I actually returned the product as not strong enough for a 100 foot hose	-1
Order error, but are stuck with it!!  NO HOSE GUIDE!!  Amazon wouldn't take it back!  Get what you pay for!!	-1
While I have no real complaints about the quality of the product, I do dare anyone to show me how they get 100 feet of hose reeled into this!  I have 75 ft medium duty 3/4 inch garden hose and no matter how carefully I've tried to reel it in, the most I can get on the reel is about 60 ft.  I guess if I went out and bought the flimsiest 1/2 inch hose I could find I might be able to get it reeled in, but I have my doubts.	-1
How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways! I purchased this locally, and although it supposedly will hold 100 feet of 5/8th" hose, it doesn't even do well with 50 feet. I purchased the one with the guide for "easy" reeling, and I darn near have to sit on it to get it to stay in one place while winding and unwinding, but I couldn't do that if I wanted to since I have to open the top and help the thing wind smoothly. If ... no ... WHEN the hose winds on top of itself, it will not be able to clear the container because it's too thick and, remember, this is with the 50 foot hose.  The crank for winding is too close to the ground, and I scraped my knuckles several times in the process.  I THINK the square in the front right of the box is to brace it while you're reeling, but there's no room for any adult foot or toes. Perhaps the larger size hose reel would be better, but I wanted something more unobtrusive. Now I'd settle for ugly and easy.  I don't know if my "solution" will work, but tomorrow, I'm laying the full hose out in the hot sun, and hope that all the kinks are out when I try to reel it in. Mind you, it doesn't stay put while unreeling.  The only thing that seems to be reeling is me.	-1
i would not buy again.  i purchased it for commercial use and it just did not stand up to the challenge.  not a bad product when new but quickly failed in functionality.  plastic grip and sprayer are too fragile for commercial use	-1
Somebody open this before I did! Missing the end of the spray wand and the hose clamp that holds the hose to the tank. Without the end to the wand the product is inoperable. Instructions and picture on the outside of the box clearly show both missing items. What happened to QC?	-1
plastic nozzle. Expected better spray gun for this price	-1
This sprayer work for a few months, until the inside coating began to peel off, clogging the sprayer to the point that it wouldn't work.  The sprayer clogged as fast as I could take it apart and clean it.  An expensive sprayer that sounded good, is now even more expensive in the junk pile.	-1
The humidity reader was accurate when it first came.  Within a week, it broke.  It's a nice thermometer but that's all it is.	-1
tis cannot be in the sun, so what good is it , I have the sun all day on all sides of my place	-1
Lasted 6 months, then totally off ! Won't recommend !	-1
not accurate	-1
Fell down and broke from a 2 foot drop	-1
wouldn't get again, cheaply made and it seems not to give correct temp	-1
Not well made. Settings temp and humidity not accurate. Tried to adjust but failed	-1
Stuck and absolutely useless !!!! Try to contact the company but there are nonexistent,	-1
Don't work	-1
FELL APART AFTER ABOUT A MONTH	-1
Simply put, this doesn't work. If you put it in the sunshine, the temperatures recorded are way over any sort of reality. I got readings of 110 degrees when I know the weather in LA never went above 72 that day. So why bother to have a thermometer if it doesn't tell you the truth  or something reasonably close to it?	-1
This is a beautiful thermometer, unfortunately, it is not accurate. It's off by approximately 25 degrees. I would not recommend.	-1
You pay for what you get. It's a cheap decoration that doesn't really gage the temperature or humidity very well. If you put in a sunny spot it way off and even in the shade it's not correct. Looks good, that's about all.	-1
What a waste of money, plastic and my time.  Sometimes the thermometer works but the hygrometer doesn't work ever.  Skip this one.	-1
Didn't last 5 months in the desert shade (Las Vegas), Not accurate to within 20 degree's.  The humidity meter always pointed to the 80* mark, I wouldn't recommend this one.	-1
The thing says its 84 when it's only 65 outside....... Can't find a way to adjust the gauss in any way. Only a metal spring in the back.	-1
Very cheaply made. Product has a coiled piece of metal for temp and humidity. It's about 10 degrees off and humidity about 7 percent off. Looks nice but is way off. Even did a test with a digital and was no where close. Total crap. Also asked for a new one and had them both side by side with the digital and they were both off except the digital. They should be free. Waste of money most definitely	-1
It's not worth a dime! Don't waste your time or money on this! It looks good but doesn't work so in the end it's just not worth it!	-1
Very cheaply made.  Loses what little accuracy it has within months.  Cheap fully exposed springs.  Weather fades.  And this thermometer was not exposed to the Sun.  NOT worth it!	-1
This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit.  Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low.  The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.  Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.  I just threw it in the trash.  If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to 120 Degrees F.  You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate.	-1
Don't be looking for accuracy. And if the hygrometer is is important to you... keep looking. For what I paid? I didn't expect much, and I wasn't disappointed.	-1
We had several gas and then electric caddies--for  a beach house with high winds making gas impractical.  They once were great and now are absolute junk, and they shortened the warranty from 5 years to 90 days.  Even so, I was able to make a warranty claim on our last one (AND I MEAN LAST ONE)because the burner unit and the regulator/plug-in burned out in 60 days!  Then the handle broke in half.  Just after I duct-taped it, the entire handle came off.  And everything else, the legs, the grate, all are thin and cheap.  They have sold their last unit to me.  P.S. If you look at the favorable and unfavorable reviews, the favorable are generally old and the unfavorable are new--doubtless coinciding with their switch to manufacturing in China.	-1
Bought one at end of season--for under 99 dollars. As I grill year-round, yes even in Chicago (in a coat in winter)--it got a workout. And died accordingly after only 2 years. Will NOT replace with same. If you use it only occasionally-maybe it would last.	-1
I got this at a great price in my gold box and was ecstatic as I have been looking for a gas grill for some time.  When I unpacked it there were two large chips out of the thin enamel coating on the bottom half of the cooking chamber.  When I called Char-Broil about a possible replacement, they said that this model has been discontinued, so that is something to be aware of. As I was getting near the end of assembly I realized that there were no flame diffusers like all other gas grills I've seen.  The flame comes up through one tube and heats a round, five inch diameter cast iron plate.  The heat then radiates from there.  NOT at all what I call a grill.  I call that an oven.  If you are looking to cook over flame, look elsewhere.  Also, the quality of the product is mediocre at best.	-1
Great design concept, poor construction. Broke mine after pruning two crepe myrtles. Spent an hour trying to fix but ended up throwing them away.	-1
We had a wind storm 3 days after putting this thermometer up and the clear plastic cover blew off.  Have not bee able to get it back on as there is a clip missing.	-1
I bought my Fisker pruner locally, not from Amazon, but I believe it important to warn potential customers and send a message to Fiskers. This pruner can work beautifully when new, but it won't  hold up to even casual use, let alone hard everyday use.  The problem is the cheap plastic head. The cutting mechanism will bind and jam repeatedly after light use.  The mechanism needs some machined or cast metal parts to make it function reliably. Everything needs to be beefed up a bit. The concept of activating the cutter head with a woven strap fed down the pole channel is clever. It eliminates the free swinging rope of other pruners that can be bothersome.  The light weight of the cutter head itself is wonderful as is its small size. There is no long lever on the cutter head, as typical of traditional designs, to foul in the tree canopy. But sadly the materials of the cutter head and details of its mechanism are just wrong. This could be redesigned to be a great tool,  as it is, it is expensive junk. You will have to pay roughly twice the Fiskers price to get a pole pruner that will hold up and work reliably day in and day out, and it's design won't be so eloquent as the Fiskers, but at least it will work well, and hold up to hard use. Marvin and Jameson both make a first rate pruner head, as does A.M. Leonard.  With any of the latter three pruner heads, which are all professional arborist quality, get the the hexagonal hemlock poles, not the heavier fiberglass ones.	-1
I have had at least 5 of these in the past several years. Every time I do a branch trimming project it locks up. Either the blades get stuck or they fail to retract. When it works, it seems great at first. The lock to keep the head in place comes undone far too easily. In an hour of trimming I have to relock it many times. The ball comes off the end too easily. The part above that also comes off too easily. I hate this thing. It brings my work to a complete halt and then I have to wait for a replacement. At least they have a lifetime warranty. Another claim submitted today. Such a piece of junk.	-1
I loved my first one. Used it a lot and eventually the head failed so I bought a second one. After only a few uses the kevlar strap began to snag on the locking clamp and shredded making the tool unusable. Sure wasn't worth the money to fail so quickly. Liked the tool while it worked.	-1
If I could leave 0 stars I would! Never close to the right temperature! It is made by Taylor Precision Products in guess where? China! It cannot be mounted without disturbing the mechanism because the screw mounts are in line with the coil. If one installs it, and follows the instructions, the wind blows it right off the screws. If one tightens the screws, the coil sticks, and whatever temperature you installed it at, stays the same no matter what the current temperature is! I would return it, but, it has blown hundreds of feet across the field several times! Wind catches it, it becomes a "frisbee"!	-1
Returned not accurate at all and very cheap quality. Outside temps in the 30s and this thing will have 110 on it. Not even in the sun. Very cheaply made. Placed it indoors to see if it was accurate. Same thing. Way off. Face plate had a chip out of the edge on arrival.	-1
I so want to love this pruner. The ONLY plus: it reaches 12 feet.  The negatives:  1. Horrible, horrible design exposes the pull strap(chain) on the outside, where you need to hold the shaft, AND requires the plastic slider to displace whichever hand is trying to hang on to the free end. Much too clumsy, especially when extended to awkward length -- have to change hands around in middle of every pull, sometime losing position. 2.  As with a 6' version, this is very likely to scissor-pinch twigs, requiring the fuss of a pause to unlock, often needing a small wrench.  3. The plastic parts stick tightly to each other, and together pull loose from the metal shaft rather than separate from each other. Infuriating, exhausting, and painful. They also tend to beat you in the face during hand repositionings, and return with a sharp snap which can violently pinch hand (wear gloves or bleed). Perhaps I should mention that I'm a small woman with arthritis in hands. This tool is barely manageable for me, and only for short periods.	-1
READING IS way OF!!!! DO NOT BUY IT.	-1
the saw part works fine and the adjustable length is a plus.  But the cutter simply doesn't work.  Mine would never open so it is completely useless for that purpose.  Suppose to be a simple item but if it malfunctions, there are no instructions or manual.  Suspect someone erred during manufacturing and I'm stuck with the mistake.	-1
The one I bought has showed 72 degrees (like their picture...ha ha) since I got it.) It reminds me of: "a clock that has stopped running is right twice a day..."	-1
Accurate in the mid range, off by 10-15 degrees at the high!	-1
I really like the looks of this temperature gauge, but unfortunately, it doesn't record the temperature accurately, so it's absolutely useless.	-1
Returned. Stuck on 80*	-1
When new, this pruner is terrific. I bought my first at Home Depot, and it lasted for a good four years, although early on I had to struggle sometimes to get the jaws to spring back open. My new one, purchased on Amazon less than a year ago, began to go bad early this summer, and now, like the old one, the jaws won't spring back open.  And how many of the eleven months since I purchased it were winter, when I wasn't using it at all? I now have two broken Fiskars pruners in my basement.  I need a tall, expandable pruner, but I can't see going for a third one. And if you can't trust Fiskars . . .?	-1
Had this grill for three years.  It worked great until summer 2009.  Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element.  Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00.  First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first.  Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty.  As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller.  This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done.  However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails.  No response to three emails and three phone calls.  Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill.  It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap.  Find a different brand.  I am going to Weber grills.	-1
Plastic cover came off within 1 week from wind	-1
I've had two of these grills.  The first I replaced because it was starting to rust (despite being covered) -- I had no major problems with that one, the second I've only had for six months.  The second grill has melted around the heating element, which seems to be a fire hazard.  I was quite suprised.  In addition, the thermostats on these grills have gotten worse than with the original model -- it seems at least 100 degrees off.  The fire safety, not including the briquettes and a jacked up price should probably make one look for other options, if only there were other quality options.	-1
I'm not at all satisified with this grill.  While assembling it, the porcelain coating on the body cracked off in most places where a fastener contacted it.  I contacted the manufacturer and they agreed to replace the lower bowl (bottom half).  They sent, instead, an aluminum liner which I didn't need.  Char Broil has not replied to my four subsequent attempts to contact them. The grill will only get to 400 degrees instead of the necessary 600 that they recommend in their cooking instructions.  Meat gets done, but you don't get that charred effect.  I might as well cook it in the oven. I am very disappointed.  Update:  I finally got tired of buying replacement controllers and heating elements and bought another brand.  The Char Broil went to the garbage where it belongs.	-1
This thing is about as sturdy as a plastic bag. I'm guessing it'll last about a week, if the sun doesn't hit it. As I'm hanging it up, I'm pretty sure it will be the next thing in my landfill.	-1
Junk, was off by about 4 degrees in summer weather as winter temps came 10 - 12 degrees off.	-1
Arrived 20 degrees off actual temp...Returned...	-1
first one I received I realized was bad when my water puddles outside were frozen and it was reading 42F, they quickly sent me a replacement witch was also a few degrees off, the next one worked but was broken in about 10 pieces in the package, my last one was few degrees off as well but I gave up on complaining, I am living with the erroneus reading for now knowing that it is off, they are not adjustable so I will see if I can pop the pointer off one of these days and reposition it	-1
Most home improvement stores no longer carry this product for a reason. Yes, the design is attractive and the tool is user-friendly, like other Fiskars products, but this is not a heavy-duty tool and it will not last. I quickly damaged the saw blade, and found this is hard to replace. After a few more uses, the bypass pruner broke. The failure was at the hinge, which has a plastic joint. In attempting to prune a branch that fit into the jaw (which it should therefore be able to cut), the force of the cut made the metal blade come off this joint and damage the joint in the process. My recommendation is therefore to look for a pruner with all-metal construction and easy to find replacement blades. I replaced mine with a Corona, which is heavier, but appropriately heavier duty.	-1
I hung this up at my lake house where my last one had hung for 3 years. The plastic face cover broke off in 2 months. Next summer I'll look for one of better quality.	-1
This style (from any manufacturer) has a reputation for being inaccurate.  It's the way they work.  Some are okay, but many aren't.  Mine always read 8 degrees too low.  For accuracy, get the old style vertical model with red liquid in a glass tube (some are inexpensive and others are very elegant), OR the newer wireless digital thermometer which has the easy-to-read display unit that you can place anywhere inside your home.  Those will need batteries every couple years, but at least you'll know the true temperature.  They also show the temperature in the room.	-1
Lightweight/have to glue it down so winds won't blow it away.	-1
This thing is complete junk. The temperature is never accurate. See photo where I have compared the current temperature online to the reading on the thermometer. 13 degree difference.	-1
Cheap and inaccurate, but large.	-1
This thing is total junk. Doesn't move more then 20 or 30 degrees and doesn't go below 40 when its in the upper 20's. Do not buy	-1
Doesn't work in the wind.	-1
It's cheap and there's a reason why.  Too big for anything other than a huge patio/backyard.  At best 3 to 5 degrees off indoors and out.  I gave it to my gardener and bought a good one.	-1
Complete piece of junk.  Fell apart when I opened the package.  Feels like it is about 8 oz of plastic.	-1
Actually didn't work very well at all	-1
I just realized it if off buy 5 degrees.	-1
Broke with the first gust of wind, in a location where we had a similar one in size for the past eight years.	-1
Very clear dial face which can be seen from quite a distance.  The only thing wrong with it is that it only registers 80 degrees despite higher or lower outside temperatures therefore I am not happy with it.	-1
This thermometer is not acurate; it reads about 6-8 degrees f. above actual. I wouldn't recommend buying this. I did and I regret it.	-1
Uh, well its mediocre at best. It tends to tell me its over 110 degrees outside when the temperature is actually 95. I posted it in the shade on my backyard fence. I think that the fact it has an open back contributes to the error in reading. Once the fence gets hot so does the thermometer, hence faulty reading. As long as the temperature stays in the 80's or below I think it will be ok. Unless of course the fence gets frozen this summer and then I may be getting a negative reading here in Northern Ca. Which actually doesn't happen.	-1
The temperature is off by ten degrees!	-1
Not  accurate and no adjustment to correct temperature.	-1
plastic junk!	-1
Seems to be off 5 degrees or so all the time.  Not very accurate.  Would not recommend, would purchase something else.	-1
This piece of cheaply made piece of junk gives new meaning to rinky-dink. It has huge numbers to enable you to see how far away from accuracy it is possible to get. There are no words that can truly describe the uselessness of this piece of trash.  I did not return it because it belongs in the trash and that is where it will stay until I go to the recycle center.  Do not waste your money on this. It is worthless. Honestly.	-1
horribly inaccurate humidity I ordered 2 of these, when they showed up they both showed way different readings  one was 20 the other was 45. I set them down on a desk and left them over night the next night after work I look at them, one now says 30 the other 55 looking at my solid brass one that I trust, it says 30, the weather station says 30. so the 55 one is out of wack. its easy to open and slide the little bar by the spring to adjust it, i move it till it reads 30 as well. it raided overnight - not one shows 45 and the other shows 75.  wait what? wasnt even woth it now to even get a credit from amazon on these junk things.  both are in the trash.	-1
Good heavens this thermometer was rubbish! For the short time it did work, it wasn't measuring the temperature on my corner of the planet. Then is just quit - finished. Upon examination of the inert unit, I was astounded by the profound shabbiness of it's construction and gained a grudging respect that such complete crap could work as long as it did. Before you throw your hard-earned shekels away on the Springfield 90007 - I suggest you try something more precise and reliable - like dice.	-1
This is very larger and easy to see across a patio or deck. At the time I bought it in late November 2013, it appeared to be accurate, based on the temp reports on the phone apps and the weather services. However, by 2015, it constantly looked wrong, especially on hot days. Today it is telling me it is 63 degrees out when my weather channel app  is telling me it is 85 out.  I just bought a Taylor so we will see how that goes. My Mom's thermometers are 30 years old and they still work perfectly, give or take a degree or two. I initially started this review in 2013 as 5 stars, but just discovered I had never submitted it.  I have reduced my original rating to 2 stars. I'm sorry, but I think a thermometer should last more than 2 years, especially because of the environmental impact of apparently  non recyclable plastic in the trash.	-1
This thing is junk, I guess I was expecting a bit more.  It's also very inaccurate, it's over 10F off.	-1
This is without a doubt the poorest quality thermometer that I can recall seeing. I will not purchase from this manufacturer again.	-1
Arrived broken...  the temp was at the bottom... finally started moving but the calibration seems way off.  I ended up going with one of the digital versions and much happier.	-1
Not very accurate. The thermometer is ok, but the hydrometer is way off.	-1
I bought this large outdoor themometer because it had graduaions for temperatures that can be seen from a distance.  I mounted it approximately 75-80 away on the outside of a wood shed in an area not in direct sunlight. I read the reviews before I purchased it, some were good, some bad, so I took a chance. It is cheaply made, doubt if it will last one season of cold and hot temps, but the worst is that it was reading 6 degrees higher than the acutal temp.  I put a smaller outdoor themometer, bulb style, which i knew to be accurate. I have been able to twist the metal coil in back and got it down to 4 degree lower, twisted it again to read the same temp as the smaller guage.  Don't know if this will work, but worth a try. Recommendations, keep looking for a better build and more accurate themometer.	-1
Save your money. The temperature reading isn't even close to being correct, and having no way to compare the humidity reading with another device, I assume it's incorrect as well.	-1
Cheap	-1
Junk! Save your money! Put it in Green house 2nd day it pegged both temperature and humidity meter, and it was only 85 deg... It is a JUNK Plastic, not worth returning, POJ! (Piece of Junk) Thought another review might had stepped the boundaries of reviewing, but they were dead on. Go to the Dollar Store and but a thermometer and save your money.	-1
Well I guess the quality of these is hit-and-miss, because the one I bought at a local L home improvement store does not register temperatures below 40.  There is frost all over the grass, birdfeeders, cars, etc, and our other 2 thermometers read 31 degrees, but this one still says 40.  This thermometer has not dropped below 40 degrees once this whole winter.	-1
These are very cheaply made, especially for the price. The first one came broken, and they sent a second one at no additional cost. (I didn't have to return the first one). It's going to be hanging out on my deck, so I'll use it for awhile until I find something I like better.	-1
This thermometer didn't work. Like another reviewer wrote - it stays at 40-45 degrees all the time.  I wish I could give the product a zero but Amazon 5 stars!  The refund/return was so easy and Amazon even provides the shipping label so I don't have to pay to return it.  I got free super saver shipping to begin with so I'm out $0.  This is why Amazon rocks and I am a frequent customer.  I rarely have any issues with AMazon purchases. I am a loyal customer because I know that when there is an issue, they make it right.	-1
Not very accurate and difficult (or maybe impossible) to adjust or calibrate	-1
Cheap, you can get same one at dollar store. Returned for refund. Defective.	-1
I purchased 4 of these large easy-to-read thermometers- 1 for inside, and 3 outside.  I first set them side by side, and they were within 1f of each other (acceptable).  After 1 cold  MT winter, all of the outside are Way Off! The one kept inside is still accurate.  I'll try the Conant next?	-1
Guess the Temp is correct	-1
Not at all accurate. I want to think that old fashion is good but this is a bummer.	-1
on pictur looks ok but on wall not	-1
:(	-1
not as sturdy as I expected,mounting hardware very flimsey	-1
THEY DO NOT  TRAP MANY FLY. I HAVE ANOTHER FROM OTHER COMPANY THAT WORK PERFECT. I WILL SWITCH  TO THE COMPETTITION.	-1
I bought two and placed them in an area with lots of flies. They only attracted one or two flies each after a few months. And the smell is terrible, and easy to get on your hands.	-1
The Red Top raps work much better.  Had this near a Red Top and it didn't catch hardly any.	-1
Didn't work at all!  Same brand as I bought at Home Depot.  Doesn't ene smell at all.  Very disappointed with this!	-1
did not work	-1
Horrible stench like decomposing fish, and within a week maggots were all over it . Would not purchase again.	-1
We purchased this locally in Hawaii. It  did not work at all for us.  It only attracted ONE fly in three weeks. I did far better with a couple of fly swatters and fly strips hanging from the patio ceiling.	-1
Not like the ones you buy in hardware store. Not as effective	-1
Found this one to be far less effective than the disposable model despite using them almost side-by-side.  Threw it in the garbage after the first month & went back to the disposable models!	-1
Really disappointed that the 18 single doses come in ONE big bag. NOT INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED creating a potential smelly mess issue.	-1
after a week and have caught nothing waste of money	-1
i bought this on a whim thinking maybe it would help the bug situation in our wooded yard.  but i knew it wouldn't and i was concerned about just how much stench it would create. where would you put this?  away from the deck so that the smell wasn't noticeable?  or near the deck where it could be effective?  What if the kids started throwing sticks at it?  yeah, it just didn't sound like much fun having a stinky smelly messy fly grave swill bottle hanging in my yard.  so it sat in a cupboard in the garage for a couple years until we started smelling something putrid like rotten meat.  it took me a few days to realize where the smell was coming from but then i saw that bottle i had forgotten about.  i guess the package the smelly stuff came in had started to decompose.  the bottle and the smell went straight into the garbage can.	-1
followed the instructions, it smells terrible but does not attract flys. We have lots of flys around the goat pens, Moved it around never caught a fly.	-1
followed the directions, smells bad, but no flys....moved it around still no flys, And YES around the goat pens we have LOTs of them.	-1
It does work as well as the flytrap bag does. It does take a bit loger for the activation to take hold, but is a great product	-1
It's been a couple of months since I've had this up, and the flies aren't coming into it. I've followed the directions to the letter, and it's still only caught like four flies.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Victor-M502-Disposable-Fly-Trap/dp/B00004RBDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Victor M502 Disposable Fly Trap</a>&nbsp;was so full that they were actually breeding in there. This one? I've caught almost none.	-1
followed the directions setting it up let it set out for a week and it killed 3 flies another trap I used was full	-1
There are better options than this. It barely caught anything and the stench is AWFUL. We actually scraped them pretty quick due to the whole HOUSE smell that it caused. Two of these made our 1500 Sq Ft house reek to the point of nausea. Maybe for outside, but not for indoor use in my opinion.	-1
I got this to reduce the number of flies on the patio when we eat dinner outside.  Bottom line, it does not work...flies were flying around all over, and not one went in the trap.  I put it near the garbage cans for 2 days, and I caught 1 fly.	-1
The Rescue Fly trap is good and we've used them for years, but when we came to Amazon to buy refills of the attractant, we found out the hardway Rescue has "replaced" this item (shown as a 3 pack) with a new single pack version. This is a out and out scam. The original 3 pack listed sold here for $3.99 to $4.88. But now the same single pack sells for the same $3.99 to $4.88 price. The part numbers are different, FTA-DB18 for the single pack and FTA-DT18 for the 3 pack. This ad shows and references the triple pack, DT18, but you will only get the single pack DB18. Since we can buy the single pak for $2.49 at home depot, it's a waste of money to pay $4-5 for this one.	-1
Rescue's product works very well.  Its only drawback is that as others have noted, the product stinks (that's why it works so well).  Probably for that reason, they changed to a foil packaging and in doing so, switched from three per package to one per package.  While they changed their pricing, some distributors, like Ace Hardware are behind in changing their pricing.  I ordered a season's supply of this three-pack, but they replaced it with the one refill per package.  The effect was that they charged me over $5 each.  I could have gone to Lowe's and bought a Rescue disposable fly trap with the attractant for $5.  Don't order this until they show that they are only shipping the foil pack of one each and change their pricing.  Otherwise, you too will fall prey to their bait and switch.	-1
Amazon gave refund so I am good with them but item received was not as described or shown in picture.	-1
The aroma was so bad that we couldn't have it anywhere near the house, which is where the flies like to hang out. Put it out in the garden and the flies could care less.	-1
Don't waist your money thats all I'm saying . I filled up with water after cutting the top ,I hung it up and in two days I got NOTHING in the trap, the flys are still in my room.	-1
These stink! Yes, they attract flies like crazy and they get stuck in the bags, but the bags smell like a dead animal. We had to get rid of them quickly.	-1
Smell really bad and no fly was trap after 2 days	-1
Never reduce the fly population even though they kill a lot.  Possibly bring  lot from all over the hood.	-1
It was a total dud. I've bought these before locally and they always work great, but this one give off no smell to attract flies and has only caught one fly in 2 weeks. Maybe the packet in mine was a dud? They usually smell like a dead animal.	-1
I know the difference between yellow jackets, honey bees, bumble bees, paper wasps, and bald faced hornets.  It was yellow jackets that were harassing my hummingbirds at the feeder. With the originally supplied attractant I caught no yellow jackets in this trap.  With Dr. Pepper I caught one in a week.  Another bait might have worked better but the Rescue reusable trap with apple juice worked somewhat so I stopped using the one-time use trap.	-1
Bought two. One broke before it was even hung up. The second one lasted about three weeks before it was completely full of water from rain leaking in, so overflowing stinky water on the area below.	-1
We ordered a lot of these things - 5 times to be exact.  The first 3 orders the item was terrific.  Smelled like death but man did it attract & trap 1000's of flies.  We put them all over our lot, front & back, at the beginning of the season and never even saw 1 fly.  So of course we ordered more when these were so full of flies we wanted to keep up the good work.  The 4th order we received something was very different about the traps - no smell at all after adding water.  The flies returned to our yard but not to the useless traps.  We tried to return some of the traps we didn't open & fill but we were beyond the return date.  We then contacted the Sterling Manufacturer to alert them to the bad product - maybe they had a bad batch - they offered NO help what so ever.  Said we had to deal with the 3rd party but thankfully it was Amazon.  Amazon refunded for the bad traps.  I will never buy anything from the Sterling company again.  Too bad for them to have changed the recipe for their fly traps.  The USED to work great.	-1
Not a single wasp in 10 days and my backyard is swarming.	-1
Read the reviews, thought this would be great for my patio,,10 days  ZERO anything,, think I wasted my money. Very disappointed.	-1
Does not work at all. Waste of money.	-1
Not one single yellow jacket. They flew around it but not one entered the trap.	-1
Difficult to use	-1
I live on Toledo Bend lake in east Texas. Tons of wasps and yellow jackets on our property. I tried both versions of these traps and neither worked. I have the other small plastic one you fill up with cranberry juice, water, and sugar under this just sitting on the porch rail and it catches them and they completely ignore this. I really wish it worked here. The wasps here are HUGE!	-1
Save your money!	-1
I used this product at different locations outside my home. Never caught one.	-1
More effective at catching flies than yellow jackets, they should probably rename it. 0/10 would recommend.	-1
waist of time and money. Wasp nest within two feet. actually got ONE in two weeks. Totally disappointing.	-1
I have a scourge of yellow jackets roaming all over the patio and ground cover.  I have two hanging yellow jacket traps baited with tuna that catch them like mad.  However, I thought I'd try these disposable bag traps as they don't have to be baited.  The bait dissolves inside, etc.  They've been up three days in the same area as the others but not ONE bee has entered.  Very disappointed.  Waste of money.  And, yes, I followed the directions to a tee and tried them at various heights and locations.  Nada.	-1
No, no nein, nada,  etc. This a no product, I can't stress this enough.  First, the item stinks, literally. I hung it up in a remote part of the kitchen. but the flies never found it.  Now what?  I couldn't put  it in the trash, stinks to high heaven.  I finally poured the liquid down the garbage disposable, rinsed the bag thoroughly, and then  threw it in the trash.  Fly strips are the way to go.  They look gross but I toss them out often.	-1
Tried 5 different wasp devices including two of these. Put it where another trap got multiple wasps, got nothing , put it in another place, still nothing.	-1
Yes, it is a fly trap.. except it really ended up being more of Hotel where the flies could go to meet and reproduce and then live out the remainder of their life and die from old age. More little flies left this trap than big ones entering.  And then there was the smell.... I ended up moving it to a remote location, hanging from a tree, in my back yard.  Even then, it the breeze was a certain way I'd swear an animal had died.  My goal as to reduce the number of flies in my back yard.... there are more.  Don't waste you money,	-1
I ordered three different types of wasp/yellow jacket traps. This one wasn't the worst but doesn't work very well. I added my own mix of liquid that worked better than their stuff. I LOVE the Aspectek Wasp Traps.	-1
Didn't work6	-1
It leaked gave me money back.	-1
A bother to set up and then the wasps literally fly around it. I then swat them with a fly swatter.	-1
catches more slugs than bugs.	-1
Nope, tried everything. Found about 5 yellow jackets flying in a area, and set this right down among them. Nothing. Really wanted it to work. They seemed more interested in one I killed then the trap.	-1
None caught	-1
This company makes the BEST fly traps, but this thing caught one bee even though it was 18" from the nest.	-1
Not much good.  I hung it as directed. Only about 10 Yellow Jackets in the trap.	-1
Better quality control needed. Bought two, filled with water but found one of them was leaking. Had to wrap another plastic bag outside and I am not sure it will make it less effective.  Update: 1. after using it during the whole summer: very effective catching all types of flies. The effectiveness will start to decrease as the liquid evaporates and more flies got in. And in my experience, I had to change a new one every two or three weeks. 2. Disposal is a big problem because I don't want the smelly liquid/fly bodies leaked everywhere in my trash and the bag itself is very difficult to seal. My solution was to use a used infant formula tin to store and finally dispose it.	-1
This item has been hanging in the yard for over 2 months and NADA. We have wasps, hornets or yellow jackets (I don't know) flying all over but they're oblivious to this thing. As one reviewer stated, all the print on the bag makes it almost impossible to see inside without a lot of manipulation.  Fortunately, there aren't any wasps around it anyway. About 10' away there was a nest being built under a plug cover that I had to spray. In our yard anyway--USELESS. I guess I'll just throw the 2nd one away unused.	-1
Caught one yellow jacket after following the instructions.	-1
Sorry. After three weeks I have caught 4 yellow jackets. I wonder how long the trap was hanging around before I bought it. My guess is the attractant was just tired and went to sleep.	-1
I have the yellow Jackets, especially around my fruit trees. This product didn't work?!  The fly one worked great....disappointing!	-1
The worst! All it caught, after a week, were a few moths! DON'T BOTHER!	-1
I have always used http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XWMJ39M?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00, but in a effort to save money, tried the Rescue Disposable, along with 2 others.  It did catch a few yellow jackets, but nothing compared to the one I mentioned, and over a much longer time.  Also, it is much less convenient, since water (which evaporates quickly in the hot summer) is required and makes disposable messier.  Have gone back to the original Rescue reusable and will stick with that.	-1
printing hides dead yellow jackets	-1
These are very easy to set up. But they stink like death. We had one in the garage and one in a large shed. Both places have open doors with breeze. Their stench is unbearable. My husband took to them out and threw them away after 1 week. We caught only a few flies too. I would NOT recommend these traps.	-1
Ummmm maybe it's not working because it's April but no wasps go near it.  It's just caught a few nats.	-1
Been outside for a week now and not one wasp has even touched it.	-1
This didn't work for me. I bought several here on amazon. First, they hair didn't work. Secondly, the box they came in was so smelly - I know that's the attractor, but before opening even the amazon box, it was nauseating. It was so bad we threw the box in the garage. No exaggeration, the smell lasted in our garage for well over a year. It was unopened in the garage for less than 3 days. So, overall it was a huge disappointment.	-1
Worthless!  Caught 0 wasps in my barn and there were 100 or so to trap.  Save your money and time and use something else.	-1
it indeed can attract flies! But the net is too small to trap an aduly fly in. I only caught tiny flies. pitty. suggest to make a larger net to attract regular flies.	-1
These did not work.  Not in the least.  I would not buy these again.	-1
Never caught anything , not even flies.	-1
I have a problem with yellow jackets nesting near the house. I bought this Rescue disposable trap in a nearby hardware chain store, followed the instructions, set it up and hung it about 20 feet from the nest as directed.  Result? Three days later there is not one single yellow jacket in the trap.  I can see two tiny fruit flies that wandered in, but no yellow jackets.  The weather has been warm - hovering between 75-80 degrees F. - so the attractant should be working OK.  The little plastic bag containing the attractant inside the trap did dissolve in the water an hour or so after filling, but the next day I noticed a lot of undissolved powder in the bottom of the bag.  I kneaded the bag to dissolve some of it but it didn't help.  Verdict: judging by some other user's success, it seems to be hit or miss with these things.  There may be a problem with the attractant formula or the age of the attractant.  Either way, I certainly won't take a chance and buy this trap again.	-1
This has been hanging in my garden for weeks now.  I tried a couple locations.  The yellow-jackets are happily ignoring it and I think they're mocking me.  There are a couple dead flies in it, but not a single yellow-jacket.  I don't know if I have mutant wasps or what.  When I lived in a different city (Eastern Missouri) - I could trap zillions of them and danced on their graves.  But here (Eastern Nebraska), they are impervious to traps of any kind.  I will say, it was easy to set up and a rather clever design.  So two stars for that.  Not pretty though.	-1
Despite moving this yellow jacket trap twice, only one yellow jacket caught.	-1
I've had this hanging in my 2 acre back yard now for 2 months, and have not captured one bee. Yes, they come within a foot of it but do not even land on it, much less go in it. It has attracted hundreds of fruit flies, but that's it. Most of what Amazon sells works and is high quality, but this isn't the case here.	-1
It didn't catch a single one. I put it in the shade, and then tried the sunny side where they like building nests. They just kept on going about their daily routine. I still have hundreds of wasps in my yard eating my pergola, drinking from my fountain, and making nests everywhere they can.	-1
We had used this in the past. Got them locally at a hardware store, and they were incredible. Within a day the trap had a lot of yellow jackets, and it kept trapping them for a week or so. It was so effective that we stopped seeing yellow jackets in our yard. We used them successfully for two years in a row. The next year we ordered them online, and never had good result. We had a huge nest by one of our windows. We placed one of the traps far away (about 25-30 yards) and one very close to the nest (about 2 feet away), and the most we trapped were fruit flies. The design is great, and it is very practical to toss the whole thing, wasps and all, instead of trying to wash them (like some of the other models), but if the attractant doesn't work, wasps will never get in the trap, defeating the whole purpose. Please bring back the old attractant.	-1
We hung the trap 2 feet away from a large wasps nest. After 3 weeks it had caught only two. In the end, we sprayed the nest with spectracide and that fixed the problem.	-1
I've had this up for a week and it's got one yellow jacket. I notice that some people recommend apple juice, but the instructions say to just add water. I'm very disappointed. I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive. Their fly catcher is great, but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets.	-1
I bought one of these traps at a big box store. Installed in my front yard because we have a yellowjacket wasp nest near the front of the house and I wanted to get rid of them. After following the instructions carefully, and hanging the trap about 30 feet or so away, I am sad to say that it has not trapped even one wasp (or any other insect except 5 or 6 tiny flies). After 3 days I moved the trap to another location closer to the nest, but a week later still nothing. So, I conclude that it doesn't work and can't recommend it. Waste of my money, I'm afraid.	-1
used about 3 of these over a two year period, although in partly shaded places, and never caught any YJs.  The reusable rescue trap(which I guess i am having trouble finding in stores now) worked fairly well.  I did use water as per instructions, however.  did not try the apple juice thing. Guess people don't find this review helpful, that is OK.  There might be regional differences or other poorly understood factors.  Just my experience with the product. The YJ problem is so bad around our property(especially after mild winter) got stung several times this year and personally destroyed 2 underground nests, yet they are still around.  Have heard they can forage for a quarter of a mile away.  We live in one of the Gulf Coast states and maybe that is a factor.  Maybe our YJs are smarter than the ones in other places, who knows.  I have to try this again but will use apple juice mixture this time.	-1
I followed the directions to the tee.  It did not mention anything about diluting with anything but water.  I set the trap out in the evening: 9:00 Aug. 1st.  I just checked now, 6:30 PM Aug. 2nd and not one insect except the ones that were pictured on the product.  The so called white packet of attractant did NOT dissolve. Maybe they should have recommended using HOT water.  I will need to go out there tonight and attempt to shake up the packet in hopes that the attractant dissipates. What a royal pain ...... If I have any luck I will write another review.  Mary	-1
Disgusting smell. They just attracted more flies to the area, and it smells so bad we couldn't sit out on our patio, had to put it in the trash.	-1
The pouch punctured before I even hung it up I believe it came that way possibly. The product in here is so awful smelling that wouldn't leaked over the kitchen it's almost impossible to get the smell to go away. Even if I hadn't I don't know that I would use it again because wherever you hung it would have to be far enough away where you wouldn't smell it.	-1
Spills easily ---- on you with rotten maggots and flies.	-1
Leaked as soon as we put it up.  Attracted flys great to the puddle under the trap.  Horrible.	-1
Does not catch Horse flies that bite. The sticks work much better.	-1
Don't waste your money!  You'd think the manufacturer of a fly trap that is basically a hanging plastic bag filled with water would make sure that the bag is tightly sealed to prevent leaking.  Not so with this fly trap.  Both of the traps I purchased sprung leaks.  The first started leaking on the third day of use, so I assumed it was an anomaly.  I also noticed that the trap hadn't appeared to catch anything.  However, since I'd bought two of them, I decided to give the last trap a chance to demonstrate its effectiveness.  Unfortunately, as soon as the bag was filed to the halfway "fill line," it became clear that the second trap was also leaking (before I'd even hung it up).  A fly swatter would have been way less mess (and way more effective).	-1
