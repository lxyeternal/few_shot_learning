Bought them for my husband, he says they taste good. Packaging was average and they seemed like a decent value for the price.	1
these are absolutely yummy...maybe for me a little too yummy.  my teenaged son loved them as well.	1
Cascadian Farm Snacks Organic Nut Protein bars are a great snack for my hubby and teen daughters. I keep them put up from my nut allergy kid, but the older kids and husband take them to school in lunches, for snacks after school, and during tennis practice. They are calorie dense, USDA organic and have a good flavor. The protein gives it real staying power, unlike a lot of snack bars. I love Amazon's Prime Pantry, getting the quality food I love delivered straight to my door and usually at a price that matches or beats my favorite semi-local grocer. I usually have to drive 30 minutes to the nearest store with any decent organic selection, so this way saves me time and money.	1
Delicious organic protein bar. Perfect for travel. Having a hard time finding them in the stores, glad to see them on Amazon at a good price,	1
POSITIVES Cascadian Farm Snacks Organic Nut Protein bars are GREAT TASTING and DELICIOUS Organic and no GMOs and gluten free Unique and crisp tasting -- chewy yet nutty and crunchy Real nuts and a little honey create a flavorful treat that is fresh Great energy snack and wonderful breakfast The protein is packed with staying power and energizing and satisfying No aftertaste  NEGATIVES None  HINT DO NOT have anyone with nut allergies around these bars. Portable protein snack is easy to toss in your bag and carry around for a treat or meal substitute.	1
good to have in the cabinet	1
Not bad, much more flavorful and fresher than most other brands which are hard, dry and tastless. Will buy again.	1
These are tasty protein snack bars.  We like them on occasion.	1
I'm a binge eater, for sure. I got these bars to keep at work in case I needed something to tide me over for a few hours. I don't normally get full on one bar, but this product is fantastic. It's not as unhealthy as others, is full of various nuts, and tastes delicious with its hint of honey. The protein keeps me full for hours. I'm working on building a stockpile for these.	1
Did not like at all.  The flavor is weird.  Not what I expected at all.	-1
Awesome tasting and great source of Protein !	1
So delicious.  Tastes like dessert.  Love it with my greek yogurt for lunch, keeps me going for 4-5 hours... highly recommended.	1
Tastes great very hard I chipped a tooth but didn't stop me from eating more lol love them	1
I love this product but when I received it it tasted stale even though it was not past the pull date.	-1
i love corn nuts, and this flavor is pretty nice.	1
Love these.  Not a strong spicy flavor, but not weak either.	1
It was a gift, they loved 'em.	1
My family loves corn nuts as a snack and this Chile Picante flavor is a nice change from the original flavor.  Great flavor and just the right amount of "heat". Very tasty!	1
The chili picante flavor is the best.  It's a good snack at work.	1
Who doesn't love Corn Nuts.  This flavor is fantastic.	1
Love these but hate having to purchase $25. in Amazon pantry.	1
Exactly as stated and expected	1
Delicious!	1
Great flavor and price	1
Chili picante is the best Corn Nuts flavor and so hard to find. Glad to see it on Amazon	1
good snack	1
GREAT	1
Our family loves Corn Nuts. This isn't our favorite flavor, but it's not bad. Very crunchy, tasty snack.	1
Delicious	1
my hubby remembers these from his dad, brings back good memories	1
The flavor is so good!	1
A staple for my breakfast.  This was a great price.	1
This product is excellent.	1
I mean... its pretty ok for a "special" cereal. Seems pretty healthy. Good protein and low sugar is a plus.	1
love This simple basic blend.	1
made special k bars yummy	1
Like this kind of cereal because it tastes good to me.	1
I REALLY LIKE THIS CEREAL VERY GOOD	1
Enjoy the Special K	1
Special K has always been a favorite of mine, it's like a cross between Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies. For breakfast, I love eating this with any kind of fruit---fresh berries, bananas, even canned peaches and pears. Keep milk to a minimum, though, this cereal goes soggy pretty fast. Bizarrely, this also makes a great coating for oven-baked chicken!	1
great taste priced right full of vitamin's.	1
I love these things, especially with strawberries.  Product is consistent from box to box, which I appreciate.	1
Love this simple cereal - and it makes great chicken too!	1
One way to add some fiber without even noticing you are doing so!  Or add some fiber to Grandma's diet without her realizing you are doing it.  Anything that has even a remote possibility of putting an end to her constant talk about her bowels not moving is something I had to try.  I wish these came in a large, economy size because she actually enjoys these when dipped into her coffee. And a serving provides a little more fiber than adding a spoonful of this to her coffee&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Metamucil-Multi-Health-Fiber-by-Meta-Original-Coarse-Sugar-114-Teaspoons-29-Oz/dp/B00MTSDSLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Metamucil Multi-Health Fiber by Meta, Original Coarse Sugar 114 Teaspoons 29 Oz</a>	1
Nice and crisp with a sweet taste	1
I just discovered this item in the grocery store a few weeks ago and liked them so much I thought I would order some from Amazon, They are very good tasting ,nourishing and curb the appetite for quite a while. I would recommend them for purchase.	1
I like it, great light breakfast on the go. They called them biscuits but they're more than thin crisps. Good to inter-change breakfast options daily to not get tired of it. Might want something to drink to wash it down.	1
Taste is good and delivery and packaging as expected.	1
Tasty	1
Excellent!	1
These are yummy and great with black tea	1
Great taste and value	1
Soooo good!  Love these for breakfast.	1
I am presently recuperating from a stroke and like to have something convenient nearby for breakfast  so I don't have to bother anybody. These nature Valley Breakfast Biscuits are certainly a favorite  and  a tasty addition to my stash . So many different flavors/varieties  and ALL are delicious!  . I even used them as a pick-me-up snack some afternoons.  And, I sometimes tuck one in with a cup of coffee after dinner!	1
The flavor is not great	-1
These are amazing there is 4 in a pack and you get 5 packages.	1
I purchased these through Prime Pantry.  I usually purchase the cinnamon flavor but thought I'd give these a try.  They are really very tasty.  My kids love them as well especially dipped in milk.  Would buy definitely again.	1
awsome	1
Ordered these for the hubs as he loves these things!  They are perfect for him to throw in his bag for a snack while he is at work.  Personally, I don't care for them ...but that's just me.  One thing is for sure...make sure you have a drink nearby because these dry your mouth out when you're eating them  Surprisingly, my kids love them	1
I bought these blindly. Had never even heard of them before. With a deployed husband and having to take care of a baby & a toddler by myself, I sometimes don't have time to eat breakfast. However, these are very filling and easy to grab and go. There are 4 biscuits in each pack. My tot always takes one for herself. Even with 3 I feel like I got some b'fast that morning. Granola bars don't satisfy long, but these are great! Highly recommend for anyone that has trouble finding the time to eat breakfast in the mornings! ...or just because they're that good! I'll definitely be buying more!	1
These are a quick tasty on the go breakfast item. At 230 calories for the four cookies in each package its a bargain. Most breakfast bars and cookies have 230 calories or more in one bar or cookie. Good taste, reasonable caloric count makes them a good purchase for my family.	1
I am a huge fan of the belvita cookies and when they were out of stock I ordered these. I was extremely impressed. Great flavor too.	1
Dry but satisfying these breakfast biscuits are blissfully devoid of unpronounceable ingredients. They also contain no high fructose corn syrup or trans fats. The nutritional information on the box provides information for both a four pack and also a single biscuit -- which if not being used as a meal substitute, is often enough. Each biscuit has 60 calories, 1 gram of protein, 3 grams of sugar, 8 grams of carbohydrate and 2.5 grams of fat -- multiply times four for an entire pack.  Healthier than many cookies, and certainly most candy bars, these are a simple but wholesome option. I usually eat one or two as a snack with tea or coffee. They are also good with a cup of yogurt. The biscuits are not just a quick breakfast if running late, but they are also good to carry on a hike or keep at work or in a carry-on when traveling as a meal replacement or supplement.  The box I received had an expiration date seven months in the future.	1
Fine. Great delivery. Tasted good,kept you full for a snack.	1
The "Nature Valley Breakfast Biscuits, Honey, 5 Pouches of 4 Biscuits, 1.77 Ounce Per Pouche" are absolutely delicious! Well done goes to "Nature Valley," for such a super delicious product! Thank you goes to our Trustworthy Amazon.com "Prime Pantry" for such a wonderfully delicious product at an unbeaten price-point!	1
Theres some kind of grainy texture going on with these that makes them a little less favorable than belvita breakfast biscuits, but these are still delicious and I would purchase again!  Very satisfying and having so many biscuits in a pack makes me feel like I'm eating more than I am :)	1
These are now a favorite at my house. They are great for a quick breakfast or a afternoon snack. The taste is lightly sweet but satisfying	1
Taste is subjective,  some people will like these, some won't. They are not sickly sweet like some breakfast bars or granola bars. Personally, I like that. This is real food, like bran flakes but better. Crunchy and easy to carry. I like that I can eat one or two biscuits from the pack of 4 and space them out while enjoying morning coffee.	1
These are for you. I bought these because my husband never eats breakfast and its really not good for you. He has a physically demanding job so I kind of forced him to take these to work with him. I bought two boxes and he is already out. I think these are a great way to eat something in the morning without getting too full, and getting enough energy to make it through your day. They are super easy to stash away in a desk drawer, purse, or for my husband they are in his rolling tool box. I would try buying these if you feel really drained in the afternoon. Try eating these when you start your day at work and see if you get more energy.	1
these are just not good.  they are grainy and have an odd flavour.  my husband, whom i bought them for, hates them.  i can choke them down, but it's nothing i'll purchase again.  maybe i'll pass them out at halloween lol.	-1
Delicious for a morning snack	1
They taste like applesauce...but in cracker form. Love them.	1
I don't think these have a good peanut butter flavor.  I love Honey Nut so thought I would give these a try.. Would not buy again.	-1
Love these cheerios!  Huge fan of the multi grain ones!  Great flavor of peanut butter and healthier than other cereals on the market!  It's always nice to be able to buy things for my family that are healthier without them realizing it!  Who knew multi grain could taste so good!  Awesome way to get the peanut yumminess!	1
LOIVE CHEERIOS	1
Nice salty peanut flavor with a little bit of caramel. I ate them as a snack as it didn't exactly seem like a breakfast food. Would definitely buy again.	1
Great for quick and satisfying snack!	1
Taste great! Excellent nutrition bar.	1
It tastes great...... I highly recommend it!!!	1
Salty nutty tasty	1
Ahhh cookies and cream cereal  Yes, it sounds just as addicting as you think it would be.  Between my twins and my hubby...this gets devoured VERY quickly!  Must find a way to ration them with this cereal!	1
YUMYUMYUM	1
This cereal gives me life	1
Not that great...	-1
Taste so yummy very similar to coco puffs cereal but a little cremier in taste	1
My kids love this cereal	1
Tastes TERRIBLE !  sorry i have to say that on anything with the Hershey's brand !	-1
Good taste	1
Been eating since they first came in the market .... still my Favorite	1
My favorite shredded wheat and is not too sweet.	1
Nice flavor.  I like the maple sugar flavor on these.  A nice addition to mini wheats.	1
Liked the crunch and ectra sweetness. Good for a crunchy snack.	1
great deal	1
Good food.	1
I did not really like the taste of the maple kind.	-1
These are tied with the strawberry Mini Wheats as my favorite cereal.  It's the only sweet cereal I've found that has a ton of fiber.  It tastes exactly like you'd imagine.  Like maple and brown sugar.  Kind of like oatmeal when you add brown sugar to it. It is about the same sweetness as the other frosted Mini Wheats cereals.	1
good taste	1
These tasted horrible. And I actually like Maple and Brown Sugar.	-1
Love brown sugar and the crispy wheat.	1
Good wheat flavor!	1
Fresh and good.	1
What can I say, love me some maple brown suga Wheaties. Da best.	1
I like maple and brown sugar.... just wasn't overly impressed with these.  They were interesting the first time, but half way through the box I was ready to get back to the regular and strawberry flavors...	1
a family favorite....large box makes fair price	1
Good.	1
I really like it, much better then Traders Joe's. Only problem is not on Amazon any longer.	1
Good product	1
Good	1
very good, love this	1
2nd best (though it is very close) cereal ever. And it has fiber! Perfecto... I tend to buy two boxes; one for the cereal shelf and the other for the snack shelf. Great with or without milk!	1
Love these and cannot find them in stores anymore.  Taste great.	1
great buy	1
wonderful product; exactly as promised.	1
If pine tree bark were sold in a Kelloggs box, I'd imagine this is exactly what it tastes like. This has no brown sugar taste at all.  If you enjoy the taste of tree bark, this is for you. If you're looking for a sweeter taste, look elsewhere.	-1
I was afraid it be too sugary but it was the perfect combo!	1
Tasty	1
Husband's favorite cereal very good sometimes hard to find in store	1
fresh cereal	1
This is the best cereal out there.	1
Good maple flavor	1
The maple is probably my favorite flavor, it makes me feel like I'm being bad and having waffles or pancakes yet I know I'm still being good. It is more expensive on here than in the grocery stores, but for those of us who cannot get to the store easily it's convenient and we pay for convenience.	1
Good cereal not as sweet as most frosted ones	1
Tasty cereal	1
ok	1
great	-1
very tastey	1
Crushed box but contents were ok	1
Everything is taste preference, but we love these.  Our little one snacks on them dry.	1
Yeah! Love prime!	1
I absolutely loved this cereal. Too bad the kids stole the box after I got my first bowl.	1
Good but I like the regular better.	1
My daughter loves the Maple Brown Sugar Mini Wheats.  They are just sweet enough to satisfy her sweet tooth, but light enough not to over power.	1
I don't like mini-wheats, never really have. I like these. ;)	1
Who doesn't love Mini Wheats?	1
This is my favorite version of all the breakfast cereals made from shredded wheat.  It is sweet and flavorful, crunchy but not hard, and the bite sized pieces are the perfect size.  This is a hearty cereal and I find it sticks with me-- unlike so many cereals that are filled with air that leave me hungry soon after after eating a bowlful.  The fiber is a decent quantity for a breakfast cereal; one serving has almost 25% of what is recommended for the whole day,  This actually is 50% more than a bowl of oatmeal and TWICE the amount in a single serving of leading fiber supplements!  Sure, it would be even more healthy to eat the unflavored/ unsweetened version but let's be honest, eating it plain is kind of gross.  I would be more likely to skip breakfast than eat it plain.	1
These tasted great and were very crunchy. I will definitely get them again.	1
These were softer than the normal nature valley bar, and they taste great. Well worth buying again, provided I can contain myself and not eat them all at once!	1
good treat for in between  tasty and just enough for one	1
Good	1
Lightly sweet -- only six grams of sugar -- a normal candy bar can have well over 20 grams of sugar. I checked two candy bars against this nut crisp and both contained the same three grams of protein and two grams of fiber. And, although it is a small bar, it is satisfying and stays with you longer without the huge sugar spike. Crunchy and delicious. A better alternative than a candy bar.. .	1
Delicious taste, but a bit crumbly.  Maybe a chewy version would be better.	1
good	1
I have eaten a LOT of desert in my lifetime, so can generally pick out a good sweet snack. These are not overly sweet and contain a low 6 grams of sugar, so a good sweet snack for those watching their sugar intake. They are thin, relatively crispy bars, as are a group of seeds an chopped nuts held together by a light sugar syrup coating. The bottom of the bar has a thing coat of dark chocolate.	1
Great	1
OMG! I bought these by mistake in the store a couple of months ago and they are now my favorite go to snack! Just the right size too. A hint of salty and sweet. Perfect combo!	1
Very tasty with nuts and seeds.	1
This "Palmolive Dish Liquid, Original, 28 Ounce is very easy on my hands & softens them imensly.	1
Great value - big bottle lasts long!	1
Palmolive is a great standard product for washing dishes.  I don't care for the scent or I would have made it a 5 star.  I am adding bleach to my dish water when I use it though so you cannot smell it anyway!	1
Seemed more watered down and runny than any store purchase I've made of the exact same product	-1
Good soap	1
awesome	1
Great price.  Works well, easy on hands.  Nice scent.	1
love it	1
While I wouldn't wish the after-effects of this stuff on anyone, it's good to know that others have experienced the same residual smell problem. This has never happened to me before and for awhile I thought I was the only one experiencing it. Even if I rinse and rinse and rinse, it's still there.  To add insult to injury, it doesn't clean very well even if I scrub something to within an inch of its life. I've always considered Palmolive to be a reputable brand, but it really dropped the ball with this product. I'm unable to recommend it.	-1
Good!	1
I use this for hand soap in the bathroom and in the soap dispenser on our kitchen sink, much cheaper than buying stuff marketed as hand soap. Works best when diluted slightly, to about 1/5-1/3 water. Over diluted and it works fine, but is too runny.	1
Second to none dishwashing liquid! Dont even bother with another brand!	1
I have been using it for years. I like it.	1
Good standard dish liquid. Helps breakdown grease effectively, and is a good price.	1
great smell and works wonderfully on oil and grease	1
It cleans dishes and my hands are not the worse for wear...See Madge	1
This dish soap gets the job done quite well	1
Easier on hands than some detergents and seems to get the dishes clean!	1
good dishwash liquid	1
Does a great job.	1
Good grease cutter	1
Does not lather unless you use a lot, which equates to simply pouring money down the drain.  And does an astonishingly poor job or removing residue.	-1
Good price, good value!	1
This really suds up very well and has a very nice aroma..	1
Great deal, good stuff!!	1
Dish soap, what can I say?	1
It's dish soap.  And it works.  LOL  No complaints, but don't know what else to say.	1
I remember my grandmother using this stuff. I remember the old TV commercials where the manicurist would have their customers soak their hands in the Palmolive.  This product does exactly what it says it does, very sexy cuts the grease and it softens your skin.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I found that Palmolive has another dishwashing liquid that uses OxiClean and I prefer that one.	1
Love Palmolive to clean pots and pans.  Also cleaning around kitchen.  The scent is nice.  Great price.	1
Works great as always!	1
best soap for the kitchen.	1
i love palmolive! they always leave my dishes absolutely spotless! i love it!! they always leave my hands feeling super soft! i will always choose palmolive over other dish soaps and you should too.	1
Don't waste your time trying to save money on the cheaper soaps just spend a little bit more on this Palmolive soap and in the end you'll end up saving money and time in the long run because this gets the job done without having to use a lot of it.  I love this soap because it truly does wash dishes effectively. From time to time I see this on sale on Amazon Pantry so look to see if it's on sale from time to time because when it is I find it to be cheaper than it is in stores.	1
Love it.	1
I will not be buying this product again.  It does not compare to Dawn.	-1
Great product.	1
Nice two pack	1
I've been using Palmolive for many years and I'm very happy with it	1
Yes, it's dish soap	1
this soap was worse than the generic brand. It did not suds up at all. Really disappointed and will not buy again.	-1
cleans well, no residue, and suds nicely.	1
ok	1
Love this stuff	1
good product, good for grease	1
Good product.  As described.	1
This is good for the hands, when you wash a lot of dishes, and the larger size is great!!	1
Been a huge Palmolive fam for years. This was packaged well and i.really couldn't beat the price. Prime Pantry has never let me down.  If you've never checked it out. ..well you'll be glad you did	1
Most affordable dish detergent available, and it really gets the job done too. I see people complaining about the scent but it's not really bothersome at all.	1
Good dish soap.  Very cheap. What else is there to say.	1
I love Palmolive. Works & Cleans great	1
Best soap for the price.  I bought Palmolive before in the bulk gallon size but per ounce, this size is a better buy.  Bought a dozen  bottles!	1
Very nice	1
GREAT	1
I got a really good deal on Amazon pantry for these. Really pleased with my purchase.	1
Good	1
I have always enjoyed Campbell's Chunky Soups because you definitely feel like you are eating a meal and not just a soup. This particular variety has not been available in my local grocery store, so I was curious to try it when I saw it here on Amazon. Wow! The dumplings make all the difference. This is just like eating beef stew with dumplings. Guilty pleasure to the max. Yes, it is not the same as home made. No canned product can match that. But for a quick meal, and with the all the veggies and the tender beef, this is a great "soup". Try it, you will like it!	1
Good flavor but the dumplings are a weird texture and throw off the rest of the soup.	1
My friend loves dumplings, made a great little surprise gift.	1
Great	1
yes it is soup	1
Hearty, tasty and way easy to prepare.	1
Tastes great!	1
A+	1
This was pretty good..As far as the dumplings, I could take them of leave them.	1
not great but good	1
Food like substance in every way. Pretty decent, but I liked the chicken pot pie better.	1
My son like this soup	1
great	1
A gift	-1
I'm a Cambells Chunky soup fan. I will purchase again.	1
quick meal	1
Great taste and very filling.  I would buy this again.	1
tastes good	1
I have to admit when I first opened this and dumped it out into a bowl, I was a little disappointed.  It just seemed to have a lot more gravy in it than anything else...At first anyway.  Once I warmed it up and started eating it I realized it was very chunky, and indeed rich and delicious.  The gravy is very dark and flavorful, and there are plenty of meat and veggies.  As for the dumplings that some people have complained about, don't expect the traditional ball style dumplings that Mom used to make with chicken soup.  The look more like fat sliced mushrooms.  In fact with their appearance I thought they were mushrooms at first. But then the way they melt in your mouth, and with the taste, I realized these were the dumplings. I usually eat something like this on a cold winter night with a big hunk of crusty bread.  But even though it's still warm here and not much of an ambiance yet for a hot bowl of soup, I just had the hankerin' for it any way.  I found it excellent and can't wait to enjoy it this winter when it will be even better.  Also, at the time of this writing this goes for less than what it can be bought for at the market here...Actually considerably less..  I don't know how long that will last but for now its a solid deal with prime pantry.  Really delicious and a bargain...Highly recommended...	1
I'm very happy with this purchase.	1
Perfect Speedy dinner meal	1
Tasty.	1
Yummy in my tummy.	1
Don't care for it. Texture of dumplings are poor, the flavor is overly salted - better than nothing if your hungover. But not great.	-1
Good soup if you need a quick meal. Definitely not homemade tasting but not bad either.	1
love	1
Good soup.  Not great soup. Good taste.  And as always too much salt.	1
It is almost unconscionable to title (and in caps!)  this otherwise good soup with "Beef" as the primary ingredient. In every can I have opened the average number of dime-sized little squares of beef  is five. One amazing can actually had ten of the itty-bitty beef pieces.  If you do not mind the lack of beef, this is actually one of the better vegetable soups on the market and for that reason alone I AM re-ordering. I gave the product one star because my family found  the lack of a substantive beef component frankly disgusting and deceitful and I have to agree with them.	-1
Ok	1
Love it!	1
Mmmmm MMMMmmmm  Good	1
This is mostly mushy congealed flour pieces and hardly anything else.	-1
We ordered this chunky beef dumpling soup via Prime Pantry and we liked it. The dumplings were more like thick noodles (didn't taste like they actually had anything in them) but overall it was good. The chunks of beef are a good size and the flavor is good.  If you like chili and don't mind a little spicy kick, we loved this one by the same company,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Campbell-s-Chunky-Chili-Hot-Spicy-Beef-Bean-Firehouse-19-Ounce/dp/B015IO2NO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Campbell's Chunky Chili, Hot & Spicy Beef & Bean Firehouse, 19 Ounce</a>&nbsp;Yum, yum! Smile. Hope this is helpful!	1
It is there and no going to the store.	1
great	1
Both hubbie and I liked it and he doesnt usually like dumplins	1
Campbell's chicken soup sucks but this guy is great!!!	1
I love canned soup for evenings when it is chilly and you don't have time to make homemade. Add some grilled cheese and thats a good meal, folks! This is a great brand and always quality.	1
only soup my hubby will eat,besides homemade soup	1
This tasted awesome.	1
I had this for lunch today and I think the word dumpling in the name of the product should be changed to big thick round noodles instead of dumpling. I've had many a dumpling in my 42 years and the dumplings in this can were not dumplings.  Despite the misnaming of the product, the soup actually tasted okay once I got over the disappointment of it being more noodle like than dumplings.  Could use a lot less salt, but it's a can of soup. Canned soups are notoriously salt laden.  There were ample vegetables and the beef was actual beef as opposed to that funky faux meat or soylent green some companies use.  I provided this review for informational purposes only. I paid full price for this can of soup and received no discounts.	1
This soup is pretty good, not my favorite from the chunky brand. The dumplings seemed kinda slimey but overall it was pretty good. Quality that you'd expect from Campbell's.  The price was good when added to a pantry box to save on shipping.  Soup arrived fresh and well within its expiration date.	1
Good Product... Thank you.	1
I could like almost any Chunky soup, but this one is better than most to me.  But I've got to honest here. I'm waiting for a hip replacement right now and I'm having a lot of trouble walking, which means that buying groceries on amazon and having delivered just recently occurred to me.  Grocery shopping here is even more treacherous than usual, and by leaving items in my cart I've seen some pretty outrageous things happen to the pricing. So here's what I do.  I use the Camelizer, which is a free download and will track prices and give you the 411 on how the price is today. I see that this has been changing from $1.69 to $2.08 recently and the lower price is really a pretty good deal if you like this soup like I do.  So if you have several soups in your cart or list to check on when you go to fill a box, you can always pick the best deals on your favorites. This will make it easier to fill your box with savings, paying about the same as the good local prices without burning up gas and time or doing any loading or unloading.  If you need it, order some Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper, black or a blend, too. Because for me at least, they just make Chunky soup a little unseasoned because it's for everybody and I'm not everybody.  At a buck 69, delivered to my door? Bring it on, I can 5 star Chunky soup.	1
Not bad for can soup	1
Tastes like chemicals.	-1
Not Campbell's best idea.  Dumplings are unappetizing, lack good flavor.  Will no buy this item again.	-1
This is a great tasting soup but is close to being a stew.  The dumplings are ok, but are the flat southern style dumplings.  I love keeping extra cans of this in the pantry for something hearty but fast.  I have on occassion made my own (Jiffy or bisquick baking mix) dumplings and dropped them in.	1
A bit like watered down beef broth with veggies thrown in.  And I didn't notice the dumplings at all.  I guess I thought they were a veggie which doesn't say anything good about the soup.  I was expecting the chunky style soups I am use to getting from them.  This wasn't.	-1
Yep.. It is food.	1
Too salty, like most prepared soups.	1
pretty good flavor and packed with veggies!	1
ok	1
i'll buy something else.	-1
great value grocery item delivered directly to my door	1
Great	1
The dumplings were gross.	-1
mm, mm,  good...	1
Good hearty soup.	1
Most of the campbells canned soups are pretty good. I don't have any complaints here. Its canned soup, so you can't be expecting some gourmet delicacy. Decent vegetable to meat ratio. Salt level was fair. Pretty good overall for a quick meal	1
Tasty	1
Great with scoop Frito lay corn chips or corn tortilla chips! Try it!	1
love it	1
Good soup.  Good flavor and it does satiate.	1
for my son	1
It's okay	1
Good stuff manard!	1
good	1
Yum on a cold winter's day.	1
Another great soup from the folks at Campbell's.	1
Good to keep in your bomb shelter ...	-1
These soups are amazing.	1
love it! Cambell's has yet another Healthy Request soup! Keep 'em coming.	1
Nasty!  I had to pour all the cans in the garbage.  Terrible taste.	-1
Icky. Didn't realize it was the healthy heart recipe  The original chicken corn chowder is the best flavor offered under the Campbell's chunky soup line	-1
Good as is. Better (for my tastes) with more corn added.	1
Great product!	1
Good soup.  Not great soup. Good taste.  And as always too much salt.	1
New flavor for me and I like it a lot !	1
not good	-1
One of our favorites	1
Very good, but contain too much sodium ( salt).  My grandkids ate more than I did, so it must have been good for them to eat it.	1
Way to pricey for soup!	1
Good, hearty soup.	1
As advertised	1
Yuck.  too thick	-1
Tasty.	1
This was a delicious choice.  Tasty corn chowder.	1
As expected, great price.	1
its ok	1
I did not like how this tasted. I love lasagna usually but the sauce they have in this isn't very good.	-1
This is one of our favorites of the Velveeta Skillets. I'm not a big fan of lasagna, but I do like this quite a bit.  Velveeta dinner boxes are better than the Hamburger Helper. While I love the idea of Hamburger Helper, most of their ingredients are powdered and taste like everything else. The Velveeta Boxes are different. There's no additives to make the recipe exactly as it is on the box (other than water) and like the cheese is in a pouch.  I wouldn't say it will turn out looking like the picture. It won't. It will, however, be tasty.	1
I had never tasted it before this purchase and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor is great and I think you get your moneys worth.	1
Judging by the other reviews, the bad taste was not just me. I like the lasagna flavored Hamburger Helper and I figured this would be better, because of the Velveeta. Nope. I can make something better from scratch.  It tasted very fake, like I was eating only fillers and preservatives. I even added Italian seasoning to the meat and extra cheese at the end and it didn't help the flavor.	-1
Tastes great and is quick and easy to make.	1
Good Quality. Great Price. Fast Delivery.	1
This boxed dinner is an easy weeknight meal for the family Just add some browned ground meat and you're good to go! I occasionally like to add a bag of frozen vegetables to the mix to get some nutrition in. You can also add some flavor by including onion, garlic, and/or peppers in the ground meat mixture.	1
GOOD	1
yummy	1
Mad this last week.  Kids liked it and me as well.	1
mmmm	1
Good, easy to make.	1
SENT PRIME PANTRY FOR COLLEGE STUDENT  PERFECT	1
great dinner	1
Velvetta products taste good. The skillet meals are a quick easy meal when time is limited. Match with a great salad or vegs and done.	1
I'm a fan of Velveeta cheese, so I thought I would give this a try. Big mistake! The cheese is totally different, the seasoning was horrible, and I'm shocked we even finished eating it. My dog wouldn't even touch it and she loves pasta and meat. I can't even describe the taste.	-1
tasted like chillie	-1
We like these velveeta meals from time to time. They are easy to make and very good!	1
Was a Gift to-for Another...but, They "Loved IT also"!!....driggs, 1/17/16	1
Great Product	1
Tasty very easy to prepare.	1
These are my favorite easy meal planning quick fixes. My kids love lasagna, so I decided to give this kind a shot. I have purchased every other kind they have made. I am not as big of a fan of this one compared to others by velveeta, but the kids tore it up. I like to add fresh veggies to spruce it up and give it a healthier aspect to it.	1
I wouldn't call this Lasagna. It is like Midwest Goulash. It is much better than the Hamburger helper version. It takes about 20 minutes to make, and like many pastas it is better the second day.	1
Excellent ...	1
The rolls are extra thin I wish I had a regular roll to compare seriously you're wasting your money	-1
like to save time by ordering online.  These batteries are good in so many electronics; these are for key finders	1
Very good price for these.	1
Too big for my item. It was the risk of finding online...	-1
Taste great and none of the disgusting artificial ingredients found in most other brands of mac and cheese.	1
It's really hard to believe this comes from a box because it comes out super creamy and so good!  The kids absolutely love it and I love that it's organic!	1
Delicious macaroni and cheese, without any of the artificial dyes found in the traditional "blue box" meals.  I prefer this over the Trader Joe's white cheddar macaroni and cheese boxed meal.  I've found heating up the milk/water in a measuring cup and then mixing in the cheese (then pour over the cooked noodles) works well.	1
Tip: the cheese powder is really salty, so mix WELL. I've started to mix the cheese sauce in the pot while the shells are draining in the sink so that the powered cheese doesn't get stuck in the nooks and crannies on the noodles.	1
YUM! A little more expensive than basic mac and cheese. But really good!	1
Can't go wrong with white cheddar, love when I can get organic food for the same price as conventional - which I did on this order.	1
I mix them with whole wheat organic pasta elbows to stretch further. Kids love 'em.	1
Great Product	1
loved it!	1
good	1
The lower sodium is really a nice factor in this. We can't taste any difference, but the nutritional profile is a lot better.	1
I am reviewing the online grocery experience with Amazon. It was really neat experience to be online buying food! Its easy to use- kinda fun, but the really good thing is it matches coupons for you! That in itself, makes the experience awesome.	1
Gotta love this stuff!!!!  I like it with any meal.  Great price from my friends at Amazon.  And they brought it to my door!	1
If your restricted on sodium. This is great when coupled with chicken.	1
Great	1
great product definately would buy again	1
Stove Top Stuffing. Good flavor, easy, and goes with almost any protein.	1
A little salt(sodium) can be a good thing.	1
Great stuffing! It was fresh and arrived in great condition. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.	1
Hubby really like this.. Rather have this then homemade stuffing..I make an excellent stuffing btw way, but hubby's Moms grew him up on this brand. I serve him his and then doctor mine up with a bit more braised onions.	1
I like the low sodium. You can tell it is low sodium but other than that it tastes good.	1
I love stuffing and this makes such a great addition to a chicken dinner. Nice flavor that enhances what can be a ho-hum chicken dinner.	1
Really good, easy to make and you can control the sodium.  Not like the old Stove Top	1
Love it!	1
Nice to be able to enjoy a quicky side dish not loaded with salt . Can't find in store. Found in prime pantry .	1
Not home made, but works out well when traveling.	1
Good, very good.	1
Was very good with our Thanksgiving dinner!	1
Great item helps so much	1
as described	1
Product is as described - Very good	1
thanks	1
This for the price it is fun, I make it , let it cool add one egg, make patties and roll it in bread crumbs then fry. Yummy. You can add peas,or chicken pieces, or drained corn get creative, best product . makes my family happy. Its not just for thanksgiving, I use it year round. Id give it 6 stars if they had it.	1
My fianc always wants some kind of pasta/bread with dinner. We always enjoy this stuffing mix as a side with our Thanksgiving meal and have even taken the time to make it an entre itself with adding chicken, broccoli and cheese also. These whip in just a few minutes and taste great.	1
When comparing regular Stove Top stuffing to this lower sodium variety the difference in taste is negligible, but the sodium drops from around 390mg to 250mg -- the other numbers calories, sugar, fat, etc. all remain the same. A painless way to reduce sodium without sacrificing the taste.  I usually reduce the butter/margarine from four tablespoons to two -- and I use olive oil instead. I add a couple extra tablespoons of water to replace the moisture. This does not magically make the product healthy, but it is slightly healthier. Note, for those people with a sensitivity to the additive, the product does contain monosodium glutamate.  I had difficulty finding this product locally, so I was happy to see it available here.	1
Just as expected = thank you.	1
Arrived in good shape.	1
What can I say? Love, Love, Love this!	1
Much better then the original that is way too salty!! The low sodium has great flavor and a favorite now :)	1
Tastes just as good as the higher sodium one- really there's no difference at all in taste. I like it.	1
Very cheesy and delicious.	1
These are very easy to make and they are so good! They come with a velveeta cheese packet to make your hash browns extra cheesy!	1
Tasty, high in sodium	1
Have not tried it yet but it looks good.	1
Salt city.	-1
Also very cheesy	1
Easy to make and great taste.  The kids loved this.	1
Terrible product, even when prepared carefully and according to instruction. Just a mess, don't know how these ever escaped the Kraft test kitchens. Don't buy this, just nuke a couple of spuds, mash them a little, and melt a couple slices of cheese on top. That'd be cheaper, less sodium, and better for you.	-1
Great potatoes	1
Pretty simple, easy and shelf friendly so we can have them any time. These are tasty cheesy potatoes (hash browns) just like you'd expect. My only qualms with it is that it is a little too oniony. Otherwise, they were really good.	1
Pretty good	1
Good product. Quick shipping.	1
good hashbrowns and even better if you add some of your own ingredients	1
These are okay. Easy to make but just meh in flavor. It's good to have in a pinch for breakfast or dinner, but overall you can make more tasty hashbrowns on your own for a little more time.	1
I love these Hash Browns, even if slightly salty. I just wish someone could invent Microwave Hash Browns that tasted as good as this.	1
Great for cooking.	1
Great item.	1
Very tasty and great quality.	1
THIS IS GREAT FOR BAKING. GOOD TASTE	1
So the name Crunchy Pretzel so I had to try it. Was rather tasty and was a nice twist on the standard Shake N Bake	1
this was so good on chicken fingers. Gone in a flash. I will buy again.	1
We enjoyed this. The flavor is not as strong as we like, but that is easily fixed with seasonings of our choice. The crunchiness is really good.	1
Don't normally use or like these type of mixes but this one is actually very good. I used it on chicken breast and it was crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside. Will buy again for a quick and easy meal.	1
I had never used shake and bake before and only chose this to fill in the last tiny spot in my prime pantry box. So glad I picked this, it's really good!  I used it to make chicken nuggets. Everyone raved about them and already requested  I make it again. Glad there are two packages included!	1
good price	1
Like to have this in the pantry at all times	1
It's Shake and Bake .... and I helped.	1
Crunchy Pretzel Seasoned Coating mix from Shake'N Bake?  Sounded too yummy to not try. When I opened the packet of Crunchy Pretzel breading, I was so skeptical - just smelled like crushed pretzels.  I almost added seasoning, then changed my mind so I could honestly review the product on its own.  I was sure I would be disappointed. However, the taste was mind blowingly wonderful. Applied the coating to 4 beautiful, boneless, lean pork loin chops and baked them up.  Crunchy and so flavorful on the outside while keeping the meat juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to try it with chicken!	1
Easy to use,  just shake and bake like the package says.  It had a good taste, but I prefer other seasonings.  Worth a try if you're looking for something different.	1
ok the best, best shake n bake every.  i am on my 3rd purchse.  this time had to order more than just the one or 2.  It covers alot-i still haven't used a full package on a full tray of chicken.  Tastes so good.  I love pretzels and i feel this is the tastiest-not as salty and doesnt overwhelm.  I know i will never go back to the other flavors-so better keep this one in stock.  great price too.  thus I so highly recommend	1
thanks	1
This stuff is delicious.  I used it to top a couple of pans of homemade macaroni and cheese.  The pretzel flavor is subtle and a nice change of pace from your usual bread crumbs.	1
I used this crunchy pretzel breading mix to coat skinless, boneless chicken breasts that I cooked in an air fryer. I cut every piece of fat off the chicken, coated with this mix and then cooked for 15 minutes. The air frying blows heated air around, like a convection oven, and the dry air helps create a crisp exterior, but it can cause food to dry out. And, without any additional fat added to the fryer, I was concerned that the result might be dried-out and stringy, but the meat was moist and delicious with a satisfying crunchy exterior in part because this mix helped seal in the juices.  Perfect with chicken, the seasoning is not too salty and definitely tastes like pretzels. The mix created a quick, economical and tasty chicken dish when I was short on time. I will absolutely buy again.	1
Delicious, nice crispy flavorful coating that helps keel the chicken moist.	1
We do like the sauce, but not a lot of difference in flavors than the other types made.	1
Tastes good on meat grilled or cooked on the broiler	1
Excellent!	1
Mild taste and not too sweet. No high fructose corn syrup is a plus.	1
Very good.	1
nice addition to amazon pantry - delivered to doorstep	1
Grandson loves it.	1
These are fantastic for easy meals when I want potatoes but don't want to spend time cooking them. They take about 30 minutes to cook.	1
Not good just taste like paste	-1
tasted great	1
grandkids love this	1
Great item and shipping!	1
While I am generally a from scratch cooker, I make an exception with these versatile and economical Velveeta Cheesy Au Gratin Potatoes, and always keep a box or two in my pantry.  These au gratin potatoes are easy to fix and can bake at the same time as a roast or other main dish in your oven.  Versatile, I usually doctor them up a bit with the addition of one or more of the following:  chopped herbs, green onion, garlic, red bell pepper, a bit of chopped ham or bacon, extra cheese sprinkled on top.  I deviate from the preparation instructions by baking at a lower temperature for a long period of time.  I also add the cheese sauce at the initial preparation with the boiling water and milk, and cover the baking dish with foil.  Adding the cheese sauce at the end of the baking diluted the hot temperature too much for our tastes.  Yummy and delicious, any leftovers warm up nicely the next day for a lunch side dish.	1
Very good. Not overly sweet. Has a good taste. Made bbq chicken. Yum!	1
We do big BBQs regularly and everybody always loves this sauce.	1
I like it and us it often good on grill and oven	1
Great sauce, husband loves it on everything!	1
Great Taste - I prefer Kraft to Sweet Baby Ray's	1
not very tastey sbr is way better	-1
Arrived promptly and in good condition.  Appears to be a good, tasty flavor of sauce.	1
"Item was For Others, etc..but..They told me that IT...was "very Good", etc.....driggs, 8/28/16	1
This 18 ounce bottle of Kraft Slow-Simmered Sweet Honey Barbecue Sauce makes leftover meats come out with a good taste of enhanced honey flavor without overpowering the barbecue component. I also recently had this Kraft sweet honey barbecue sauce with leftover pizza which came out tasting better than if I hadnt applied the sauce.	1
Thanks	1
It's basic BBQ sauce. Goes with everything.	1
Good flavor	1
I made it in my oven. The potatoes were tasty, cheesy, just delicious. I had a mess to scrub the pan afterwards. Next time I am cooking on the stove.	1
great item	1
I got these at the same time I got the bacon scalloped. It came very quickly and packed nice and tight in the box. It wasn't as good as the bacon scalloped but u wouldn't mind stuffing my face again with it. Better than any other brand of scalloped potatoes.	1
Love all Velveeta products better than the other brands on the market.  Better cheese with Velveeta and much better taste.	1
I've tried boxed before without much luck but these change the game for me! They're very tasty and hearty too, I'll be buying more of them for sure!	1
Very Cheesy	1
These are great to have on hand for quick side dish. Cheezy.	1
Very tasty and thick.	1
Really good, I can't get this flavor in my area.	1
thanks	1
good flavor.  liked by the kids and adult.  I would buy again.	1
Love this BBQ sauce. They don't use high fructose corn syrup (yeah!). The price is also great, just as cheap or cheaper than my local grocery store (Smith's or Kroger)	1
I have always loved Kraft barbecue sauce. I like a sweeter sauce and this fits the bill. Arrived on time.	1
My girls have barbecue sauce with almost everything... they love the sweet, honey and regular or calm flavors, this was a hit and I am so glad I bought a  couple of bottles!	1
Like the other Kraft cheese/potato mixes, this is not good at ALL. Too much salt, too expensive for what it is. Buy your own slices of cheese or some cheese powder, slice up some potatoes, add some salt/pepper/paprika/milk. Much better taste, just as easy, and better for you!	-1
Good but not great.  I like these better than the version with bacon, however there are other better boxed off the shelf version scalloped potatoes out there.  All in all for the most part I'm really disappointed with most of these Velveeta brand boxed products.	1
Good, easy to make	1
Family really likes this version. We are watching salt intake, so this is a once in a while thing,  Nice cheesy taste, fast and easy to make. Wish the portion was a bit larger.	1
One of my staple dishes.  Can use this as a base for a cassarole and add to make other meals.	1
Very cheesy.	1
taste is whatever (2 out of 5) [] crunchy is good (3 out of 5) [] the feel or hardness of the chip/cracker feels different. not really my type of snack although i go for more crunchy (1.5 out of 5) [] total basically just around 2 out of 5 stars.	-1
Got that snap i love them	1
Great taste.  Love it on everything cooked outside.	1
Very good bbq sauce - glad I purchased.	1
Yum	1
Used this sauce in a recipe for ribs and sauerkraut and it has just the flavor I was looking for as a brown sugar based product. It offset the tartness of the sauerkraut nicely. Everyone enjoyed the dish.	1
Love the flavor of this bbq sauce. Not too spicy and it's sweet.	1
This sauce arrived quickly and in great condition.  Like the hint of brown sugar, but not too sweet.	1
Thanks	1
This was great on chicken for basting on the BBQ. Loved the taste.	1
Very tasty.	1
I really enjoy this BBQ sauce.  I will be buying this again.	1
Can't find it in the grocery store anymore.  Great to have stashed in the cabinet when that old "now what will I cook for supper" question arises.	1
boy, surprised this product is still on the market. I used it over 50 years ago when a bride! I like to keep it on my pantry shelf.	1
Takes me back to my childhood when my mom fixed this !! Easy & fast to make ! Great Taste !	1
receved	1
Super yummy, great price.	1
Good	1
Same great taste after all these years.	1
Shake n bake!	1
Basic breading shortcut for chicken (or other foods) for those times when you haven't got the energy/inclination to set up a dredging station.	1
I love this stuff!	1
Although I like the original better, this was a nice change for dark meat pieces.  Does not stick to white meat because the morsels of coating are thicker and white meat is to dry to absorb them.  They just fall off.	1
Love to use on chicken  and pan fry it is so good	1
Received a fresh product with a good expiration date.  If this helps, Please rate this review as helpful. Thanks!	1
Love the crispiness of on old favorite,  Same taste but much better texture,	1
Exactly as described	1
Yummy!  So easy and delicious!  And crispy!	1
I use this to coat my fried chicken. For a family of 5 it takes both pouches. It's so easy and delicious!!! My husband and kids mark this one down as one of their favorite meals!	1
I love fried chicken, but it never seems to come out right for me at home.  It also isn't cheap (cheep) at the local fried chicken place.  With this I can cook the chicken in the oven, without oil, and it comes out good.  It isn't exactly the same as deep fried, but I like it just as well.	1
It's Shake 'n Bake, always does the job. Good stuff!	1
Great on your chicken just gives it a different taste. You'll love it.	1
great	1
love on chicken	1
This is a great alternative to the "blue box" macaroni and cheese dinners you usually encounter.  I feel good about eating the Back to Nature version, because it has no artificial flavors or preservatives.  Yes, it's the powdered cheese version, so it's not a very thick sauce (as another review commented), but it's still delicious!  I recommend this version and also the white cheddar flavor too.	1
Probably my new favorite Mac and cheese ever. Will definitely be buying again!	1
Excellent.	1
good	1
I have tried several of my "own" chicken coating recipes to include bread crumbs, corn flakes and the like. When it comes down to it though, shake and bake is the bomb, it is no fail, easy and tastes great every time.	1
Arrived quickly, as described.	1
yummy	1
Great product, at a great price!	1
GREAT	1
Excellent.  We love this healthy Mac and cheese.	1
My grandkids love it!	1
these weren't terrible, I figured being organic it would be terribly bland or something. almost the same as off brand taste wise, the pasta itself could be better though. kinda has the thin texture to it as the microwavable velveta shells.	1
good	1
tastes good	1
Not only are the shake n bake coating mixes sooo  good on pork (which comes out very moist every time) and chicken- fish and shrimp benefit when breaded with this as well. Easy and yummy!	1
Yummo	1
Haven't used yet, but, I've been using Shake n'Bake for as long as I can remember & have always been happy	1
Got what I expected and we love shake n bake for chicken and use it often.	1
Great value and product	1
Came opened.	-1
Tasty and delicious on chicken, beef, pork, and really anything you want. Great price and has a nice aroma.	1
In a taste test with Sweet Baby Ray's, it comes in second.  But for the price, it's a winner!  This Kraft Barbecue Sauce has a thick, rich flavor and really sparks up a chicken breast or a pork chop.	1
always good	1
Best BBQ sauce ever in my opinion. It has just the right blend of sweet and tangy.	1
My son's new favorite sauce. I have been looking for something new to try and this is a hit with my family.	1
very good	1
Very nice flavored sauce. Family wanted and finished the bottle the same day.	1
Tastes great, less filling	1
Perfect BBQ not too thick deep little bit spicy taste love it	1
This is a terrific barbecue sauce better than most I've had even in barbecue places voted the "best" or "number one" in an area.  There's a great  hint of mustard, tomato, vinegar, and sweetness that combined with spices and herbs just tastes good. It is thick enough to dip a rib into and have the sauce cling.  Its companion sauce the Kansas City style also is wonderful.  I'm a good cook and I'd have to work a long time to make a sauce this good.  Thanks to Amazon and Prime Pantry and great price, I always have these on hand.	1
"Item was For Others, etc..but..They told me that IT...was "very Good", etc.....driggs, 8/28/16	1
Love the regular Bull's Eye Barbecue sauce and love this flavor too.	1
Thanks	1
Jost tried it tonight for first time.  EXCELLENT.  Will be my new norm and I will pass jf on. I LOVE IT	1
This is some delightful BBQ sauce I must say as far as over the counter stuff goes. I use to be all about the Kraft BBQ sauce and I still enjoy it but this is better on all levels, it has less sugar and carbs than the Kraft and the taste is on point. Use this on pork, chicken, beef, or whatever else you please. Very good flavor without being too sweet and thick enough to coat meats. Great for dipping or marinating, I've done it both ways and will continue to use this for my BBQ needs.	1
Not a big bbq fan, but this is pretty good sauce. I would buy it again.	1
Fine basic BBQ Sauce, though perhaps a little generic.  Worked well with Pulled Pork.	1
This is a regular product I buy, but price is much better here.  Gives us a chance to try new products.	1
tasted great	1
Perfect for baking	1
Chocolate that I have been using for over 40+ years.  The ONLY disappointment that I have and I am sure others have noticed and are not happy about, is the squares being literally half the size in each box, so for example if you need eight ounces of this chocolate (and any of their other varieties) that means that you MUST buy TWO of the boxes...one will not suffice for a recipe anymore, since one box now equals FOUR OUNCES, not eight.  We are actually paying TWICE THE PRICE for one box, which means that we are being forced to do so.	1
Fresh (no bloom), and always a good staple chocolate.	1
I purchased this, wanting to use for my baking. The next thing I've realized, my father had eat this on its own. Guess it's good enough to be eaten alone. This can also be broken into pieces!  This is "unsweetened", which I believe is good for diabetics.	1
wow was this a great deal at only .60	1
Great product as advertised.	1
makes such tasty and easy chops, fish, chicken.	1
Makes and excellent pork meal. Oven baked, no oil mess. Coating crispy and meat remains moist	1
Exactly as described	1
I use this once is a while for a change of pace. Nice flavor and an easy dinner fix. I will add 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning for another tweak.	1
My husband loves fried food but luckily for his heart, also likes Shake n' Bake.  Although we buy Kraft as well as generic coatings for our pork chops and drumsticks, Kraft does cook better.  The results seem crunchier and a tad less salty.	1
It's Shake 'n Bake, always does the job. Good stuff.	1
I love Shake N Bake for pork... I use this for pork chops and it is my favorite preparation. For a while we made pork chops several different ways but I came back to Shake N Bake. I love the combination of spices and it always tastes great with potatoes and a vegetable.  Easy to use, just put the seasoning in a bag, add a pork chops and shake, shake, shake... by the way my son loves to help shake the bag.  Put the covered pork chops on a pan and bake.	1
Can't get any easier.  Comes out perfect crisp with a nice mild cheddar flavor.	1
makes pork nice and tender	1
love shake and bake	1
Pantry item	1
Shake N' Bake original pork is one of my all time favorites. I like to coat my pork chops for some really scrumptious flavor. I also like to mix up different flavors and shake them all up in one container. I even mix up the chicken and pork kinds. I would suppose on average that my boys ask me at least once a week to make something with Shake N' Bake. It makes for a great easy dinner. Coat your desired meat, pop in the oven and ta da dinner is served. Ok maybe a vegetable and a side dish too with a salad of course haha. But yes I like Shake N' Bake.	1
My husband uses this to cook pork chops and the taste is excellent.	1
good item	1
Good option for the kids instead of fried. Good flavor. Not bad overall	1
luv this	1
Great	1
Family said, better than expected.  Could do without the bright orange color.	1
When I saw this kind I didn't even know it existed so I was excited to try it, and it came in my pantry box and we had it with chicken. This is really very good and gives a good spin on regular chicken.	1
Super good! We used on bone in chicken drummies, wish we would have just made our own chicken nuggets with it or something boneless. Was good though!	1
Love these.  Although, ours arrived, soaked from a broken bottle of hand soap.	1
tasted great	1
Not a strong cheddar flavor, but still a great shake and bake.	1
same old shake a bake, love to use for a quick zip to my boneless pork chops	1
Arrived in good order.	1
We have used Shake N Bake for many years, and the pork chop variety is our favorite. I placed this in my Pantry box because the price was the same as I would pay locally, and it allowed me to stock up my cupboard. The date was fresh, and I was happy.  Tonight, after stopping by the butcher, I brought home pork chops and we had them for the family. While I am sure you either like or don't like this, I thought I'd throw my two cents worth in.	1
I BOUGHT 4 OR 5 BOXS.  I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE BITE.  SOOOOO.  I CAN SAY THIS.  GIRLS FROM 5 TO 12 LOVE THESE POTATOES!!!!!!!!	-1
Did not like the taste or flavor of this. Will not buy it again. Yuck.	-1
These are really bland. They are no where near as good as the Idahoan brand that are cheaper and easier to make.	-1
Ended up tossing it in the trash. It tasted worse than ham burger helper meals.	-1
I bought 6 boxes in one order and 2 more in a separate order because we always use 4 boxes at a time for our big family. If I had known how just bleh it was going to be, I would have saved my money. If you are thinking in any way shape or form these potatoes will taste anything like the Betty Crocker version, you are sadly mistaken. Imagine if you baked potato slices in milk and water and hem threw in a cheese sauce from a deluxe Mac n cheese after it was done, because that's exactly what you do. It's just not that good.	-1
Received four double boxes and three single boxes.  Ordered one.	-1
Disappointing. Annie's or Kraft is much better. Will not be reordering.	-1
Not so good.	-1
Thick and stale. Previous brands have been thin and light.	-1
The chips are super thick and taste odd. I've had other kinds of blue corn chips before that were good. These are not.	-1
These taste pretty good, other than being a bit bland. I was very disappointed though to see that they contain canola oil. Or at least they might have canola oil. I really hate when a product states that it contains one of three different oils. Sunflower or safflower is okay, but canola is not. Why not just say which it is? Until they decide to not use canola, I won't be buying them again.	-1
These were quite stale and not as flavorful as I had hoped.	-1
I did not like the taco shells, thy were stale and did not taste good.	-1
These were VERY STALE. I'm super bummed as I'd finally found organic shells! The date on the box was not past expiration.	-1
These taco shells break easily and they're small so they don't hold much.	-1
I have two main complaints. First, every single one of the shells I received were broken. Out of two boxes! Every. Single. One. Completely useless. Also, the shells were stale and not very good. (I thought of maybe using the broken shells for a taco salad but they were too gross to eat.)  Also, everything in the pantry box was light (taco shells, tortilla chips, etc.). I learned my lesson when I ordered flour and SmartPop Popcorn and all the popcorn bags were crushed and blown open.	-1
they were all broken!!	-1
Crappy tasting!	-1
they were super stale when i got them. sadface.:(	-1
stale tasting not the same as in the stores.	-1
Not to my taste	-1
These are just the worst thing I have ever tasted. They are super mushy. However, my dogs love them so it wasn't a total loss.	-1
I suppose I was expecting something more like pepperoni, and this isn't it.  The spicing was, in my opinion, very mild, and the consistency was similar to a hot dog, but a bit wetter.  My palate was amused by the hints of kippered herring, yet no fish are listed in the ingredients.  I won't be back.  I think the product name is meant to evoke memories of "Old Wisconsin," not to suggest that these are OLD Beef Sticks.  Don't make that mistake, because you would be wrong if you did.	-1
I never had a bad beef stick until I tried this product. Yuk.  When you bite it large gooey globs of fat or emulsifier squirt into your mouth - disgusting.  I squeezed a ton of it out with my hand trying to figure out what it was - still not sure, just gross.  And to top it all off it doesn't taste good, the spice is completely off, like nothing I've ever tasted on a beef stick before.  I love Old Wisconsin smoked turkey meat sticks, have had many times, spice/texture/etc. is great.  Never imagined their beef sticks could be so awful.	-1
This product had a very strange taste.  I didn't like it at all.  They ended up being dog treats.......I hope I didn't hurt them.	-1
very greasy no flavor	-1
"Beef"? Made of turkey!	-1
Tasty snacks but I got the runs every time I ate them. Will not buy again.	-1
Too salty.	-1
Doesn't do much for me. Reall sticky.	-1
Felt good when applying but ended up drying my lips.	-1
I thought this would be moisturizing.  It isn't at all.  So odd!  It's not as thick as the original Aquaphor.  If I apply it, it wears off very quickly and then my lips feel even drier!  Stick to the original.	-1
doesn't work that well	-1
Not worth the price.	-1
This has Mineral Oil and Paraffin in it, as main ingredients. Both are extractives of Petroleum.  If you like slathering Petroleum onto your skin and absorbing it into your body, well, that's your choice. I really hope Amazon brings in some good skin lotions with healthier ingredients at low prices.	-1
The claim was no sticky after feel. It certainly did not work that way for me, my skin felt tacky. I returned it.	-1
This is great to help you save time (but not water, as you have to rinse it off...) but unfortunately, my sensitive skin is very allergic. I don't recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin...	-1
Not impressed with the flavor	-1
These looked really good, we love coconut  and we love caramel. I couldn't taste any caramel flavor at all, not even a hint of flavor,... just a strange aftertaste. These did taste a bit dry and stale too. Also only a few of the coconut chips looked like the picture, the rest were broken and crumbled in the bag,...not very enjoyable at all.	-1
Smaller than expected.	-1
too small	-1
Plates are too small.  I do not believe the product description stated that these are small plates and not dinner size plates.	-1
too small.	-1
Not really a fan of this soap. It doesn't lather very well, so I end up using more than I would like. Plus it leaves me feeling still a bit dirty and my skin does not feel hydrated. I'll be switching soaps when it runs out.	-1
One day after use, there is a lot of dandruff and itching. Very uncomfortable!	-1
loaded with sugar	-1
I do a lot of gluten free baking, and I normally love Bob's Red Mill.  This mix is really gross though.  The final product smells moldy, and tastes awful.  It's a weird combination of crazy crumbly (you can't even slice it properly), and overly moist (it's so moist that it almost seems raw, no matter how long you cook it).  I bought 5 packages, thinking it was a different bread mix I love.  I've tried three times now, and every time the final product is just not tasty.  It tastes like a combination of bad sourdough, rye, and oat bread.	-1
Too molassesy.  Dry tasting.	-1
i guess i did it wrong. I usually cook from scratch but this was a disaster. we threw it out but will try again.	-1
This box mix comes with 3 sets of instructions: a 3-hour recipe, a 1-hour recipe, and a bread machine recipe. I bought this Country White and also Classic Sourdough mix, and tried both of the manual recipes. The bread in both cases was disappointing once baked. Other reviews said that these mixes are great in bread machines, so I am going to assume that's really the only way to be successful.  Our loaves came out large, round, and only about 1.5 inches high. The crust was fairly crunchy, all good. The inner texture was very spongey, and almost had an undercooked taste even though we baked to the full time recommendation. Having made a lot of bread from scratch, I was initially suspicious about "no-knead" loaves---guess it was too good to be true!	-1
I've bought it for the home bread maker..  but for recipes you'll need more than one!  I thought it was the perfect measurament required for one bread preparation!	-1
Don't know what is wrong with this mix, it comes out flat and heavy.	-1
Not a favorite, the taste has a sweet flavor that just didn't taste right.	-1
This had a strange taste and texture. Country white way better	-1
not good	-1
It didn't rise	-1
Very artificial almond flavor. Very cheap. Get what you pay for.	-1
For reasons known only to Krusteaz, and maybe a few conspiracy theorists, this mix only makes NINE muffins.  Who the heck came up with this idea?  And I could almost forgive that super strange situation if the muffins were good, but these simply aren't.  They're dense, pasty, and way too sweet, especially for an oat bran muffin.  We adore the Krusteaz blueberry muffin mix, which, incidentally, makes a dozen muffins instead of only nine, but we won't be buying the oat bran again.	-1
JUNK	-1
These were very stale. Tasted like clumps of half cooked dough. Really disappointed	-1
Good price. Shipped Prime Pantry with moderate damage! The box was crushed and showed damage. One whole sleeve was crushed.	-1
Never buy crackers online. Go to the store- unless you love broken crackers. Learn from my mistake.	-1
This package was darker than any other package I havep[urchased. Not just one sleeve but every sleeve  in the box, was over cooked and not great.	-1
I like these, but they are so inconsistent, box to box and even bag to bag.  You can get 1 or 2 over-cooked ones in a bag, or a whole tube of them.  From 1 edge brown to both sides brown.  Crackers are pretty dry to start with, obviously.  If they're overcooked, it makes a serious taste and texture difference to me.  I switched to these from Zestas because of that same problem.  Now I'm looking for some other brand and hoping I can find one that won't put out inconsistently made product.	-1
Mine were stale	-1
Stale & Old -- Don't buy food from prime pantry.	-1
Crushed and broken boxes...no refund yet... Maybe just go to the store. Love the brand and taste of the crackers though	-1
Box open & flattened !	-1
ariived broken...	-1
way too sweet. My fault because I prefer Oreo Thins over other Oreos because the filling just tastes like greasy sugar. yuck. threw these out.	-1
Stale	-1
It's just too much "stuff".  You can't bite one without the stuff oozing out from everywhere.  If you do the twist-and-bite move, you get an entire mouthfull of the filling and that's just way too much.  We only ordered these because for some reason I will never understand Amazon doesn't sell just regular Oreos.  They have what seems like every other form, size, and flavor of Oreo, but not the original, which is by far the best.	-1
Too much of a good thing?  I like the originals best.  This was way too sweet and the cooky part seems way too thick.	-1
Stale	-1
Was really looking forward to trying these. BIG disappointment. "Mint" has odd taste, besides very imitation. Cookie part is typical crunchy, tasty Oreo but that's ruined by the green slime between the cookies.	-1
Now, this is a subjective review. I did not enjoy these cookies at all. The mint flavor tasted artificial and pasty. The cookies break apart quickly if you try to separate them manually like you can do with other Oreo cookies. I've had a package that lasted so long uneaten by family members that I eventually threw it away. These are really not good at all.	-1
I love Oreo's and various flavors of them, and I loved everything I have eaten that had a mixture of mint and chocolate.  So I thought, "hmm, mint Oreos, awesome, how could I go wrong?"  Well, I didn't know that they overdid the mint, and it basically makes these taste like Oreo's with toothpaste filling.  Yes, the filling tastes like toothpaste, a problem I have had with no other mint-flavored foods.  I ate some and was horrified, and assumed I just had a bad taste in my mouth or ate them with the wrong thing.  A couple days later I ate some more, and the same problem.  Tried a third time on another day just in case, and just gave up and threw away two-thirds of the package.  I didn't get a bad package, or a bad batch.  I told family members at a recent birthday about this, and they said "oh yeah, didn't you know?  Mint Oreo's are disgusting."	-1
I have tried using this product multiple times now and every time the product somehow starts to sting my eyes even up to one hour after putting it on.  I don't put it near my eyes anymore than I have ever done with my other moisturizer (Clinique is what I'm used to) and I don't have a problem with stinging.  It didn't work for me..........	-1
I love Cetaphil lotion (in the tub) and the liquid cleanser; however, I'm not loving the oil. It has a strong scent that I just can't get past. Also, I saw "organic" and assumed it was a fully organic product for babies. Nonetheless, it seems only the calendula extract is organic. We live in Colorado where it is really dry; and after using this daily for about a week, I do not feel it is making a huge difference.	-1
Too expensive	-1
My daughter hates these. They have very little taste and don't dissolve well. They are.so powdery it makes her cough every time she tries one.	-1
My baby hates these.  They also don't dissolve as quickly as other puffs.	-1
The liner smudges terribly. Nothing perfect about this item. I had to return it.	-1
I've never purchased an eyeliner, attempted to use it, and immediately thrown it away until now. First, it wouldn't come out (I know there is always extra space left and you have to turn or click more times than normally for the first use, but it just wasn't working). Then, tiny plastic tip, being super delicate//fragile, turned slightly sideways. I straightened it, finally got the product to come out, tried applying it and it literally broke off onto my eyelid. Like almost crumbled. I don't know if I got an old batch or what but there are a few fundamental flaws with this product. Despite the value, it's not worth it. There are tons of eyeliners w/comparable prices that actually work.	-1
I like the blackish brown color and the shape of the brush, but this formula burned my eyes fresh out of the container.  My eyes then tear and the mascara rubs off.  Note: Prime Pantry purchase.  Not sure why the AVP isn't showing.	-1
This mascara kept flaking off & getting in my eyes. Very disappointing.	-1
I really disliked this mascara. no matter how much I put on, my lashes did not get longer. Not sure why it was so bad, but it was	-1
The liner smudges terribly. Nothing perfect about this item. I had to return it.	-1
Awful ..makes lashes look thinner... lashes stick together not thickener at all plastic applicator... Worst ever bought	-1
Not impressed	-1
I purchased this lipstick on a whim while filling my pantry box. I was thinking it was a nice enough color to pair with my light skin. While the color itself is awesome you really can't see it through all the shimmer! It was like I coated my lips in very finely ground glitter. Thankfully it was a bit salvageable with some translucent powder dusted over it. Otherwise it would have been one star.	-1
Doesn't cover very well and doesn't smell very good.  I'm very sensitive to odors though so it probably wouldn't bother most people.	-1
I've used cover girl mascara before with no issue but this particular mascara made my eyes itchy and red. other than sore eyes, the product was great for bargain dime store makeup- gave me full, thick lashes with no flaking. It's a shame it didn't work for me.	-1
Brush is too thick for my liking	-1
I gave it a one because it is easy to apply (i.e. glides on smooth) - but other than that, it is awful!  It is smudged and I had "raccoon eyes" within 1 hour of application - I wish I could get a refund! uuggghhhh	-1
Awful worst mascara ever does not add  volume makes lashes stick together and look thinner... awful so disappointed,  plastic applicator  have to wait and layer and layer and UGH......	-1
Not impressed. I was trying to find a nice alternative to higher end mascaras, this will not be the one to help me make the switch. It does not provide great volume, no feathery full look if that's what you're going for. It's easy to apply, but I found as I tried to build coverage to experience the "volume" it only clumped. Get it wet? Short stubby clumps of sadness.	-1
The brush it absolutely huge!!! Unless you have 3in fake eyelashes, it is very hard to get the mascara on. Very bad design flaw!!!!	-1
Very clumpy, makes my lashes stick together, messy to have to try and brush it out. I tried cleaning the brush and starting with nothing on it, same result, so it wasn't a case of too much on the brush. I didn't care for this mascara at all.	-1
I will say that this product produces a very natural look, but I like a mascara that increases the look of length and volume.  I bought it because of the claim not to clump, and it does clump very little.  It just doesn't give the look I prefer.	-1
Very wet mascara.  Even after wiping brush with tissue before application, the mascara deposited way too much product that quickly transfered to skin.  The stiff rubbery brush doesn't grip each individual lash, so it actually clumps more - without lengthening - leaving me with shorty spikey lashes.  Tossed this one and went back to my standby.	-1
Terrible small brush, product barely comes off, don't like this at all...it's nothing like the wonderful "scandaleyes by rimmel that i normally use...will be going back to that!	-1
I only bought this because it was so cheap through Prime Pantry with the manufacturer coupon that you "clip" and add to cart. I usually do not use drug store brand cosmetics, but figured i'd give it a try for a buck.  The brush hurts your eyes. It pricks them. It's like applying mascara with a tiny cactus. I do not know why the bristles are so hard and pointy. Usually these types of brushes are softer silicone. If you do not mind stabbing your eyelids over and over needles while applying mascara, then give this one a try, but for me it went in the trash. Weird!!	-1
Be aware, this mascara application brush is not like your normal mascara.  Also, not as waterproof as my regular mascara.	-1
Cons: Short stubby brushes.  Mascara covers the end of the wand.  You have to scrape it off. Pro: nice color	-1
This is not black... It is brown and the bristles on the brush are tiny! Very difficult to us and very light in color. Disappointed	-1
The mascara seems okay, not great.  The brush is terrible.  It's plastic with widely spaced bristles so it goes on kind of gloppy.  I used another brush from an old mascara and it worked fine but as soon as I could get a replacement, I just pitched the whole thing.	-1
I had used the LashBlast before and do not remember the brush being so terribly big. It was always bigger than a standard mascara brush but I think it may have gotten even larger. It makes it a pain to put on. You can not get close to the root of your lashes and trying to turn it sometimes ends up with that dreaded eyelid bump that can be a total bummer if it messes up your other makeup. I don't want this to be a waste so I do use it for a first/light coat and then quickly break out another mascara to fully do the job and get close to my lash line. Also, this is brown....my mistake, I usually wear black and ordered this without reading the full title. So if you're impulsive like me and were looking for black, it's not this one.	-1
I hate the applicator that comes with this mascara.  I'll admit, I'm a bit of a mascara snob.  My go to mascara's are Lancme Definicils and Younique 3D but, I recently tried a very cheap Elf mascara because the price was great and I was completely impressed so I thought maybe drugstore mascaras had improved.  After all, I've been using Lancme for over 10 years and makeup has come a long way.  So, I got this, also at a great price, with high hopes.  Turns out it was a complete waste of money...I'm just glad it wasn't much.  The applicator is really big, almost oversized but has short, sparse, hard little bristles that offer no chance for creating volume.  The wand picks up way more mascara than the brush and is hard to use without making a mess.  The mascara goes on clumpy and actually, unbelievably,  makes my lashes look thinner.  It doesn't harden well.  The color is awful.  It's supposed to be black/brown which, in my experience is usually pretty dark.  This is brown, not dark at all.  The one positive thing I can say about this is that it is indeed waterproof...took forever to remove.  I totally understand now why Amazon was offering a $3.00 coupon and $5.93 mascara.  Unfortunately, it's not worth the difference.  If you want a decent cheap volumizing mascara, try the e.l.f. Volume Plumping mascara.  It has its faults but at less than $3.00, it's far superior than this and it does make my lashes look thicker and fuller.	-1
These beef sticks were fairly flavorless and within two weeks had mold growing on them.	-1
Extremely salty - not to my taste	-1
Fatty and quick to spoil.	-1
Crumbled dry mess	-1
Did not like it.  No rye flavor, weird texture.	-1
Ok I am not naive but perhaps I miscalculated thinking because I love rye bread so much that I was sure to like this bread. It is as advertised and I am sure it is healthy but gee whiz. Why does everything healthy have to taste so bad? Problem for me is I got quite a bit of it and I am going to have to get creative as to how to use it. I am sure there are folks out there that like it but I am definitely not one of them. Definitely will not be making any more sandwiches with it. Well several more attempts to eat this "bread". If you have never had this before and like bakery rye you may want to pass. Each loaf, and you get 6, is about the same size, texture and weight of an adobe brick. I tried to like it and I can't. Tried to eat it and I can't. Throwing it away. For me personally the worst rye bread I have ever had.	-1
The concept of bread with a long shelf life is intriguing. This is okay to have on hand in your pantry if you suddenly run out of bread, but to be honest, I don't enjoy the flavor at all. It doesn't taste like typical rye bread--or any bread I've ever eaten, for that matter. The texture is odd. I'm eating it up slowly by toasting it and adding avocado and garlic powder. I'm not sure what else would taste good on it. UPDATE: By toasting the bread several times, adding cream cheese, and washing it down with some delicious fruit juice, I was able to eat the loaf I had left. I'll never buy it again, though.	-1
Upset my stomache.	-1
Uh.. I usually like nongshim products. However, this ramen was just okay... In my opinion, it does sort of taste like kimchi but not really. It smells really strongly of kimchi though, not in a good way. It is very fermented smelling. The color is very red. It is spicy. I think though that this really needs some other flavors to it, in order to make it more dimensional. If you plan on buying this I would add some meat to it. Perhaps some pan-fried spam or even cooked pork. Also, I would buy this from a local Asian grocery store if you have one. The price per unit is kind of high on Amazon	-1
Didn't like this at all, but could be that I don't like the flavors of kimchee. I poured off the seasoned liquid and the noodles were much better.	-1
To much for what you get and it did not have a good taste	-1
I usually get white Jasmine rice and thought, hey Brown Jasmine Rice!  I'll try it.  Blah.  VERY Expensive for such a small amount, plus that wonderful tasting, fragrant Jasmine Rice I usually enjoy (the white) is just not there in this.  In the case of paying more for something because it says "Organic", this is it.  I would not purchase ever again :(  I'm sorry :(	-1
I usually like these breads, even I haven't had many. I didn't care for the flavor of this one, though. They're also basically useless if you don't toast them first and they don't like toasters. It wasn't worth the trouble of trying to make it edible so I threw them out.	-1
I did not like the taste of this bread. Tastes dry unless toasted and unless cream cheese or butter put on. I will never order this bread again. Tastes a little sour to me.	-1
While I applaud Barbara's Bakery for it's organic way I feel like these were a swing and a miss.	-1
If you want to get animal cookies that are more like cookie crumbs ... order these. it is not a joke when i say when i opened the bags of these not only were they broken but literally in crumbs ... EVERY SINGLE ONE... there was not even one single whole animal cookie to be found in the bag ,,, i ordered several bags so i thought... maybe it was just this one bag and somehow it just got smashed. OH NO ... i opened all the bags and they were all like this. The fun of getting animal shaped things for kids is so they can actually see the animals and say what they are which needless to say did not happen with these.	-1
This is really odd.  This is the second time I have purchased these because I thought they tasted soooooo good the first time!  However, this bag seem to be rather tasteless!  I can't taste any jalapeno flavor/spiciness for sure, and even odder, they taste like they have absolutely no flavor other than that deep-fried taste..  I don't know if the cheese puff bags can differ that much during the manufacture cycle, but I do not think I would repurchase these again.	-1
I bought these at Trader Joe's after hearing all the hype about these, I'm sorry to say I hate this cereal! I put 2 biscuits in a bowl and added a little amount of milk TO THE SIDE like I read, and instantly the biscuits soaked up the milk and instantly became soggy.....it was the texture of wet toilet paper..IN MY MOUTH! So disgusting. The taste was nonexistent, there was no pleasant taste to be found, not even a slight sugar taste like I hoped. The only way this cereal can be saved is adding a bunch of things to it, but then what is the point? The texture ruins it. Never again.	-1
Kids didn't go for these...  I thought they were okay.	-1
Arrived completely crushed :(	-1
Not as good as I thought it would be it has a strange taste. Leaves a little bitter after taste. I was disappointed in these but everyone has different taste  just didn't like it and won't buy it again.	-1
If you want to get animal cookies that are more like cookie crumbs ... order these. it is not a joke when i say when i opened the bags of these not only were they broken but literally in crumbs ...

Unfortunately, these just didn't taste very good.  My 2-year-old and 4-year-old wouldn't even eat them, which is definitely saying something!  I ended up throwing them away.  Bummer.	-1
Tastes awful. I would eat this if the world came to an end. I guess for dried out veggies...... it is okay at best. It is like those ramen noodles with dried stuff. Not for everyone.	-1
Probably a better option for those on a very bland diet - did not cook well.	-1
I was not crazy about these. Tasted like paper crackers.	-1
terrible save your money	-1
Another reviewer was right, it looks and smells like dog food. It might work well in some type of tomato sauce (That would cover up the smell ), but otherwise I can't think of anything else you could use it with. Key Stone does produce a very nice canned chicken though.	-1
greasy, greasy, greasy-I scraped, I drained, I blotted-still greasy- plus it didn't taste good and was too salty	-1
I resembles dog food. Doesn't look safe for human consumption. Smelled odd too.	-1
What a disappointment!  I was so looking forward to liking this.  But it's fishy tasting and has a shocking 790 mg of sodium per 2/3 cup serving. Made one serving and threw the rest in the trash. Not for me.	-1
No flavor	-1
least of my favorite perrier.	-1
I was happy, until they raised the price. No longer worth it.	-1
NO EXPIRATION DATE on product. NO DATE AT ALL. I don't know when they made this product or when it is good by. Also it is all STRAWBERRY DUST. And the container was so sticky and nasty when I received it. Please don't sell food without expiration dates on them ....  Also the strawberries were VERY stale and chewy - which is why I checked the expiration date which I never found .... They are supposed to be CRISP!	-1
too sweet	-1
This is horrible!  I had been really looking forward to drinking it from reviews I'd read here and elsewhere.  But I guess I'll be pouring all of it down the sink as it has nothing other than a terrible chemical taste to me.  I would give it a negative ten stars if possible.  Did I get a bad batch, or what?  All I can say about it is I need to wash out my mouth and get something else to get the horrid taste from this off my tongue and out of my mouth.  Yuck!	-1
14 one-cup servings for five bucks?  I don't care how 'good' it is, it's way overpriced.  Will not buy again.	-1
cans exploded inside plastic in box	-1
Didn't like it at all	-1
Great value but didn't like the taste - tasted artifical compared to other sparkling waters and left a strange coating on my teeth.  May just be me but want to be honest in my feedback.  I bought this one as the Perrier Sparking Water Lime wasn't in stock - i'll switch back to Perrier's instead as tastes more like real sparkling water.	-1
I was really anticipating this.....i love lime!!!  But this was so bitter I couldn't drink it....and none of my family liked it either.  Will not buy again!!!	-1
I understand this is soda water. However, there was absolutely no taste of lime/key lime in it. It was/is/tasted like straight soda water. Maybe that was why the price was so low. If you like straight soda water, this is for you. It is not worth complaining about/sending it back because of the low price....	-1
Odd aftertaste - won't buy again	-1
This has to be the worse sparkling water I have ever tasted. The first sip I almost gagged. The carbonation is the only thing I tasted absolutely no flavor at all. I would not recommend this to anyone. Not even sure if it was made as mixed drink if it would taste well.	-1
Too "sparkling" for my taste.	-1
Definitely not a flavor I like!!! Dragon fruit is bitter and theres too much of it!!!	-1
The flavor is very bland and it's a full calorie drink.  Arizona Tea Arnold Palmer is much better. Even the Arnold Palmer Light reduced calorie version tastes better.  Of course, that's just my personal taste preference.  Someone else might think this is fantastic.	-1
I like sparking water but I don't taste any flavor in these. It's like drinking straight seltzer water which I don't like.	-1
I didn't really like it too much	-1
Awful!!!!  Very strong mineral fizzy taste but very little fruit flavor.  Was hoping it would be like IZZE sparkling drinks which are terrific.  I bought several flavors of this brand so hopefully the others are better.	-1
TANGERINE;  very bland; will not purchase again.	-1
absolutely horrible taste . I couldn't give this flavor away.	-1
I do not like it at all	-1
I like the keylime better. This one is hit or miss. You're gonna love it or hate it. I hated this one. The flavors were weird together. Bleh.	-1
This is definitely not Lacroix,the taste wasn't that great. I got a pineapple taste more than anything. The price was good ($2.00) so cant complain about that	-1
Great price, but neither of us like the flavor. Just personal taste I guess.	-1
I do not care too much for this stuff....	-1
I was hoping this would be a good soft drink alternative, but my boys, 8 & 11, took one sip & that was the end. They do like the Nestle flavored bottled waters,.	-1
Not a fan. I cannot taste but a small hint of strawberry. I taste mostly seltzer water.	-1
Title says it all	-1
Terrible is not a strong enough word.  Bug Spray. Lotion. Think of something bitter and nasty tasting...then you're close.  This is BAD.  Perhaps I just got a bad batch, but I tried 2 cans of this (in case one was just a fluke).  Wow. Worst ever taste from any carbonated drink, bar none.  Bear in mind, I am a heavy user of sparkling water.  From Perrier to La Croix to store brand lime selzer, I have tried it all.  Further, I have enjoyed or at least tolerated most of it.  This...this "Tangerine" Pure Life Exotics...just spray some Off or Cutter bug spray on your tongue instead.  Seriously, AVOID THIS.  I also got the Exotics Lime, Mango, and Strawberry Dragon Fruit. All were at least acceptable.  Lime is actually great, one of my favorite Lime selzers in any brand.  Mango is decent.  Strawberry Dragon Fruit is strange, but grew on my so that I actually have a pang for it now.  Avoid Tangerine Pure Life Exotics.  Or, if you doubt me, buy it, drink one can, then write an apology for not believing me.  It's bad people.  You've been warned.	-1
Terrible.  Tasteless.  I knew it wasn't expecting or wanting a sugar filled drink, but this has no taste at all.	-1
It is bubbly like seltzer water.  If you don't like seltzer, you won't like it.	-1
Very unpleasant taste! It certainly doesn't taste like strawberries or any other fruit. There's not a hint of sweetness to it, natural, sugar, non-calorie or otherwise!	-1
The taste of this is awful.  Myself, my Daughter and 2 Grandchildren tried it and none of us could drink it.  I can't even describe the taste.	-1
not like regular flavored water we threw half the case out	-1
Taste is awful, was unbearable to drink.	-1
Well, I won't go as far as "hate" on this one.  I'll be generous and give it two stars.  First off, you have to know this is NOT a soda. It is sparkling flavored water.  I was looking for just that. I love dragonfruit flavor, and thought this would be a nice thing to try.  They don't carry it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  We've tried it both right out of the can and well-chilled, and neither one passes the muster. If you are old enough to remember Strawberry Nehi sodas, then you will be able to understand what I mean when I say that this stuff tastes like a glass of carbonated water with a few drips of Strawberry Nehi mixed in. There is zero dragonfruit taste, so I'd guess they tacked that on there to sound exotic and interesting. It is FAR from interesting. There's a little bit of the strawberry soda aftertaste, but that's all.  I would definitely NOT buy it again.  I'll stick with other brands of sparkling water that have actual taste to them. This was just not good, and would not recommend it either. Two thumbs down (or should I say eight thumbs down - no one in the house liked it) for this drink.  Fail.	-1
Is this supposed to taste like something? True question? It's basically carbonated water. If it's flat, it tastes even worse. I would prefer the nestle flavored waters instead of this. If you have any of the propel packets, i would suggest you add some to this water if you're ever wanting to drink it. I don't think I would be purchasing this specific sparkling water from prime pantry anymore.	-1
Where can you go wrong ? Well if you buy these you will find out. There is a metal taste and after taste that stays with you for along time. But did come fast.	-1
yuck	-1
Not a fan	-1
Tastes pretty nasty to me.	-1
I thought I would love this but the mango just wasn't my thing.	-1
THIS HAS A BITTER AND METALLIC TASTE= YUCK! USED TO BUY CASES OF THIS IN PLASTIC BOTTLES IN MANY FLAVORS EVERY SUMMER.  I WANTED A CONTAINER THAT WAS HARDER TO BUST OPEN SO THE CAN DOES THAT AND OF COURSE IT CAN BE FROZEN AND TRANSPORTED ANYWHERE WHERE METAL CONTAINERS ARE ACCEPTED.  I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A BETTER TASTE FROM ONE FRUIT INSTEAD OF THIS SO-CALLED BLEND.	-1
Oh no this is not my cup of tea. Why did I buy this, oh I forgot it was part of the buy 4 deal in order to get free shipping. The packaging is what fooled me, the vibrant colors, the showcasing of delicious mango, peach, and pineapples flying in the air. If you are expecting Sparkling ICE type of sparkling water you will not enjoy this, this is more on the road of pure carbonated water. Some reviews state they taste peach and mango, I don't know about them but I tasted something that was a mystery. I can drink Sparkling ICE but I cannot drink this. I only recommend this to those who love carbonated water, if you do not like carbonated water then this is definitely not for you.	-1
Since we've eliminated the diet soda, I thought we'd try something new - something carbonated - something tropical.  Um, the taste is club soda-like with a dash of citrus.  Not good in my opinion.  I'm wondering if the flavor can be enhanced with some fruit juices so I don't end up dumping the remaining cans.  I'm not a drinker, but maybe this would work well with gin or vodka?  "Exotic"? ((shaking head no))  Nah, not on my future "buy me" list!	-1
This cream felt great going on, light and smooth. By the 2nd day the application site began to itch a bit, but I thought it was just seasonal environmental allergies. By the 4th day I had swelling under my eyes, redness and extreme itchiness. Obviously I quit using it. Now I'm applying cool compresses and have an appointment with a dermatologist in 4 days. Hopefully the effects aren't that long lasting.  It may be "all natural" but that doesn't mean it it without problems.	-1
nothing special	-1
I really wanted to like these chips, but they tasted weird to me.  Won't buy them again.	-1
I did not like this at all. Perhaps I should have read into it more. Very strong fake sweetener flavor. Will not buy again. Not what I expected. but like I said maybe I should have read the ingredients first. I would not call this all natural. This is probably the first 1 star review I have ever posted.	-1
Why add chemicals to perfectly good water??	-1
Was looking for water with lemon, but Nestle Splash doesn't taste like real lemon.  Plus it has other stuff that I do not want (see below).  Liked the price and that it has zero calories, but not crazy about the taste (and aftertaste). I don't drink soda, which is probably why this tastes funny to me. But if you like soda, you might like it.  INGREDIENTS: Purified water, natural flavors, citric acid, Sodium Polyphosphate, Potassium Sorbate, Potassium Benzoate Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Calcium Disodium EDTA, Magnesium Sulfate.	-1
Way too sweet for a water product. This is supposed to be tangy lemon water with no "sugars" or artificial flavors. The surculose is a chemical substitute for real sugar and definitely has a flavor. Who are they kidding?  Apparently me because I made the mistake of assuming it was in the product to cut the bitterness of lemon.  Nope - this is made for sugar addicts that cannot have real sugar for some reason. How bad is it? If you pour 4 oz into a 12 oz cup/glass and add 8 oz of plain (bottled) water it is OK (but one STILL gets that nasty surculose aftertaste). If ANYBODY wanted to do that, WITH would they buy bottled water??? Nestle needs to change the formula.	-1
I typically like flavored waters and don't even mind when they include artificial sweeteners.  But I didn't care for this one.  I felt like the taste of the artificial sweetener overpowered the lemon flavor.  I won't purchase this flavor again.	-1
Not great. Too much lemon.	-1
I thought i was buying flavored water, but this is not water!!! It has sucralose in it! I don't consider sucralose to be a natural flavoring.	-1
Contains sucralose and acesulfame potassium.	-1
Bleh - tasteless...	-1
If you love drinking your water with a wedge of lemon, don't imagine for a moment this beverage will be anything like that. I bought this lemon water and also the grape variety, and they're both awful. I'm not particularly put off by the idea of artificial flavors or sweeteners, since I already drink a wide variety of calorie-free brands; but the people at Nestle need to go back to the lab to figure out why they can't seem to get their chemicals to result in a decent-tasting beverage. Terrible!	-1
this is a soft drink, not "water". loaded with sweetener (sucralose). check the label for multiple preservatives too.	-1
Ingredients don't list sugar but nondescript "natural flavor".  Tastes like pure artificial sweetener, almost no lemon.  Completely ruined my day off.	-1
I knew this was a sweetened product, but still I was not expecting it to be so sweet that it's near impossible to drink it straight out of the bottle.  If that weren't bad enough, the artificial and chemical tasting lemon flavoring is reminiscent of the scent of bathroom cleansers. Taste is subjective, so of course, your experience might be completely different from mine. In the future, if I would like something that has a splash of lemon with a natural and refreshing taste, I will use a bit of True Lemon powder and mix it myself.	-1
This does not taste like lemon to me.  It's too sweet and the artificial flavor is too strong.  I added some plain water to it, and it was not too bad.  However, who wants to have to play mix master with bottled water.  I won't buy this again.  If you are thinking this will taste like water when you add a slice of lemon to your glass, it doesn't.	-1
Yuck. Wayyy too sweet. I was expecting water with a hint of lemon- not sugar with a hint of lemon and water.	-1
Tastes like weak kook aid  - I always check the ingredients but must have been tired when I added this to the cart. It has preservatives I'm not sure of.	-1
Way too sweet!  Overwhelming artificial taste.  I expected a light refreshing drink with a touch of lemon.  UGH.  Disgusting.	-1
I really don't like the taste of this water	-1
I don't care for this drink.  Sorry, just not to my taste.	-1
Weird taste, too sweet, just nasty. Not for me. I took a few sips, kept trying, then tossed the partially drunk bottle. Ugh.	-1
I appreciate the healthiness but it has a horrible aftertaste.	-1
Did not care for the taste	-1
not the best flavor if you ask me	-1
I get that people want this water to be healthy, and therefore the sweetener isn't sugar.  However, artificial sweetener is not good for you, and frankly drinking this made me feel dehydrated.  I would have rather had some (not a lot) of sugar in it instead.  It doesn't need to be even remotely as sweet as soda, which is what they were going for, really all I wanted was water with a hint of coconut.  If you like artificial sweetener then you might love this, except for the steep price.  If you like real food, pass on it.	-1
This crushes all of the food in your pantry	-1
I wish I had know that this was basically flavored water, it is ghastly...  I don't like sativa and that is one of the ingredients and it tastes like chemicals.  Sorry I purchased this water.  TOO sweet imo, and doesn't really taste like coconut water, more like artificially sweetened down water with a hint of coconut, left a horrible aftertaste too.  I love coconut water but not this stuff.	-1
Dont like the stevia flavor	-1
No taste...	-1
Not so tasty! Nobody will drink it, finally had to throw away the bottles that were left in the fridge so they would stop taking up space.	-1
Ok	-1
Not much on flavor.  It may be good for ya...	-1
tastes like sugar with artificial waterer.  flavor was supposed to be blueberry.  I've tasted blueberries; this was not blueberry flavored.  tasted like artificial sweetener, not as much as in other fake drinks but enough to leave a long aftertaste of it.  has less juice than cheaper sugar water juice drinks.  inexplicably has caffeine	-1
It tastes like cough syrup.  I drank about two ounces of it before pouring it out.  I was so disappointed.	-1
I purchased this drink because it only has 5 calories per bottle and it appeared to be much better than sugar containing drinks. However, its flavor is medicine like and not very pleasant. I think it would taste better if they used a natural sweetener like stevia.	-1
Not anywhere near as good as the orange.	-1
Bought 48 k-cups.  Expiration date is 4 months from now.  That is a semi-fresh item:  it was part of a 100-k-cup order.  So, it will never be consumed before it goes it to the compost bin.	-1
does not taste anything like it says	-1
Disappointed in the flavor. Could not decide though whether it's the coffee itself or my personal preference.	-1
This is bitter and weak even when I added alot of coffee.  This does not taste good at all!	-1
not enough flavor	-1
Not thrilled with the selection	-1
Update:. I'm changing my rating to one star and cancelling my "subscribe and save". I received another order with excessive grounds in every cup and it is obvious that quality control is going to be the undoing of this company. My original review was extremely positive but two orders in a row with the same problem and no response from the seller puts these k-cups in my "do not buy" file.  I have tried many K-cups and these are by far my favorite!  They are labeled as having different flavors, and they actually taste like they have flavor.  Previous coffees I have tried may be labeled as having assorted flavors, but I can't even detect the hint of any flavor other than coffee.  I have repurchased a few times and will continue to do so.  I am sticking with one brand since the other cups I have purchased are also "assorted", but it appears that I receive more of the less expensive grocery store cups versus the others.	-1
Not a strong coffee. It is not as described. I am very disappointed. It is more light to medium. I bought 4 boxes and am stuck with this weak coffee.	-1
Very bitter to me and my co-workers.	-1
does not fit my Keurig K-Cup, had to throw the used ones out	-1
Very bland, no depth at all.	-1
We used to love what used to be a wide assortment of coffees. Now it is basically all dark roasts, with a few mediums thrown in. We don't like french roasts, so won't be getting this anymore. If you like dark  then you might like this.	-1
Really strong, reminds me of gun powder.  Not my favorite but it is okay.	-1
I didn't like it.  Gave it to my mom who loves it so don't go by my rating.	-1
Yuck. This tastes like bad Koolaid. Nasty flavor and nothing like blueberry. Red tea? I mean its very very red. How is that? Blueberry juice is clear. Not red certainly.  Nasty after taste too. This is more like a bad raspberry flavored tea. In fact, it is so far from blueberry I thought I got the wrong item and went back to check the box! Yogi is a lot better.	-1
I love fruit flavored black teas, but these fruit herbals are just not to my liking.  The Blueberry variety was no different.	-1
We really had a lot of fun trying these out. First of all, not sure if it is the cute catchy names or the cute catchy tops but either way the taste of all of them were all good at first.  So, I ordered the large box of Fuhgedaboudit (spelled diff on the box and in the descript in the selection amd then in the two diff areas in the body of the descript, hee hee) amd I was surprised how weak it tasted ad sort of flowery!!!!! ewww!!! I like mine really really strong, my husband likes them medium so we aren't digging this batch and won't be ordering again..so bummed! . If it is a medium blend, I just make it on a smaller setting but then it still doesn't tasted full bodied!  Boardwalk Blend is better but I have to drink it on the setting above the espresso. If you want a full bodies yummy bold cup of joe like you would get for $4.50 a cup at a popular coffee shop get Tully's French Roast....so delicious!	-1
I don't care for the taste - threw it away.	-1
Not a fresh lemon taste at all. Reminds me of lemon cleaner in scent, especially. I really like their orange tangerine zinger so I thought I would like this one - not so!	-1
The past six months I've been trying all the zinger teas available on Amazon (after learning about the high antioxidants found in Hibiscus tea). This is definitely my least favorite (FYI, the Tangerine Orange is my favorite).  I should mention that I've been using these teas as iced tea. This particular flavor is definitely more suited to be a hot tea. Even then, the apple flavor is very faint, and the cinnamon flavor seems stale to me. Not sure that's the right wording - the cinnamon flavor tastes a lot like the flavor in cinnamon gum, rather than the cinnamon flavor in a pastry or something. I hope that makes sense.	-1
I love herbal teas, apple and cinnamon, but hated this.  Sometimes when you don't like something, you grow to like it as you use it.  Not this tea.	-1
My variety pack contained three each of Hazelnut, Maple, French Roast, and Breakfast Blend Decaf and three or four each of Breakfast Blend, French Roast, Boardwalk Blend, Brooklyn Bridge Blend, Colombian, Corner Donut Shop, Cyclone, Fuggedaboudit, and Skyline.  I ordered it as Subscribe and Save which was a big mistake because it took almost a month to arrive.  I should have just paid a buck more and gotten it with Prime delivery.  I like stout coffee (Barista Italian) and my brother likes medium-strength coffee (Breakfast in Bed).  I actually made four different cups at once and compared them to new flavors from Timothy's and Green Mountain.  These coffees were the worst of the lot.  They are largely too mild, even for my brother.  Even when brewing, some of them (Breakfast Blend) look more like tea.  They also tend to lack good coffee flavor and aroma.  While I appreciate the reasonable price, I can't make sacrifices for flavor.  I'll take these to work and put them out for people who are too cheap to buy their own k-cups (students) and will drink anything.	-1
No I don't hate these (no one does) BUT I do hate the PRICE! The regular size rice krispie treats sold here on Amazon are a fraction of the price ($3.67 for 12.2 oz, which if you do the math would equate to about $5.50  for the same 19 oz) Okay so maybe you have wee little ones who wouldn't eat the whole square (cos near as I can tell these must be about 1/4 the size) but I can't really imagine any kid not being able to eat a one ounce rice krispie treat anyway & you could buy like 3 boxes of the 'big' (regular) size rice krispie treats - 36 full size treats instead of 50 mini 1/4 size squares. Now why do I care? I mean I do understand you pay more for the smaller portions for convenience packaging - but Amazon keeps baiting us with the other item being "not available" for us so clearly it's this way overpriced (super) mini-treat or nothing. Especially when they offer coupons on items thy're already out of, which would make them even cheaper - make the difference in value even greater - it's super insulting. I don't think they should offer coupons on items they don't have in stock - or they should honor the coupon when they gt the item in stock, like a raincheck.  I'm sure these taste great & if money's of no concern then go for it but everyone else - live & learn. & that's unfortunate too, because a lot of lower wage earners couldn't figure out the cost differential on this bait & switch ponzy since the cost is per each & the weights are so dissimilar.	-1
Not too bad tasting.  I was curious to try it and was pleasantly surprised.	-1
not the best flavour of sirracha,  tasted more like  ketchup with some  tobbasco in it.	-1
STALE	-1
item bought. two packs one arrived broken open. tried to report no place to go.	-1
Tastes great but the bag was already opened due to poor packaging, so we had to eat it first.	-1
The actual product is probably fine, but I received it without a cap, so I can't use it until I figure out some container to put it in once it's opened.	-1
to expensive ;i found at local pharmacy!	-1
It works as sports tape just fine.	-1
Causes more problems than solutions!  Stay away!	-1
My daughter gets horrendous cramps when her period begins. She tried a few of these capsules and muttered under her breath, "placebo" She is only 13.	-1
For the price, it is better to buy a larger pack at Walmart, Target, etc.	-1
No longer ordering since onlly 3 are allowed at a time.	-1
did not like it very much	-1
Contains artificial sweeteners which I didn't realize, my fault for not reading. I will not reorder. Not a healthier alternative. Still artificial. Will stick with real water and fresh lemon.	-1
it says it is made with natural ingredients BUT the drink tastes like they put a ton of Artificial sweetener which is NOT natural. ended up giving away to someone w diabetes.	-1
This was a great price so we added it to our Pantry Box. I like them ok, but the Grape flavor is a "fake" grape. My husband and son will open one thinking they want it, and then I find them all over with only a little bit gone and they never go back to it. Not a hit in our house.	-1
I can drink it, but would rather not. I got it because of a pantry deal where I had to get 5 items from a "select" group and I had a hard time coming up with the last one so I opted for this because the price was low and I thought it couldn't be too bad......	-1
this is a soft drink, not "water". loaded with sweetener (sucralose). check the label for multiple preservatives too.	-1
Don't waste your money!	-1
tastes like a watered down melted artificially sweetened grape popsicle	-1
Always bring bottle water with me on the go. Decided to try this. It has an artificial sweetener taste that I don't like, I'll stick to regular water.	-1
has artificial sweeteners	-1
flavor was flat	-1
It has a rather strange taste. Not really sure what to describe it as, but I felt thirstier after drinking it. It contains no juice, has calories and some ingredients that I'm not sure what they are. The bottles are flimsy and collapse in on themselves while you are drinking which is annoying. The lid is small and there is a choking hazard listed, so be careful if you give this to your kids. Some of the other Pure Life Splash flavors are good, but the Wild Berry isn't one of them.	-1
My cats were not so thrilled with this food.	-1
Bland and rubbery vegetables. How can canned soup be this bad just to get a reduced sodium product. DO NOT buy this!!	-1
bland, bland, bland	-1
Years ago this was a great soup...  I think the change happened with the "Healthy Request" labeling.  Yes we should be healthy but Campbell's should have given the consumer a version with some flavor as they used to have AND a "Healthy Request" version.  Campbell's had missed the mark on this one.	-1
you can taste the powder quite a lot. You can feel it in your drink while tasting it. No I can not recommend it.	-1
Nope.  Not that great.	-1
I did not like the taste of these.  Some people might but I guess I am just to used to Chef Boy RD.  These have a completely different taste but its not bad, just not my taste.	-1
This is extremely overpriced	-1
We keep protein bars handy as a "go to breakfast" when time is short, so I thought the kids would love the chocolate version.  I was surprised when they didn't.  Perhaps it's the dark chocolate, but they found them bitter and didn't care for them at all.  Oh well, back to strawberry yogurt bars and peanut butter bars instead.	-1
They seem to be packed with energy but taste kinda bland.	-1
Rather dry and grainy. It would have been better if it was a little more moist. It was like eating cardboard with chocolate on it. I personally won't purchase this type of bar again.	-1
Cloyingly sweet and not at all chewy. We are still on the search for the perfect on the go breakfast bar	-1
Not good tasting at all	-1
the outside shell gets soft pretty quickly. Tastes like mush surrounding nuttella, doesn't turn the milk chocolaty.	-1
Adult cat hated it!!!	-1
My little Chihuahua really has to be in the mood to eat these. She used to love them, but now she'll either take a few bites or snub her nose and walk away. I don't think I'll be purchasing these again.	-1

Again, my dog won't eat it.  She also won't eat canned (human) chicken if not fresh...she just goes without	-1
The somewhat trendy words "Ancient Grains" are right in the name of the cereal, but they might as well not be there at all.  I'm pretty sure that, by law, ingredients must be listed in order according to their proportion (by weight) of the product: the Ancient Grains are listed starting after "Sunflower Oil".  In other words, considering that this cereal isn't oily, there are hardly any Ancient Grains in here.  I should have looked at the photos more carefully, where it says there is a "touch" of them.  Touch is right, and touch isn't what I expected from the product name.	-1
Absolutely disgusting	-1
It could use more almonds, cinnamon, and possibly some raisins.	-1
package came very smashed and one side was completely tore open and the other side has a third of way tear open	-1
Tacos are supposed to be spicy but this was way overdone, especially with the salt. The shells--great idea but thick and rubbery. Plus the leftover shells lasted FOREVER in my cupboard. Which is good if you want to eat a Taco boat next month but Bad if you worry about whats in your food--cuz those babies are in it for the LONG haul!	-1
The shells, although soft, have an off-flavor that I just can't come to grips with. In all fairness, I have used them more than once from multiple orders just to confirm that it wasn't just shell from a bad batch. I will just use regular flour tortillas in the future.	-1
Very bland dry in some places hard. (stale?) I usually heat my tortillas in a pan before loading. These were gummy and tasteless. I can't think of a way to heat these before filling so I'll probably never buy again. Good concept easy to fill. Just not very tasty to me.	-1
not my taste	-1
lots of preservatives  yucky	-1
Really, really great product. Wonderful product for anyone in need of a good gluten free cereal. You will have no idea that it's gluten free. Taste, texture, and digestion are all excellent.	-1
Not nearly as tasty as Kellogg's apple cinnamon "O's".  There is only a hint of purported to be cinnamon taste and no taste of apple at all.  Plus, in the bottom of the bowl, there remained a brownish residue presumably from the purported to be cinnamon but tasting nothing like cinnamon.  My younger set didn't even finish a bowl of this cereal so it was a complete waste of money.	-1
I agree that Food Should Taste Good, but these were not very good at all.  They have an unpleasant look to them, and are slightly sweet which is not at all what I expected in a brown rice cracker.  Threw out after trying them a couple of times.  Won't order again or recommend.	-1
crackers too large and break/crumble too easily. Not very tasty either.	-1
Tasted awful to me.	-1
Cleans well but leaves lots of spots on glasses and leaves a white residue in the dishwasher.  I don't recommend this product if you have concerns about spots on glassware.	-1
I purchased these not realizing they weren't my usual finish tablets. I find it very difficult to open the wrapping, and they don't get my dishes as clean. I'm about ready to toss them out and will be much more careful in the future, when buying online.	-1
There is some weird taste to prime pantry. It taste almost expired. Sad and waste of money. I tried one/ two of these Kix and was disappointed. The ones I get from Safeway taste way better. I should of just gone to the groceries instead of being lazy.	-1
Every single tablet I've opened is broken. It doesn't make any difference for purposes of washing dishes, but it's messy on my counter and when I put it in the dishwasher. Works great for the dishes but is too messy pre-use. I will go back to plastic tablets.	-1
I love kimchi, but I was not a fan of these at all. The flavor wasn't very close to me.	-1
It is not good tasting.	-1
Good flavor, but not worth the price and Amazon pantry didn't pack them very well so half the bags were crumbs.	-1
I don't like these.  Lots of spots on our dishes.  All other brands we've used have worked better.	-1
definitely not a candidate for re-purchase.  comes individually wrapped and not that easy to remove the foil wrap after loading dishes	-1
This detergent left a white residue that coasted my dished, particularly plastics and metals. I will not be buying this again.	-1
Does not work and leaaved a film on my dishes	-1
I don't think these work at all	-1
I don't think that this product works as well as some of the other brands.	-1
I love the regular Kix but I did not like this Honey version. The honey flavor tastes very fake.	-1
It leaves spots every single time. How is that possible?	-1
not grippy enough to clean the baby	-1
Not as good as regular kettle chips. We are them. They were ok.	-1
wasn't what I thought	-1
Didn't care for the flavor.	-1
Too pricey for what you get.	-1
The entire bag was opened when it arrived, threw it out will by eat opened product	-1
No.  FSTG regular chips are yum in all flavors.  Kettle cooked are not. I blame the kettle.	-1
What they taste of is burnt. A definite bitter note, and very dark compared not only to the graphic on the package but sweet potato chips I've had in the past. They are also greasy and undersalted - I won't order them again.	-1
The worst chocolate syrup, I have ever tasted.	-1
very bitter	-1
didn't realize it said diet on it	-1
DID NOT LIKE THE TASTE.......	-1
Has a more of a chemical taste. Don't know why. Won't buy again. BUT, if you add a small amount to hot coffee, it tastes ok.	-1
Tastes sugar free and breaks up on ice cream.  I am used to sugar free products and I like the caramel version, but the chocolate isn't for me.	-1
I love chocolate syrup but this bottle tasted sour.  Cannot eat anymore of it.	-1
For all those on a diet that need a chocolate fix look elsewhere. It is Hershey, but it is bitter and has an after taste. Not good at all. A far cry fromth e real Hershey's chocolate. Would not buy this again.	-1
ugh	-1
This tastes like plastic and I don't even wanna be one of those reviewers that sound bougee it just does. I bought this not really knowing anything about caramel syrups and seeing the Hershey's name just made me think theirs should be the way to go but it truly just doesn't taste right whatsoever. I used this in a few of my homemade iced coffees and it barely even added any caramel flavor let alone the weird plastic off taste it gives that overshadows the barely existent caramel flavor I just mentioned. Do your research and get a syrup that actually tastes like what it's supposed to taste like. This is just one of those items you cant give the price too much influence in the majority of your buying decision for.	-1
I added this to a Prime Pantry order because I love Hershey's chocolate syrup, and caramel, and it was only a couple bucks. All I can say is the taste of this is bad...really bad.  I threw it out, and I'm not one to waste food.	-1
I like the fake raspberry taste but my daughter says it gives me bad breath.  Seems self defeating.	-1
...if you are looking for a gum that maintains it's flavor, then this is not for you... it diminishes very fast and becomes somewhat toxic-like or chemical-like, as the best that i am able to characterize the taste experience after about 3-5 minutes...  spit it out after that and tossed remainder out...  seems i recall icebreakers to be a lasting gum...  perhaps they have modified their formulae...  however, on a positive note, it does maintain it's size and chewability unfortunately, not pleased, Thank you.	-1
Sorry but I prefer Nestle Nesquik.	-1
not tasty at all	-1
Too expensive for what you get	-1
Tastes too sweet and the tiny blue grains get stuck in your teeth. It also has a grainy texture.	-1
I actually love this product but I don't understand why it's mostly gmo corn syrup. If they would just make it with cocoa and sugar I'd give it 5 stars, but until they do it will be 2.	-1
chemistry lab - poison	-1
Thought these were mints. They are not. Imagine someone squeezing your gum into a cube with there hands then handing it to you with no wrapper. That is what these are like.	-1
The quality has declined on this to be what the store brand quality was! It is no longer a thick syrup like it used to be, now it is watery, like they watered it down by half, gross. I only used it on ice cream and it is not fit for that as it is formulated now. I will not be buying again. I feel bad for all you 30 yrs old and younger don't know what these products used to taste like and be like. I can't even eat todays fruit it all has about 75% less flavor then years ago. It's so sad. Only good thing is those of us that DO remember how this stuff was will not be buying it anymore.	-1
These were stale and disgusting! We were so excited to try the rainbow flavors too. I love strawberry twizzlers, but these were just gross. I tried a bite of each flavor, and all were equally disgusting. I don't know if its a flavor issue or if they were just stale, but I will never buy these again. EVER!	-1
We live in the California Desert!  Someday I will learn NOT to order anything that can soften or melt!  These were definitely GUMMY!	-1
I like regular twizzlers, but the flavors here have unpleasant chemical tastes. Don't buy.	-1
Don't waste your money, bland, tasteless.	-1
These were a bit disappointing for me. Too sugar sweet not really fruit flavored and tough to chew, I prefer more of a red vines or nibs consistency in licorice. I was surprised because I do like Twizzlers cherry and strawberry flavors and consistency.	-1
These taste like medicine, says my 14 year old grandson. I tasted one and it was just gross. Very surprised, given the brand.	-1
These in no way taste anything like the traditional Twizzlers licorice candy. They are soft and limp and have a very off taste. If you are a fan of the traditional taste and texture of Twizzlers candy these will disappoint. Flavor is bland and almost plastic like. The only fun thing about these are the bright colors. I purchased these through Prime Pantry to try (for the first time) and will stick to traditional licorice candy in the future.	-1
I really wanted to love these. I enjoy twizzlers and was excited for this fun summertime treat. However, when they arrived, they weren't as flavorful as I had hoped. They were bland and it was tough to pinpoint which flavor you were enjoying without looking at the bag for the options. These are also more sticky than normal twizzlers, making it hard to pull them apart from each other as well without ripping the whole bag apart. I wish these had the flavor quality of other twizzlers products, but its just not there.	-1
Wanted to try them out and they're just not that great in my honest opinion. They taste like the flavors they're supposed to be, but just not my type.	-1
I totally should have known better.  My recent purchase (prior to this one) of Twizzlers cherry flavor was a huge disappointment.  I prefer the strawberry but that wasn't an option.  Taste seemed off and the texture was definitely different than any Twizzlers I had ever eaten.  They went into the trash.  So, for some idiotic reason I thought these might be a good replacement.  I guess I was in a fruity frame of mind now that summer is here.  These do not have the familiar texture, they are too soft and gummy.  But the worst part comes later.  In the form of a bad stomach ache.  It's not unusual for me to get a stomach ache after eating heavily colored breakfast cereals and I should have realized this would produce the same unpleasant symptoms.  I wasn't thinking about that, I was just thinking about my previous love of Twizzlers and my desire to have a fruity snack on hand for the summer.  Like the previous purchase, these ended up in the trash too.  I am reluctant to buy any more Twizzlers now.	-1
Licorice is versatile: birthday parties, school lunches and holiday treats. I periodically keep a tub at the office to fend off co-workers who roam around in the afternoon, looking for a snack.  Licorice requires tender, loving care. Unlike hard candy, which can (and often does) sit for months in the bottom of your grandmother's purse, licorice tastes best soft and fresh. Storage should be airtight and at room temperature. That favors&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Twizzlers-Twists-Strawberry-105-Count/dp/B00X3GA1PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Twizzlers Twists (Strawberry, 105-Count)</a>, which come individually wrapped  perfect for packing into school lunches.

Of the two versions of Twizzlers, my sons (ages 13 and 12) prefer the individually wrapped strawberry twists. We had a birthday party with nine kids last weekend and you can see in the photos how many pieces from the rainbow assortment are still left. We sealed them up in a plastic bag, but I don't expect them to be eaten soon.

Red Vines are Star-K kosher-certified with no fat and only 140 calories per serving (five pieces/vines). My sons still favor Red Vines over Twizzlers because of the softer, more dough-like texture.  Rating: Two stars	-1
not worth the price	-1
Don't know who is saying these are great - they must have left their taste buds in another coat. These were like plastic with some cheap flavoring, i ate 3 sticks- and tossed the rest. Total waste of money in my opinion.	-1
I love Twizzlers and I love fruity flavors! Unfortunately, when combined into this product, it's pretty gross. These Twizzlers are bigger, thicker, chewier, and the flavors aren't good. I would definitely not buy them again.	-1
Did not like at all.  The feeling in your mouth felt like you were chewing on plastic.  They were also so stiff, that I got tired of chewing on them and spit them out.  Only strawberry and grape tasted halve way descent.  Will not buy again.	-1
I don't like the taste and within 5 minutes I had to spit it out.	-1
Like eating rubber.	-1
Way too much sugar alcohols etc. just grab a Greek yogurt or something else fast.	-1
This is kind of a pointless product.  Why not just use regular wipes for hands and face?  It takes up space in my diaper bag, and I don't reach for them even when I could use them.  Also, the package arrived ripped open, I had to tape it to seal it shut.	-1
meh, I guess I don't like this one.  It has a cumbersome plastic thing on top that has to be opened and then dig into the packet through that for a wipe.  Also, I do not believe these wipes are clean and surely would not use on baby hand OR face; first two wipes I pulled out had hair on them??	-1
It arrived fast, but was already stale.	-1
Smelled good, but had very little flavor. I wonder if I got an older package...	-1
My husband wanted some beef jerky in our prime pantry box. Sweet and hot is his favorite but he said this kind tasted horrible compared to the bags he gets from the grocery store.	-1
Not impressed.  I think the extra cooking to make them toasty kills both the cheese and salt flavors.  They were like eating cardboard.	-1
It's too dry and hard for me. Personally, I don't like this taste.	-1
Never buy crackers online. Go to the store- unless you love broken crackers. Learn from my mistake.	-1
The crackers taste  burned	-1
Stale.	-1
They came to us stale	-1
stael, losey  trowen them away.  Must be fifty years old	-1
I was not impressed they seem to to have a great taste.	-1
doesn't taste that good and my child and I usually buy stuff like this this and like the types of natural foods but not this one.	-1
My toddler did not like these unfortunately my teenager ended up eating them.	-1
I liked the product's claim to be healthy and the baby ate it, but it just looks and feels like play dough.	-1
Got these for my grandchildren as school snacks and when I opened the first package we all looked at these little worm-like shreds that have a strong smell and a somewhat artificial taste and tried to figure out what to do with the packages because we were not likely to eat the contents.	-1
For some reason my daughter does not like the berry flavor but does enjoy the peach.	-1
My 2.5 year old was not at all interested in this snack. He wouldn't eat them. I ended up eating them. lol. Maybe good for a much younger child.	-1
I ordered these without knowing that these were for toddlers i bought two boxes of this junk too i don't know what toddler would eat this dry crap this is the only time ever i didn't read the comments i wouldnt buy this for my child if i had one.	-1
Smashed!!	-1
Smashed product,Not happy......	-1
I can't eat this, please get Mueller's products.	-1
Gross.  I love pastas of all sorts but this is disgusting.	-1
These are gross.  Now I know why they were like $1 each.  LOL	-1
I bought for my grand daughter , she wouldn't touch it.. I tasted it..awful.. The dogs turned their heads.. bad stuff. In the trash, like always.	-1
It's an inexpensive shelf item...get what you pay for. Best to boil pasta and add a bar of basil tomato sauce.	-1
Blah	-1
Did not care for the taste.	-1
doesn't take like real food.	-1
Smelled gross, tasted even worse. My lunch break at work is only half hour so by the time I had heated it up n got back to my office to try it, I had run out of time to cook anything else and was forced to eat as much of it as I could to last me the rest of the work day. Ugh.	-1
These are gross.  Now I know why they were like $1 each.  LOL	-1
Horrible	-1
Don't particularly like the taste.	-1
These Barilla 1 minute meals have a very odd chemical or metal flavor or just something different.  I cant put my tongue on it (no pun) but there is a flavor of something very odd in all of these 1 minute meals.  I bought a bunch of them several weeks ago and noticed they all had that strange flavoring.  Maybe its just with all the italian type meals?  Could be as I bought  Spicy Marinara, some other marinara, pene` pasta, some pasta, sauce and sausage thing, some other pasta with meat sauce type meals and they were all disappointing.  I was so excited to get these at the store so I stocked up on a bunch of them.  It was a struggle to eat them and I can eat.  Not these though.  Ughhhh	-1
I would eat this in an emergency only.  The marinara tastes like ketchup with a heavy chemical aftertaste.  I love how the packaging looks so appetizing though.  The pasta itself seems to be cooked well but the sauce is just off.  The other flavors weren't much better.	-1
Tastes horrible (worse than canned pastas) and noodles are a horrible texture. Looks way more disgusting than imaginable.	-1
I really like Barilla  products but NOT this. What's with this sauce, I throw the sauce out, and season it myself	-1
Horrible. I don't know how this product made it out of the testing or focus group.	-1
Not a fan of this item. While I like Barilla, this did NOT impress me at all. It says there's MEAT SAUCE, to me, this means I should SEE MEAT.  There was NONE in the package. The taste was okay...Nothing to "Write Home About".	-1
not so great. However, Barilla Angel Hair pasta is my favorite by far of any brand.	-1
Smashed!!!!!!	-1
sour tasting.	-1
The flavor reminds me of something from my grade school cafeteria.  Easy to fix, yes.  Tasty?  Not particularly.	-1
doesn't taste like real food...	-1
Box bought through Prime had mold growing from the bottom. Barilla did not respond to email inquiry. Could be Prime storage problem or manufacturer. FYI	-1
SMASHED!!!!!	-1
doesn't taste like real food...	-1
tastes good but falls apart when cooked and becomes mush. I much prefer rice Pad Thai noodles when making spaghetti or noodle soups.	-1
This pasta is made from a crescent shaped piece of thin pasta that is rolled to form a pasta that looks sort of like a lily.  (Yes, I unrolled one to see how it is made.)  I like the unusual shaped pasta that Barilla makes, but this is not my favorite.  Since it is made from rather thin pasta, but is then rolled, it is hard to get it cooked to exactly the right degree of doneness.  You have to cook it long enough to get the rolled part cooked, but then the edges are often overcooked.  Since there are so many other pasta shapes to choose from, I won't buy this again.	-1
Difficult to eat as flavor is unusual and I'm vegetarian	-1
These are gross.  Now I know why they were like $1 each.  LOL	-1
BLEAH. Awful.  I'm not sure I'd ever be desperate enough to finish this.  The sausage/rotini flavor was much better than this one	-1
Not impressed.  Bland flavor and gummy	-1
doesn't taste like real food...	-1
Kind of an odd flavor. I wouldn't eat this again.	-1
the box was badly damaged,	-1
Most of them were broken. That would've been great if I wanted cheddar chip nachos.	-1
More than half of the box was broken	-1
I'm the type where the bolder the flavor, the better, so I would actually vote for a little more cheese flavor, but it wouldn't stop me from buying them. What will stop me from buying them is the fact that my box was stale even though it was still in date. They didn't have any crunch, just kind of bent and eventually snapped in half, spilling the contents. Not one to throw away semi-edible food, I broke the rest up into Dorito sized chips and ate them like nachos. I would buy again, but only from a local store.	-1
Expected a cinnamon flavor because I searched cinnamon tea and this came up.  It is a black type of tea, but not a good black tea.  Still looking for a good cinnamon tea after Keurig quit making the Good Earth Tea in a K cup.	-1
Disgusting!!! One sip and I almost gagged at how awful it tastes and got rid of the rest.  Wasn't even close to a Chai Latte. Who tests this stuff? I drink a lot of Chai Tea and this was not even close.	-1
I purchased these to try instead of my normal go to which is the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte. This is not the same. Cafe Escapes is sweeter and tastes more like hot chocolate type drink than a tea. The tea flavor in this is very strong- which is great if that's what you want. I don't like it, however.	-1
The K-pod is no good for tea as there is no steeping time.  Great service from Amazon.	-1
Tastes bad, this will sit on my counter for guests.	-1
Didnt care for the taste, but everyone is different	-1
Very bland for a chai.  Disappointed.	-1
Sad excuse for chai	-1
This was very gross.	-1
Weak flavor  would  not buy again	-1
its just ok, I like the regular chamomile tea instead, much for sleepy and has a better taste	-1
I love Earl Grey Tea, but this is on the weak side. I won't be buying this again. Maybe it's because tea really needs to steep for awhile in order to have great flavor. But whatever the reason this was a disappointment.	-1
Will not buy again, very flat and I'm a tea lover.  This is not tasty at all but I don't think you can return "foodstuffs" for a refund so I'm stuck with a bunch of flat k-cups of tea that would better be mixed with ????? not sure that anything would help.	-1
"Taste" is purely in the mouth of the individual. I don't care for this tea and am frankly puzzled how it may be described as "sweet." BUT, thats only my personal opinion.	-1
Too much Garlic.  Didn't like the overall flavor as the garlic just lingers and is really strong / pungent.	-1
package was 99% pretzels, if i wanted pretzels i would have just bought a bag flavor is great but mix is poor	-1
Awful, like earing sawdust. Yuck.	-1
no comment	-1
This had no taste to me.	-1
I would give it a zero if possible.  This is advertised as lemon soda, it tastes nothing like lemon, it reminded me of soap. Yuk.  I can't imagine anyone who might want to waste their money on this product.	-1
I love grapefruit and these disappoint. I ended up mixing grapefruit juice with one and it helped some but I ended up passing them on as I was not wasting them, Needless to say I will not buy them again. I did them the extra star for the attempt. I will try others as I find them and I hope I do find the one that calls to my taste buds.	-1
Yuck !  I like sparkling juices and sparkling flavored waters, and this doesn't taste like either.  For the 80 calories (of sugar), I expected something that had a flavor more like sparkling juice, but this was very watery in its flavor.  It was not overtly 'grapefruit', but a general citrus flavor- not bad but not what I ordered.  I took three sips, and threw away the rest of that can along with the remainder of that 4-pack, and the other one I'd ordered.  I'm sticking with Izze.  THAT is actual sparkling juice- not some leftover food waste marketed to sell.	-1
Hated the taste	-1
Wasn't liking the flavor.  Theree are much better labels of ginger ale than Q Drinks	-1
nasty!	-1
Not enough ginger	-1
Disgusting	-1
These were really bad... and this is coming from someone who likes pretty much everything Kashi. They were super chalky and dry they came in a box that once you opened the inside packaging you could not reseal it at all which made this even worse .. tried putting them in an air tight rubber seal cookie jar ... this did not help. Also the chocolate flavor is not a deep flavor in this cookie it almost comes off as mild which is even more disappointing for a chocolate cookie	-1
Not as good as I expected. Very dry and difficult to eat.	-1
