I am updating my review on this product. It is well made and with some use, it is a little easier to use. Seems to be holding up ok.	1
good price,good product	1
Works great.  My neighbor gave me an old Homelite SuperXL AO chainsaw with a dull blade.  This new blade makes cutting tremendously easier compared to the old blade, even after sharpening.	1
These work great, trying to sharpen up a worn chain is obviously not one of my best talents. If you install this it is like you have a brand new chain saw.	1
This is a replacement chain for my Sears 18" bar electric saw and works as good as original which did what I wanted.	1
as advertised..... Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product. I've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and haven't ever been disappointed with the quality...... good product..........	1
Product is weak sent back	-1
saves a lot of work.  dunno how I sharpened chains without it in the past!	1
Got these thinking they were the perfect answer for holding my shade screen on the fence but after spending a LONG. Tim, I never did get one to close and work like it should. They kept popping open. Horrid.	-1
Good Product.	1
These are exactly like the Coolaroo Shade Fabric Butterfly Clips 20-Count at less than half the price. EXCEPT the Coolaroo brand has all the male pins on the same side and Easy Gardener has the small male pins on one side and the 2 large ones on the other. This makes it impossible to push the fabric onto the pins before you close it. If you do not push the fabric into the pins first they don't close as tightly.	-1
Going to use these for two projects with the sun blocking screen material not coolaroo cloth but the finer mesh that they make blinds inside and outside to block heat and sun in several weights. I also removed coolaroo from some outdoor blinds we liked and replaced with the see through screens last year. So now have the coolaroo cloth to do something with. If there's some of these left over I intend to use these to help hang the pieces over a back 20 foot long covered patio to help cut down the heat that afternoon sun builds up there. We noticed a umbrella kept the heat out when we used it one summer but don't care for the trouble the umbrella is to keep upright with any gusts of wind etc. So being able to hang the coolaroo fabric and or some of the other screen material may just do the trick. I checked the clips out and they well support and close on the fabrics just fine.	1
This is a really nice chain for the Craftsman 18 inch cahIn saw. The original chain bent a tooth on the chain and I am glade that I had this new one already on hand. Going to buy another one for emergency backup.	1
My husband likes it !	1
Works just fine, a real help when cutting longer grass.	1
I like reel mowers and had an old Scotts mower. I sharpened the blade - get the Fiskars kit and don't go for the 'easy' fix like the screw on sharpeners - and ordered this grass catcher.  Reasonably priced but just doesn't quite cut it. So that kind of makes it useless.  Difficult to get on the mower in an expedient manner - and when you are emptying a catcher a lot, this can be tiresome. Doesn't do a great job collecting the clippings.  Maybe it is because my mower is old. Maybe it's because I got a funky catcher. It certainly isn't because I am not using it correctly. Whatever the issue is, this is not doing it for me.  Good luck	-1
sharp fit my chain saw and good quality	1
didnot fit	-1
I didn't realize how bad my old bar was getting, I had tried several different sharpened chains and still had mixed results. I put this new bar and chain on and jumped right into 30" logs. Cut like a champ. Buy it BEFORE you think you need it, it'll speed up your job immensely,	1
Just what I was wanting and at a good price. Fits my Echo saw properly and I did not have to go to town to get it.	1
I was not sure if this mower would work for me, seeing as my lawn is "too big", bumpy, and pretty weedy as I don't use chemicals on it.  But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each "section" of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.	1
I have used it only twice now......once on my large Stihl and once on my smallest. It takes a minute to get the hang of it but then sharpening goes very quickly. I don't think this will replace sharpening at the shop but should be able to just sharpen the blade 3-4 times in between shop sharpenings	1
I've never used something like this; easy to understand, and operate.	1
Somewhat hard to figure out how to use due to the horrible instructions provided with the sharpener-there are however several great videos on YouTube under sharpening a chainsaw that show this specific sharpener in action. It takes about 5 minutes to sharpen the entire chain. Great Product-Terrible Instructions	1
I started camping with an RV and my wife can go through firewood like butter melts on toast.  I bought two of these to keep up with the work.  I don't know how to sharpen but these fit well and seem to eat wood pretty well.	1
It was half the price of the same chain at Sears and came in two days. It saved me a ride and I have a pile of wood.	1
always like These chains.  You have to understand that you need to remove< clean. and sharpen before the blade dulls bad or blackens in order to get the most of of them	1
Much better price than what the local box store offered for this chainsaw cutting chain. I was able to cut the trees downed by Sandy in short order.	1
Needed a replacement bar for my old homelite xl . This brand is a trusted name in the industry . The price was right . The item came quickly and fit perfectly to my saw . I am totally thrilled with my new bar . It has brought me life back to an old friend	1
Works well, does not seem to cover a wide area but I am in the Florida swamps.  Easy to use but also wish the cord was a bit longer.	1
Best purchase I ever made.  Used to get attacked by mosquitos out by my pool and pergola area as soon as it got dark.  Bought one of these and put it up at the back edge of the property and it knocked down the mosquitos substantially to the point they were barely a bother.  Since then we bought a second one and always put them out in early spring to stay ahead of the mosquitos and it works great.  They are on a dusk to dawn timer so they work all night for us.  We clean them up every fall when we put them away.  Otherwise they are pretty much maintenance free.  The bulbs are a little expensive but there's some generic units out there that work just as well as the ones flowtron sells.	1
Bought this chain saw blade combination for a Tanaka TCS-3401S.  I merely sought to extend the range of possibilities for this remarkable little chain saw.  Had used the 12 and 14 bar sizes before (from Oregon as well.)  This particular 16 grouping fit the Tanaka perfectly and, as one has come to expect from the Oregon brand, the performance is exceptional.  Sadly, during this harsh New England winter, I have had to use the chainsaw more often than expected (or hoped for).  Nevertheless, the saw performed brilliantly, cut smoothly and effortlessly, and remained sharp much longer than projected (in view of the moist, snow- coated timber.)  First-rate saw blade combination.	1
New, sealed package, with high quality Oregon product - I tried to find one locally for close to the same price but I could not.  I put it on a Poulan 4218.  Works great!	1
great replacement bar and chain for price fit great and Oregon is a very durable chain and bar company have used many times in past	1
This product was recommended with the push real lawnmower that we purchased. However, it constantly comes disconnected from the lawnmower and doesn't work the way we had hoped.  I am very disappointed in having wasted my money on it.	-1
This is an OEM replacement for your poulan 18" chainsaw blade. It was the cheapest I was able to find on the web. It arrived in the mail quickly. I would purchase it again.	1
Nice quality replacement chain and fit perfectly. Seems to hold its sharpness better than the chain that came with the saw. I find it less trouble to just replace the chain rather than try to sharpen them.	1
Works fine for a cheaper alternative to a bench mounted sharpener. Only complaint I have that it is hard to keep the collet tight it keeps coming loose during use.would have been 5 stars if not for that	1
Cant run a chain saw without one.  My friends love it so much they borrow it and don't bring it back because they use it so often.  I let them keep it as a gift and just purchase myself a new one.  Highly recommend the carbide bits though.  The stone grinders wear out quickly.	1
I have used hand pushed reel lawn mowers for about 20 years now.  I have a SE Pennsylvania typical yard of a mix of fescues, bluegrass, zosia grass, white clover, red clover, and various weeds, I do not use any lawn treatment, managing the health of the lawn strictly by mowing height, timing of mowing and watering during extended droughts.  That's worked very well for me.  Especially in those full sun areas where the wonderful zosia grass can grow.  I have many shrubs, trees, and bermed somewhat steep slopes.  A full mow of my 1/5th acre property takes as much as 6 hours when the grass is most ragged, yet in high growth (late spring-early summer).  More typical time is 3.5 to 4 hours.  It's a two day job.  Once mowed the lawn looks great.  I cross mow about 1/3rd to 1/2 of it -- the most used part and the most visible part.  About 15,000 pedometer steps.  A good mower like Scott self-sharpens.  You'll need a good strong big screwdriver to make the adjustments every so often.  I do so every other mow, or every mow when the lawn is thick.  Four screws that set the closeness of the fixed cutting blade to the reel.  Two on each side.  To adjust, a very slight partial turn is needed.  No more that "a hour" or "half an hour" of the sweep of a 12 hour clock face.  You want to adjust  so you just start feeling resistance and hearing "click click click: when you mow a few feet.  That's a tight set to sharpen.  Once I do a few short rows back and forth on the tight setting I back it off a quarter of half the turn I used to tighten it.  That seems to give me the best cutting setting.  Mow a few hours or the next day after a rain -- when the grass is pliable, and rain has washed the mold off.  The grass should be not wet, but not dried out either.  Wear long pants, closed shoes and shocks -- otherwise you will get mold, pollen all over your legs and feet.  Be sure to take breaks, stay hydrated.  I have used the Scott and the Great Lakes.  I have  also used a couple others years ago whose brand is unremembered.  The Scott's classic is definitely the best, and I've never had any problem with the "plastic gearing" -- in fact when I opened the wheels up a few years ago the gearings were metal.  The Scott used to have a less well made handle.  To me, in my use, it is the handle that is the wear part.  In my heavy use I have broken the handle on every mower I have owned.  Given the many plantings and hills I have to be pulling the mower back and at an angle a lot.  Scott re-engineered the handle a few years ago -- a single U lower handle with thicker tubing.  That  handle lasts twice as long or longer.  When a handle breaks I call the Scott 800 number and they send out a replacement, or replacement for broken section of the handle.  No charge.  Very happy with the customer service.  The Scott is great, and great to a person like me who is a mowing monster.	1
Overall, it works well, but only on short grass. Don't let it get too tall or it does not work well at all. I have not owned it long enough to know how long it holds its sharpness. Time will tell.	1
Works great	1
This works a treat. It came with a bonus attractant pad that glues to the bottom with double-sided tape, and it's been happily zapping mosquitos all night for weeks now.	1
This was a direct replacement on my echo saw.  Bolted right up, and I bought some spare chains too.  I downgraded my saw to a 16 inch from 18 to give it more power, and it worked well.  saw doesnt bog down at all.	1
I haven't actually used it yet, but by appearances and feel, it's an exact replacement for what I have now on my chainsaw.  It arrived promptly, packaged very well and was as expected.  When it's time to replace bar I'll already have the replacement ready. As for the chain, this will be my third spare chain.  I already put one of these from the same company on my chainsaw and it cuts beautifully.  I won't be silly anymore and replace these chains when the cuts are no longer producing wood chips, but sawdust.	1
The original chain on my Echo saw had 87 teeth.  This is the Oregon replacement and has 86 teeth so it is slightly shorter and you have to adjust the tension on the chain to make it fit.  Once the tension is adjusted the chain works fine and Oregon is a good brand of chains.	1
So nice to have a new chain.  I've already bucked three cords of wood without any sharpening - and the trees are lying in rows on the ground.	1
I bought this because the original chain has some bent teeth stoping it from fitting the guide grove in the chain bar. It did the trick replacing my old messed up chain.	1
Works great. Best redneck entertainment	1
It worked great -- for a month and a half.  We had it near our front door, and it lured away enough mosquitoes to make entering at night tolerable.  Then the bulb died.	-1
Thanks	1
work great	1
This thing is just awesome fast shipping too thx guys	1
Works great.	1
Did not fit my saw even though it described it would	-1
great	1
Works great for my vintage Homelite XL12.  Cut's through pine trunks like butter.	1
Excellent. Delivered promptly and works great.	1
Goes great with my reel mower.  perfect fit, it does really work.	1
Great chain and bar deal with free shipping. It was worth every penny. Oregon makes good quality parts. This is a great product.	1
This bar and chain combo seemed like the best choice for my echo 16 inch. The bar and chain both are Oregon. This chain has one less link than the stock chain that came with the saw. The original Bar was made by Echo. Both are low kickback, but if your old bar is worn out , your extra chains will not fit this bar I'm told because of the link difference. I have not used it yet,but it appears to be the same low kickback design and also will sharpen with the same size file. I trust this brand over any others and the price was half of what I would have paid in the store.	1
The trouble with older bars and chains is, with age they stretch out and lose their cutting ability, even with sharpening. After a few years of occasional use, my chain and bar were done, it was time to spring for a new combo. The new combination really tears through hardwoods, I forgot how good a new chain and bar can perform!	1
This replacement chain cost about one-third of what the manufacturer of my chain saw was asking via their replacement parts web site.  As it turns out, the Oregon chain was identical to the O.E.M. chain.  It appears that the original chain on my Craftsman saw was made by Oregon.  Why pay more?	1
The chain was the perfect size and replaced my dull chain in seconds.  It cuts much faster than the original one did and didn't cost much more than having the old one sharpened.	1
GREAT ITEM AT A GREAT PRICE	1
This chain fit great for my Poulan Pro electric saw. This is also an older company that has a great website to help identify exactly what model your specific saw requires. It is not directional, so you don't have to worry about any arrows facing the right way. I just used it and I forgot how powerful my saw was. Getting old ones sharpened can be questionable when new ones are this cheap.	1
Paid for itself the first use.	1
as ordered	1
It is still working and killing flying bugs.  Good size and good price.	1
great product arrived quickly	1
Works good.	1
as ordered	1
I hit a nail in a log with my Poulan 400E. Ordered Oregon chain as backup. I could not believe how well it cuts right out of the box. Great saw, great chain.	1
Could be my Imagination, but it seems to be of better quality than what came with my poulon pro chainsaw........even though I think they are made by the same company (at least it says oregon on the bar that came on the saw) have resharpened a couple times now and it holds a edge very well	1
I had to return the product, as I misread the dimensions and needed a reel mower grass catcher that was 20" inches and this product fits up to 18". That being said, I assembled the product (which was very easy to do) before I realized that I ordered the wrong size. It was sturdy and would work well with an 18" reel mower.	1
Item was received as expected.  Thanks	1
LOVE IT! Just like mosquitos love me. This really helped.	1
good.	1
I chose this product because of the reputation of the Oregon brand and the reasonable price. Oregon makes a wide variety of products for a wide variety of chainsaw brands. I highly recommend this chain; you will not be disappointed.	1
I probably should have paid closer attention to the reviews but I thought they had improved the product.  Very easy to assemble and takes very few tools. Fits my mower perfectly.  Worked great for the first use but then the bottom was dragging the ground so it screwed it up.  The bottom of the basket is now tweaked and warped.  With it like that, the catcher falls off in the yard continuously.  More work than raking!	-1
The Oregon chains are top notch, however the Amazon web sites on the chains leave a lot to be desired. The write-ups  are all over the place and need to be improved. It is almost impossible to tell from the listings which chain fits your saw. I had to send two back already and while this one will work it is not the model recommended by the mfg. You may find ordering chains from Amazon to be a challenge. The product itself is fine. I could have saved a lot of time by just going to the hardware store.	1
What can I say - this is an oregon chain. Amazon and online is the only place I can get this chain anymore (Lowe's and Home Depot don't stock it). Good price and the item arrived in a couple of days - great service.	1
Chain fits my saw perfectly. Very sharp from factory and cuts like a charm. My local shop guys loves the manufacturer.	1
Pretty basic device not worth writing a whole lot about. It serves it's purpose although the mounting screws could be a little longer and galvanized for exterior use. None-the-less the bracket is sturdy when mounting on the exterior siding.	1
Yeah, the title says insect killer, but what I'm really hating is the mosquitoes and that's what I want to be killed. I just wish there was a way to kill off this specific insect rather than a million moths and other unknown orgy of insects piled on.  If you want to be humane as possible about this insect killer. Only use it when you're going outside or about to be doing an activity such as mowing the grass or enjoying the pool. Leaving it on is a waste of energy and a dent in the insect population.  To clean it, just use a can of compressed air like for computers and such. It'll get the majority of dead bodies off of it. Just take a step back as the pieces of raw insects might get flown into the air and attach to you. ;) Hopefully you didn't get too sick thinking about the shredded, melted, insect flesh.hahaha	1
Works great! I was missing some clips and Amazon made sure I was satisfied.	1
good	1
Works fine.	1
Good value for the $$$. Killed lots of bugs over the summer.	1
Perfect for my small lawn. Easy to assemble. A joy to use in my early morning garden reverie. Tucks into a corner of my small garage. I really am glad I went retro.	1
Tiny but mighty! Why is this tool discontinued? Should get another one I guess just in case mine break. Good for digging, removing rocks, weeds with long roots, old tree stumps, hard compacted soil. Very light weight but strong. Good to have during a zombie apocalypse for sure!	1
Perfect for garden work cut through roots and easier to dig them up.	1
Just as described!	1
The ground has frozen so I won't be using this until spring for metal detecting, but its got the right heft and length and angles that I believe will make this a very useful tool. I will be wrapping the handle with friction tape as it is a bit slender for my XL glove sized hands. Probably will drill a hole and put a loop of Amsteel on it for carrying.	1
Had to adjust a little to fit right on the mower but works great.	1
Normally I don't like "add on's". Very often they are not very compatible. This product, however, works quite well. Now I have to push the mower faster, but that is MY problem. lol	1
Works well with no worries.	1
Heavy duty hold this industrial sized zapper	1
Love hearing the snap, crackle and pop of bugs dying.  Am using it in the house to kill moths from the parrot food.  The only time it is loud is when I think an Eagle gets in it. lol	1
Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2... Flowtron	1
I gave it 4 Stars cos I find the seller is respecting the error even not from him  the product is ok for my small works on my backyard garden not heavy I mean even my wife enjoy to works with it  thanks	1
Works very well for planting, strong easy to hang on to and balanced.	1
I already have a large pick mattock but sometimes I want something smaller and lighter. This tool does the job so far. Time will tell if it holds up to heavy use, but so far so good. I would like the blade side of the head to be a little longer and wider, but haven't seen any other better designs available for purchase. To me, the wood handle feels much better in hand than those yellow composite plastic handles do. Yeah the composite is super durable but it just makes the job feel a lot more tedious for me. Hickory handles are the best.	1
I bought these to add to my supply reserve but have had good experience with them in the past.	1
just what I needed and at a great price	1
just what I needed and a great price	1
I bought three of these for my narrow backyard system.  They work exactly as described.  I had to adjust the water inflow rate to get perfect coverage, but that's a normal requirement.  After 2 years of using these, I'm very happy!	1
Nice and sturdy. We use on a tree to hold our large bug zapper. Looks good and secure.	1
it works	1
The flat side of the head is not perpendicular to the handle.  It's like 15 degrees off.  Very sloppy Chinese mfg.  It's still usable, but just barely.  It's inexpensive and cheaply made.  You get what you pay for.  Might throw it away after the one job for which I need it.  Update:  After using it for a day, I've discovered that it is also too light to be effective.  There are relieved out areas on the top that lighten/weaken it.  I tossed it.	-1
This mini pick arrived earlier this week, and I used it and a shovel this morning for the coarse initial preparation of two planting beds and to trench for planting pachysandra rhizomes.  This tool comes in very handy where a regular pick is overkill.  It's very well balanced, has good design and structural integrity, and gets the job done fast. Just the right weight to do rapid, major damage without killing your arm.  Have I seen better finishes on hickory tool handles?  Sure, but I didn't buy it to look at.  This is a sturdy, well-designed, and extremely effective tool for which I can envision a variety of uses.  I detest spending good money on cheap, crappy tools regardless of where they're made.  I'm extremely happy with this tool.	1
I use this pick to trim grass around my flower garden.  It makes clean cuts through the grass and makes edging easier.  Also, great for planting flowers.  With one swing the pick makes a hole large enough for each flower.  Speeds planting time.  Beveled edge cuts cleanly through grass.  Narrow pick end perfect to break up hard packed dirt.  Good weight to pick helps making each pick hit effective.  Strongly made, will last a long time.	1
I ordered this grass catcher for my Great States 16 manual mower model 816-16, but it's seriously annoying that this is being advertised as universal fit for "14, 16, and 18-inch width reel mowers" while it is not.  This grass catcher, made by Great States, will NOT fit mowers with trailing wheel (2 rear wheels in addition to the main 2 wheels) that has less than 19 1/2" space to allow for the grass catcher to be installed. Measure and make sure you have more than 19 1/2 space between the rear wheel space before ordering, or you'll have to return the item as I had to. This incompatibility is noted on the included install instruction, so I don't know why this is not mentioned here to save buyers' hassle.	-1
Worked great at catching grass when needed.	1
The reviews are accurate.  It sucks.  I thought as an Engineer I could figure out a way to make it work, but instead I saw that its to flawed of a design to bother as the mower (Great States 415-16) is also to blame for the useless nature of this grass catcher.  I wanted this to work so bad that I just ignored the bad reviews.  Now I think it should not even be allowed to be sold because it is just a really bad useless item to buy.	-1
The hooks don't hold it on the mower (ended up taping the hooks so the grass catcher won't fall off all the time.)  Don't know why the call it a grass catcher, I get more grass by raking after I'm done than with the catcher.  Also the grass slides forward every time I stop.  Worthless.	-1
This Push Reel Mower is managing the grass/weeds and rocks in our African house very well.  Arrived extremely sharp, not too hard to push, and back wheel gives it a bit more traction.  Heavy duty and nothing is bent yet.  will continue to monitor and change review if all collapses (like all the rest of the push mowers I have bought for the yard.)  Having a gas powered mower would be a nightmare unless you spent a lot of money (which I don't have) as the blades would bend in a minute.  Much better to have steel and use a bit more muscle.  Of course the tall weeds don't cut as well, but it is pretty good and definitely good for the money.	1
God product	1
This bracket is perfect for my Flowtron Fly Trap Dominator	1
Perfect for hanging my new bug zapper to the tree.  Thank you for such a prompt delivery.	1
I wish it stuck out from the wall a little further, but the hold in screw is the ticket. Even in 50 mph winds, it stayed on the hanger!	1
easy to put up, came with all the right screws etc.	1
Great, exactly as expected!	1
We used this as a second layer of fence around the top of the fence around our garden.  It's enough to keep the deer out and it's easier that installing metal fence that high up.  We did have a chicken fly into it though and rip a section.  It was easily repaired though and the garden is fine!	1
This is a good product if you're fighting the backyard battle of man against the critters. I use it the way it comes,which is folded in half, which makes it 40 inches high, enough to keep out most deer and rabbits who are looking to make your garden their next meal. put some wooden stakes about six feet apart and use a staple gun to secure to stakes, or you can just throw it over some plants if you're lazy. You could use the full 7 foot height if you don't mind the 'maximum security' look. Usually, the pests, excuse me, our furry friends, will just move on to your neighbors yard where there are easier pickings...except, when those juicy,red tomatoes start ripening in August...at that point I'd recommend an AK-47.	1
Nice Product as an add on item for your Flowtron bug sapper. The best part of the design is that the outer curl has a closing clasp. So, once you snap your Flowtron Sapper into it the clasp holds it in place and the wind or a frisky animal (such as your neighborhood raccoon) won't dislodge the product. Why is that good? Well because the Flowtron's cage unit has a tendency to crack when it falls six to eight feet to the ground. We found that our squirrels and a raccoon must have thought it was a feeder and they have tried jumping up on it and the clasp keeps it from crashing down.  I highly recommend that you purchase this at the same time you purchase your bug sapper.  It would also work well for holding hanging potted plants in place during severe storms or strong winds if you didn't happen to be home to unhook them from a standard hanger before the storm.	1
Nice beaker for hanging bug zapper	1
Actually for my small patch of grass, it slows me down.  For a bigger lawn, it would be perfect.	1
Fits perfectly and helps to keep the lawn neat.	1
Love that it actually attracts bugs, unlike my other one. I only wish it had a light sensor to turn off during the day. On the good side, it has killed a couple of bugs during the daylight.	1
Works well. Don't have on in the rain.	1
These flowtrons are the way to go, good quality that keeps killing those bugs! I have mine on a timer to come on right before dusk and off at dawn.	1
I do not work for the seller. I am using this for the Stinger 1 1/2 acre bug Zapper. I had to bend the holder on the bug zapper a bit to fit through the support bracket here, but nothing 2 pairs of pliers can't handle. Fits like a charm!	1
Work great	1
holds up my bug killer.	1
Easy to install and the lock bolt and nut are a great feature.	1
Good product, did what it was supposed to.	1
Doesn't attach on very well and falls off.  I returned mine.  Good idea but needs more help in how to attach to lawnmower.	-1
I appreciate that this mesh is packaged in a roll. It was evenly cut and a breeze to install, I just unrolled and clipped it on the poles as I went around my fruit tree cage, which happens to be 7' tall. So it fit perfectly on the sides of the cage. I just rolled it up to the top and secured with small bungee cords. Now it's ready when I need it. One less thing to worry about. I plan on leaving it on all year. If needed I can place fleece or plastic directly over it in cold weather when needed. The mesh is 1/2" x 1/2" and the birds can see enough shine on it to actually land on it instead of flying into it. But it does not obstruct my view of looking at my beautiful food plants. Note* I secured a heavy duty mesh netting on the top of my fruit cage to withstand smaller falling branches and hail. I recommend attaching this taught so the birds will not get tangled in it.	1
grate	1
When I received this bracket one of the welds that held the knee brace in place wasn't holding anything. I drilled a hole and bolted it together. I purchased the Flowtron Diplomat which is a large bug zapper and this would never have supported it the way it arrived. The tiny little screws they supply to mount the bracket would never do the job in any surface so I drilled out the holes so larger mounting screws could be used. The paint was pretty thin to so I re-painted it. It just is not worth the money.	-1
So far has worked as advertised	1
good one	1
I bought this with my huge Flowtron Bug Zapper.  The bracket works great.	1
Works well but short service life, 1 - 2 years is all I have gotten out of 2 of them.	-1
Perfect!!!	1
I've bought several different ones and this one is the best. Works like a champ.	1
I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing. It didn't work out. The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.  Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.  If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.  If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me.	-1
Since I have used this product before, I knew what to expect. It worked perfectly with my chain saw	1
JUNK. FORGET	-1
THIS IS THE PREFECT HOLDER FOR MY BUG-LIGHT AND LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MENT FOR MY UNIT, SO HAPPY I BOUGHT....... 8-)	1
Very durable, I screwed this into a 4x4 post and hung my bug light. Threw all the bad weather at times still in good shape.	1
These hangers are very versatile and I like the fact you can secure what you are hanging with a nut and bolt so the wind can't blow your pot off the hook.	1
At first I thought that cost was too much, but I ordered it anyway.  It is appears to be wrought iron and anodized.  So, it was worth the $$$.  It can also be used as a plant hanger, provided it is securely anchored.  Works well with the bug light.	1
This is a great product and is exactly what we needed.  It works very well to hold the bug zapper and the locking pin prevents it from getting blown/knocked off.	1
Works great for what we needed. great for hanging plants and electric bug zappers. easly attached to tree with screws and drill	1
It works ok on some flying insects, but does not work on flies or mosquitoes even with the attractant pouches installed as directed... :O( Seems to be a big waste of electricity for what I had hoped for...trying to keep the flies and mosquitoes out of my face in my shop, and yes I installed it as directed... but even when I moved it inside the shop and closed the door the flies and mosquitoes just laughed at it...? :O(	-1
Have used this as a barrier to keep critters out and keep some in.  All and all - it's a very good product.  Strong enough but will definitely rip is too much pressure is applied.  If your project doesn't require a product to be too strong, this works fine.  If "yes", get some chicken wire or stronger.  I'm happy with how it's performed so far.  The deer will eat the plants - no doubt.  This helps keep them at bay.  Not perfect - but definitely helps!	1
At first I was skeptical, but after using this for a year, I'm sold.  We spread this on the ground to cover plants or areas we don't want varmints, whether deer, rabbits, chipmunks, etc.  It is thin so it is not readily seen via eyesight, so it's not visible from the road when people drive by.  Deer step it in once, and that's all it takes.  All the other animals in our area (very rural) have learned to avoid  this stuff because it sticks to your feet, just like it does to the animals.  We put this down again this spring, and it stops all animal traffic into the yard. Last fall, we were cleaning off the old leaves before winter and we even had a blue racer (snake) that was caught in it.. (it couldn't get out), but we were able to free the snake by cutting it off (very carefully).  Snake rested for quite a while on the ground after being freed, but soon left.  This is great stuff, we also use it to cover potted plants left outside, and the plants are not bothered by any of our wildlife.  I'm guessing the people who don't rate this high just don't know how to spread this out for maximum efficiency.	1
I have it mounted to siding on an exterior structure. It fits perfectly. My only complaint is the ants use it as a freeway to get to the dead bugs on the Flowtron device. It took less than 5 mins to install this. The screws that came with it is sufficient, but depending on the surface you're mounting it to, you may want to consider stronger wood screws.	1
i return the garden stand then buy this hanger.  its good.  easy to install.  hold tight.  i install it on my deck.  its nice.	1
Very good quality	1
I bought this to try to reduce the bug population around our house. It is hanging in the yard about 7 feet up and 25 feet away from our patio. It does the job well. Within a week of installation we noticed a difference in mosquitoes and beetles. I feed the pets on the patio and the flies love the food. I started leaving this light on 24/7 and again within a week there was hardly a fly to be found. I put a bucket on the ground under the light and the variety of dead insects was amazing. On occasion a lizard going after bugs or a giant moth will get in it. That requires turning the light off and removing the intruder.  After a year one of the 2 bulbs went out. I just ordered 2 replacement bulbs. FYI: I've read that if the new bulb doesn't work that it may be the starter which I hope is replaceable. Time will tell. A side note: These bulbs do not seem to be the intense electric blue I'm accustomed to. They are a lighter blue. There is some difference in color temperature. I'm not sure if these bulbs are less effective since I don't have an older one to compare it with.  I've used the light with and without the mosquito attractant and didn't notice any difference. That stuff is expensive and smells like death so I choose not to use it.	1
Works great	1
good	1
Went through wood like a hot knife through butter!	1
Worked perfect..Great price. Highly Recommend.	1
Product as described.	1
The grass seems to pile up right around the roller instead of being tossed into the catcher.  Maybe that is inherent in the design of the reel mower though?	-1
I purchased this grass catcher for use with the American Lawn Mower model 1705-16, for which this unit was labeled compatible for use.  I would recommend that anyone with the aforementioned model mower spend the $20 on a better lawn rake, or having the neighbor kid pick up grass clippings, or a down payment on a leaf blower, or on materials to build your own grass catcher attachment.  This attachment is absolutely useless for the 1705-16.  It does not fit well at all, so that a large portion of the grass slides out neatly piling as you go (which looks worse than if you do not use the attachment at all).  Not only that, this attachment has a capacity of approximately 6 toddler sized handfuls of grass.  Seriously, you can only mow 10 to 15 linear feet before the catcher will not hold anymore without dumping it out (due to the way the catcher fits on the mower), and that is on flat ground - it will not hold anything if the handle bouces up.  The catcher can be modified to work in an almost mediocre fashion if you want to put the time and materials into reworking it, but honestly you would be better off starting from scratch if you were doing this.  This catcher is very cheaply made junk (four coat hangers and some netting to be exact) and is not in any way durable.  I was quite disappointed by this, because the American LM 1705-16 mower I have is a very good little reel mower and a quality product.	-1
Nice an easy to put on and take off and does a great job. Is an extra worth combining with the mower.	1
It's a decent arm bracket but I am surprised that the bolt and nut they give you to use to secure the bug zapper is not SS or galvanized as by the end of summer the nut and bolt was all rusted.  As such, it does pliers and muscle to get the nut loose.  The rest of the item seems fine so I will just use a outdoor rated nut and bolt for this upcoming season.	1
I love the look of this styled bracket. It is easy to mount, and adds a touch of class to any outdoor scheme. We use it to hold our bug zapper (see...classy!), and it works very well, holding the entire fixture easily and appears to withstand most weather.	1
I purchased this wall bracket for my Flowtron bug light. It is durable.  It provides theft security by means of a screw/bolt that prevents removal without removing the screw. It is also nice in that if it is windy, it keeps the light from falling off of the bracket.	1
I wanted to wait to make sure I was still liking this mower after a couple months.  I do, I love it.  I personally find it easier to push around than a standard big ol' gas mower, unless said gas mower was self-propelling of course, or unless you let your lawn go a couple weeks between mows.  I do have to stay on it and mow every week.  But I really find it kinda fun with this little guy, so it's no skin off my back.  Also I didn't get the scrap catcher thing, and I really don't need it since I'm staying on top of it and the clippings stay pretty short!  The only maintenance this needs is to be wiped down clean and sprayed with some wd 40 after each mow.  Not a big deal.  I love that it's quiet.  I love that it's Earth friendly.  And American made.  Yeah, if a stalk is very tough or very tall, it's hard to get with this.  When there are a few grass-weed type stalks that don't want to get cut, I just trim 'em with a clipper.  (I also edge a little bit with my hedge clipper.)  But that's just me.  Anyway I don't require absolute perfection.  If you are a serious lawn perfectionist, then perhaps an electric mower might be better.  We figured this was way cheaper than an electric mower so it was worth the gamble if it didn't work out.  So glad we took the gamble and saved a bunch of money!	1
It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.	1
Works great	1
Power baby!	1
Just a warning once you place the attraction container in run run	1
not a bad bagger.  it'd be nice if the clippings flew further back.  It catches 90-95 percent of grass.  It reduces the mobility of a reel mower.  but it works.  takes 3 seconds to assemble and 90 seconds to attach to the mower.	1
this was a disappointment. I does hold some of the grass, but not enough and it pops off too easily in the middle of mowing spilling the grass. The gap between the blades and catcher is too large and allows grass clippings to escape.	-1
I love this push mower. Works great. And it is fun. Nice feature is various height choices. Tip: Don't let grass get too high before mowing as wheels will push long grass down so it will not cut those areas.	1
This chain was not available locally, as the chainsaw has been obsolete for some time now.  It was just what I needed.  I originally ordered the wrong chain, but after realizing it, I contacted them and they recommended this chain and it fit perfectly.  Great  customer service and a great product.	1
This is a fast cutting chain which I bought for my discontinued McCullough chain saw. It fits perfectly and cuts quickly. Thx Amazon for coming to my rescue. Oregon, as all chain saw operators say, is top notch in their chain saw replacements. Reasonable price as well and easy installation.	1
Super fast shipments and great products AAAA++++	1
Arrived days before I expected it in the condition that I wanted  Perfect job!	1
Great Deal1	1
Awesome, fit my Craftsman chainsaw as expected and cut thru trees like butter.	1
I bought this with my new mower, and it works just as I expected. It doesn't pick up every blade of grass that is cut, nor do I expect, or want it to. It does prevent me from having to rake by reducing the amount of clippings falling back into the yard, and still leaves some behind, which I'm told is good for the lawn.  I noticed that the metal loops that snap together can come apart easily, so used a pair of pliers to close them; the instructions don't mention doing this, but they should; it took like 30 seconds, and makes a world of difference. It can easily dislodge from the mower if you kick it or bump it against something, but I think once you I get use to it, it will be easy enough to avoid.  So given the price, I'm happy with the purchase, and think it makes a nice addition to my new reel mower.	1
GOOD CHAIN FITS GREAT	1
The glucocil. I have not really seen any change in my blood sugar	1
Made in China doesn't sit well with me but this reel mower proved its worth after its 1st use. I used to own an American made reel mower, thought it was the right one to buy, but I was proven wrong. Used to fight with my old one, go over the same spots repeatedly to cut those few blades of grass, & constantly adjust those screws, where as this beauty cleanly cuts just about everything in front of it & I barely break a sweat. It's one of those tools that deserves to be treated well after use. Do yourself a favour & be sure to keep it cleaned, covered, & oiled after each use. Do that & you'll stop hating the day you need to use it. You'll actually enjoy mowing the yard. I do, now.	1
As described.	1
This is basically the same thing as the netting you can buy to keep birds off your garden. The filament measures 0.006 inches. I found it impossible to attach it to an existing flat fence. No matter how many staples I put in, the netting would rip out. Perhaps if you wrap it several times around a post, you will get enough friction to anchor it firmly. In any event, while you are working with it don't let it sag and touch any debris on the ground, or you will have a lot of work getting it untangled.	-1
Should sharpen the chains.  But the price of this is right and it works.	1
If its not Oregon, its crap!	1
So I got this item delivered on time.  It was assembled for the most part.  I just had to put together the handle part.  I went over the grass and it was a breeze to mow it.  The notion of hauling around a bulky outdated gas powered monster just to mow lawn always bothered me, so I never considered buying one.  This little guy puts those to shame as it is easy to use and mows beautifully.  I'm happy with this purchase, and am looking forward to mowing my lawn again and again.	1
Pretty good netting.	1
Worked well...	1
I know they call it deer netting but I don't know how it could possibly stop a deer. It rips at the slights tug! I used some to cover my chicken run and used skinny zip ties to hold it. Completely useless. It's constantly tearing through with minimal pressure. I had it caught on my button once and without even knowing, I ripped out two zip ties.	-1
easy to use and worked well for our application, which was keeping hawks out of a chicken run.	1
Good quality	1
This was purchased for my son's chain saw - I do not recall the model number, but in reading other people's reviews, this one was chosen over the recommended size.  The comments I read were correct.  He replaced the chain and found it fit tighter, better than the original.  If the model can be located, the comment will be updated to include it to help others choose the size they need.	1
love it works great	1
It kills bugs. We had a ton of bugs flying around our entryway.  I put this unit below the porch (2nd floor) and it really brought the amount of bugs flying around the door down about 95%. I was impressed.	1
Perfect fit on my old 1625. Cuts like butter.	1
Excellent replacement chain	1
works well	1
Put over newly seeded yard area...worked great and kept squirrels from digging a burying. Came up easily too. No trapping of animals.	1
As advertised	1
Works fantastic	1
Works great	1
kills all bugs	1
This bug zapper works great.	1
Gift for dad. Works well.	1
Second one I bought and this broke quickly too.  No more!	-1
Great quality chain for a great price.	1

Great price!	1
I bought a new house in August that backs up to a small woods. I wasn't living there long before I discovered that there was a serious gnat infestation in the evenings. I couldn't even sit on the deck for 10 minutes without being bitten, The massive swarms of gnats looks like small storm clouds in my backyard. I tried spray, citronella bucket candles, ultrasonic repellent devices, hanging glue traps, and even a homemade vinegar and soap traps. Finally I went ahead and bought this electric trap since I was out of options. I was very happy when I heard zap zap zap shortly after putting it up. Ever since I put this out on the fence that runs along the woods the gnats have been almost non-existent.  A note: I was going to mount this under my desk, which is attached to my house but in the instructions it tells you not to mount it on your house. So instead I have mine mound in the back yard on the fence with a 75ft extension core running to a day/night timer under the deck.	1
Kills like it stated	1
PERFECT	1
Cuts real good very good	1
Too small for my Wen Model 5016. Sent it back.	-1
This is the second chain i've bought. Got this one for a back-up to use when i need to replace the existing one i am using. Also bought it because of the price, it's half the price from same one at home improvement stores. Plus it's a great product, less vibration and kick back. Thanks for a great product at a fantastic price.	1
Direct replacement. In fact I think this chain cuts better then the OEM one that came with the saw. No issues and it seems to not stretch like the OEM version did when cutting hardwood.	1
xgood	1
Not what I expected.  The material is more like hair net than tennis net or netting for fencing very thin material.  Material is as thin as sewing thread.	-1
This was a waste of money for me. I wanted to use it at the bottom of my current fence to keep the rabbits out. I doubled up on it and tripled up in some places and the rabbits still broke right through it.	-1
Destroys flying insects!  I need to clean it already due to its massive effectiveness.  Flys, moths, and mosquitos are virtually non existent in my yard now.  My dogs ears are grateful and so am I.	1
Works as advertised.	1
worked as intended	1
Arrived as expected and fit correctly.	1
Excellent quality cutting blade for the price.  I buy these and use them over and over by resharpening them and they work like new everytime.	1
Though this is a portable grill, it is terrific for at home use if you're single, or have a small balcony apartment. It takes very little space, and is easy to maneuver when cleaning time comes.  I've used this gem for years. My apartments, on the whole, mandated the simplicity and efficiency offered up by the Smokey Joe.  A great feature is the rounded top. This enables better smoking, as air and smoke circulates more fluidly.  The downsides: The legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. Given time, a bit of bumping around and general abuse, and the screwed on legs might turn askew. If you notice this while the grill is hot, you've a problem. The solution is to keep them tight during non-use.  The air intake at the bottom gets clogged with ashes. A key to good charcoal grilling is the manipulation of air flow. The intake might be open, but stopped up. If you are diligent to clean the ahes, you'll be OK.  Because the grill is so close to the ground, you need to be careful. Unlike most of Weber's grill, this one os also apt to getting kicked over, run into by dogs, cars and children.  I fully recommend Weber's Smokey Joe. Now, I'm hungry. Time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats.  Anthony Trendl AmericanSpeechwriter.com	1
Not practical.	-1
I used this netting for a chicken run.  Worked great and was just the right width to accommodate an arch over the coop.	1
great product great price	1
No deer, so far.	1
I bought this to keep the sparrow birds out of my snaps and grapes and it works great. Great price on Amazon as well!	1
We got this to protect young trees from deer.  It was just the trick we needed.	1
It works well to kill termites.	1
Nice cutting chain.	1
Oregon saw chains have proven to be good quality and proper fit at decent prices.	1
Was able to put on my Remington chainsaw, and wow, it cut through a close to 3 foot tree trunk with ease.	1
It's a bit smaller than my 20" mower but it works fine.  I used cable ties to fasten the loose parts. The assemble process isn't straightforward but it's not rocket science either.  The catcher needs to be emptied once in a while but it's not end of the world. It's perfect for a small yard (< 2000 SF).  After all, it provides another way of exercise.	1
Fit perfectly	1
Just as described..very satisfied	1
Perfect replacement.	1
Oregon chains really are the best replacement chain on the market. Fit my Craftsman 16" 32cc chain saw perfect!	1
Zaps the crap out of annoying insects and puts off a nice blue glow. The only problem is it freaks my dog out miserably! But that is his problem.	1
A LOT of betting for very little. Not durable if you've got *determibed* critters but it's good for redirection. 10/10 would buy again.	1
Good product , but dragon Flys get trapped in it and die.	1
GREAT PRODUCT, WORKS AS EXPECTED	1
all good	1
Got as a spare one	1
The chain is great.	1
Nice zapper!  I got this for mosquitos but haven't had time to add the stuff for the little boogers.  Even without the lure, this zapper gets anything that ventures near.	1
It works great. I should have bought it years ago.	1
great item, it cost me exactly one goose egg to mow my lawn. just make sure and mow it while its low growth. cuts like a electric knife through goose.	1
It's 9:00am on a beautiful Saturday morning.  The air is a little cool but the sun feels warm on my skin.  The Northern Cardinals are singing and I hear a Golden Fronted Woodpecker chirping in the tree above my head.  As I sit on my back porch and sip my coffee I feel content and happy.  Then, my next door neighbor fires up his ridiculously over-sized riding lawn mower.  A few minutes later the guy behind me joins in.  I head inside.  Another Saturday morning ruined.  I decide to make a  point.  Later that day the neighbor is hosting a bar-b-que in his backyard.  As he is tending the grill I chat with him for a while.  He has over 30 guests and they are all having fun talking to each other and laughing.  I announce that it is time for me to mow my yard.  His eyes get big and he stammers "N..n..now?"  Yep.  I roll out my brand new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scotts-Push-Reel-Lawn-Mower/dp/B00004RA3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scotts Push Reel Lawn Mower</a>&nbsp;and start mowing right next to his fence.  None of his guests even noticed.  He happily offered me a beer and a brat when I was done.  This mower makes life better.

I still like the Scotts but the Fiskars is easier to use and requires less maintenance.	1
Junk deer crashed on through it like it wasn't there. Had to put up different fence and clean up the mess it left.	-1
This netting works great!!!!!  Keeps the deer out.	1
We used this to create an aviary for our chickens so they could be worry-free from hawks and other aerial predators.  It is thin enough that it is essentially invisible unless you are looking for it or right next to it but it has been working like a charm.  Love this stuff and wouldn't hesitate to recommend for this purpose!	1
Much cheaper than purchasing at Home Depot. Home Depot had advertised for $89 - what a rip off! Purchased here and works great for protecting our small veggie garden!	1
Great little grill and perfect for an apartment patio. We are a family of 3 and have just enough space on it for one more person. Easy to put together and well designed.	1
Great product. Sharp out of the box, durable, no comp,aints	1
Better than original cut up tree in less than five minutes with new chain...	1
Great price and works great	1
Works great until something actually wants to get through it. My dog hit it once and that was the end of it. Can't imagine what a deer would do to it! Waste of money. I built a real fence.	-1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
We use this to discourage the dog from going over the wall, it works and you can't even see it.	1
New, but appears to instantly start working. I ordered a second one instantly.	1
There is nothing better then sitting on the front porch with a beer and a bug zapper.  Spoken like I am a true redneck or something...... try it... you won't be sorry. This works great. Zero bug bites after this arrived.	1
This thing draws them in and wipes them out. Really Great	1
high quality	1
As expected.  Good value.	1
fits perfectly... have not used it much since I replaced it...	1
Love this zapper!  Does this trick...its amazing what it can do.  Like the reviews say you don't put it next to you...move it away and if you want a good show put it in your eyesight.  I have one for the house and one for a cabin we go to...its like 4th of July...Make sure to get the Attractant and change it out every month.  Doesn't get them all but makes a huge difference.	1
Attracts and kills a lot of bugs. In prime bug season it makes a lot of sizzling noises as it fries bugs.  Between that and the disclaimer on the bug attractant... I'd be slow to recommend this one for use around children and pets.  There is something satisfying though listening to your antagonizers frying and sizzling to a crispy dry husk.	1
I needed to enclose my chicken run do to Ariel Predators such as red tail hawks. The mash is super fine and easy to see through so it does not block any light. Also flexible enough for are birds to jump up and not get hurt. Great for our chickens	1
this thing clears out the whole yard back to the woods.  love to hear it zap.  especially with the zika moving this way	1
does nothing	-1
Fine	1
No problems with this it did attract all the night flying bugs.	1
using along the bottom of our wood fence to keep puppy inside.  very durable and easy to use.  got the big roll because I know we will find other uses.	1
Bought it because someone reviewed that it caught a couple of snakes  YES!  but alas, no snakes yet.  The netting is thin, it sticks to itself when you curtain it about, but once it's in place, it works well. It will NOT keep deer out, if those guys want your stargazer lilies, they will get past this netting. Birds however, they don't dive for the strawberries any longer.  YES! So depending on what you need, it is pretty sturdy, very very thin, and almost invisible when hanged, birds will be like "what the" but deer will be like "hmm, another cobweb to carry in my antlers..."	1
good fence for the money	1
easy and works well	1
great	1
perfect fit	1
worked great! Cut like butter right out of the box	1
Fits perfect on my chain saw	1
This Flowtron BK-15D electric bug zapper arrived as pictured. It feels pretty sturdy and was super easy to set up. I opened and installed the mosquito attractant pack and then plugged it in. That is really all there is to it  The power cord on this bug zapper is very short and will require an extension cord regardless of where you place the unit.  The attractant pack doesn't really seem to do all that much, but I do hear the occasional zap as an insect arcs across the electric grid. The unit makes a very faint buzzing sound that is only audible from a couple feet away. This has not been a problem in our case.  I would suggest hanging this bug zapper away from your doors and windows as it draws insects toward it. I hung our zapper from a tree about 30 feet from the door and it seems to be doing well there.  I have not had any noticable decrease in mosquitos on our property, but I do occasionally hear it zapping, so I know it is working as it should. There are mosquito attractants that produce CO2 to draw them in. I may have to give them a try as this just isn't as effective as I had hoped.  Overall, this is a great quality bug zapper that I would highly recommend. Even though this hasn't done exactly what I wanted it to, it is definitely reducing the bug population around our property. I have had no probelms with this product other than the ineffectiveness of the mosquito attractant, if anythingthing changes I will update this review accordingly.	1
It worked really well during the Chicago summer.	1
It looked flimsy when I first opened the package, but it's really hard to tear.	1
Used it to reinforce wire fencing, that the deer were jumping through.  Worked!	1
NOT DEER FENCING!!  This is awful, it is 'bird fencing'!  Besides being impossible to work with, deer (or even bunnies) would walk right through it!  However, it will tangle a human trying to work with it.  Don't waste your $$.	-1
Having owned the larger 22 one for a long time I wanted to have a smaller one that I could use when grilling just for me and this is perfect.  In fact assembly is a breeze took minutes to put together.  Im able to use less charcoal with a little less depth between the charcoal grate and the grillling surface I can get away with 12-16 briquettes rather than 25-30 built into a hefty mound and it is small enough and light enough to allow it to be easily transported.  The only flaw is the grilling rack doesnt have any handle to lift it on and off but it is minor.	1
My husband is very excited that he can give me an empty package of the items he wants, and I can find them online. These are exactly what he needed at a value price.	1
Oregon is the best brand and Amazon has the best price.	1
Good product	1
This Scotts 2000-20 20-Inch Classic Push Reel Lawn Mower is very good. Easy to use good for environment, only needs adjust the knife for good cut.	1
Unfortunately this deer fencing was a disappointment. Almost invisible - hard to handle. expectations lead to disappointments :(	-1
LOVE it! Boy does it ever work! The bugs, especially mosquitoes, have just been awful this summer here in central Texas and this has rfeally helped.	1
Nice little Weber for storing in your RV. I always prefer to use a personal grill rather than cook on campground fixed grills.	1
it worked!	1
I tot this for my wife's chain saw.  She likes it.	1
very good chains to use. AAA+++	1
Need I say more, it's a Weber cover for the grill it fits. Impossible to find at the local stores.	1
Used a cheaper cover last year, blew away, and ripped several places due to high winds in our area.  This cover secures with velcro, so, no blow away this year so far.  Well worth the extra dollars, as I feel this cover will last more than a year or two.	1
I was a little amazed on how inexpensive this product was compared the plastic mesh netting I have used in the past but now I why, it's because it is very thin in comparison and I doubt if it will last.  Ended up returning it...	-1
Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds. One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.	1
Easy to assemble and works great.	1

great	1
I bought the weber gas grill and I had one before that after several years had started to crack and fall apart.  This cover held up longer than I expected and I looked quite a while to find a replacement one and finally found one online.  I am very happy with this cover.	1
High-quality, sturdy, with a vent that allows any water than gets underneath it to dry. Well-made alternative to the cheapies.	1
I'll start with what's good about the Scott 2000-20: it's lightweight and easy to push (I'm 51, female, and if I can push this thing so can you).  My lawn is fairly level and it leaves it with a nice even cut.  I love not having to maintain a gas mower and it's nice to mow without having fuel exhaust in my face.  I can mow early, when it's cool, without disturbing my neighbors.  All in all, I'm pleased with the performance.  The drawbacks apply to any reel mower, and they are somewhat significant.  Prepare to make a time investment in your lawn if you use a reel mower.  They don't handle long grass well and this means constant grooming of your lawn, at least a couple of times during the week depending on the season. When the grass is short it breezes through it, so while it isn't a huge chore it is time consuming, especially in the heat of summer. When the grass is long, this thing is a pain to use so constant grooming is essential. As others have noted, I do sections throughout the week but not everyone has the time or inclination to be constantly mowing their lawns.  As others have also noted, it does not mow weeds - at all - so you either have to stoop to pull them out or leave a very raggedy-looking yard behind. I haven't used it yet in the fall, but that's when I'll probably switch back to the gas mower as I'm not inclined to rake up every single leaf in my yard so I can use this.  So---it is what it is.  Before you buy it weigh the benefits vs the not-so-great aspects and decide if this fits your lifestyle.	1
More effective than smaller units because it has a brighter warmer UV lamp inside. Place it in a shaded area and you will get bugs zapped constantly. One in a porch area or 2 in a barn. You will control the buggers.	1
This is clearly not deer netting, maybe birds will fly in a die in it.  Way too flimsy to be deer netting, not even close.	-1
Works great deer can't eat my trees	1
Used it for the first time today.  Perfect size for us. We were able to place 5 large burgers on the grill with no problem.  Could have squeezed in more.	1
Good little grill at an unbeatable price.	1
just right for two	1
When you get into the world of Webers, you know you are serious about your Barbequing tools. I recently purchased a Weber Genesis Platinum C, and with such an investment, decided to purchase a cover to go with it.  The Cover fit perfectly without any adjustments, looks great, and is made of a strong, heavy material. Pulling the cover on and off is simple, and it looks like it will do a great job of keeping my Weber shiny for years to come.	1
The cover has a mesh strip in the front and back. I'm not sure what they are for but if your grill sits out in the open, the mesh allows water, dust and whatever to get inside the cover. One of the reasons I bought the Genesis Gold B was because of the enclosed area under the grill. The first rain came right thru the mesh and everything inside the enclosed area was soaked. The same thing with dust. I'm trying duct tape over the mesh areas. If this will not work, it will be new cover time! Very dissapointed with the cover but the grill is great!	-1
Don't buy this for the WORX chainsaw. This 16" chain has a different length than all three I have purchase, matter of fact, NOT ONE of the three is identical to the other, and NONE fit the WORX 16" chainsaw. Time to learn how to sharpen a chain!	-1
Fantastic product; delivered faster than expected	1
Wipes out a lot of pesty bugs	1
They work great and are perfect if your bee guards break. I had to buy them because the woodpeckers took and broke the ones from the feeder.	1
I love these guards.  I had some pesky yellow jackets that were being quite aggressive with the hummers.  I popped these on and the yellow jackets finally gave up!	1
I didn't notice if they had a gage on the plastic, so when I got it, I found it to be way too thin!	-1
Does it fit wonderfully?  Yes.  Does it velcro together well?  Yes.  Can you accidently leave the cover touching the grill and cook dinner, and it not burn?  Yes.  I did manage to grill hambugers and veggies, and part of my cover was touching the hot grill, and it survived no worse for the wear.  I am glad I shelled out for the perfectly fitting cover!	1
Great camping grill. Weber quality and easy to assemble.	1
These valves seem pretty sturdy. The cheap plastic orbit valves I used to buy would wear out pretty fast when exposed to sunlight.  UPDATE: May 2014 All these valves seem to have stopped working at the same time. Tried replacing diaphragms and switching solenoids. Additionally, the valves will not turn on manually. If I find the valves are not the problem I will reedit this review. Until then, I recommend you stay away from these.	-1
These valves work great! They reduce my 100+PSI water supply down to 15-25 PSI, and are fully adjustable. I initially bought three, and after installing them, bought three more! The quality and durability are great, I highly recommend this product.	1
Super zapper works great	1
WISH YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY MORE CARTRIDGES	1
Works Just Fine = This thing is sizzlin bugs all night	1
great product	1
Great price and great delivery - installed on my craftsman and I'm cutting wood again	1
This product performed as described	1
Exactly what I needed. Can replace the ones I am cleaning and can get the Hummingbird feeder out for the birds quickly.	1
These were delivered quickly and were the exact replacement parts I needed.	1
Flimsy but it does the job. You get what you pay for.	1
nice like it	1
flimsy, single use only tears in the wind. Look for something stronger, waste of money and time to set up.	-1
Last year the bees and wasps chased the hummingbirds away from the feeder.  This year only the hummingbirds can get to the nectar!  No more bees or wasps!	1
I lose bee guards every year because of squirrels and raccoons.  I can never find these in the stores near my house, so I was so glad to find them online!  These are great and perfect replacements.	1
they work	1
As described.  Fits our Perky-Pet feeder fine.	1
Bees cannot see the color red - whatever about red flowers attracts them, it isn't the color. But they can see orange and yellow, and they swarm the feeders with these yellow guards on much more than my all-red feeder.  Maybe decades ago this color issue wasn't known, hence a tradition of cheery yellow bee guards developed, but come on, Perky-Pet -- get with it. Red or colorless bee guards make a lot more sense. btw, if you have woodpeckers or flickers that like to guzzle from the feeders, they can sometimes crack parts of the guards, letting bees get in anyhow.	-1
weber rules	1
Same as the old days...does good job, good coverage.	1
Fits my Remington model #111174-01 electric chainsaw perfectly!	1
Great price & timely shipping. Easily replaced old chain & fit as required. ready to tackle brush piles when weather cools off.	1
the S56 fits my two Remington Electric 16" chain saws (Model RM1632A) like a glove. No Remington saws were listed on the chain saw label - but found it matched on company's website  oregonproducts.com	1
Timely delivery ... packaged appropriately ... product as described ... very satisfied customer	1
I bought this mower over a year ago and here are my experiences:  If the blades are sharpened and adjusted correctly, this mower is almost fun to mow with.  With a gas mower I would wait till once a week or two then mow everything that needed mowing in one big operation, with the reel mower I mow different sections of the yard every 3-4 days as there is no preparation necessary, (gassing, oiling, cleaning filters, making special trips to fill the gas can, cleaning the carburetor,none of that- just grab the mower and push. It just makes a nice soft whirring noise and I can cut whenever I want, even at the crack of dawn on Sunday or late at night.  The main difference I see between a reel mower and a gas mower is that the gas mower creates air suction and pulls up grass that is lying flat and cuts everything the same size. It also sucks stuff off the ground and chops it up too (leaves,sticks,grasshoppers) so there is the composting effect.  The reel mower will miss some weeds and long grass, also does not work well with very thin grass. The reel mower cuts by using the revolving sharp tines to push grass against a metal bar and shearing it off. Thinner grasses and weeds sometimes are just pushed to the side or down instead of getting cut. I like the clover and wildflowers so this is not a problem for me.  If you are obsessive about having everything perfectly sheared at the same height, a reel mower is probably not a good idea unless you have a monoculture lawn of wide bladed grass.  If anything, having a reel mower and a gas mower would probably be the best for someone with a large lawn or grassy areas. Mow a few times a year with the gas mower to clear and compost, then maintain with the reel mower.	1
I bought this lawnmower used locally for a fifth of the new price. When I got home it was dark, but I wanted to test it out anyway. With just the light from my front porch, I walked straight through the middle of my yard and left a clear cut line behind me. It was so much fun, effortlessly mowing, silently, and without gas / electricity, that I just finished my whole front yard in 10 minutes. Why any other type of lawnmower was invented after this simple design is beyond me - this is absolutely perfect. The only maintenance I can foresee is that one day I might have to sharpen the blades. BIG DEAL!	1
Replacement each year beats trying to clean them!	1
good	1
A+++	1
I live on the grill for my summer eat outs. saves electric.	1
Provided you're not grilling for a crowd, this has everything you will ever need.  Why, for small grilling sessions,  buy these $300+ propane grills with all the associated maintenance, danger and complexity?  It defies reason.  This small grill makes cooking virtually impossible to screw up provided you keep an eye on it.  My suggestion:  use briquettes ignited with a combination of mesquite or hickory chips and newspaper.  You will have long enough to grill the equivalent of any propane grill.  It will just take a little longer......	1
great product, fantacestic price	1
Tears easily, but the problem I had with it most was that dragonflies get stuck in the fence among other things. If used for small livestock (like chickens), they don't seem to be able to see it so they run into it and freak out. Almost impossible to untangle it from itself and re-use.	-1
Oregon always make great chains	1
Good lo rice works well will buy again! !	1
Nothing is better than a sharp saw. These Oregon chains are a good option and even after a couple sharpenings, still going strong.	1
Quality product and great service.	1
Great item at a great price/	1
thank you	1
Great	1
Good. As shown!	1
I purchased this item so that I could do some grilling for myself and my girlfriend.  Easy to put together, well made, instructions are clear and the grilling guide is a great addition. You will be a pro in no time.  Word of advice: The two vents are riveted on. Make sure you move them back and forth to loosen them before you use the grill, especially the bottom one.  Enjoy!	1
ty	1
It was a nice product. I also recommend it to other people.	1
They fit the feeders and replace some older ones that have gotten broken or just fallen out.	1
These fit perfectly for this smaller feeder, now if I can just keep the squirrels from trying to eat them again.	1
What can you say it kills and goes on killing.	1
A baby Weber ? NOOOOOOOOO ! It's a WEBER. I originally bought this to pimp  out a Brinkman ... But, this is a high quality grill for 2. It does almost  everything the big Weber does.  But, it's smaller...  I can roast a whole chicken in it but, The chicken needs to be split in half. This is a great small grill ... Perfect for camping, tailgating, and for a family of 2.	1
Perfect !! Just what you need to make your work easier !!	1
Just what I needed for my Poulan chainsaw!  Cuts way better!  Thanks!	1
Fit my Craftsman 16" chainsaw perfectly	1
Work just fine.	1
Glad they finally figured out that sometimes things need to be replaced- this was a needed item	1
Gotta have them or the bee's corrode the hummer's food.  The guards get brittle and break after a while and need to be replaced. These work for that.	1
It is nice to have bee guards on my hummingbird feeder.	1
Works great in my backyard.	1
Fit my 12 year old electric chainsaw, so I am happy	1
Great price and quality	1
Yet another fantastic chain that fits, cuts and sharpens like the best.  I recommend Oregon for all chain replacement needs.	1
great idea	1
Fits my old perky pets cinch feeders for hummingbirds without a problem.	1
Love the new design.  They are a bit hard to open, but it is so nice to be able to scrub the mildew from the insides!	1
This netting is dangerous to wild life and humans. It is so lightweight, it can not be seen. Birds have become trapped in it. Dragonflies got trapped in it. A gopher snake got trapped. It is so fine it is easy to enter and get stuck and impossible to see. I myself have tripped on it, hurting myself. It is terribly thin and due to that reason, it is very unsafe.	-1
great netting	1
very thin material, not very sturdy.	-1
These work great and the best thing is that they open up to clean.  The old ones don't do that and they help keep the bees away from the nectar.	1
AS ADVERTISED	1
I love these as it just makes replacing the feeder pieces so easy, rather then trying to clean them.	1
Don't fit	-1
Sometime the mildew in the guard is tough to clean out.  Nice to just replace it.	1
Forget it ~~~waste of time(Tell it to the Bees)	-1
Works perfectly, worth the money	1
Everybug is drawn to this	1
It has zapped hundreds of flies, gnats, moths and who knows what else this summer.  We don't have mosquitoes here in the desert, or it would most likely do a number on them, too.  Very pleased!  I also got the indoor Aspectek 20W zapper and put it by the back sliding door, so it got anything the outside one didn't.  We've had a very pleasant bug-free spring, summer and fall.	1
Perfect replacement for my craftsman.	1
Fits the chainsaw bar and gear fine.  Works well.	1
Best chains ever	1
good product	1
Little thinner than I wanted but it's OK	1
good product and good services Thanks	1
A Chinese factory worker forgot to weld on one of the two support pegs that hold the handle to the mower head. Despite a gaping hole where the peg should have been, they went ahead and dipped it in paint and sent it out. Quality control is apparently left to the end user of the product.  Unfortunately for me, I bought it just before moving and by the time I got to assembling the mower, Amazon's timeframe for returns had passed. Amazon was nice enough to give me something for the pain. Scotts is sending the entire side plate of the mower for me to replace after I disassemble the entire head.  So, again, whatever you buy that comes from China make sure you check it out COMPLETELY as soon as you get it. But then, you knew that. You're much smarter than I am!  Added Note: The box it came in had 'Made in China' written on it. I had to become quite familiar with the owner's manual since it required several iterations to get the right part.  I gave the consumer hotline the 'Key No.', 'Part Description', and 'Part No.' from the owner's manual. A week or so later the wrong part arrived. The part looked like it had been taken off a new machine (unused but assembled). After calling again, another week or so later the correct part came (again it appeared unused but had been assembled on an existing machine).  Replacing the side plate was a bit more involved than I cared for. Once reassembled it required iteration after iteration to get the Reel Assembly (blades) accurately cutting against the Cutter Bar.  I called the company about returning the defective and the wrong part but they weren't interested -- more indication they don't make them here.  Actually cutting grass with the mower I quickly realized that unlike a rotary mower which cuts up to or beyond the wheels, the cutting path for this mower is about two inches in from where you see the wheel path. With a rotary mower you could follow the wheel path for your next pass but not with this mower.  If the grass is high enough, you can see where to cut. But you really don't want to manually cut tall grass with this. If the grass is shorter or sparse, you have a problem seeing where you've cut. So, you have to overlap a fair amount and end up with an effective path well less than 20 inches (more like about 16).	-1
Works...easy to clean.	1
These fit just fine on my feeder.	1
Over time these seem to wear out -- especially if you clean them regularly.  They are suitable replacements and keep the wasps/bees away from the feeders.	1
If you don't stay on top of cleaning these, say you let it go a year without cleaning, they get so bad that nothing will remove the grime and mold. Buying this set of replacements is an inexpensive way to bring your feeder back to like new, and no doubt better for the birds. I honestly don't think a bee guard is even really a necessity in our area, but the feeder looks better with them in place. :) I only wish I could buy them in a slightly larger pack at a reduced price, since we have three of these feeders!  All that said, these replacement guards are 30% the price of an entire new feeder, so looking at it that way, it sounds a little steep. But still saves money over buying a new feeder.	1
Have had 2 of these on all summer and they have done a good job with zapping the bugs. The downside is that it's hard to get at the dead bugs that are stuck all over the grid, to clean them off.	1
it is what it is	1
good	1
Factory packaging, nice and sharp	1
I've been using this mower for a month now, and it's been working great. I wish I discovered it years ago, it's so much more fun and enjoyable compared to gas push mowers. As long as the blade is set at the right level, there's no problems and it cuts well. (Rotary mowers cut a bit better, but if you're not a perfectionist, this works fine). Or you can go back over some areas twice - which is only necessary if the grass is really thick. I've sold my gas mower now, no need for it with this reel mower and an electric corded rotary mower for really tall grass.	1
I received this grill in time for the 4th. of July.  It cooked the pork steaks and burgers just fine. My carry bag and chimney starter will be here tomorrow.  I will be a mobile grilling maniac.	1
They fit somehow loose in my old Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder. But if the original ones were any better, I wouldn't need to buy these replacements. So I glued them with hot glue. God help me when I'll have to clean them! But the good thing is that they have "hinges" and open and close, making the cleaning easier (I hope)	1
These work!  Neither bees or small woodpecker can get passed these caps!	1
good	1
Did not fit my feeder.	-1
This did not work well to keep the deer out (I put up an electric fence).  It did, however, work well to keep the birds from eating my blueberries when I draped it over the bushes.  It is light and easy to manage.	1
Perfect replacements for those bee guards that are falling apart.	1
These were not the size that I expected.  Amazon used to sell a size for my tiny feeders, but no more.  I have several of the tiny size, and no source of replacement bee guards.	-1
They work & fit my hummingbird feeders beautifully	1
We'd been having a problem with moths in our backyard to the extent that every time we opened the slider, at least 1 would fly into the house & these weren't little white ones.. they were large brown beasts.  So gross & "dispatching" them when they flew in wasn't a pleasant chore.  It was getting out of hand and reducing the time we were spending on the deck just because we didn't want to open the door so I came to Amazon to seek out a solution.  I found this Flowtron & decided it was worth the investment to try to reclaim our outdoor living space.... and it worked!  Hubby & I were both amazed.  I ran this overnight and cleaned it out daily & in just a few days, there was a significant decrease in the moth population.  It was a rough time in New England for moths and many areas had trees without leaves due to their destruction.  We live in a wooded area and we didn't see any damage.  We know this made an impact and is now a must-have for our home.	1
Holy crap this thing is awesome! It was worth every penny. It works so good I still jump every time it zaps a bug.. which is constantly.	1
This thing does the trick.	1
We have 2 acres, and worked great !	1
good price	1
perfect	1
Excellent quality at a superb price.	1
Very hard to work with, I highly doubt this could keep a deer out. I use it to keep my chickens in one area, had to put up a chain link fence because there's not way this is keeping anything out.	-1
Just too flimsy to hold anything back	-1
Had to return it. It was way too thin for my needs.	-1
I have used this type of product many,many times.  It is almost invisible, which can be good or bad.  We have had a few birds and squirrels run into it, sometimes getting caught, and sometimes bouncing off (seriously!).  It is not as strong as a metal fence, of course and if you run into it while walking past with a board or something it's going to rip.  Still, at six feet tall, it provided an adequate fence for my garden that kept out the deer. I don't think it would keep the local bear out if he was determined enough, but then you never know.  It also worked as a one-use pea vine support.  It ripped when I pulled the weeds I should never have allowed to get that big.  As an affordable, easy-to-use way to fence things, it's very good.  i will be using more this week, because my daughter's puppy has decided to use the soft dirt near my rhubarb plants to dig to China.  He is easily discouraged, so I think four posts and a length of this netting will do the job.  The affordable price certainly helped, as we have been moving into a new house (to us) and there are a lot of expenses.	1
The humming birds were happy!	1
Needed some for replacements for missing guards on older feeder.  Works well.	1
Super Product - Great Price - Fast Ship!	1
Replacement for old worn out bee guards.  New design is wonderful	1
Very good quality.	1
Worked as described.	1
Great	1
We live in an area with a LOT of mosquitoes.  I mean, a LOT!!  This bug light helps.  It functions even better when you use mosquito attractant, but the light itself did help.  It has shorted out a couple of times, causing the safety button on the outlet to pop, but when we checked, both times a small tree frog had gotten into the light and committed frog suicide by electrocution.  Other than that, it has worked quite well, without significant buzzing noises or flickers.  It seems more like a porch light than a bug zapper.  I do recommend the mosquito attractant, though.	1
Instructions on how to use bait are terrible. Not sure if I have it on there right or not...  Tons of bugs flying around that never come  to get zapped.  No way this covers 1.5 acres.	-1
keeps the animals out, and its thin enough that its hard to see and works well with a flower garden	1
Not  durable at all	-1
Not really anything to say with the exception that It works as intended with the hummingbird feeder. Can be a bit of a pain to clean up.	1
Perfect	1
love it been bug free summer  90% inprovment	1
Nice buy for this item !!! 5 Stars  Dennis PA.	1
fits and works great on my craftsman saw	1
Sharp! These blades definitely hogs through the wood and the price is nice: about $7 less than Stihl blades.	1
good price and worked as it should  UncleD oked	1
These chains are excellent for my Husqvarna 316 electric chain saw.  They cut fast.  They do not come in the package pictured on Amazon, but they are the equivalent chains.  ISE Forest Garden gets bulk lengths of chain from Oregon itself and cuts them to order.  At first I did not receive a complete and correct order.  ISE Forest Garden did more than enough to make it right.	1
Sturdier than the original bee guards, harder plastic, and they stay on.	1
We built our home in a rural area 14 years ago, and are lucky to have hummingbirds in our back yard.  So getting them to come to a feeder has been a breeze.  They're highly entertaining, and making nectar is a lot easier than messing with bird seed!  From the start, I put a hanging feeder in the front yard on a shepherd's hook. On the patio window, I placed a Perky Pet Window Mount feeder.  From the living room, I can see both feeders.  There's almost always someone at one or the other, sometimes both.  Hummer fans will surely understand how special this is.  The reason I bought Perky Pet is because locally, that's what every store carries.  This is the only window mount feeder available in the brick and mortar stores.  It's a frustrating product though.  I've never had a problem with the suction cup.  I've had petals blow off, but the hummers don't mind that.  The problem is the prongs on the back of the reservoir.  Sometime, they're going to break.  I've had them break on first filling and fiftieth filling, and even if I can get the well to stay on the reservoir for awhile, eventually it slides off.  I only mount one of these at a time, and have bought as many as 3 in a season.  I've also had them last more than one season but never more than two.  The hummers get frustrated if the food disappears.  They chase us around!  I've emailed Perky Pet about this issue, which they acknowledge.  That's been a couple years ago, and I bought a new one this spring, because last year's broke.  Well, two weeks ago, a prong broke off, and I know I'm on borrowed time.  I will not buy another of these, since the problem hasn't been resolved.  I'll look for a window feeder by another manufacturer.  This is the only Perky Pet feeder I've had a problem with, and I would not recommend it.  I know I've bought at least 20 of these, and every single one has broken.  I've only bought two for the shepherd's hook!	-1
For something so lightweight, it works very well to deter birds from eating the fruits on the tree.  The netting is so thin and see through that it doesn't get in the way of watering and checking for growth.  I also like the long yardage which made it easy to wrap around the tree to get a complete coverage.  Will definitely buy again	1
Works well laid over my shrubs to stop the deer from nibbling on fresh growth. The best part is it is not visible from a distance. You can still enjoy the plantings. I also used it flat on the ground to protect recently seeded areas from chipmunks. They get caught in the mesh and leave the area alone after a few tries. For the price this is an excellent and flexible deterrent.	1
Works great.	1
hasnt been used, but used this brand and liked i so I think it will be fine	1
Great grill, can't beat it for the price !!!	1
We like it. Bugs do too..till it zaps them. Requires attractant though to be really effective	1
A real bug killer for sure. Wish it would have automatic turn off and on light sensing.	1
I bought this to place in my yard and kill mosquitoes and flying outdoor roaches. This thing works great!  Love hearing the crackling sound at night. There's already a pile of bug carcasses under it and I've only had it on a couple days. Make sure you place it away from your house, deck, etc so it draws the bugs away from you.	1
Always good to have a spare.	1
No problems	1
MAKE SURE THESE FIT YOUR "MODEL" OF "PERKY PET" FEEDER!  WASTE of $$!!! Perky Pet needs to come up with a standard- I have 7 different styles of feeders but these don't fit ANY!!!  Furthermore you can't find a model number on the feeders if you've removed the packaging and paper - in other words if you have used them. I am going to have to toss a few in the recycling bin and buy only feeders with bee guards. VERY DISAPPOINTED.	-1
I would love it, but these are a pain in the butt to clean.  Even if you buy the little brush, they're not easy to clean.  So I have to buy new ones every year or so to replace the gunky old ones.  These are the best bee guards available for most hummingbird feeders though...only the tiny wild bees are able to get in.	1
Husband bought said works great	1
Great product at rigth price	1
Repair Clinic and E-Replacement Parts.com have GREAT parts! Amazon has parts in bulk. Set the lo mixture for highest RPM's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM's at full- throttle. Set the idle until the chain just stops.	1
good	1
Specs say it will fit 16 inch chainsaw including Remington m30016 aw.  I took a while to get to the job but after much trying it would not fit.  Compared with the old chain I was trying to replace one can see that the one I bought is smaller- too small to fit. I wasted the purchase price.  I waited too long to return it so I'm disappointed in Oregon.	-1
ok	1
killer of beasts!	1
Kills them dead. Big or small this thing torches all flying critter and keeps the number down on the farm yard.	1
Works for keeping deer out...	1
My order arrived on time and in good condition.  Very pleased with the purchase.	1
Works great for keeping dear out of the garden.  Yes they could push through it but they feel restiance and turn away.  Also good for row covers over seedlings.	1
good product - now, if only you could make them raccoon proof.	1
Fits my hummingbird feeder perfectly.	1
We love these pruners so much that we bought more!  The pointy blades make them great for deadheading roses and other flowers.  They feel great in your hand.  The are fine quality.	1
These are very nice pruners, and so handy that my husband and I decided we should order an extra pair or two.  We already have two, but we are avid gardeners.  These are great for deadheading roses.  Corona products are a joy to use.	1
fast shipping, worked on my Remington saw	1
I have a 16 " Poulan chain saw. The chain was sharpened so many times it was starting to do a bad job of cutting.  I thought it was time for a new saw. I stuck this new chain on and WOW. It's like cutting softy butter. I'm happy.	1
Said on package in the ad that it would fit a Remington saw but when it got here the Remington part was missing and it didn't fit.	-1
This little grill is terrific. It does an excellent job when we are out camping. Much to our chagrin a lot of places in California have a NO COALS policy so this kind of put a damper on our grilling. Doesn't take up a lot of space and cleans up well. Do not waste your money on the carry case though. The grill doesn't fit well in that.	1
Awesome. Very hard to be Weber quality.	1
great for replacement guards.	1
great replacement.  Worked well. They are for the hummingbird feeder	1
product didn't fit feeder; product was not as pictured online	-1
These are nice to have on hand.	1
Does the job perfectly! And there's lots of net to cover a big area!  Kept out the birds and frogs from my pond!	1
This thing really zaps. Larger bugs will even catch on fire as the Flowtron incinerates their carcasses. I've noticed fewer flying bugs and mosquitoes in my garage. It comes with a scent lure too which is nice.	1
Killing bugs all night long.	1
This thing produces alot of dead moths and similar flying bugs, but really no mosquitos.  Since I purchased this primarily for mosquito control, I have been extremely disappointed.  I really don't mind all these other flying bugs.  We have the so called Tiger mosquitos here, and the Octenol lure doesn't work against them.  Really you need Lurex3, but I can't find those designed for bug zappers like this.  They make them for the Mosquito Magnet contraptions, so I'm out of luck.  Probably all the reviews in here praising this product's efficacy against mosquitos are either exaggerations or they're from a geographic locations where Octenol lures are more effective.  So if you live in the Southern US with the nasty Tiger mosquitos (including North Texas), don't believe these reviews too much.  I suppose I have to go back to spraying myself with Off.	-1
I have about six-thousand square feet of lawn.  This mower handles it quite well.  There's some effort to push it, but it's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower; for example, the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space.  It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.  I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.	1
I have a flat yard, that is small and takes less then 45 minutes to mow with a reel mower.  The lever** on one side snapped. (**That you use to change the height.  I'm strong, but not that strong.)  The right back wheel was defective and so was the metal plate that it was mounted to, neighbor tried to figure out a way to jimmie and correct but it wasn't possible so eventually it rubbed metal to metal and the wheel fell off.  Mowing with three wheels but the cut is wonky and my lawn looks like a drunken sailer's buzz cut.  Nuts wobbled off while mowing, lost them before I bought the blue stuff to keep them in place.  I know my way around a tool box--my neighbor borrowed it and said he tightened the ones that wobbled off on him and the next time I mowed they started to wobble off too.  So, in case you think it's a gender thing, it's not.  He commented that he didn't think the mower was very durable.  Sadly the thing didn't make it to it's second month's birthday.  I had borrowed a neighbor's reel mower and that thing was a tank! This mower is the Yugo of the Reel Mower world.	-1
Big improvement on the previous guards. These can be opened and cleaned.	1
Better than the original guards they replaced, which did not stay on the feeder so well, and got lost or broken easily.	1
Just like the old days, really works great.	1
Just as advertised	1
Nice shears. Sharp, well made and easy on my hands. Perfect for trimming indoor plants and spent blossoms in the garden.	1
Excellent quality, professional grade.	1
I am very happy with these shears, I use them to trim my miniature horses hooves.  Most farriers tools are made for large hooves & are hard to manage for little hooves.  These are great, they cut through both my horses hooves very well & one of my mini's has very hard hooves! I am so happy to have found these!	1
great for tailgating!	1
WORKS OK	1
Living lakefront in Florida bring the flying bugs at dusk and early evening hours, particularly in certain times of the year -- and this bug zapper does a remarkable job of controlling them!  In a very short time it has proven to be a very good purchase for us!  I highly recommend this product.	1
I put this out close to our 1/2 acre pond.  Runs all night, Dusk to Dawn.  mosquito population is definitely down.  Works with the bait.  But works very well without the bait.	1
been working well since i installed it the day it arrived.	1
Does the job and very straightforward.	1
This is a great fence for a great price.  Just be mindful because it can get tangled during installation.	1
Awesome!	1
We actually purchased this as an extra layer of protection for our duck pen. We had already covered the pen in 1inch chicken wire, however we wanted something with a smaller opening to deter snakes.  This stuff works really well. It's much sturdier than I would have guessed and we were able to wrap the entire pen with it to give it an extra barrier against snakes and other predators. I would not recommend it on it's own as a 'fencing' because it wouldn't hold up against dogs and raccoons, but it will keep out snakes and probably birds.  My only issue was that it was folded in half and then rolled, so you have to struggle with it a bit to get the full seven foot height out of the roll.  It would have just been easier if it would have come as it's seven foot roll or had been rolled, then folded so we could have unrolled it easier.	1
it works and is cheap enough to protect my garden on my farm	1
works to keep chickens from scratching my seedlings	1
didn't fit into my humming bird feeders	-1
perfect for replacment	1
Super quality and comfortable to work with	1
Ease of use and slim design make them my go-to shears for thinning out most anything in my garden from miniature roses to herbs.  Own other Corona tools so I am rather partial to the brand.  Went through three pairs of shears bearing a different brand name in less than a year.  So for the price and quality, this is a real bargain.  And like any other tool that is used outdoors, cleaning and oiling after each use will lengthen the life.	1
Fits perfect on the Homelite electric chainsaw.	1
strong and sharp.  Perfect fit.	1
Killer! i bought two for our beach property, and haven't seen a mosquito in three months.	1
Ok for the $$... suits my needs as a fire pit insert instead of a BBQ.  If grilling was a focus I'd kick in for the next step up which has better venting.	1
good	1
great for keeping birds out of my boat house	1
Fit the old feeder perfectly even though they are a bit different shape than before .  Just what I needed so I ordered 2 packs as they have changed the new feeder and I might not find these next summer when needed.  They only seem to last one season and then crack- maybe from the sun and heat.  The hummers love that feeder so don't want to change to a newer model.	1
different than old ones easier to clean	1
I have the new Perky Pet 203CPBN hummingbird feeder. These bee guards are identical to the ones that came on the feeder. They are the roundish/domed ones. I got mine from Olde Towne Hardware. They were very helpful.	1
These are the best shears for light trimming that I have found.  Great for trimming rose bushes and other plants.	1
These work very well, however that little hook for locking closed is not designed with use in mind.. it's too tight a fit and can not be done easily with gloves.  Solution, open up the loop with a pair of needle nose pliers, it'll be a little sloppy. but so much easier.	1
I have several Corona pruners, I really like their products, I think they are reasonably priced for their quality.  These are my favorites, great for pruning rose canes.  These and the finer thinning pruners are really great.  As with any garden tools these perform well for a long time if they are cleaned, sharpened and oiled.	1
I've used these to prune much larger branches than I think they're probably intended for.  It's difficult to say what the maximum thickness branches they are intended for because the documentation on the package gives no such guidance.  Nonetheless, they are holding up very well even when I should probably look for my loppers but when I'm too lazy to do that, "just for this one branch."  I just use a sort of twisting, "sawing" motion to get the branch down to size a bit before I execute the actual cut.  The blades are easy to lock closed with one hand so you can stick them in your pocket and not get stabbed after you forget they're in your pocket.  Keep the blades sharp and clean the blades with a wet rag, then with a dry rag, and finally wipe with an oily rag after each use and I think you will be glad to have these for a very long time!	1
I wanted a small charcoal grill to use while living temporarily in an apartment out-of-state for the next 7 months.  Since I do not plan to keep it when I have to return home I wanted something inexpensive.  After considering an inexpensive Hibachi grill, none of which had very good reviews on Amazon, I came across this little Weber kettle grill.  I have two full-sized Weber kettle grills at my house that I love and use all of the time, so this little Smokey Joe version seemed like a perfect and inexpensive choice for my apartment.  The grill arrives disassembled in a compact box.  Assembly is quick and easy.  A Phillips head screwdriver is the only tool needed for assembly.  Once assembled, the grill sits quite low to the ground but works pretty much like the larger Weber charcoal kettle grills.  There are vents on the top and bottom of the kettle to adjust heat, and a shallow ash catcher sits below the bottom vent.  The ash catcher is not removable, though, so dumping ashes is awkward.  For such a small, inexpensive grill the actual grilling surface (14 inches) is quite large and can easily grill several steaks or burgers all at once.  This Weber Smokey Joe grill is perfect for use on a small apartment balcony or deck.  It is small enough that it could be easily taken camping or for use at a tailgate party.  For the money it really cannot be beat.	1
OK	1
good quality	1
Just as described and work perfectly!	1
I'm going to buy more , order it twice before , good protection to my chiken coop  , captcherd 6 rat snake within a week	1
is much stronger appears. Good price and fast shipping.	1
It seems to be another way to sell garden bird netting. I am using it to keep my small (8-12lb) dogs away from an area of my yard and it works for that.	1
It really working good.	1
Zap... gotcha... sounds cool.	1
I bought two.  Very effective mosquito zapper.	1
Love these feeders and so do the hummingbirds!	1
I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did.  I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either.  This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.  It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.  So I'm back to the mower.  One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.	-1
The picture is wrong for the ones that I received, fortunately.  The ones I received were domed rather than squared off.  The big plus is the ones I received snap open so I can clean the inside the cage.  I could not do this before (with the ones pictured), thus the reason to replace them.	1
The newer dome-style hinged Bee Guards that Perky Pet has switched to is what I received.  Nice surprise as those seem to be more durable and easier to clean.  Did the trick, just wish they didn't get stolen by my dog so easily...which is why I had to buy more.	1
Once the bees come out these are the only way to give the humming birds a chance at the feeders. Other wise you are feeding the bees.	1
bought the little 3 oz feeders - these are too big check the model numbers for the feeders and the guards a bit annoying, the pic is wrong	-1
Nice grill. Best quality for the price, for sure.	1
Great little grill.  Does everything you would expect it to do.  When not cooking enough to justify the big grill this works well on 1/2 to 3/4 the amount of coals.	1
Quality chain but DOES NOT FIT Poulan PLN3516F, you will need S55 for that.	1
I bought 2 of Oregon S56 16-Inch Semi Chisel Chain Saw Chain for my 16" Homelite Range and Poulan Pro. Cuts like butter.	1
Great chain saw blade. Best I've used.	1
Nice	1
average quality	-1
I detect only a very limited affect on mosquito population.  It kills lots of moths and other flying insects but I see only a few dead mosquitos on or below the electric grid..  I don't believe this is worth the money.	-1
I got round bee guards, not square as shown.  Not what I wanted at all and they look too small to fit my feeder.	-1
They appear to be cheap made in china junk.  Hate to hear they were made in America.  Will have to check on other feeders next time.	-1
Before I even got them on my feeder one cover broke off the holder....so no bee guard on one port. They fit and the others seem to work. Had to glue the guards on the holders with Elmer's.	-1
The cord is tooooo short, you will have to buy an extra power cords. And the space in between the electronic wire is too big, the small insects can easily get away with it. I brought  the Aspectek 40w indoors electronic insect killer first, it works great so I decided to buy 2 outdoor electronic insect killer for outside .but his is nothing to compare with the Aspected 40w.	-1
Used it 2 or 3 times and then replaced it with a different type of soaker hose. The little holes got filled with debris/dirt very easily and water didn't come out.	-1
Worked good for about 2 months, then blowed. Replaced with a new bulb, and it blew the bulb. China junk.	-1
VERY WEAK AND POOR MATERIAL.  IT TORE AND RIPPED AFTER ONLY A MONTH.  NO GOOD!!!	-1
Bought this on June 16..Few days after that I installed it and it worked fine.....but just less than 2 months later it has torn by the female end!!  Up unitl then it was working great..now it is garbage!!	-1
Very light weight and cheaply constructed. It will work for about one season. If that's all you want, then go for it. If you are looking for a sprinkler hose that will last for years, this ain't it.	-1
After seeing our neighbors success with keeping deer out of their garden using the Easy Gardener 6050 DeerBlock Netting as a fence material, I decided to order two rolls for protecting our vegetables and flowers from deer on our property.  The 6050 DeerBlock Netting kept the deer out of the garden area until the deer decided that there was something worth eating on the other side of the netting. (The flowering plants were developing flower heads and some of the vegetables were getting ready to pick.) The deer went through several areas of the fence, and our garden was demolished overnight!  Easy Gardener makes two types of deer fencing that are available here on Amazon, this 6050 DeerBlock netting, and a beefier (more expensive) product: Easy Gardener LG400171 Deer Barrier Fencing (&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Easy-Gardener-LG400171-7-by-100-Foot-Deer-Barrier-Fencing/dp/B000A16T7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Easy Gardener LG400171 7-by-100-Foot Deer Barrier Fencing</a>&nbsp;) .  I ended up replacing this weaker/ less expensive 6050 DeerBlock with the stronger/ thicker LG400171 Deer Barrier as fence material. The deer have not gotten through the Deer Barrier fenced area (yet).  Used as Bird Block Our vegetable and flower gardens are planted in a combination of direct sewn seeds and transplants. The birds don't bother with the larger transplants, but they really enjoy eating some of the emerging seedlings (carrot sprouts are one of their favorites). We have had good results preventing birds from wiping out emerging seedlings by using this weaker/ less expensive 6050 DeerBlock draped over newly direct seeded garden areas.  Based on our experience, I would recommend this 6050 DeerBlock for use as Bird Netting, but not for deer protection, as it was an epic fail for keeping the deer out of our garden.	-1
Sadly, after trying different brands of charcoal briquets and using the Weber 7447 Compact Rapidfire Chimney Starter, this little guy never developed a high enough temperature to do anything but turn meat grey. So I donated it with the chimney starter. Too bad. My brother said he had used it successfully while camping. Had great hope as the large Weber we used to have made such tasty hamburgers and steak.	-1
Even though I owned a perky pet feeder, these bee guards did not fit properly and fell off.  Cannot recommend.	-1
Unfortunately, the product is not a rugged, reliable piece of equipment.  The material composing the hose itself is extremely fragile!  Not a quality you look for in a garden hose - especially where I live in the southwest desert.  The first hose I ordered sprung a leak within two days.  It was located in a protected spot, not subject to any disturbance other than sun and wind.  Why it started leaking is a complete mystery.  The seller rushed a second hose to me when I requested a replacment which was great, however, upon opening the package, I noticed the end fitting (not sure what it's called: the part that attaches to the spigot or another hose) had completely seperated from the hose end before even taking it out of the package.  Put it right back in the box and sent back for a refund.  Very disappointed!	-1
This costs three times as much as netting that is considered fragile and lightweight, yet this is fragile with a small mesh. It could easily tangle birds and frogs. I was expecting a MUCH heavier weight with wider mesh.	-1
The bait does not work well it in a location under the unit and when you sit the thing down on something it blocks the bait	-1
Product arrived on April Fools Day of 2017. The return window closed on May 1 of 2017. This is now May 8 of 2017 and I'm stuck by one week with a faulty product.  Bought this hose to help keep some new sod watered. Worked great until today when I walked by and noticed that water was spewing everywhere at the place where a regular hose was connected to the sprinkler hose. The metal part had separated from the hose part so all I was getting was a mess of water where the regular hose ended and this piece of junk began.  Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone at all.  Grrrr....not Happyashell over this one.	-1
I purchased this 2 summers ago.  One of the clips that holds the bottom on broke the first summer but I managed to jury-rig it on with just one clip.  The second clip broke the second summer and made it useless.  I tossed it.  Not recommended.	-1
These are low end sprinkler valves and not pro grade by any stretch, but I would still expect the threading to allow space for Teflon tape to wrap the end of the pipe before it is threaded into the valve body. This is not the case and it is very easy to gall the threads. Next time I will go to a commercial valve body.  These will work OK but very important to have it higher off the ground than the water lines in your house or the sprinkler lines to which it is connected. If not you will have problems and it will not be the fault of the valve.	-1
bad threads	-1
Very cheap!  Rabbits ate through in less than a week	-1
The screen inside is crooked and when looking at it I notice one side is missing a tiny screw.  Update: After using it one night there are now hundreds of bugs on my deck where before there were just a few. This seems to draw in bugs from everywhere but doesn't kill them all. I won't be using it again.	-1
After 4 of these I am done!  They keep blowing off at the outside faucet connection.  Nice Idea,  poor connectors!	-1
Very flimsy, virtually impossible to handle.	-1
Really thin, this is more like bird netting to cover bushes. Tears if you look at it funny. Bought it to help partition an indoor chicken paddock, not realizing how useless for that purpose it actually is.	-1
horrible to work with. Too thin to be useful. When it's not tangling and snagging on everything, it's ripping and tearing. Waste of money.	-1
Very cheap made Deer Block. Not the same quality as you find in the stores. It actually broken as I was unrolling it. wow	-1
Way too flimsy. Would not buy again.	-1
It has not worked so well in the heat.  Gets really hot and causes damage to the hose.  Wouldn't buy again.	-1
Not drawing insects from very far.	-1
We took it down after we found dead squirrels and other little animals ...	-1
Really thin and flimsy.	-1
put scent pad on and plugged in and ran, ran , ran...no flies or mosquitos were harmed during the operation of this "bug zapper"! for several weeks, I tried it for hours at dusk and into the night, and tried it at dawn, and for hours into the day.... nothing.. I did see bugs near it, but never drawn to the zapping grid.... either the bugs are really smart where I live, or this zapper is really crap.  Makes for a lovely (used) house warming gift to someone you don't really care for!  The "insect killer" in product name should be change to "insect friendly".  0 stars not available, so 1 star it is!	-1
I did like it while it worked. bought April 30th 2016, Put up in May, only had in on at night, and then not every night. usually when we went out to the pool at night. To my dismay in Aug 2016 it completely stopped working. My mother had a smaller model and hers worked for years. Maybe I should of went with the smaller model! Guess they just don't make things like they use to. For the price, and the brand name, I would of expected a longer lasting product. Of course it's also out of Amazon's return date time frame.	-1
Ants all over the place within an hour.... we took it down.	-1
Cheap.	-1
I purchased this standard pulley to replace one that I had accidentally broke when I was removing it. Unfortunately, this is not a standard pulley. Although not specified, the keyway notch should be 3/16" wide with a 3/32" depth. The tolerance for the keyway notch should be +.0020, -.0000 width and +.016, -.000 in depth. The pulley I received had a keyway notch that measured 5/128" too small and the key would not fit. Rather than waiting another week for a replacement, I ended up filing the notch bigger to fit.	-1
This is NOT Deer-Block netting.  It is very light weight netting, possibly effective for throwing over fruit trees to keep birds out.	-1
Thin material. Trash	-1
It worked fine for about a week and then blew itself up. iT RUPTURED AT ABOUT THE 3/4 POINT SO WE HAD TO TAKE IT ALL BACK UP AND BUY SOMETHING LOCALLY.	-1
Don't bother buying. I had one of these that I had purchased last year at a local store and it worked great.  This year I wanted another one and purchased the exact same one here. The first one I received was defective and the clear top would not fit on the base. The clips were not cut properly and it would not snap on.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement. I received it only to find that this one did not fit either.  Kudos to Amazon for trying to make it right but the product as it is produced now is defective.	-1
This product is NOT designed to keep deer out. It is far too flimsy.  I read the reviews prior to purchasing but since it had a high review I purchased it. Don't spend you money on this if your goal is to keep deer out of your garden. It MAY be good for keeping birds out. The old saying "you get what you pay for" definitely applies here.	-1
this is large bird netting, not even going to bother to put it up as im sure a strong wind would tear this cheap crap	-1
Was surprised to see the pulley was out of true by an 1/8 of an inch.  Way to far out for 3800 rpm.  Recommend researching for a good steel pulley.  Bad buy, not recommended.....	-1
the feeder was p about 20 minutes, the suction cup gave out, the feeder crashed and burned on the patio, broken beyond use	-1
Worked great the first 2 nights. The cage was full of fried bugs. I cleaned it out per the instructions with a vaccume using blower end. Now it attracts the bugs, swarms of them... But nothing seems to zap.	-1
Half empty when I received the product	-1
Was the wrong sized key, even though I used the correct part number from diagram to order it. I finally found the right sized key in my stock after having sheared these keys twice and having to remove flywheel twice to correct.  Chinese knock-off?	-1
I've purchased rolls of Deer Screen before and this was by far the weakest of all the products. Tears too easily, just isn't worth the time or the money to install. If you have to be careful installing it, then it won't stop a deer..	-1
This does not attract Mosquitos. Look it up online if a bug zapper actually attracts mosquitos. You will see it does not.	-1
I let it go the first time but this is the second time I purchased this product (the birds LOVE it!) and the base just falls off.  Very disappointing.	-1
We had put it up to keep the chickens out of the garden. It is fragile and tore easily. Also the holes were small enough for insects to get stuck! Bees couldn't figure it out. Maybe they couldn't see it well? Won't be using again.	-1
I have mowed with this mower 4 times now,  and each time I have to go back through with my weed eater to cut down the longer blades.  It gives a jagged cut that looks terrible.  It refuses to cut some blades of grass no matter how many times you try to mow it.  It's great for exercise, but bad for mowing.	-1
Very hard to work with and it tore within 24 hours.  I am very unhappy with this product.  Don't waste your money	-1
Not very strong, had it attached to posts around a evergreen with zip ties, snow and wind tore the netting	-1
I KNEW BETTER	-1
The deer block seems to be very light weight.  It was installed less than a week ago, and has already torn in several places along the shrubbery it was installed on.  I wonder how long it will take for the deer to discover ways to defeat the netting?	-1
this mower is the worst....if you want a push mower get the brill... smoooth!!!  if you have a bigger lawn: black and decker 19 inch corded electric mower..NO GAS...  I have owned all three products .  AVOID THE SCOTTS 20 INCH  its heavy, cluncky, and NOT SMOOTH	-1
to thin	-1
These aluminum keys shear off too easily.  I suspect they are not a universal-fit part as the description leads one to believe.	-1
it MAY be a good trap, but it is certainly NOT a have a heart trap. The space is SO SMALL that if the mice are caught soon after putting the trap out before bed, by morning, their fur is soaking wet (no doubt from sweating AND stress/ fear. It is small, dark, and was a big  mistake for us :- (. If you want them caught & released, choose another trap. If you want them DEAD, choose another trap. If you want them tortured, this is the trap for you! After seeing their state, my hubby put the sorrowful mice in a bucket they they couldn't get out of, added cotton and a piece of an old sweat shirt to "nest", some walnuts and a bottle cap of water. A few 2 ate & drank, one didn't even have the energy for that! They shook and suffered needlessly and died. SHADES OF A (ANIMAL) CONCENTRATION CAMP!	-1
Absolutely useless. I've used these for over a year and not a single mouse. Can't compare to standard mouse traps.	-1
disapointing, doesn't seen effective -- no pile of bugs around it, very few stuck to it :(  plenty of bugs flyin around -- very FEW attracted TO this -- HOPING to see an increase in effect,  I waited 2 days too long to return it :O now stuck w it - -YEARS ago had a garden bug killer that attracted em w a black light that was REALLY black! once the bugs got close, they were SUCKED INto the pan of dish detergent water under the light by a powerfull fan [ dish detergent eliminated surface tension so the bugs couldn't float an drowned right away ]  REALLY EFFECTIVE!  Had to clean it and refresh the mixture near every day [ FULL of bugs! ]  WISH I could find onea them toDAY ----  I'm thinkin the SAFEty features of this [ the plastic grid that prevents one from touchin the metal ZAP grid ] ALso prevents many bugs form BEING zapped :P  Back in the day, it was assumed folks would KNOW better, if they didn't, they would *learn*  NOWadays, it's assumed NOone knows and has to be protected  SAD	-1
Did not work fro me.	-1
Very flimsy. We used it around new grass, and the dog walked right through it.	-1
This is VERY THIN netting.  I tried protecting my newly planted trees from my goats. Once the goats figured out that they could tear the netting, the trees got their leaves striped. You can tear this netting with your bare hands. If you only have to worry about deer, perhaps this netting will suffice, and it's almost transparent.	-1
hummers don't like the flowers, buy one with flat flowers	-1
We have lots of mice around that get into unwanted places.  Not knowing which no-kill mice traps work best, I decided to get a couple of three different models and try them out together in different locations to evaluate effectiveness before buying more.  Over a period of a couple months I compared the Mouse Hotel, the Kness Trip-trap and the Mice Cube, setting each per the instructions and checking at least morning and evening. Of the three, the Mouse Hotel caught the most mice by far.  The mice also seemed to be the least stressed.  No mice died in the Mouse Hotel.  This appeared to be because it is the roomiest and they can move around.  It also has a bait holder which they can feed from without making a big mess.  The one problem it has is with the trip floor limiter, which is just a thin plastic tab.  It broke off on one of the traps while a mouse was inside.  The last mouse may have chewed it off but at any rate I found it broken after catching a few mice which renders the trap unusable.  This is a design weakness.  Plan for a limited lifespan of these traps.  The second most effective was the Trip-trap, but it suffers from a couple of serious shortcomings.  If you don't check it every couple of hours expect to find dead mice.  They seem to panic in these and even if found alive they are usually covered in urine, bait and appear really haggard.  The traps are so confining that the mice cant turn around.  Also, I often find this trap tripped with no mice caught.  If they brush against the legs of the door, which they often do in the dark, the trap can close with no mouse inside.  It helps to weight it so it doesnt trip so easily.  The least effective was the Mice Cube.  Not a single mouse was caught with these traps.  None would enter.	-1
Didn't catch a single mouse.  Not sure why it didn't work.	-1
Ain't caught jack yet.	-1
It keep tripping the breaker. I am all for frying insects but this takes on way too much juice	-1
never caught any mouse with these traps..... very disappointed	-1
The designer of this grill plus the cook in the test kitchen that approved it, should be fired.  The grill doesn't get hot enough to sear steaks or burgers.  I tried the foil trick mentioned in another review and that didn't help much and cut the usable searing space in half.  (The build quality seems good.)  I got my grill to burn hot after less than 30 minutes worth of modifications.  I drilled seven " diameter holes around the bottom of the grill, below the charcoal grate.  The coals got hot but a little ash fell through the holes.  A piece of foil under the legs to catch the ashes would work, but I found an old aluminum pie pan.   I drilled a hole in the center of the pie pan and mounted it to the bolt and wing-nut that holds the three legs together.  Voila, a hot fire and an ash catcher.  It even looks like a Weber kettle.  I keep the side vents closed and only use the top vent to control the heat.  If you don't want super hot coals, start with smaller holes than my " ones.	-1
I couldn't get it to work.  Bummer.	-1
I have ordered and used these feeders for probably 10 years or more. Feb 2016 I ordered a new one for the current summer. My old feeder continued to work through the summer and just broke last week. No problem! I have a back up just in time for the August swarm of hummingbirds. Got the feeder out today and guess what? It is defective. The two tiny plastic catches on the back won't engage. It is like the cylinder is too long or something.  And it is too late to send it back to Amazon saying it is defective. So I will have to eat it. NOT HAPPY. nuff said. Unhappy customer wants a new feeder free. Oh, and there was no screw to apply the rest beneath each port.	-1
Does not work.	-1
Leaks. The base is poorly designed. Leaked sweet hummer feed liquid all over porch ... Drew ants.	-1
Poor design any bait tips it and closes it.	-1
Holds four cups so I don't have to refill it often.  Actually, my hummers seem to love it more than I do as they are having turf wars over who owns it.  With the improved feeder holes, the small insects can no longer get into it.  I wrote that first paragraph shortly after filling and hanging the feeder.  I have since learned that it leaks so bad that all the food is gone in ah hour.	-1

The "ant moat" holds just a small amount of water that quickly evaporates. The plastic perch is warped and very flimsy.  Large capacity of 30oz means it will take a while to drain while its leaking. No joke. We used this last season (2014) and could not figure out why it was always empty. Upon close inspection we noticed a steady drip-drip-drip from the feeder. The feeder was allowing water to drip out of the side where the bottom and top pieces meet.  I've tried taking it apart and putting it back together using different degrees of tightness many many times. If you screw it too tightly you will strip the plastic threads so you have to be careful not to overtighten it. I tried and tried but just could not get this to reliably stop dripping.  So now it's 2015 and we put this feeder out for the first time this year. We noticed after a while that it was dripping again. I brought it back inside, drained it, took it apart, put it back together. I finally discovered that the feeder must be perfectly level to prevent dripping. If it leans just slightly off center, that will allow the nectar to flow over the containing area inside the feeder and it will leak. Since it is frequently windy where I live, the feeder tends to sway back and forth thus enabling this to leak.  It now resides at the bottom of our garbage can.	-1
love the feeder, however it broke in the back the second time I filled it.  Have now had the feeder 2 l/2 months and both prongs are gone and the feeder is usless.  Never Never buy this feeder unless you want to purchase more of them immediately.	-1
the item pictured was the 209-6. We inherently were shipped the 209B. Two different type hummy feeders. now the 209B,s top is  not conducive for proper hanging and is not as stable as the 209-6 model. Also the base is split into two separate pieces. not stable in the Wind- all the liquid drools out thus attracting sugar type pests. Terrible design if one cant keep the liquid in it. the 209-6 has a one piece design  - a little tougher to clean- But at least it holds the hummy liquid in its base holder. So for the design team at perky pets. horrible design and not very functional. We returned them . The company was very cordial . So do your Home Work and ask, call, email to make sure if you want the Better style  209-6 the pictures are Not as advertised/sales. you will be disappointed.	-1
The feeder I received was not the feeder I was told I was getting, After paying $7 for shipping, and waiting 9 days to receive it, I discover I was not sent the feeder in ALL the photos not to mention the description) but the new fangled version I stupidly bought once a few years ago and HATED. No way I'm going to pay to send this back, but I won't be using it, just like I don't use the other, because it leaks. See, it has a wide mouth and is SO easy to clean, the flower portion lifts off SO easily and you can scrub it's innards to your heart's content!! But, because it's not a tight seal a bead of sweet liquid rims the base and the bees love it, swarms of them will hang on it and drink their fill all day while the hummers go to the older, harder to clean versions. I've had the old versions for decades, they are a pain to clean, but 2 different size bottle brushes and lots of hot, soapy water accomplishes that. From now on I'm buying from Walmart, where I can see that I'm actually getting what I'm being told I'm getting!	-1
Before I could secure the base, a few rabits had gotten into the garden.  As I came out of the house, they made a run for it and I actually watched as one hit the net, was paused for a split second and then kept going.  the other rabbit just ran right through. In both cases, there were nice, rabbit-sized holes in the bottom of of the fencing.  Great concept, easy install (I pounded 10' lenghts of 1/2" conduit in every 10' or so) but buy something with more strength.	-1
This feeder was very innovative looking and it held liquid without leaking. I would suggest getting a stronger/newer suction cup for the product as the one that came with mine was a little yellow/opaque and seemed sort of like it was hanging around for a while. I decided to use it anyway since I had no other cups on hand. I cleaned the outside of my window with an all purpose cleaner and wet the suction cup with a little water. It held up for the first day, but when I came home the next it had fallen off of the window, the bottom piece (which is really two pieces) came apart at the seem and the part that attaches to the perches had cracked. On top of that, the little plastic piece that held the two clips on the back had also been broken off in the fall. I think that if you design a product that is supposed to be held on to a window that it should be a little more well built since it is likely that it will fall off at some point, and now it cannot even hold liquid as it is cracked on the bottom and the top wiggles since the back clip holder broke off...	-1
I have this same type from a different maker and when I saw this I had to have it.  Purchased some at the end of last season and this season to be ready.  Went to use them today and realized the clip that holds the bottom on to prevent all the contents from emptying, does not work.  The clip does not have any tension on it to snap it in place.  I went to check others and the same thing.  So very disappointed.	-1
Very cheaply made and does not help when mailed in plastic bag.	-1
It is amazing to see that the mouse goes in and out and thanks for a delicious meal without getting trapped. $ 7 for piece of plastic without giving any results.	-1
Before I bought it, I called Weber Customer Service in order to find out the difference between this model and the more expensive one, which has the lock-on handle at the top. I was told the lock-on type did not have ventilation-draft holes in the bottom whereas this model did. I've had a couple of the large Weber charcoal grilles and I couldn't imagine cooking without the lower vents, so I got this one.  On this model, the bottom end, where the three (flimsy) legs fasten together under the ash pan, is badly designed and comes apart repeatedly. I eventually came up with a bunch of lock washers which, if tightened after every use will most times stay together, but its still flimsy.  As for the top, I've tried various combinations of bungee cords and belts, but so far I haven't found a system that holds the top on while its being transported in a car.  So, the concept of a Junior charcoal Weber is great - a compact Weber you can tote around - but for me, it just hasn't worked out at all well.  In good faith, I can't return it to Amazon, as its been used several times, and if you don't transport it, it functions for the intended purpose. Best use is as a stay at home product.  But the flimsy bottom as it comes out of the box would aggravate any user.	-1
unless you put it in a room FULL of mice, nothing is going in here....waste of money do not buy.	-1
Cheap suction cups are the issue with this product. Either buy better suction cups on your own or buy a better feeder. Mine fell off the very clean window that on the same day I suctioned other feeders to that did not fall, only the 2 of these that I ordered ever fell off.	-1
crap	-1
Heed the other warnings.  I got this yesterday, washed it (smelled a bit of plastic), dried overnight.  Then knowing what others have said about the suction being poor, I cleaned the suction cup with rubbing alcohol to make sure it was free of any oils.  I hung it INSIDE on a clean window in 50 degree weather EMPTY.  Within 5 minutes it fell to the ground.  The suction cup fell off as well.  The clean plastic piece became detached from the red piece and cracked.  All of this under perfect conditions UNLOADED.  I can't imagine the garbage suction cup standing up to any kind of weight.  I should have known when I saw the suction cup and it's "frosted", not clear.  This might work if screwed to something but the included suction cup is garbage.	-1
We bought three of these and have baited them for 5 days. Results:  1. Every day the peanut butter is gone from all traps. 2. We have caught four mice (out of 20 tries) 3. Caught mice have eaten through two of the traps within 18 hours.  Will look for a metal trap next time.	-1
able to use it as mice can just leave after a good meal,if I ever get the end cap it might work	-1
The one I received was not red. It was brown. Very disappointed. Not worth returning.	-1
Been one year and one of the bulbs has burned out.  Only used during warm months, and I have older bug lights that bulbs are still working fine.  Would not purchase another	-1
This broke the first time I removed the water reservoir.	-1
On the positive side, this is made with a heavy-weight glass bottle that is very strong.  It all is well made.  On the negative side, the bottle has a very narrow neck, so narrow that I can't get either of my bottle brushes through the neck.  So I can't clean it inside.  The nice red base snaps together and can't be taken apart, so you can't clean the inside of the base with soap and water.  Cleaning a feeder is critically important, because bacteria grows in the sugar water you use, and it turns sour and won't attract hummingbirds.  You fight bacterial growth by boiling the feed when you mix it and by thoroughly cleaning the feeder with soap and hot water and wiping it well.  But you can't clean the inside of the bottle and you can't clean the inside of the bottom feeding tray.  I called the manufacturer and they told me they recommend cleaning the feeding tray by putting rice in water and swirling it around.  I have some black deposits inside the bottle now, and can't get rid of them, so I'm throwing out the whole thing and replacing it with a feeder from another manufacturer.  So my recommendation is that you definitely not buy this model.  Instead, buy one that's easy to clean.  Look for Amazon reviews that talk about ease of cleaning.  Incidentally, my other feeder has a plastic bottle, which I originally thought was not as good as a glass bottle.  But I've learned that it adds weight, so makes this feeder quicker to fall off if you've mounted it to a window with a suction cup mounting.  So just stay away from this feeder, which is neither the least expensive nor the best hummingbird feeder on Amazon.	-1
I was disappointed when it arrived....they sent me a different feeder than I had ordered/expected. One of the most annoying features on the switched feeder that I received was the 'bee protectors' that were added....the many baby hummers that we have this time of year that are trying to feed on it outside my kitchen window can't seem to be able to use that feeder at all.  Fortunately I have another type of feeder in my back patio so the little ones feed back there now.  Sadly, I now can no longer watch them up close right outside my kitchen window. I miss that. Shouldn't a company advise a customer BEFORE sending a replacement???.....so the customer can decide whether or not they will AGREE to be sent a replacement?  I would certainly think so....especially if the company hopes for satisfied return customers.	-1
It's an ingenious design, really, but unfortunately, being made of plastic, the hinges break, and really aren't repairable. The plastic seems to be impervious to superglue, and there simply isn't enough surface area to work with epoxy or make a makeshift hinge. I think if they just made the hinges a little beefier and reinforced them a little it might have held out for quite a while.	-1
I opened the box to begin assembling my Weber grill. I discovered that one of the legs is bent, and the body of the grill had three small areas that the black paint didn't cover. One area has a scratch which explains it, and the other two areas seem like they didn't paint over it.  I thought perhaps the shipping box was damaged, but the box is in good shape. This leads me to think, that Weber has poor quality control. I was surprise to see such poor quality in an American made product, yes, it was "Made in USA." I never seem such poor quality in ANY products that is made in China. I learned that just because it is made in American it doesn't mean the product is better made, matter of fact most American made products are worst than the ones made in China. I heard Americans complaint about manufacture jobs went oversea. When Americans (maybe they were actually illegals) made such a pis- poor product, they deserve to lose their job. I don't buy into this Made in America cr-p anymore; I am very unhappy.	-1
*BAD DESIGN - Feeder MUST be hung in a FULL-SHADE (total) area OR when the SUN hits it, the SEAL weakens and the feeder LEAKS like CRAZY which makes a total RED stained MESS everywhere! (ants, bees)  Also, it's too Large, Gosh, It would take hundreds of hummingbirds to Eat that much Syrup.	-1
The mice were much smarter than this trap.  When I saw it with the door shut, I assumed I had caught my mouse, and drove miles away to release it, trying to be nice and humane.  When I arrived and opened the door, nothing happened.  There was no mouse.  There was only evidence of a mouse, as he had chewed all over the trap, and chewed off part of the door hinge mechanism, so that it no longer was functional.  The design was faulty as well as the opaque black color - you can't look inside to see if someone is in there!  I had to return it and bought a different one, see-through plastic and with a better trap mechanism.  I successfully caught two mice with the second trap.  Don't waste your money on this one, it is ineffective even though it is cheap.	-1
So much for Weber quality. The steel is thin, the handle is plastic now where it used to be wood, and the entire grill feels flimsy. The vent at the bottom is hard to move and it also has sharp edges. My older Weber grill, the 18" model, was better quality, no comparison.	-1
It fell off the window and broke within the first week.	-1

I have had great success with the Victor mouse traps, but their rat trap only stunned and did not kill the rat it caught.  I used a piece of meat for bait and had to tie it to the trigger to keep the rats from taking the bait.	-1
One for 13 dollars or 2 for 72 dollars, if your ordering the 2 pack, call your doctor, your having a stroke.	-1
I was using them outside along the base of the back of the house would faces woods.  Tired these out of curiosity and would not have known had I not tried them.  I found others more effective, but I wouldn't purchase these again.  I can't comment as to their effectiveness inside, as mentioned earlier, I used them outside.	-1
Bottom line: I recommend this product, with a warning.  On paper, new design solves the biggest issue with H. feeders, i.e., cleaning because the base is two pieces and bottle mouth is wide.  However, if you fail to screw the bottle perfectly it leaks, and sometimes it leaks on the return trip to the kitchen if tilted during take-down.  So, when you take it down for cleaning, convey it to the kitchen in a bowl or platter due to leaking.  I would prefer the company's old feeder, which was the gold standard of feeders.  The old model, one piece base with narrow mouth bottle, was harder to clean, but never leaked.  I have used the old model for years, still have some old feeders which I prefer to this new, leaky model.	-1
The mice trip the door, but somehow don't get caught inside. It is also impossible to clean.  We also tried these:  - Catchmaster 606MC Mechanical Metal Multi-Catch Trap -- the mice go in, eat the peanut butter, poop, and go right back out. We tried messing with the ramps to get them to operate better, but no luck.  - Victor Mice Trap from Home Depot -- we had a lot of success with this. It catches the mice, and allows for cleaning.  - Victor Mini Sonic PestChasers from Home Depot -- we seem to be getting a benefit from these. Try them.  - Mice Cube 4 Pk - Reusable Humane Mouse Trap -- these work great at catching mice, but are impossible to clean out.	-1
Caught one small young mole. The remaining moles push dirt through the traps not setting them off. Have tried relocating the traps changing, angles, resetting the triggers but the moles avoid them.	-1
Hard to operate.	-1
Ok, you guys got me.  From the picture, and from the "shipping weight 1 lb", and from the phrase "rat and mice bait", I expected something larger. This trap is incredibly small. Arrives in a small envelope ! It is less than 1.5 inches square and 6.5 inches in length. No way will it catch the monster of a mouse/rat that I saw in my backyard. I think it is a little disingenuous that the dimensions are not revealed. Returning it.	-1
bulb burn out  also the light was under deck 3 mo.old i bought 2 of these DON'T BUY THEM	-1
Never got to use this product so don't know if it leaks or not. I've tried everything but the suction cup falls off the window within an hour. It's not worth bothering to send it back so I'm going to have to find another way to secure it to the French door leading to my backyard patio...what a pain!	-1
I love the idea of a grill that is small and convenient, I put 4 pork chop and 3 chicken breasts on it and it cooked them wonderfully BUT.... I'm puzzled as to why the "grill" ( the part you place the food on) is already starting to rust? I washed it thoroughly with a NYLON(!) "scrubby" ( I had oiled it first) and then put it on the top rack of the dishwasher AND IT HAD RUST ON IT THE NEXT MORNING! This is bulls_ _t! Now I'm afraid to cook on it. Very disappointed!	-1
Don't know if it's the location but they ignore this one in favor of other feeders.	-1
I bought 5 types of mouse traps and tried them for 2 weeks both indoors and in my shed.  1.  The best by far was the full size trap called the "Rat, Mouse, Squirrel Trap" by Happy Trap. I've never seen this type before, it has clever spring loaded rods that trip and are very sensitive and easy to set.  Setting it the first time took me 2 minutes to figure the thing out ... What the ?? And then it was fine.  It's a live trap but is so sensitive and fast that it never missed a mouse. I caught 6 with it.  I measured the sensitivity of the bait holder itself, and it only takes 7 grams to set it off, that's the weight of 3 pennies.  Even a very small mouse at 12-20 grams easily trips it.  I know cause I've caught a lot of mice and weighed the mouse in the trap, and without the mouse, then subtracted to get their exact weight. This has a clever design that doesn't get false trips since it's balanced pretty good but it's super sensitive.  I suggest even indoors to try this out plus it won't snap your cats nose or anything since it just closes the door.  It's not a cheap little mouse trap but if you want to catch a mouse this was very effective. [...]  2. 2nd place goes to a regular mouse trap (Victor Pro). It missed 3 times and caught 2 mice.  not bad.  3.  Third place... Havahart 0745  - live trap. this is a traditional style live trap.  It caught 1 in 2 weeks and missed 5 times.  Yes, it's intended for larger rodents mostly, chipmunks, etc.  and not sensitive enough for mice.  Very low tech and limited planning went into this one vs the 1st place trap.  4.  Pro-Ketch - multiple Mouse Catch trap.  Not effective at all.  This was baited with peanut butter like the others and placed next to a wall near the Happy Trap live trap and a regular mouse trap.  This one never had a bite in 2 weeks while the live trap worked almost every night until I ran out of mice.  Nothing ever went in this one even when it was the only trap there.  5.  Kness Tip-Trap 109-0-001 - last place.  The Tip-Trap missed once and was tipped but empty.  I kept it baited and tried for 2 weeks, I put it along a wall with peanut butter, etc, baited as per directions with a small dab but it remained empty the whole time.  It was cheap at least.	-1
I consider myself good with my hands, I've rebuilt engines, added a room onto my house, etc, but these suckers are flippin dangerous.  I bought a pack of 12, and after the 4th trap going off the moment I set it, I gave up.  These are not like mouse traps that will hurt, these will break your fingers. I would set on, put it gently on the table and it would trip with the lightest of touches.  Hits so hard, my ears started to ring after the 6th premature triggering. I gave up completely after it triggered as I was closing it and the end of the spring sliced my thumb and I started bleeding.  Wasn't worth it.  I'll either poison the rats in my attic or buy the more expensive ones that are designed this century.  I will hand it to Victor, no rat will survive this trap.	-1
Grandpa can keep his traps, these trip too easily and miss the target. Replaced with the Tomcat traps and they've been killing it... literally.  The clumsiness of this style may be fine for mice, but the rat sized ones are too dangerous to your digits.	-1
These traps have not worked for me.  and I followed instructions to the letter.  I purchased two of them and when I was setting one of them a short time age the thing broke right at safety catch.	-1
Really hard to use properly. I had better luck with the spear kind.	-1
We purchased these about 2 months ago and have been trying daily to catch the rats that have invaded our neighborhood this summer.  No rats caught yet but the pests have managed to get the dog food, meat or peanut butter we've used as bait without setting off the trap.  Definitely very disappointed and don't recommend them.	-1
Hair trigger - No dice.  Did you read that amazing 10 page year review marked "helpful" over 1,200 times? I did, and man I was sold hard and fast. I bought 3 ASAP and pressed these "mole traps" into service within days of ordering. Well let me tell you, there is no possible way to catch a mole with these things, not in the Bay Area anyway. Maybe I have an exceptionally small and intelligent breed of mole that is all my own? Perhaps not.  I'm an experienced trapper of vermin, this was my 1st shot at moles, after conducting hours of research, watching a dozen videos and reading the poor quality instructions included with the mole traps, I set my 1st, 2nd and 3rd trap. The next day 2 out of three had been tunneled directly under by the intended targets. I excavated my failed traps and tried again, with a hair trigger and the compacted dirt bridge inside the tunnel set under the trap lever, exactly as successful YouTubers demonstrated. The next day the traps had been tunneled under - again! I was floored, and frustrated too. It takes about 20 minutes to set each trap due to the complexity of building a compacted dirt bridge inside the tunnel under the trap lever, and further compounded by the glossy epoxy coated trigger with a VERY heavy trap spring. This trap is nearly impossible to set on hair trigger and completely impossible to trigger if set on full trigger. Nearly a dozen times I had the trap snap shut, several minutes after I had it completely set in the earth and ready to go. If set to full trigger the spring tension is so heavy you could play drums on the trigger and never set it off. I've included a picture to show how light I finally set this trigger (after sanding the gloss a bit), it's the epitome of hair-trigger, and yet the vermin still tunneled right underneath!  I am glad these traps work for some, they're a great price. They did not work for me, no sir.	-1
Because of its large capacity, when the Perky-Pet 209 is filled with sugar water, it weighs 56oz or 3 1/2 lbs. Unlike many other feeders, the hanging wire doesn't fit around the glass bottle, instead it has a screw-on plastic top which has a wire threaded through it. With the short (7") and thin flexible wire supplied, you can't just bend the wire into a hook shape, you must tie a very sturdy knot at both ends of the wire (not that easy, even with a thin wire). Or, you must scrounge a better wire that is strong enough to hold the heavy Perky-Pet and yet thin enough to fit through the tiny hole in the top of the plastic. Or, get out a drill, drill a larger hole and use a decent piece of wire to hang the darn thing. If the new wire is too large though, it will interfere with the cap screwing onto the bottle.  Or, you could just buy a better designed hummingbird feeder.  Cleanliness is important when feeding hummers and yet because of the bottle's very small filler hole, (5/8") it is impossible to get a bottle brush inside the bottle to scrub it. Filling the bottle with a cleaning solution and shaking it vigorously is the only way to clean it. Filling the bottle up first with a cleaner and then several rinses can be very tedious because of that small filler hole. And the base doesn't disassemble for cleaning, You can't see and clean the black stuff growing in all the tiny nooks and crevices.  Or, you could just buy a better designed hummingbird feeder.  I think most of the positives reviews about the Perky-Pet revolve around that it is very effective in attracting hummingbirds, but there are other feeders that attract hummers just as well, that are easier to hang and even more importantly, easier to clean.	-1
Tried this for several weeks with no results.  Went back to poison.	-1
Didn't catch anything for me.	-1
these do not work at all. Waste of money.	-1
didnt work	-1
The trap is not easy to trigger.  I set it very loose--with the release pin on the very edge of the trigger plate and the moles go right through it without it going off.	-1
A lot of the reviews here were pretty positive for this trap but unfortunately I was unsuccessful. There are some pretty good videos on the web about how to properly set this up and I followed them step by step with no luck. Those little furballs just keep tearing up my yard!	-1
This may work fine if you were strong enough to set it.	-1
Nice looking trap but I am not impressed with functionality. These traps are hard to set. Not for the faint of heart. I have set these on numerous times with the mole or gopher coming and covering them up. I can not recommend this item to my friends. There has to be a better solution.	-1
I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better. It is solid and easy to clean. I didn't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short. But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great. The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.  EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow "bee guards." Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these "bee guards" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.  one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir. Like I said, this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects, I will and never put it back up again.	-1
Does not work	-1
I have yet to be able to use this, so can't speak to the usefulness of it.  While I do have strength, I apparently don't have enough to operate this trap sufficiently.	-1
Birds didn't like	-1
Don't buy a Feeder without Bee/Wasp Guards! You will just be inviting pests and they drive the HBirds away! THis one does not have the Guards!	-1
The opening on the bottle is very small, making it difficult to truly clean.  Had this been an open mouthed container, like the larger sized acrylics, this would be a wonderful product.	-1
I have purchased the two best rated mole traps, the Victor out O'sight 0631, and the Wire Tek 1001. I set the traps according to the instructions in several different locations during a three weeks period. In each case the moles tunneled around the traps and enjoyed a very happy life under my lawn. I became very frustrated, and decided to try a mole repellent recipe found on the internet. I mixed  the recommended concoction of 1/2 cup castor oil, 1/2 cup dishwater detergent and then used 3 tablespoons of that mix to make one gallon solutions which i sprayed on the areas showing mole activity. The moles disappeared within two days and have not reappeared for the last two weeks. I will continue to spray the solution for several weeks to make sure the critters do not come back.	-1
Feeder worked fine and stayed attached to the window.  However, due to the design it is impossible to keep ants off of or out of the feeder.	-1
I like this feeder, so do the Hummingbirds. Unfortunately, the tabs holding the base onto the reservoir have broken on both feeders that I bought.	-1
These window mount feeders are a great idea...problem is, they are extremely fragile.  I've gone through 7 of these and several have been replaced by Amazon. Customer service is not the problem. Now the feeders are coming with a defective suction cup. I could tell the cup was made from a different compound as the cup is now opaque rather than clear. After a few days, the suction cup falls from the window and the fragile feeder breaks.  If the tank is not cracked it can be swapped for another base. ( I have several of these from feeders that have fallen when the base survives).  The company needs to get a better suction cup. I suppose there might be something available in a hardware store that would work. Also the tabs that connect the tank to the base break very easily.	-1
The mower's wide cutting path compared to other model compelled me to but it from [...].  The mower has poor built quality such as handle tends to flex, the wheels are made of plastic, and the gears are also made of plastic.  The adjustment for cutting near the wheels are very difficult to set properly, at least on mine.  Apparantly, the wide cutting path means that the stationary part of the cutting blade if it goes out of straight true with respect to the cutting blades would means more difficult adjustment than the narrower cutting path push movers.  I have narrower push movers which have not had this problem.  I have extreme difficulty in adjusting the cutting edge on this mower.  This is very poor quaity mower.  Stay away.  When, I received it one of the cuting blade was longer than other blades, I had to grind down the blade to match the height of the other blade.  Bad purchas on my part.	-1
Well, I didn't catch any moles with these. My old mole trap had broken after two years, and I tried to save some money and bought these instead. At first I thought they would be easier to set, but you really need a third hand to set these. And about 1/3 of the time I would forget to release the safety, so of course I didn't catch anything those times. Finally, I went back and got a replacement for my original trap,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tomcat-Mole-Trap/dp/B0043FHXVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tomcat Mole Trap</a>. It takes a bit of effort to step on it and set it, but I caught two moles within two days of receiving the trap.	-1
I live near a stream and have rats with bodies 8"+  These traps have been sprung over 20 times int he last 4 days and it's only caught 3 of them.  Sometimes the traps are drug a distance away from where they were.  They Are "catching" the rats but then the rats just pull themselves out and go along with their business.  I need a stronger trap.  edit 9/12 just a bit over a month later..  have caught about 35 rats with the victors since I started.  Escape rate is about 50% with the mod I'll mention in a moment.  The JAWS trap has a much lower escape rate but it also gets sprung much less often.  I modified the traps by putting sharp thin nails through the wood just inside the trap bar area so that the rats get stabbed and can't pull out as easily.  Many of the catches would have escaped without the barbs.  Here is a ascii drawing of what I mean.  lines are the trap bar and dots are the barbs. Disregard the commas.  Amazon's formatting would let me just use spaces. _______ |.....| |.,,,.| |.,,,.| |.,,,.|	-1
I would have given this feeder 5 stars if the glass bottle had a larger opening for filling and cleaning.  I thought that the red plastic top was a screw-on lid (like the feeder that I was replacing had).  It screws on, but onto the bottom of the glass container, not the filling end.  The filling end has a very narrow opening and a regular-sized bottle brush will not fit into it for cleaning. I don't even want to think about how hard it will be to clean the base.  I am quite disappointed with the product, overall, but the birds like it.  It's all about the birds...	-1
Hard to set trap and difficult to install in mole run. Road flares work best	-1
Yes, the other reviews describing just how difficult this thing is to use are factual. When actually placed in position in the ground, strongly suggest covering it with a barrier to keep kids and pets safe.	-1
When I bought this I though that the bottom would open so that I could clean it.  It doesn't.  There is no hook on top, just a wire that you need to twist into a loop, which doesn't seem secure.  I would not buy it again.	-1
More of a one-time shot trap...works well initially but doesn't stand up to repeated uses.  Wouldn't recommend it for repeated usages.	-1
This product arrived broken, in suspicious packaging. Please see my review on Birdscapes 279 Deluxe Rose Petal 12-ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder.	-1
I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I won't have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you.	-1
Haven't been able to make it work as advertised.	-1
I live next to a cypress swamp.  I have 3 of these positioned around the house.  They are a must have.  There is a lack of choice for acre+ bug zappers and I've been using Flowtrons for 3 years. Put simply, they do not last.  The fifth burned out today.  I'll be ordering my sixth of these in 3 years.  Three have burned out so far both BK-40s and BK80Ds.  Most die less than 1 year. The bulbs last longer!  I have 3 spare bulbs in a drawer now.  I've called the company numerous times on several failures.  They said they'd email me an RMA number which I never received.  They do not return calls.  So, Flowtron, how about instead of scr#wing customers you get a hold of our cheap Chinese suppliers and demand: thicker, more reliable PCB boards; more reliable neon ballasts; more reliable coils, etc. etc. etc.  They've all burned out in the 5 models I've gone thru.  But the manufacturer knows the quality is poor otherwise they would honor the warranty.  If these are < 1 yr. disposable items they should not charge more than $30.  Solution: I'm going to take the BK-80D that died today to a local electronic tinkerer to fix it with quality parts.  I figure the extra money will be made back over the long run.  It's just not worth $60+ a year and getting eaten by mosquitoes during the change out interval.  Disappointed.	-1
It is VERY HARD to set up!!! Need a lot of muscle work. It was IMPOSSIBLE for me!!! The seller should have made a note about it. Wanted to return but didn't want to pay the shipping fee. Not recommended for woman.	-1
Getting used to this trap, having to set up properly. Moles have tripped this trap, but one nothing caught yet. Watched videos on Youtube for this, and they were informative. Have used this trap now for several seasons, and downgraded my star rating since nothing caught in high activity area.	-1
Disappointed that I could not set the trap because the safety on the one I bought was too short and would not hook. Therefore, I returned it.	-1
2nd one I have bought, the first one lasted 6 months, the second one lasted two months. The plastic bottom leaks, purchase at your own risk.	-1
Cuts well, etc.; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more.  After assembly it was fine.  But who needs that added hassle?	-1
These things are terrible. they are way more trouble to set up than they are worth. there are easier/simpler products out there that will be more efficient.	-1
I was all set to love this feeder. I love the glass container, which holds a lot, stays looking clear, and is easy to clean thoroughly. I like the shape and appearance, and the birds love it. What I don't like, and what is forcing me to retire it, is that the bottom plastic compartment is very difficult to thoroughly clean, and so black mold builds up. If you're happy to clean the feeder and refill it everyday, this one would be fine. But if you're like me, and view the large capacity as an excuse to empty it only once a week - not good. It will be moldy by then, despite all the boiling of the food and hot soapy water washing of the feeder you do. Bummer.	-1
Never tripped. Never caught any moles.	-1
These are TERRIBLE! I got 3 of these at one time and all three leaked. I did NOT do anything to them, did NOT drop them, crack them etc. They just leaked right out of the box.  Very poorly made.	-1
Lasted about a year.  Bulb still works but no zap	-1
Takes too long to setup. I went cheap and bought this instead of the one you just press your foot down on. Big mistake! This one takes 10-15m to "install" and it's very sensitive.	-1
hard to take apart the base. And the glass bottle has a VERY narrow opening. All in all, difficult to clean. Not recommended.	-1
Came thrown in a paper mailer, loose with no padding. Plastic cracked (of course) and unusable. I have better things to do with my life than stand in line at the post office to return this junk.	-1
This is trickey to set and I might suggest one be very careful not to get their hands caught - the directions suck but I am sure it will kill. Although my exterminator suggested I use juicy fruit gum and roll it up to look like a grub , make many of these and put them in the active tunells	-1
Like others noted here, the "handle" portion of this kit is poorly designed, and would not stay tight.  I ended up cutting a slot in it and hot melt gluing it to the gun as the only solution I could find to make it workable.  In the past ten years, or so, I have purchased this kind of spray wand of several different brands, including this Gilmour repair kit.  Without exception, they have all been very disappointing, with short life.  They all soon start leaking on my hand, with drips of smelly spray on pants and shoes.  Also, I often want to put the back-pack sprayer away in the garage before it is completely empty, in order not to waste the chemicals, and to have it readily available when I spot just a few new weeds in the lawn.  These wands always seem to leak so that it is easy to create a puddle of week killer on the garage floor.  I have two backpack spray tanks, one for week killer, and one for herbicide, and we have a 15-gallon sprayer that mounts on the back of an ATV for large scale spring cleanup.  All three sprayers use this same kind of wand, and it has been a source of irritation for a long time that these plastic spray wands are of such poor quality.  BUT I RECENTLY FOUND A GREAT SOLUTION THAT PLEASES ME.  I bought a brass " Gunjet 31 (also referred to as an AA31, or TeeJet 31) spray gun, a brass wand to go with it, and a spray tip assembly.  (There is one TeeJet 31 gun offered for sale here on Amazon, but it is way too expensive compared to other vendor prices.)  What you end up with is a high-quality, all brass (except for the nozzle and a few valve parts that are steel) spray wand that does not leak, is smooth and easy to use, and is a pleasure to use compared to these cheap disposable plastic spray wands.  The whole assembly cost me about $80, including shipping.  You can buy these on line from many agriculture and orchard supply houses.  I just picked one vendor on line and called them by telephone.  The sales lady I spoke to was very knowledgeable and selected exactly the right combination of parts for my application.  Now, there is one more detail that makes this solution work even better.  I only need one spray gun assembly for all three sprayers.  I use 1/4-inch air hose quick connect fittings to easily switch this new beauty between spray tanks.  Search here on Amazon for "air quick connect" to see these parts.  At the end of each of the three hoses that come out of each sprayer, I fitted a female quick connect fitting, and on the inlet end of the wand I fitted one male quick connect fitting.  Even though these fittings are for intended for compressed air, they work just find for spray liquid.  This stops all leaks, even when the sprayer is left full, with the wand disconnected, there have been no leaks.  It is a ten second process to switch the wand between sprayers.  (You must put the female fitting on the end of the tank hose in order to seal the hose when the spray gun in removed.  If you put the male fitting on the hose, the liquid can free flow out of the tank.)  These days it seems that we often complain that stuff we buy is not the same quality as what it was "in the old days" but here is a solution to acquire a high quality spray wand that will last for many years and perform superbly all of its life.  The only downside you might find is that this brass assembly is a little heavier to carry than the plastic spray wands.	-1
Did not do the trick.	-1
Couldn't get it to work, set it 20-39	-1
I bought two of these feeders about 18 months ago.  I was looking for a couple of the best feeders I could find.  These were very well-reviewed, and they were made of glass.  The bottles are heavy-grade quality glass with screw-on hanger tops.  The bottlenecks are very narrow, which makes cleaning difficult, particularly if any mold has developed inside the bottle.  Also, these are almost impossible to fill  without a funnel.  The feeder base is red plastic with snap-in flower feeders, and they are prone to leak.  Worse, quite a variety of flying bugs and ants are able to get inside the feeder.  The feeder base does not come apart, so you can only keep rinsing until the dead bugs stop floating out.  You can't see the inside edges of the feeder to see if it's clean enough.  After about a year, the plastic flowers started breaking, so I gave up and tossed both feeders.  Curiously, when I first ordered these and was waiting for them to arrive, I picked up a cheap little plastic feeder at a local store.  Not only am I still using it, I just bought four more.  They're made by First Nature, and they come apart completely for cleaning.  Bugs don't seem to get inside these, either.  They were less than half the price of this model, and the hummingbirds like them a lot.	-1
If you plan on using this only once or twice a year and you are veeery careful, then it should work, otherwise it's a piece of crap.  Spend the money and buy something that you can depend on.	-1
In a week's time, on 24X7 with octenol, this has killed 1 fly and two mosquitoes.  The cloud of gnats remains unaffected, hovering literally above the device.  I think they are taunting me..	-1
IT HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL.  WE WATCHED ALL THE U-TUBE INSTRUCTIONS AND EVEN WORE GLOVES BUT THEY ONLY DUG AROUND IT WE PURCHASED TWO BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY MOLES.  THE TRAPS WERE SO TIGHT WE HAD A PROBLEM TRYING TO SET THEM OFF OURSELVES.  I'D RETURN THEM IF WE HAD NOT USED THEM SO MUCH.  VERY UNHAPPY WITH HOW HARD IT WAS TO SQUEEZE THE HANDLES TOGETHER. MY DH. HAD TO DO IT AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS TOUGH.	-1
Followed the directions!  Never caught a darn thing except maybe a cold from checking it early every morning for several days!	-1
i have bought many a hummingbird feeder, and this one i will not use or even pass on to someone else to use: it is impossible to clean the plastic element. sugar water sitting outside in the sun soon develops mold, and this feeder actually encourages dangerous mold growth because it cannot be disassembled for cleaning. if you really care about hummingbirds, make a 1 part sugar to 4 parts water food WITHOUT the red food coloring, and put it in a feeder than can be thoroughly cleaned. i sincerely hope the manufacturers of this item will redesign the base compartment so that it can be separated for occasional scrubbing; or that some enterprising individual will take up the challenge (make the bottle neck opening a little wider, too, to allow entry for a bottle brush). then we'll really have the 'best' feeder, and so will the hummingbirds.	-1
Be care when ordering to get the proper size, does not fit my nozzle. I think there  should be a chart to what they fit.	-1
I've got two of these, but will not be getting any more. As indicated in other reviews, the tabs holding the two pieces together break off very easily, making the feeder all but unusable. The other problem is that these feeders leak sugar water at the joint between the two pieces, which means they're constantly covered with bees and wasps, which chase the hummers away.  The hummingbirds like them while they last, but there are better options out there. I'd recommend the Opus model 455 window feeder instead. It doesn't break or leak, and the birds like it a lot.	-1
Mosquitoes are not attracted to scent or light. Dont waste your money. I was suckered by all the good reviews to no avail. I promise this thing doesnt work. I mounted in the correct location, use the scent attractant etc. but ill be darned if it kills mosquitoes.	-1
Screw missing from black cover.  Very disappointed. Had to put a small cable tie to hold the black cover from the bottom of this product.	-1
This trap was the most unsuccessful trap of the three I own.  Lasted one season then parts started snapping off.  There are better traps and I usually like Victor traps.	-1
I have a little over an acre in Central Florida.  This summer, the mosquitoes got so bad they drove me inside.  I'm an avid gardener, so I hate staying inside.  I had great hopes for this thing, but it didn't live up to them.  Just an occasional zip sound as bugs got done in.  No big pile of dead mosquitoes beneath.  Not a dent on the mosquito population.	-1
I was so excited to purchase this after reading the reviews.  I am sad to say it did not catch much.  After about a month, it caught 3 flies maybe.  I put it near our chicken coop, filled it with water half way and I will say I did not use the packet they sent.  I could not bring myself to deal with the foul smell and nastiness and I was hoping to be able to reuse this  trap and give the dead flies to the chickens and I knew I could not do that if I used the  stuff they sent.  Unfortunately,  it did not work without the packet of nasty smell.  I thought it was a little over priced for what you get.  Ultimately this is just a plastic bottle with a lid.	-1
Too hard to use	-1
i had no luck with this. It is hard to get set and when you try to place it in the ground the trigger springs very easily causing you to have to reset it and try again and again. I also caught no moles i think primarily due to the locations i am trying to catch them. I don't see any long straight runs like the directions and videos suggest as the place to put the trap. All i seem to have are short round paths (which according to the videos are feeding hunting burrows) i tried placing this in these locations with no luck. I am finding the P7901 mole chasers seem to be working much better. I have placed three of them and after about 10 days i no longer see any activity in the areas (about 100 feet wide circle) from these. Some people seem to have luck with these however so i guess it just depends on if you have the right mole runs to catch them in.	-1
Trap takes some strength to set and requires excavating enough soil for the jaws to operate freely, but enough soil under the trigger for the mole to push it up.  Our soil has quite a bit of clay and if it gets between the jaws, the trap will not close.  Also, moles abandon a tunnel if it is disturbed too much or dig around the trap.  While it works on occasion and doesn't require as much disruption of a tunnel as those "step on" traps at Lowes, I prefer the plunger traps over the jaws traps.  UPDATE AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS:  While I think I am right about this trap, I was wrong about the Tomcat "step on" trap.  I have now used one for several months with good success, much better than my other traps.  It's more difficult to set close to a walkway, but on tunnels in the open, it does a good job.  I recommend loosening the soil where the jaws operate and pushing the trap as far down as possible with your foot.  It's safer and easier to set than other traps.	-1
Still flies buzzing around like crazy. Not very effective. Don't know if I got a bad batch of bait or what. Never did really smell bad to me.	-1
Both bulbs burnt out within 3 months of having.	-1
Hard to use, provision much easier.	-1
I returned this item because I am an old person who does not have the physical strength to work this product. Also they look very dangerous, if I were younger I would say formidable, but at my age just dangerous.	-1
This didn't work at all. Save your money.	-1
did not fit	-1
This sucks!!! Wish I could give it no stars. It caught like 3 flies.	-1
Over the last eleven years I have purchased this item on three different occasions. Nonetheless, I will not buy it this time. Though the feeder's capacity it excellent, cleaning it is absolutely impossible.  As hummingbird enthusiasts know, these creatures are exceptionally sensitive to chemicals. Not only shouldn't you clean these feeders with ANY kind of dish-soap, but you CANNOT clean them with bleach. This can potentially kill the birds. Likewise, hummingbirds are sensitive to mold. Here's the catch-22!! Unfortunately, as noted by other reviewers, this feeder's reservoir does not disassemble, and cleaning this feeder properly is exceptionally difficult, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.  One reviewer wrote to use grains of rice to clean this feeder. This is a brilliant idea . . . and if you buy this feeder, try that!! But, please, don't use bleach.  As for me, I cannot stand another year of cleaning this demonic "thing." So, off to the hummzinger dish . . . which is not as attractive, but it is safer (simply because I cannot invest the time in cleaning this!!)	-1
The people promoting this trap are full of S***! and probably Victor employees. Moles just go around this and it sits there,untouched. Waste of money and a total 100% rip off. Amazon should delete the Victor shill reviews,because this works as well as putting brick or a baseball in your yard.	-1
Would not fit my Ryobi Weed Eater. Get tech support and was told to force it on my arbor. Sorry I will stay with my string head. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY.	-1
Bought one of these, with an additional set of replacement blades.  Do not bother!  These blades last a few minutes before they break off.  I went through several sets of blades in just a few outings with my string trimmer.  Thought this would be easier than wrapping my own spools, but not of they only last a few minutes.	-1
Does not fit my weed trimmer. Garbage.	-1
Very well built and sturdy but so far, after a month of trying, no moles.  Located in Florida the soil is extremely sandy and loose so when we try to retain any semblance of a tunnel it's just a pile of sand.  Not sure if there's any secrets to using these in sandy soil but we have stepped down tracks, found rebuilt and pushed part down and had it get pushed back up.  Then we have set the traps, waited and waited, and don't get a thing.... except more mole damage all around.  You disturb the track at all and it all just collapses down.  Any hints would be GREATLY appreciated.  If we could eliminate some of our moles, or even figure out how to get just ONE, then we'd be pushing the star rating waaaay up.	-1
Hard to set. Very hard. I'm 70 years old, fairly strong but could not set this trap even with the handle extenders included. Plus you have to cut up part of your lawn where you are going to mount it. I returned it. I prefer the spring and spike type of trap.	-1
junk, never worked for me. It got rusted	-1
It takes an NFL football player or body-builder to open the trap to set.	-1
It did not come with the three extra blades and it did not work on my weedeater as advertised.	-1
this unit did not come with the correct mounting hardware for my trimmer. could not use it. gave it away	-1
Didn't work...Pay the price for a good one	-1
This stuff is amazing!!! NOT!!! It doesn't seem to stink enough to attract any flies. I have it down low out in the sun and the flies are buzzin all around. I used one pack of the bait that was included and 2 extra that I bout from a 3 pack of the same bait. I've used the bag ones or the smaller ones and they work great. This was a big bust and now I can't even return it!!!	-1
No good in Bermuda lawn.	-1
Moles take lessons on how to avoid this.  Didn't work.	-1
This mole trap is too much trouble to locate and I've never caught a mole in 2 years. It's a waste of time and money.	-1
Makes an unbearable, loud hum noise that carries a good distance away. I can't stand using it.	-1
Ridiculously difficult to set up and completely ineffective for smaller moles.  See YouTube videos as evidence of this.  It's pretty obvious that this is not a user friendly option for mole removal.  "Make sure you build up a mound of dirt, make sure that the jaws aren't encumbered by dirt or rocks, place leaves over the mechanism so it doesn't get stuck, etc."  Complete BS!  Steer clear of this.	-1
Bug zappers are useless against mosquitoes. Studies have shown that less than 1 percent of the insects killed by zappers are mosquitoes or other biting insects. The devices attract and kill beneficial or harmless insects, like moths, and have no effect on the overall mosquito population. Electronic repellers have also proven ineffective in scientific testing.	-1
Returned -pain to set up.	-1
Lasted half as long as a Stihl brand chain, Ill spend the extra 5 bucks to get another quality chain this next time. Amazon fail	-1
I ordered this for a Remington because Remington was listed as one it would work for. It doesn't work for a Remington.	-1
Bad instructions.  Actually, horrible instructions.  Youtube offers better instructions, but long winded and slow to the point.  After 2 months still have not catched a single mole even though they are having fun tunneling about this trap.	-1
Difficult to set. Very strong setting mechanism. I bought 4 and only caught one mole in three months. They are very sensative when you set the trap; don't appear so sensative when the mole goes through-unscathed. If you don't prepare the dirt mound under the trap just perfectly, the mole detects the trap and tunnels around it. I don't recommend this product. It looks like it would trap a bear, but the moles are smarter. Back to my loop trap.	-1
Hand a hard time setting the trap, returned	-1
This was a waste of money I think it caught one fly	-1
It did not work for my saw.	-1
UPDATED REVIEW:  Well I'm back on to downgrade my review.  After about 11 months of working...it died.  My original unit lasted 2 weeks,  this one lasted 11 months.  Honestly,  just not a great product if it's going to break after a year.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: PROS:  The octenol cartridges lure the baby mosquitos,  and it does pretty much ZAP and kill anything that hits it,  insects are genuinely attracted to the light.  CONS: The first one broke after 3 days of being plugged in.  Amazon rocks and replaced it and I'm on my second one.  But a little leery,  so only run at morning and dusk - not meant to stay on constantly.	-1
I have used 2 of these in a 1 gallon trap and only a few flies.	-1
this item does not fit Remington its too long	-1
We had a problem at the beach house with hundreds of flies getting into the house. We had to leave the house open for a few hours after renting it to a tenant with a cat so that we could air it out and the house filled with flies. We placed this trap outside for over a week hoping that it would do something but it caught only about 10 flies, while more and more keep getting into the house every time we open the door to go outside. Useless.	-1
I followed all the instructions; well, 3 days later, not a single dead fly!! Spend a couple of dollars on fly paper; works better than this	-1
Poor quality. Unstable.	-1
The pan trigger on this trap is not sensitive enough.  Have to set it so it just barely holds or moles cannot trip it.  Moles are small around here	-1
This product just does not work.  Do.not buy as it is a waste of money. Buy something else to get rid of flies	-1
It does not catch flies, and it smells horrible!! In addition, it is extremely lightweight so it cannot withstand even the smallest amount of wind	-1
Does not fit Remington.	-1
I purchased these on Amazon and thought I'd just got a bad unit because we couldn't set the traps.  My landscaper attempted as well and failed.  I then purchased one at the big chain hardware store thinking it was just a faulty unit we'd received.  Nope.  Both were same design and couldn't be set.  I had an older mole trap, same style, that was very sturdy and tough to set, but not impossible.  Wish the older trap was still available.	-1
This mole trap requires you to dig out part of the tunnel to align the jaws of the trap with the mole's tunnel and then you have to carefully cover part of them back up. That is the first type of trap that I bought and I'm sorry to have to say that I have never caught a mole with it yet (watched several YouTubes on how to set it). After using that type of trap for almost two weeks with no results (changed location every day to active tunnels and got really good at setting it), I purchased two of the Victor Plunger Style Mole Traps. The very first day after getting the plunger style traps I caught two moles with the plunger traps and one more mole the second day with the plunger trap (I was still using this Out O'Sight trap but still with no results). You don't dig out the tunnel to set the plunger style and they are easy to set and put into play. But there is one thing that you need to watch out for when using the plunger style trap. I read this in some other reviews and sure enough, it saved me from losing a mole. It is not unusual for only one of the spikes of the plunger trap to barely pierce the mole and not kill them. If you pull up the trap after it has sprung to see what you have caught, you will pull the spike(s) out of the mole and if he is still alive, he will scurry away through his tunnel. So, what you have to do is take a garden trowel, or something similar, and before moving the trap, dig out the area around the spikes to see what is going on. Two of the moles that I have caught were killed by the trap. One mole, however, was still quite alive and was being held by one spike that had just pierced through the skin on one leg.	-1
Did not fit my 20" Stihl Farm Boss chain saw and had already burned the packaging...it said it would fit on the package, but it is NOT the right size!!  Do yourself a favor and buy the authentic Stihl chain.	-1
I had read that there are different types of flies which come out at certain times of the year, etc. Obviously I did NOT know our type flies OR I missed their 'season' because I only caught a few flies - when there were lots around when I began looking for a solution. Hoping to do better next summer. PS These are smelly & unsightly. Not something you want indoors or, in the least, near you. Maybe on a window sill, behind a curtain or blind.	-1
If you're buying this device for cluster flies, save your money.  We've had it up for a week in different places around the house and the only thing inside it is a hapless ladybug that wandered into it.  Hundreds of cluster flies cloud our windows and divebomb us as we walk from room to room.  A bug zapper has been the better approach for euthanizing these annoying insects.	-1
For all of my camping purchases, this is the one that I most wish I could take back, pony up a bit more $$, and purchase a better grill.  This (as most reviewers will state) will not get very hot, will have un-even cooking temps, and goes out constantly.  If using in any sort of wind, you should be aware that you will constantly be forced to re-light during the cooking process.  Additionally as this thing will not get very hot and/or cooks unevenly, you will be waiting a long time to cook any sort of bar-b-que item.  As an example it takes 30+ minutes to cook frozen burger patties.  Recommendation - save your money and purchase a larger grill (webber Q)	-1
This bird feeder is not squirrel proof, they laugh at me as they inhale the seed.  It is also difficult to change the tension setting as well has to keep the top closed after it has been filled.  The only thing it has going for it is it's good looking.	-1
SQUIRREL feeder that birds can use.  The outer cage gives the squirrel a great place to hang and feed and the cage never closes.	-1
Squirrels loved it, didn't stop them once.	-1
This feeder drops the seed even when there are no birds on it. Poor design is the problem, not a feeder that I would recommend to anyone.	-1
I've had this feeder for over a year and as a regular feeder, this is great. However I didn't realize it was squirrel proof until it popped up in my search for a new feeder. I've been watching a few obese squirrels run up my pole, reach over and gorge. Or they simply jump to the feeder and attach themselves to the sides as they shove seed and mix into their bulging mouths.  Yes, it may pull the feeder down blocking the stations, but only after some time passes and then I have to lift it back up. If you have baffles then it's a great feeder, but there's very little squirrel proof about it. In fact my squirrels seem to love it and have gained lots of weight since its been out.	-1
I had one of these for a while when I owned an RV.  When I sold the RV, the grill was the first thing in the dumpster.  Weak, weak, weak.	-1
did not fit my Stihl bar.  Length and everything was fine the slot in the Stihl bar was too narrow.  Ended up buying an Oregon bar as well and it works fine.  Fitment may have been something I overlooked in the write up.	-1
I don't think the product is bad there is just better ways of getting rid of moles.  I was never successful in catching one with the trap.  You have to have massive strength the set the thing and the trap has to be in the correct tunnel and in complete darkness to catch one.	-1
not very good, does not attract flies as stated	-1
the mole trap looks good, but after moving it from tunnel to tunnel, for a month, I gave up.  i'll sell mine cheap	-1
Very difficult to set these traps. Once set, they caught nothing. Don't believe the online videos. Those people are shills for the manufacturer.	-1
This mechanism could kill a buffalo if a could get it to step into it.  I don't want that much killing power.  I'd rather get a grenade.  If a neighbor kid ever played with that mole trap..I'm not comfortable with it.	-1
I received my order for this on April 30, 2014. One year later I had to replace the bulb. Now, late November 2015 the whole it quit again. I replaced the bulb but that didn't work so took it to an electrician who found the transformer to be unrepairable. It lasted than less than 18 months.	-1
Bottom line. If your problem is mosquitoes, forget about it. There's nothing available to get rid of this plague. All there is are those insecticides you have to apply every hour, because they keep coming back and you will probably poison yourself instead. Sometimes I think there's nothing available because the mosquitoes are good for business.	-1
This is a top notch product, well made out of good material but when you toss a steak or burger on the grill you will not get those nice grill marks on your meat that you expect to see.  The SS racks don't have the mass of the porcelain on steel racks my grill came with and consequently don't have the same browning effect.  I will be replacing these SS racks with the porcelain on steel racks. The cast iron racks are just too much trouble to bother with.	-1
I tried using this product for about a year with no success. I'm sure this works great in loamy lawns but I have plants, not grass, and live in suburban California, which means lots of clay! It is extremely difficult to find mole runs except in winter when the rain softens the clay. For my particular situation, i've found the Cinch mole traps to be extremely effective - they worked in a week. I did modify my method to try to match what other reviewers and youtube videos show, but if you don't have a nice soft lawn, there are better tools to catch moles with.	-1
Well, this is a nice little grill and very portable but for the life of me I cannot find a store that carries the canisters! It does not use the normal 16 oz canisters that every KMart and Walmart carries, it uses the smaller 14 oz canisters that it seems no one at all carries! Even the specialty camping stores in my area don't seem to have this size canister so unless you plan to hook it up to the large 20 lb propane tank (which kind of defeats the purpose of it being "go-anywhere" I'd suggest getting a stove that uses a more standard size canister. I ended up buying some online and paying some rather expensive shipping charges for hazardous materials. But at least I have enough little canisters now to last awhile. It really is a shame is does not use the standard 16 oz canisters, what were they thinking? I'd rate the grill about a 4, but the poor choice of canister size is a real killer for me.  Followup - well, I did finally find some of these canisters...check with your local hardware store! Apparently they are sometimes used for construction so can be found at Home Depot and Lowes.	-1
Total Junk, burns the bub our in about a month. Used 3 and give up. Don't but this crap.	-1
Actually, the mouse BROKE this trap. Finally caught him in the old fashioned kill trap, and it was an ordinary mouse, so why he sprang the lid all sideways is beyond me. Anyhow, no more mouse, and it seems there was only the one.	-1
Junk.  Did not work.	-1
The traps are too small to humanely hold a captured mouse. Mice are trapped and held in one position. Since they cannot turn around or move they become covered with their own feces and urine.  The traps balance off-center and, in theory, when a mouse enters to get the bait, the trap is unbalanced and causes the door to close.  But putting just a small amount of bait in the rear of the trap is enough to change the balance so that the door rarely stays open and the trap cannot be set.  These traps are junk and I threw them away.  Instead I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Havahart-1020-Live-Animal-Two-Door-Mouse-Cage-Trap/dp/B0000DINGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Havahart 1020 Live Animal Two-Door Mouse Cage Trap</a>&nbsp;and have used them with great success.	-1
Of all of the several mole traps I purchased recently, this is my least favorite. It is the hardest to set up and requires some significant digging. The spring is very strong and requires some strength. In fact I never did get it set.	-1
This trap does NOT work! The mice just push their way out once they trip the door closed. And that is after they finish eating the bait.	-1
You've gotta' be smarter than the mouse -- not only did the mouse get the bait out of these traps, open them up and escape with little difficulty, but he did it 3 times and MOVED the traps to where he wanted them!!!! Victor needs to go back to the drawing board and do some REAL testing on these traps -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. After the 3rd time, I bought a JT Eaton "Repeater Multiple Catch, Mouse Trap" (no kill) and caught two mice in four hours time!!!!	-1
Worked great for one month then the bulb burned out.	-1
I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek "EasySet" Mole Trap here on Amazon, and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor "Out O'Sight" Mole Trap is not only 1) much more difficult to operate but also 2) less effective than the Wire-Tek one, not to mention 3) tears up your yard more.  With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire-Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it, easy as pie.  That one has caught 2 moles for me so far, the Victor trap has caught 0 moles.  If it wasn't such a hassle to ship stuff back, I'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap.  Don't waste your time on this product here!	-1
These Flowtron items are junk. They don't even last a year, and the company would not honor the warranty because it was purchased online. I have had 4 of them and all failed in only 5 - 6 months. Wsted money on new bulbs, but the problems were in the circuitry. New bulbs don't fix the problems.	-1
I purchased 3 of these from Amazon. They do work. So far, I have caught 2 moles in my yard and 1 in my neighbor's using the surface technique. One of the traps though has a dangerous manufacturing flaw. The thinner piece of metal on the top of the trap where the trigger bar and safety clip are attached broke on the trap after setting it only twice. I have also observed that over time and constant use the paint wears off this piece and the metal rusts, further weakening it. I have contacted Victor about this problem but have not yet heard back from them. Thankfully Amazon has a very liberal and easy return policy on defective items. See pic of broken trap in customer images.  I would have rated this higher but Victor has quality control issues they need to address. This is what happens when you outsource your manufacturing to other countries like China.  For those having problems setting these traps, don't follow the instructions on the box. See my pics in customer images on how to set these without having to use a vice or vice-grips.	-1
crazy expensive, for less than $10 you can just buy whole new unit.	-1
not built so good I had to fix it up before I could use it update tell the bats I have a room to rent still no bats	-1
This trap does the job, but nearly as well as others I have.  THe trap is difficult to set and requires the use of special tools that come with the trap, but are not part of it.  Even with the tools this trap is a pain to set compared to others. Once you get is set and placed on an active run it does the job.  Another issue I have with this trap is that it's design and color make it difficult to see from a disance and impossible to tell if it is sprung.  You have to remeber where you put it and check it periodically.  I recommend poking the tools into the ground next to the trap so you will know where they are.	-1
didn't light up?	-1
Honestly, they would get a 5 if, the lasted more than 4 months if that. Forty dollars times 4 lights assembly's that I have, every 4 months, yeah it's worth it, NOT!	-1
Complete bug zapper new cost $35, to replace the bulbs cost $36. Shows the high mark up in the bulbs. Waste of a good bug zapper just to replace bulbs. No wonder the landfills are filling up, cheaper to buy a new unit then replace bulbs.	-1
They did not work, I have no way of knowing if it was the bulbs or the device. So a waste of money	-1
In my opinion, these are poorly made, not well balanced	-1
Replaced both bulbs without success.	-1
OK, I have been a fan of Earthway products since I bought my push planter several years ago.  I really expected more from Earthway than what we got in this order.  First, the assembly instructions were a waste of effort.  Besides that, this really is not a commercial quality spreader, IMO.  It is so flimsy.  I mean, you could probably tear it up without any effort.  It has to be handled like egg shells, and no less.  Worse, though, is that after I assembled it and gave it a try, the gauge/meter that is supposed to be Earthway settings on one side and Lesco settings on the other, well, they are nowhere close.  I think I dumped 15lbs of very expensive Lesco fertilizer into 800 or less square feet.  I walked as fast as I could thru my mother in law's yard, and it still did not spread any 12 foot spread.  At best it got seven or eight feet, and it emptied the bin like it had a hole in the bottom, like a bottomless pit.  ...and, for the final straw, when I brought this disaster back into the garage to give it a once over, to make sure that it was as bad as it seemed and not just operator error, well, then I noticed that the axle was either cut or drilled wrong on both ends.  As I looked over this POJ I noticed that the left wheel, which, BTW, is mounted onto a plastic rim and not at all commercial quality, the axle is recessed into the spindle area by at least a half inch, and it sticks out about an inch on the right side from the spindle area.  There is no excuse for this kind of poor quality, not from a company who has, in the past, made fine farming products.  This is just more sad news about today's poor quality.  I haven't bothered to check where this product was manufactured, but it does not matter, it is badly  overpriced and poorly built, with absolutely no QC whatsoever.  I have read in another critical review that this product is made in the USA.  That may be the case, or it may be that it was merely assembled here in order to get that label on it.  Either way, it is not the USA quality that I grew up with and still enjoy on some of my personal belongings.  I will be talking to my wife and mother in law about sending this one back.  Maybe they will go ahead and bite the bullet and get a Lesco.  What I have seen in those appears to be high end, but of course, with a high end price tag.  I, notably, am NOT a John Deere fan, not after having owned one of their discontinued walk behind mowers, and I do  know that Lesco is somewhat affiliated with John Deere, at least in our area they are one in the same store, so I am not a happy camper either way this one spins.  Two stars is generous.  I hope this one is going back, because it is defective as well as poorly designed.  UPDATE:  We did return this item.  Last week I stopped in at the local Cooperative to get some seed potatoes, and I saw some Earthway spreaders assembled for sale and on display there.  I think what they had assembled was a lower priced model.  Even that one had the axles off centered, so that issue, apparently, is a design flaw and not just an issue of poor QC.  That being said, the one on display at the cooperative was not nearly as off centered as the garbage that we sent back.  Ours had the axle way up in the housing of the plastic wheel.  The one on display at the local cooperative at least had the axle extending to the edge of the wheel.  These just have issues, and I suspect, as I stated above, that these, although are supposed to be made in the USA, are probably just assembled here by foreign made parts.  That is just an observation on my part, but given my experience, I hope that is what is wrong with this product, else the USA is worse off than even I thought.	-1
I am a landscaper and I bought this 2 years ago. It got me through 2 years before dying but it wasn't exactly a great two years. The pneumatic tires are really nice but if I put more than 50lbs in they would go flat. The nuts on the adjustment bar constantly come loose which means the flow of dispensing changes all the time. I would have to tighten them once or twice per property. adjustment bars are very exposed and made of soft metal. They get bent very easily which causes difficulty opening the gates. The frame is solid, the axle and gears worked great. The bin is big and solid. As a homeowner this may be perfect for you but I would highly discourage buying this for commercial use. I much prefer the units that you set the rate and pull the handle. Those are much more reliable.	-1
It works but does not eliminate mosquitoes on my small backyard- get bitten all over	-1
Only lasts for one season or less and stops working.  Not just the bulb.	-1
Kills moths and some flies no mosquitoes	-1
I bought this and it worked fine for a couple of months. Then the fluorescent bulb starts to loosen up that a little wind and the prong slips right off . While the mosquito is out there supposedly getting zap but instead feeding on me while I'm trying to push this fluorescent tube back in place. I've done that for a few nights now and fed up with it.  I bought one for 1/2 acre of the same brand and that one never gave me any problem.	-1
It' works but its not that good.	-1
I didn't see a reduction in the number of mosquitos. We don't even use it anymore.	-1
horrible, not sticky. the flies landed and left at their leisure.	-1
This does not work very well.  I actually watched flies land on it and some flew right off it.  There must be something better.	-1
Received Pic fly ribbons not Victor (which unroll and work better than Pic).  I will however use the suggestion of apple cider vinegar and the Pic ribbon around a small bowl  with the vinegar and that should improve the performance of the Pic tapes.	-1
These stupid things occasionally attract one fruit fly if I'm lucky, while 25 more swarm around.  One day, I even caught fruit flies freely resting and crawling around on the ribbon before flying off. They have never trapped as much as one house fly. I am now going to try the cider vinegar and collared jar solution -- thanks so much to the other Amazonians for that suggestion.	-1
Non of the 4 units opened correctly. They were either overly twisted or tore. Could be they were old or have some QC problems.	-1
Worst fly strips I have ever used.....yes they catch flies BUT they do not unroll properly...they unroll twisted and the inside does not collect flies so only part of the product works.	-1
I have two other fly catchers for Fruit Flies mostly.  I think that maybe the reason this did not work so well is that the others I have work so much better.  The others I have are the one that looks like a Glass multicolor beehive and the smaller that looks like a small plastic peach.  The best one is the one the glass one.  Even the one I made with an old pill bottle works better than this.  None of the others except for one uses any poison.  I added liquid Nicotine to one which did increase the kill rate some.	-1
I bought close to $50 in these for my barn.  Glad i bought so many because 75% of them break while  you are opening them.  They are so cheaply made the yellow part breaks the tape at different lengths, sometimes it left me with 2 inches of tape, sometimes 1 inch, sometimes 10 inches of tape to catch the flys.  Save your money, as I thought this was a good deal but ended up being a POS.	-1
This is the FOURTH grill I almost threw away due to corporate refusal to provide ANY written assembly instructions. Sure, there are drawings, but some of us are still LITERATE. When I saw there were no screws to attach the legs, I thought I had received a defective product because it's just too much work for Weber to WRITE (remember WORDS??) anything indicating that the legs were to be attached by spreading them and just clipping them into the supplied holes. I think consumers should demand a halt to such corporate irresponsibility. We do not work for Weber or any of the other corporations that sell items we have to finish manufacturing ourselves. The LEAST these corporations that increase profits by having us complete the manufacturing can do is PROVIDE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS. Here's a simple way to test if instructions are useful. Have a variety of people who do not work for the company and are not at all familiar with the product attempt to complete a process by following the instructions. It's called a usability study; those of us who earned advanced degrees in something other than business are familiar with the process, and it's time corporate decision-makers learn it.  Delivery was, of course, fantastic; it's Amazon. If other corporations cared for consumers and quality as Amazon does, the 21st Century wouldn't be the Era From Hell that it is.	-1
It has already quit working, will not light up, I would not recommend this product to anyone.	-1
Not happy at all with this hose. Leaks on first use at the water connection. Also, I received a red hose and not a black hose like in the picture.	-1
I bought this hose about 18 months ago to use with a small dehumidifier. The female fitting began leaking between the threaded part and the part that is attached to the hose. The hose was fastened tightly. The gasket was in good shape, but I replaced it with a fresh gasket anyway. No joy. It still leaks. The leak is within the brass fitting. It seems like it should last longer than this...	-1
Kills lots of bugs but WILL NOT KILL MOSQUITOES!!!!  Do not be fooled, also, I wonder if it doesn't kill bugs that might eat mosquitoes because it kills everything but them.  If you just want to kill moths and such, then it works wonders and I give it a 5 star.	-1
I just watched a fly circle this thing several times & then fly off unharmed.  One even flew inside the grating, buzzed around for a while and never got zapped.  In frustration I got up and shook the thing while a fly was investigating and managed to get it that way.  In 4 hours it's killed 1 housefly and no smaller flying insects at all.  My nerdie cousin attracts more babes than this does bugs.  The cord is ridiculously short, especially for something that claims to need to be 25' away from the action.  How is there going to be an available electrical outlet out in nowhere like that?  I'm  going to give it one more day and a new location & then it gets returned. Note:  I had this setting on a table.  I got out a grate and set it up on that and it has zapped a couple of flies now.  Maybe it needs to have the bottom exposed to work.  I'll try hanging it up by its hook and check back with a report.  Hanging doesn't help.  You'd do better trying to hang the flies.  This is pretty much useless for bug control.	-1
should of just bought the whole  hose it would have been cheaper	-1
Lasted a little over a year and connectors came loose from hose rendering them useless.	-1
the hose broke after very few uses i like to return it and i cant find the seller.need help	-1
THIS DOES NOT FIT INTO THE 3/4 YARD BUTLER BASE, THEY ARE DIFFERENT THREADS! WHY WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT THE TWO PIECES FIT TOGETHER WHEN THEY DO NOT! ONE IS HOSE THREAD AND ONE IS PIPE THREAD YOU NEED AN ADAPTER TO HOOK THE TWO TOGETHER!!!!	-1
I must say that I am disappointed with this purchase; it is very small even for one person.	-1
Cheap quality.  Isn't even those that is pictured.  Hose that was received was folded in half and very very cheap materials.  Would not recommend	-1
Absolute junk, worked for 4 or 5 days and stopped in one position. Nothing is broke or bent, just a poor design.	-1
This lasted part of one season before it completely stopped rotating. Waste of money!	-1
Didn't work.	-1
not likely to last very long, already swollen after a few months, looks like it is ready to burst	-1
Was disappointed to find the hose to be extremely stiff and not willing to lay flat, even after attempting to work it for a while.  Purchased with the intention of running from my dehumidifier to the drain...but after a single night the dehumidifier was leaking all over the floor because the hose wouldn't lay flat enough to drain properly.	-1
Leaked from day one, no matter how hard I tightened it. It wasn't the sealing washer, it was the swivel crimp, bad joint. Had to throw it out.	-1
The "brass" coupling, the part below the threaded piece that screws into the tap that spins around, leaked very badly. I can't see the hole, but as much water was spurting out of the hole as was coming out of the other end of the hose. Useless.	-1
This thing lasted 5 months as a garden hose before it came apart. I have others that are older still working just fine.	-1
I ended up getting a very heavy, thick, green hose that leaked after just four weeks. The hose is so inflexible that I can't even turn it so I can hold my sprinkler head and water my flowers. Tossed it.	-1
Mine leaks like crazy even though it's brand new. You're better off  getting a different brand.	-1
I purchased this item based on the picture of a quality hose.  I received a cheap hose that was was distorted from the packaging - definitely not the quality hose I was looking for.  I returned the hose for a refund.	-1
Cheap hose and end connectors	-1
The hose I received is much cheaper than the one pictured. It's the very thin, fake plastic, green kind that kink and flatten very easily. Fittings are pretty low quality too. They leak unless they are screwed on very tight. It works OK for my application (dehumidifier to pump) but I was expecting a lot better quality from the photo.	-1
The top part leaks where it connects to the garden house.	-1
This product was cheap, leaked all around the cheap gasket.	-1
The one I got was green instead of black (perhaps I didn't pay close enough attention to what I ordered. Additionally, the o-ring started leaking after a couple of days. I had to replace it. (I was using this to constantly drain from a de-humidifier.	-1
I bought this hose as a drain for my dehumidifier, so this was certainly a low-demand use. After only a week the female connector started leaking water onto my basement carpet. Rubbish.	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS POS, I should have listened.  I bought two, two weeks apart.  The first one leaked immediately, so I ordered a second meaning to return first.  Second one worked in the first place I put it BECAUSE I DIDN"T MOVE IT, the hose was on a timer.  As soon as I tried to use it to spray the plants, the tension on the connector made it leak immediately, from both sides of the screw-on connector.  So so so so so so terrible.  Now return window is over for both! Other reviewers were right that these should not be for sale.	-1
Ordered 2 lengths to use for short run between connectable sprinklers.  Both leaked (washer in place) from female connector.  Returned.  Needs better quality hardware.  Actual hose was fine.	-1
kinks easily and isn't black like what is shown in the picture. Mine arrived red	-1
The fitting leaked when attached to the dehumidifier.  I changed the washer and it still leaked.  I chopped the fitting off to use my own high quality brass fitting and noticed that the hose has an inside seam common in cheap hose, making replacing the very difficult.  Next time I'll make my own for better quality.  It did not get one star because will difficulty I could use the cheap hose material.	-1
Not what i expected.	-1
Returned this item.  It kills good and bad.  I was horrified.  It is also very loud besides the thought of fire.  When I saw a butterfly headed for this nightmare killing machine I couldn 't run out there fast enough to shut it off and return this.	-1
Poor quality. Thread brass fittings  male and female at both end are so thin and difficult to thread/screw to an outdoor pipe. The hose itself appears to be of average quality. I would recommend that you take it indoors to store over the winter and if you are on a well with a lot of minerals as i am,  perhaps take one of those old heavy brass fittings off an old hose and clamp it to this hose. From the label, looks like this made in the USA Product arrived quickly and in new condition.	-1
I purchased this to attach to my dehumidifier. Well, not only is it inflexible, but it was not long enough for my situation. (my fault for not measuring the distance between my appliance & the drainage pipe.) But even if it would reach, the hose just kept jumping back into it's coiled shape, making it impossible to stretch out. If anyone has any suggestions on how to get it to straighten out, please let me know.	-1
Fleas are smarter than humans. They have outsmart humans.	-1
Leaked at the fitting - poor quality.	-1
Does not work well unless you have a severe flea problem.  And even then it is just a band-aid.	-1
Leaks at brass fitting.... worthless. According to the other ratings these have a very high failure rate.	-1
Amazon puts words in our mouths, sadly choosing the word "hate" for a one-star rating. That is hyperbole and obnoxiousness on their part, in a passive-aggressive way to discourage one-star ratings.  I do not hate this product, but it is not made to last. Says Made in USA, but not labeled USA Origin on label. Seems like a cheap imported product - made to wear out asap so that you can buy another one for cheap. Maybe the hose was made in China and the ends were put on in the U.S.A.?  The fittings are stamped - not "cast to last". This will likely melt and corrode in direct sunlight, and may only last a year or two in the shade.  There is a distinct molding seam on the hose that is not as strong as the body of the hose, and likely that anything but lower pressures (<20psi) will cause the hose to blow out at that weak spot.	-1
failed after 3 days, side ripped out, and water pressure isn't that high.	-1
received a cheap green vinyl hose with yellow stripe. Show the ugly truth in photos	-1
I have alot of mosquitoes, and all the reviews raved.. I have heard only 2 snaps, and I sure don't have bugs to clean out. Maybe mine is defective, or something.  Guess I ll return for another one, and let you know if that works better.	-1
Bought two. They both died, really ticked me off. Ordered new bulb to see if that was it still wouldn't work. Made thru one season	-1
Honestly... these are best used in a trailer park. The scalloped edge that goes inward toward the bed is just... not attractive. They are good and flexable and quite easily bend around a sharp curved adge. I used a utility knife to cut the "ends" and it wasn't that difficult but use a new blade.  If you live north of the Mason-Dixon line... good luck pounding these in to the ground, lol! We had pebbles, yes pebbles, the size of a large marble that stiopped these from being pounded in. We finally had to just excavate to the depth we needed, set them in place and backfilled.  I don't think my remarks are a slam against the quality of the product as they work as described. I just think they look cheap, don't pound in very easily and have some seperation issues between two pieces. If you were able to pound these in, it would still be difficult to do considering you have to hook these together before you pound them in... you better have a nice sandy soil!	-1
It's alright but the large Stinger unit I have had for several years seems to zap more insects. The Stinger unit has a single 40W bulb that has a deeper purple color. I plan on switching the bulbs if the Stinger bulb fits the Flowtron and then compare results. Also the Stinger has a photocell that turns it on at dusk and off at dawn. The Flowtron stays on 24/7 unless you turn it off manually or hook a timer to it.  Above is my first review. The zapper portion quit working after 3 months. Still lights up but nothing is getting zapped. Anyone need a couple barely used Flowtron 40 watt bulbs?	-1
Too heavy	-1
Leaks.	-1
Don't waste your money. Faulty male end had water bursting from the seams.	-1
I got this to use as a hose to put on a dehumidifier and put the water up and out a drain.  The connector on the hose leaked!!!  I ended up going to ACE hardware and getting a good hose..	-1
Useless never worked - don't bother to waste your money!!	-1
don't stay attached	-1
I read another review and decided to take a chance. That review said you might get what was pictured and you might not.  I got snake eyes.  What I wanted were (as pictured) real rubber hoses that wouldn't collapse or kink. What I got was the cheap plastic stuff that collapses and kinks easily.  Caveat Emptor.	-1
Guess I got the remnant remnants. Double ended male fitting makes what I received different to what is shown and quite useless without additional fittings.	-1
I bought two of these as 15 foot length hoses online as they are hard to find at my local Home Depot or Lowes, and I needed a short hose to complete a watering system I installed. After only 3 months one of them just blew open. I admit the hose was always "open" as it was hooked to a timer. The "explosion" occurred about 1 foot from the end of the hose, so NOT at the connections. The second hose seems OK so far.	-1
useless	-1
I ordered two traps and two refills because I'm having such a bad flea problem.  They are in the optimal placements in my house and after 48 hours they haven't caught a single flea.  I'm VERY unhappy.	-1
Doesn't do anything	-1
Never got to use it at all. Brass connector leaked as soon as we connected it for the first time.	-1
This hose leaks water if sitting. I use it for my dehumidifier and noticed that my wood floors were wet due to the water coming through the hose itself.	-1
Bought this hose to be used with a utility pump I purchased in the same order.  They claim that it would not collapse when drawing water into the pump (The sides would be stiff).  Well when I got the hose it was already collapsed and flat from shipping before using and it was a very cheap piece of hose and cheap fittings, not like the picture (I know that they say colors may vary but I thought the quality would be the same as pictured.)  Would send back but not worth the effort.... Threw it out... and bought a cheap 50' hose for $9.95 at Lowes and a hose repair connector... cut it to 15' clamp on the connector and works great.  Still have 35' left to make more if needed.  Buyer beware.	-1
The threads on the connector on this hose were poorly made and I could not get it to screw onto my other hose so it leaked.  Plus if I pulled the hose taunt it would actually slip off because I could not get it to screw on very far.  Believe me, I tried and tried and so did others. I finally threw it away.  Junk!	-1
This is junk.  I never caught 1 flea with this...do not buy!  I use mine for a night light.	-1
Soapy water works much better than these. Just fill the dish part of the flea trap with a cup of water and three table spoons of detergent. Fleas instantly die in soapy water.	-1
I was so optimistic but haven't caught any fleas	-1
You are essentially buying a well-lit hotel for any flea that might randomly jump onto the sticky glue in the middle of the night. You'd be equally well-served by putting a piece of duct tape on the floor and hoping one of the critters chooses to inadvertantly commit suicide by plunging onto it. Dont throw away your money on this well-marketed junk. It doesn't attract fleas at all - it's literally just an expensive holder for sticky tape, with a light bulb to remind you how much money you just wasted. That it catches fleas in the quantities reported by top reviewers gives me great concern for what can only amount to a Biblical flood of fleas infesting their homes.  I did find that this product works very well in holding down other garbage in my trashcan, however. Please see attached photos which demonstrate this product's versatility in this regard. Other garbage has little chance of escaping from underneath this, given the weight of the electrical cord and the plastic packaging. I have not thrown this away in my exterior trashcans to test it against high winds, but it works exceptionally well indoors. Sadly, it will be trash day soon, so I will have to part with this expensive hunk of junk. Sadly, my own internal regret at being suckered in by the positive reviews will haunt me for years to come...	-1
It seems people like to review these zappers, but few, if any of them, report their geographic location. That makes it difficult to decide if this is right for you in your particular region. Let me say up front that I am in Houston. Where I live is heavily infested with mosquitoes. There is a duck pond a quarter mile away and the woods and soggy ground are rife with the biting buggers. Too bad none is attracted to this 80-Watt zapper. I use the Octenal, I have the zapper hanging from the first story eave 7 feet off the ground and horizontally 25 feet from my patio as instructed. At night, we zap an occasional moth or a fly or two. We get some mosquitoes but I think they simply blundered into the light. I leave the thing on all day and night and it does, essentially, nothing.  So it looks to me that this is a great thing for you if it works in your area. Where I am, it is useless. I've read that Lurex is a better attractant, but neither Flowtron nor anybody seems to make it for this type of zapper. If it is so good, there should be a great market for it but where is it? One would think the manufacturer would be champing at the bit to make the product work on more varieties of bug. This makes me think this zapper is more snake oil than a solution for mosquitoes.	-1
didn't do anything	-1
Waste of money.  Put out a lamp with fly paper underneath it and it will do the same thing for a fraction of the cost.	-1
Sticky paper, that's it. Nothing remarkable.	-1
Did not work.	-1
useless	-1
does not work at described.	-1
This item does catch fleas but i would only use this as a way of finding out if you have fleas it don't get rid of them at all. The light needs to be white and the plactic white also it is kind of a yellow type light the feas love white.	-1
the hummingbirds did not like it. We usually have dozens of Hummingbirds but as soon as we switched to this product rather than make our own, they stopped coming.	-1
JUNK FOOD FOR HUMMINGBIRDS. I have been reading dozens of sites on the care and feeding of hummingbirds ... they all advise against adding red dye to the nectar (which can easily be made fresh by mixing sugar and water).  Here is what the Audubon Society says: "No, red coloring is not necessary and the reddening chemicals could prove to be harmful to the birds.  Natural nectar itself is a clear solution." Don't buy this junk food! If you care for these little flying jewels, you'll provide what's healthy for them and not give them anything that could harm them.  Again the Audubon Society: "Fill the feeders with sugar water; made by combining four parts hot water to one part white [not brown] sugar, boiled for one to two minutes. Never use honey, artificial sweeteners, or red dye."	-1
These are a joke. But if your house is infested with fleas, you'll try anything. And you'll want to see the dead little things because you hate them so much.  Yes, this might show you a few of them stuck on the pad, dead or dying, and that might make you feel better to the extent that revenge functions that way, but it won't put the slightest dent into your flea problem.  So, buy this if you want to kill some fleas to make yourself feel better.  But then get over it and doing something that will really get rid of them.	-1
Truly had this placed in several areas of our house and not one flea was stuck on the sticky paper - watched over 2 weeks and nothing.  Would not recommend even those this is rather inexpensive.	-1
Construction is ok, directions are crap because they don't specify the hardware parts which would have made it quicker to assemble. Another thing that would have helped is if the stupid morons who put the hardware in the bag would put the right parts in there! I ended up having to go out and buy a bolt because instead of two each of two different lengths, they included 3 of one length and 1 of the other. It takes high levels of brain power to put parts in a bag. These people don't have it.	-1
Hummingbirds don't like it. Went back to boiling sugar and adding this for color then they liked it.	-1
This is the refill for the flea trap itself.  I've tried it in a flea-infested environment and the trap itself does not work.  Do not buy this.	-1
I was pleased until unit stopped working. Bulbs seem to be an issue with this company. I will replace but will go with another brand.	-1
Do not buy it, it is not working! All the mystical story you can see in the review is written by the manufacturer himself.	-1
expensive bag of sugar1	-1
Our hummingbirds weren't impressed with this brand, but the ANTS were. A day and a half after we put the nectar up, the feeder was caked with black ants. We accidentally fed an ant colony, which then expanded and promptly attacked our house, looking for more.  But I learned that our hummingbirds love homemade nectar, which is easy, costs a fraction of what this does, and is healthier: 1 part sugar to 4 parts hot water, cooled before serving.  In other words, 1/4 cup sugar + 1 cup clean water = hummingbird nectar. White or brown sugar is fine, but no dyes or gimmicks, just energy for hungry little birds. And that way, we can mix up small quantities as-needed, rather than leaving a large bag of ant bait hanging around the house.	-1
cheap cheap  I don't know why i have to write more to get this in, it is stupid and makes many now want to even write	-1
My little friends quit drinking here the moment I changed to this stuff. It must be awful. Never again!	-1
Had less that a week. Worked amazing for 4 days.  Now one of the bulbs don't work. Junk	-1
Bees and mice love this stuff. Hummingbirds? Not so much.	-1
bag was torn on arrival and some of the contents in the shipping box	-1
I thought this would be easier than making homemade sugar water, and in is easier but my hummingbirds did not like it.  I ended up not using much of it because the hummingbirds would drink from my homemade sugar water feeder but not from the one with this nectar.	-1
This stuff is just makes overpriced sugar water.  If you want to pay $12 for a 2 lb bag of unnecessarily colored sugar, it's your prerogative.  But there's no trick and no more effort to making nectar:  cup granulated sugar (sucrose) to each cup of water.  Boil to retard fermentation. Cool before using. Store excess in fridge.  Voila.  (This recipe *including its warning to not use red dye* is provided by the Smithsonian National Zoo's Migratory Bird Center at http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/webcam/hummingbird_nectar_recipe.cfm)	-1
I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option.	-1
I have a cat and dog.  I had a flea infestation so bad that I got bitten during my sleep all over - hands, feet, neck, body.  I thought it was mosquitoes initially.  I got this flea trap and placed it under my bed, and near the dog and did everything they said.  My animals were itching a lot all the time as I had run out of flea meds and vet was out of supply temporarily.  I DID NOT CATCH ONE SINGLE FLEA AT ANY TIME FOR 2 MONTHS OF USE IN VARIOUS ROOM, NEAR DOG, UNDER CABINET, UNDER BED - NADA, ZERO, NIZ, NYET, NON!!!  This manufacturer needs to be reported to FTC for making false claims on products.  Utterly useless, DO NOT BUY!  Here is how to eliminate fleas: do it myself pestcontrol Online - Order Talstar Pesticide and Ultracide for spraying your mattress.  Do not spray pet bedding - wash it instead.  Smell is too strong for animals.  Vacuum your house as if your life depended on it!!  Vacuum floors, carpets, crevices, mattresses, under cabinets, etc.  Throw away vacuum bag at end of first vacuum, then weekly.  spray Ultracide inside vacuum bag to kill fleas as they hatch and store vacuum outside your house.  Spray house and yard with Talstar using a 2-3 gal pump sprayer like Chapin.  Mix and spray.  Kills all bugs outside too!  Do not spray flowers or edibles.  Spray perimeter of house, driveway, cracks in concrete, ant hills, etc.  Avoid earthworms.  Repeat in one week to kill hatchling fleas.  Let dry before letting pets back in.  Has no smell.  Spray your mattress with Ultracide and under cabinets.  This has a strong smell. Do not spray this near animals as they have sensitive noses!  Let dry and aerate house.  Wash animals with Eqyss Microtek Shampoo and Eqyss Premiere Conditioner. Give dogs Comfortis orally once a month.  Give cats Revolution applied to skin once a month.  On Amazon, buy Nitenpyram ($1 per tab) from Little City Dogs, which is generic for Capstar ($6 per tab).  This works for 24 hrs only and kills fleas instantly. Give animals orally (2 sizes) at the same time you are spraying house so all fleas die that day!  You can give them Nitenpyram same time as other flea meds, no problem.  Give animals another dose next day then after one week, so you keep zapping new hatchlings.  This should eliminate fleas for 6 months till the next spraying.  I spray 2 times per year and keep my animals on monthly flea meds plus Nitenpyram as needed.	-1
You are better off buying dish soap a plate and putting it next to a lamp. If fact I did this and the dish soap caught more fleas then these things.	-1
This device might have some beneficial application for someone somewhere but not so much for me.  It is a very cheap plastic bowl with a small night light bulb that screws into the top.  Adhesive paper is placed inside.  Fleas are attracted to the light and the warmth.  The fleas hop into the bowl and get stuck on the sticky paper.  I caught between 30 and 50 fleas before the bulb burned out(three days after purchase) in my unit.  The same amount of money could have been better spent on some permethrin based insecticide. This is more of a gimmick or a toy.  I knew that ahead of time but I like gadgets so I bought one.  I am disappointed that the manufacturer didn't at least use a higher quality bulb in the flea trap.  My advice is not to buy this device.  Your money will be better spent on some quality insecticide.	-1
Red dye kills the hummingbirds! Do some research before purchasing this deadly product! The red dye in this product is killing hummingbirds.. Shame on amazon for carrying this product.	-1
waste of money! they don;t tell you that you need to buy their trays of pest control, otherwise is not attracting anything	-1
DO NOT use that red-dyed hummingbird food. It is harmful to both humans and hummingbirds. Besides, it makes no difference in attracting hummingbirds and its expensive.  Also hummingbirds lovers: DO NOT use honey to make nectar for hummingbirds. Honey ferments and causes a deadly bacterium in hummingbirds. Table sugar most closely resembles the nectar found in flowers. This is the feeding method of choice by every hummingbird researcher I know. It is very important to clean your feeders out frequently in the summer heat. The nectar can spoil in the heat and cause illness for the hummingbirds. Aim for every other day.  Here you can find more info: http://www.ecosystemgardening.com/is-sugar-bad-for-hummingbirds.html	-1
I don't see a difference at all, we followed the instructions and even put the mosquito attractant but still have so many of them. I don't like the product. We ended up spraying product with the hose and that worked much better for us.	-1
There are studies out there that are inconclusive as to weather the red dye in these sugar feeder foods are harmful to Hummers. Why would you take the chance?? The Hummers are attracted to the anything red! Since all Hummer feeders have a red plastic base you will have no trouble attracting these beautiful small birds with a feeder using plain sugar water without the dye in it. I have been successfully feeding Hummers all season with clear sugar water and I have many birds to my feeder. They even buzzed my red umbrella when I opened it the other day!	-1
My birds won't touch it.	-1
This light did a great job while it was working but it did not last very long, My bug lights in the past have lasted at least three years or longer. This one only lasted one summer. I have changed the black light bulb did not fix problem, now I have ordered a starter bulb to see if this will do the job. By the way I have already spend more than half of what the light cost in the beginning. Light is working again see photo.	-1
I hate to say this, my hummingbirds don't like this product.  Going to return and just make up sugar water at 1 cup water to 1/4 cup sugar instead and hope my little birds come back.  Not happy, it was just as one other reviewer said, all you need is to make your own your own and the correct measurements.	-1
It stopped working after only 3 months of use.	-1
Most of them are bent so Lid does not close properly.	-1
Horrible!!!	-1
I have 3 different kinds of human mouse traps.  This is the only one that has never caught a mouse.  Also, it is very difficult to check because you can't really see under the hinged doors through the little air holes.  Overall, this trap is inferior to many others on the market.	-1
caught a few mice, But they quickly figured out how to take the bait and run. That makes the mice smarter than me because I can't figure out how the little houdinis do it.	-1
I won't recommend this product. Only kills bugs that won't bug you in the first place.	-1
After entering the trap, the mouse ate all the food, then it was able to pull down the entrance of the trap (after he was inside) and walk out. I heard the entire thing, scratching the metal and pulling the lever to get out, then going back for seconds.  He struggled a little to exit, but he got out when he was ready. Even left me a puddle of pee at the entrance of the trap. freaken jerk. Not strong enough for a smart mouse.	-1
Did not catch anything!	-1
Caught the most with this one	-1
Worked well initially. One entrance spring broke within a week of starting to use it and mice were not trapped. I would have returned it but delayed using it until the return deadline had passed  My fault.	-1
Poor quality design doesn't zap anything.	-1
I'm puzzled where the flaw is in this trap.  It's all metal, so it certainly removes the mouse's ability to chew their way out.  Yet I'm having the same mystery as so many others here:  mice get in, they eat the bait leaving a mess inside.  The get out however.  I've looked it over, applied tape to the cover to prevent a strong mouse from pushing his way up and out.  The tape doesn't not prevent escape.  So the lid must not be the flaw.  The entrance mechanisms must be where the mice are exploiting some flaw, I have yet to find it.  I'd recommend against investing any money in this trap.	-1
These are NOT humane traps!  Invariably, a mouse in the trap will try to squeeze under the trap door and suffocate.  Very poor design; the old spring-wound tin cats were much better.  Do not buy these if you want to prevent killing the mice.	-1
It has sat empty and baited for weeks now, while the other trap I set has already caught three mice.	-1
Just an overly expensive product made with the cheapest components available. Lasts about six months and fails. Look elsewhere, this one is junk and a rip off. It doesn't even deserve one star, but.....	-1
Mediocre bug killer. After a while, bugs do build up on the screen and don't fall thru as expected. Doesn't appear to have a lot of power to attract or kill bugs. My older model could zap a beetle, but this one.........	-1
We had a trap very similar to this a few years ago. That trap worked like a charm! This trap, not so much. In fact, it's possible that the little mice just went in and out of it? We did catch two in a different trap right alongside this one after a few unsuccessful days with it. Returning this product today.	-1
first use results == ... and when i checked on the trap it had mouse droppings and an evidently uneatable muffin piece the mice chose not to eat (ever wonder when a human food isn't eaten by mice, what exactly could be wrong with it?) compared with the other food (so proof the mice did visit/get inside) and that was it, so all i did was serve some scraps to the mice cause it was empty!  i have used the plastic box traps (3 alive, 1 dead and full of flaws) before i tried this one.  if a mouse can come in and out then its not a trap.  i will use it again and maybe checking every 4-6 hours and not 12 hours means i can catch the mouse before they exit?  but folks i am at my wits end trying all humane traps, and understand why folks with real, real, mouse problem just use the death traps... its depressing opening your humane trap only to find thank you poop... the plastic window version makes a lot of sense, but its easy to peek into the sides of this trap.  it looks constructed well, however this entry ramp thingy into it is two way.  <<a month later and again the food is gone as is the mice, for some reason this trap has zero success compared to those that loved it -- wonder if smaller mice, like the standard house mouse i have caught with other products can escape back out through the ramp, so right now one last try then i throw this away as "useless".  maybe mine has a flaw in the auto shut capabilities of the ramp - its the only way in and out.  either way ALL FOOD gone, NO MICE inside>>	-1
My husband wanted this grill because it had good reviews. After we got it one of the legs came pretty bent in but we didn't want to return the product already because we needed it for the weekend. Another downside is that the lid doesn't latch on to anything so when grilling and the lid is hot you have to hold the lid in your hand. Thats very inconvenient because you cant put it down since its hot so that leaves you only one hand to grill with. Pretty disappointed.	-1
Worked great for a few months them half of it died. Tried replacing bulb but it wasn't the bulb. Continued to use until a few months later when the other side died too.  Tried replacing bulb for that side but not luck. Sad because it worked great for bugs for a few months even with only one side still working. Disappointed	-1
Mice would not go in this thing. Complete waste of your money.	-1
needs a clear window on top so you know if there is a mouse in there or not, otherwise, you open it to check and the mouse jumps out.  Or you waste you time driving out to the fields far from your house and find there is NO mouse in there.  Buy the one with the window on top	-1
so far has caught nothing	-1
ridiculous pricing on these new Webers... where once you could get a 22" model for less than $70, the company now charges (and never discounts) upwards of $100 or more  have to agree with other reviewers about:  bad quality control -  issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sized  poor material choices - older models had really nice hardwood handles, but the newer models have the molded plastic crapola handles...  loose fit overall - something seems amiss at the factory - models are not assembling with as tight tolerances as in the past  Weber used to be a solid name in the U.S. charcoal grill market - i'm afraid that this reputation is slipping down a steep slope of obscurity if the QC continues to slide  i recommend:  1. better quality control 2. standard hinged grates for all models (you will win big fans) 3. better tolerances 4. revert to hardwood on handles ('handles' heat better - get it?)  btw, i use cheap aluminum round cake pans in the ash catcher - works better than an expensive model upgrade to catch and remove waste charcoal	-1
50% trap rate I'd guess.  Half the time, the mice eat the food, leave a load of poop, and figure out how to escape by pulling the little ramp down. This is not a sure thing.  I have rigged it to make it better, and it seems to have upped my catch rate from about 20% to 50%. Will check with a different brand, this trap needs more time in design and testing.  Unless I just have been blessed with a house full of brilliant mice.	-1
Once side will not close. Item is defective.	-1
I bought it in hoping for killing the mosquitoes in backyard, but I doubt it had any effect. A friend jokes that it might just attract all the mosquitoes within a mile to me, instead of killing them. So, in the end, I might get more mosquitoes in my yard, unless every family around is using it.	-1
mice get out	-1
I recently purchased this trap & began using it immediately, since I have had an infestation. It took a while to finally catch a mouse or two (a few times) but then all of a sudden, the bait was chewed up and no mouse inside. How on earth did they get out is what I would like to know? Does this mean that my trap is no longer working? I clean it after each use, since the mouse dung reeks and I am allergic to it if I touch it. This is now my second have a heart that has failed. I am giving it one more go ahead tonight. They love popcorn with nutritional yeast on it! I am considering buying another type. Any recommendations?	-1
Worked great for about 10 months, then quit. Amazon replaced it and two months later the replacement quit working.	-1
No matter what I put into this trap, the mice don't like it.	-1
I purchased way too many of these items. Not a one works so far. Formerly I had a type with a clear top and I had success then.	-1
Mice apparently do not like the cold clammy metal on their itty bitty feet.  Never would go inside. So it was a waste of money.  I would not recommend this trap.	-1
Updated review 7/6/17: After only four years of light use and excellent care, this unit broke. Their manual says the transformer would have to be replaced. The cost for the transformer is - you guessed it - almost as much as a new unit. I've contacted the manufacturer to see if they can do anything. Will update this review once I receive a response.  Old review: ZZZZZZAP bugs are gone.  Very effective.  Greatly reduced bugs flying in my face when I'm out with a flashlight.	-1
We're very disappointed in this product.  We have a mouse infestation and the HaveAHeart traps are the only ones we find that work successfully on a regular basis.  This Victor trap for some reason is not working.  We make sure we secure the lid really well (they got out the first time when we evidently did not have it tight enough).  Some how, they were getting in, removing the peanut butter/choc. chip delight and leaving.  So with this trap we have been housing and feeding these ingenious little critters.  We have to quit using this device since it just isn't working and we can't figure out exactly why.  We are terribly terribly disappointed because although the HaveAHeart traps are excellent, they only trap one mouse at a time.  Which means with an infestation, you are losing the battle - fast!!	-1
Mice avoid this trap regardless of if it is baited or not.  I placed the trap along a know mouse trail without bait as instructed.  Plenty of mice as evidenced by fresh dropping but after a week not a single mouse.  I then baited the trap with the fish food they were after.  After another week no a single mouse.  I will try another location this week but do not expect any better results.  My guess is that the very small trap entrances are probably too small for mice.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  AVOID THIS ITEM.	-1
