These work great on bugs, mice and shrews, the things I have caught with them.... if you accidentally step on one though, you are in trouble.. it is not coming off... You are supposed to fold them up but I leave them flat to catch more stuff...  with animals and small children I suppose that would be a problem	1
These are the cheapest unscented/un-baited sticky traps I've found.  They work fine for catching things (such as cockroaches) that don't need an attractant.	1
These work pretty well. Only seem to catch bugs if folded. Caught mice, a snake and even a small dog on the flat ones.	1
so easy and efficient to use.	1
Great product for the price.  Very versatile and effective	1
The Victor Tin Cat Mice Glue Boards are extremely sticky and they have worked very well at catching critters in my workplace. We've had an infestation of mice, crickets, lizards and several other pests this year, but these glue boards are doing the trick. Once the mice stop dead in their tracks, just toss the glue board in the garbage and place another one.	1
Works well, board is very sticky with enough glue- free space around edge to handle. They are non toxic which is positive though if you catch an animal using these, they die over time which is les humane than other types of traps. you have several options for how to use them, laying flat or folding	1
Great	1
Best thing I've found for trapping roaming brown recluses.	1
great product at the right price	1
Leave them out when you are away on vacation.  (Mice will play when the cat's away!)	1
Have tried before works well. Good price.	1
Bought these based on customer reviews. We're become the Go To place for mice and needed a boss product to get rid of them. The glue pads arrived the next day, they get five stars for delivery but two for the glue pads. Maybe they grow 'em stronger here in Tennessee but the mice extract themselves from the glue. We got one but only because he was still struggling to get free. So far they've left their mark on four - see photos of two of them. I folded the edge up and placed them where we know they run. I'd like a refund.	-1
they work if the mice don't chew the cardboard and get away ... darn things are smarter than average I guess.....	1
Very good mice and buds.	1
great	1
no complaints	1
These are super easy to place around and to my knowledge, they are not toxic.  They just have a real sticky goo inside that will stop and spider or bug and probably even mice in there tracks.  Put them in closets, behind the couch, and under the bed.  Any place you may find bugs.  I was given a couple of these by a professional bug guy and they worked so well, I decided to buy some here.  Same quality, just a bit smaller but I don't think that matters as the bugs can only take a couple steps before they are stuck.	1
some mouse lost some hair- but that was about all that got trapped in here!	-1
Once they get on, they don't get away.	1
I have an old house that came with roaches. I use a razor to cut the sheets into smaller pieces. They work. 9.5" x 4".	1
This is the "better mousetrap."  Seems obvious, once someone put the sticky on cardboard, yet no one did it until now.  Great price per.	1
they works but the mice crys  i hate it	1
Works great	1
works great	1
I have used these for a couple of years now and they are excellent for the occasional spider or cricket.  I leave them flat and place in obscure locations (behind fridge, behind toilets, etc).  It seems to me that folding them just reduces their effectiveness.  Strong enough that I have caught mice and a grass snake on them in the garage.  Compared to the prices you pay in supermarkets and big box stores these are such a low price.	1
So far caught mice, spiders, misc. bugs, and a snake.  Used Veg Oil to remove the snake.	1
I had mice get caught in them, but I mainly use them to catch bugs. Placed in inconspicuously around the house, it is amazing how many bugs get trapped. To think that so many bugs are normally unseen and crawling around the house is sickening. In a garage, they get completely full of bugs in a couple of months. No bait needed.	1
great item, great stickiness.  catches all my little nasty creepy crawlers coming thru garage door opening	1
I literally just watched a mouse traverse directly over the top of the board and all I have now is a tiny mouse paw-print to show for my troubles. The one thing a sticky trap has to do is stick, and this one doesn't stick. Five stars for nice cardboard and easy to peel back, negative infinity stars for not doing the thing it's supposed to do.	-1
These boards are great for just placing in corners for insect/rodent monitoring or for use in the TinCat Mouse Trap.	1
Either I don't have any bugs, mice, scorpions-which I do, I see them elsewhere-or they are all avoiding these boards, because I have had one cricket and some very small bugs on one board for a month--nothing else.  I saw a wolf spider get 3 legs on one board, still moving-I didn't want to pick it up till it seemed dead-and 3 days later the spider had escaped!!!!  Now I have an angry huge wolf spider lurking!  And I sure never caught a mouse.	-1
Works great.  Had mice in garage, caught some first day I laid down glue boards.  Price much lower than other brands, would buy again.	1
Hideous and cruel - should be illegal.	-1
LOVE these easy to use and easy to get rid of Mice Glue Boards,,, me doggies don't brother them and work really well. Buy these as the best deal going I tell you.	1
I would buy this again. If you fold it up as the picture it's better cuz it's sticky all around so if the mouse moves it gets stuck to the top or side and can't runaway.	1
I placed these strategically in the pathway of field mice. The mice are three for three. I return to find evidence that the mouse was caught, moved around in with the glue trap stuck to it and then chewed up the cardboard to free itself. I think these would work well with insects but it is a tough sell for mice. It is too easy for them to free themselves. While the mice were three for three with these I have been three for three with the traditional mouse traps. I'm sticking with them - no pun intended.	-1
Glue traps cause hours of torture for targeted and untargeted animals.  Imagine being stuck, unable to move --- struggling until you die from exhaustion, or dehydration, or you starve. Animals caught on glue traps are first filled with terror, not understanding what has happened to them; they are also separated from their young; what ensues is hours of suffering and prolonged death. There is simply no excuse for this kind of cruel device to be sold to the public when there are alternative ways to get "pests" out of homes. Mice, kittens, birds, squirrels, reptiles --- any and every small animal unfortunate enough to come across a glue trap has been caught and doomed.  How many suffer the pangs of hell in these sadistic traps every year is unimaginable.	-1
What is here to say, they are a sticky mouse trap.	1
This is a poor pest control method, no matter how you feel about rats, mice, birds, snakes, spiders, etc. You have to be really detached to not empathize with anything caught in these traps, and you're likely to catch anything but the pest you're trying for. I used a similar trap when frustrated by flies swarming my dog's food. I caught very few flies and one very lovely little bird. I couldn't decide whether it was better that the dogs had found it first and killed it, or if I might have been able to end its life in a more humane way. Getting it out of the trap was impossible, even dead. I've seen these traps in an attic, they had all sorts of little critters stuck to them. Fortunately for me most of them were dead when I came across them. The one that wasn't, I couldn't help. I'm not an animal rights activist. I eat meat and believe in the order of life. But to use traps that glue an animal down and make it slowly starve or die of thirst is simply wrong. These are inexpensive and convenient, and maybe in special circumstances necessary, but I believe there are several better options. These should be used only as a last resort.	-1
So i bought these based on value and reviews.  i set about 30 of them all over basement anywhere i figured spiders and mice may be.  I have two cats so to be honest i didn't think i had mice.  It was spiders and bugs i wanted to get rid of but just to be safe put in places where mice may be.  I set them up about a week and half ago.  and today i was just looking here and there where i thought mice may be and they are clean.  i found a few w/ spider in them and a fly.  and than up top along the wooden beams i see something furry sticking out and i got flash light and bam sure enough not one but two mice.  seems like i have more of mice problem than spider problem.  so now i reset like 6 more traps along the beams to see if there are more.  these are easy to assemble and do have a distinct peanut butter smell.	1
Waste of time.  Put out 20 of these in a room where I had a mouse, and nothing for 3 days.  Put down a plain old Victor spring trap with a dab of peanut butter on the trip, and had the little mouse in an hour.	-1
Watched mice run through them....good for catching dust and tiny bugs on HOT DAYS	-1
these are great at catching spiders good items	1
Will never be without these. great for garage, house and outbuildings.	1
Work amazing! Excellent price. I didn't realize how many critters sneak around your house until this year I had an odd experience with crickets wanting in. Well it caught them all, along with other things. I leave them down behind stoves and under furniture where I won't see or step on them because good luck getting it off your foot!	1
This was a reorder. I recommend that you do all the bends first.  Than remove the paper to expose the sticky.  Slide it into the slot and press the tab into the sticky.  This will make the set-up easier and prevent it from opening up later on.  I also bend and flex it so the back of the trap fits the angle tightly.  You will be surprised what you catch in this.  Wonderful product and well worth the money invested.	1
Effective and good price	1
I use these for spider traps in my house and they work perfectly.	1
Been catching the brown recluse left & right with these. Super happy customer	1
Lay them flat...it is amazing what small bugs crawl over and are caught.....have not had a problem with mice.  However, did catch a small one a few years ago.  We keep these under furniture in basement level of home...Good value for the number of traps.	1
Love these; I started with the banana boards and then got these. Using these with Tomcat bait. Together, they are THE BEST. Keep your pets & kids safe!  Sprinkle the Tomcat pellets around the edges of the sticky boards, since the mice like to chew the board and glue and then get away. Takes a bit of time, but get yourself some Playtex gloves and sprinkle the pellets around the glue edges -- I have also stuck a block of bait in the middle of the cards and got results as well.	1
Little critters don't. Easy to dispose of. Watch out your pets don't get a paw stuck on them. Mine did -- poor thing ran all over the place until she dislodged it-- I was not home at the time. She was ok.	1
These are a must have for our garage, we use them to catch bugs and critters before they get into our garage/house. Works like a charm!	1
Love these boards.  I have them everywhere in my home. They catch rodents & bugs very well.	1
very good	1
good way to go to control insects, thanks	1
Smells good and great sticky	1
good for catching flies	1
Performs as advertised. Also catches garter snakes.	1
Love this product	1
I don't give too many 5 star ratings - but these boards are great. I catch mice, bugs, spiders - anything that moves in my garage or basement is fair game. My next door neighbor didn't think he had a bug problem, put a couple in his garage and they are both billed with bugs and he caught a mouse. I put these down preemptively to catch bugs  and mice that want to make a home in my home.	1
This is very inhumane product.  I had a mice problem on a 6th floor high rise apt. !!  The maintenance man introduced me to this.  One little cute mouse did not get the memo and ended up on one of these.  I felt sorry for the little creature, but he was stuck on this and ended up dying just hours later from the stress.  Since I am single with no pets, I have decided to place moth balls around the stove where they were coming from.  For small mice, this works like a charm.  Only problem is that moth balls in large numbers can be quite toxic, and I did have a really bad nightmare where this stuff must have gotten into my brain, but I must've grown immune because I've had no problems since.	-1
Catch-master Peanut Butter Scented Glue Board  To use a glue board, simply peel off the plastic film, and put in place.  The glue is extremely sticky, so handle it with care.  We have a small storage building that crickets love and these glue boards catch those critters by the dozens.  We replace the full boards every couple of months in warm weather.  Use scissors to make smaller glue boards before removing the plastic film.  One note of caution though; if you have a curious pet and they get stuck to this thing, they will make a ruckus trying to get free.  One board we left outside overnight had feathers on it the next day, so these things can be harmful to birds.  You also wouldn't want to use them where children might touch them.  The peanut butter smell isn't too noticeable with one glue board, but the open box of boards stunk so bad, I bought a waterproof plastic box to store them in.  Don't expect it to solve your critter problem overnight.  Leave it in place, and keep replacing a glue board as it fills or gets dirty.  We don't have mice in our area, so I can't attest to its rodent catching ability.  This product works for crickets and other bugs!	1
If you have very large hands, it's perfect. Otherwise another smaller model like the 8 or the 6 will be a lot easier for you to use. I thought I have large hands but my fingers are a bit too short for this model to be ideal. Very high quality construction.	1
I have avoided Felco pruners for years and stayed with Corona shears because of price. I still think they are over priced, but they are truly superior to my next favorite, Corona pruning shears.  If you just like the best, work as a gardener, landscaper or an orchard; spend the extra and get these Felco shears. They are awesome! If you want a great occasional use pruning shear, and you are price sensitive, look at the Corona shears or the Felco knock-off shears at Costco. BTW, the Costco shears look exactly like Felco, but I tried them and there is no comparison.	1
You will love these easy grip easy pressure clippers.  A bit expensive but I wanted something that would last and reading other reviews I was not disappointed.  They work great and I highly worth the investment.	1
These bird spikes are worth the extra cost over ones made with plastic bases. These will last for years with their all metal construction. They have solved my problem with flickers destroying my eaves. I used screws to attach them (they have holes for fasteners). I only wish they came in a longer length.	1
Number of strips was perfect for the top of the front porch column where they were nesting. I used "Liquid Nails" in a caulk tube to hold them down. The male flew back once, could not land, and never came back!	1
NOT GOOD THEY DID NOT EVEN SPROUT I PLANTED THEN IN MIRACLE GROW POTTING SOIL AND SO FAR I STILL HAVE NOTHING. SO MUCH FOR THAT.	-1
These seeds really sprouted for me this year. They are ready, here in North Carolina, to put in the ground now.  I started them in a Jiffy "mini greenhouse" tray with clear cover and peat pots = transferred to slightly larger pots after they had a good 3 to 5 strong sprouts in each tiny peat pot.  I have, from this packet of seeds ( a lot of seeds, by the way) about 20 very strong, healty Beefsteak tomato plants (after thinning about half the sprouts that were weaker ones). I've tried for several years to get a tomatoe plant strong enough to put into my red clay + compost southern NC garden from just seed. These should compete well with most any "sto'-bought" tomato plants available here.	1
Received seeds in good condition and they are current, not out of date stock. Too early to plant but if there is a problem, I'll come back and update my review. I've not had any problems with Ferry Morris in the past, so I expect good results this year as well.	1
The soil was prepared, the containers readied, the lights placed and the seeds planted.  The little sprouts appeared in May along with varieties of vegetables in several containers.  And then, after about three weeks they all died.  I am sure it was something in the soil and will use the rest of the seeds for next years batch & hope for a better result.  I give the rating this year as the sprouts did appear and began to grow.  I think their demise is due to my lack of developed horticultural skills.	1
For the last couple of years I have been growing a couple of tomato plants on my patio in large pots.  Until last year I waited to plant my tomatoes plants until the end of May as cold frosty night we get kill tomatos that are planted too early.  I started with the seeds, which I germinate on a dinner plates covered with wet paper towels, and then covered by another dinner plate.  This technique produces very reliable good results.  Last year I decided to see if I can start growing tomatos earlier by using an umbrella green house.  I was not sure whether the umbrella would provide sufficient warmth, as my plants are located on the wooden deck with air circulating in spaces between the wooden slats.  If the umbrella was placed on the ground would provide a warmer environment. My tomatoes plants are watered by the drip irrigation system on a timer.  The umbrella fit perfectly over the pots as well as the drip irrigation tubes  coming into the pots.  I left the umbrella on the plants during the days and the nights, lifting only to fertilize the plants every two weeks. The umbrella handle comes with a removal stake which can be planted into the ground which I did not use since my pots and umbrella were sitting on a wooden deck. I positioned the stick next to the pot, rather than inside it.  And was able to have two plants covered by one umbrella. The plants grew rapidly and survived well through a number of frosty nights we had since early April.  By the beginning of May both of my plants had several flower clusters.  I was concerned about pollination, since my plants were under an umbrella and no well meaning bee could get to the flowers.  After doing a bit of research I found that either insects, wind or hand shaking of the flowers would carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma.  I found that some people use electric toothbrush placed near the blossoms to simulate buzzing bees.  But I went with a simpler method: shaking the plant gently once a week for self-pollination.  The tomato pollen is not in the exterior of the anthers like most flowers but is produced internally and then released thru pores in the anther. Motion is required to release the pollen, and the greatest quantity is released by sonication of the "correct" frequency.  When you shake the plant by hand try to mimic the natural resonances of sonicating bee. Shaking should not be violent, just as close to the right frequency as possible. Note that using implement like a cue tip or a brush is not very effective because the tomato's pollen is not on the surface.  In the last week of May last year (2010) I noticed the first tomatoes on my plants which is pretty incredible for the cold North East!  I felt like a proud mother since I polinated the plants myself with a technique described above :-)  I am attaching a photo of tomato plants under the umbrella, that allowed me to get an early start on the season.  Update 5/21/11:  I live in the Northeast, close to New Hampshire/Massachusetts border. This morning I noticed my first green tomato!  The tomato plants are about 3 feet tall and have several flower clusters.  A friend of mine and I started growing tomatos on the same day, but he does not use a pop up green house.  I visited his house this weekend and his tomatos are still little dwarves compared to mine!  This pop-up greenhouse really works!	1
Did not grow well. Thank goodness I picked up other plants elsewhere.	-1
pretty good	1
Planted, tomatos grew, and they were delicious.  It's been a while since I planted them, but I remember being satisfied with the yield and the overall crop.	1
a lot of leaves grew but no flowers and no tomatoes. I may give it a shot next year. If it works, I may come back and change this review.	-1
A great price and almost all of the seeds came up just fine and am exspecting fruit anyday now. Thanks	1
Shipped very fast and the item was exactly as described.  I have planted my seedlings and will wait to see what happens.	1
these seeds are great, they produced tons of large delicious tomatoes in my garden last season, I had so many tomatoes I had to give a lot of them to the people in my community. and after harvest it is time for some good cooking in the kitchen, here is a great book full of delicious home cooked recipes.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Grandmas-Delicious-Recipes-Home-cooking-good-enough-to-share/dp/1481055704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Grandmas Delicious Recipes: Home cooking good enough to share!</a>	1
Order came promptly and correct. I would revisit this vendor if I needed something else. This was a good experience.	1
Don't Recommend this company's product to anyone.  Seed will not grow.  Their other product are the same way.  Do not recommend to any one.	1
This seed stock is excellent. I have had 97-99% germination every seed flat. I have a bumper crop. This is one of "thee best" hybrid cultivars I have used. The plants when staked can easily grow up to 5-6' even while bearing 3-6 tomato bunches. Mmmm Mmmm Good. My first week of picking I pulled 20 tomatoes from a 16 foot row.	1
nice set up to hide the unsightly garbage and recycling bins. Was easy to put together and am growing a clematis against it for added plus. it is sturdy enough so far to support the young vine. hopefully also when grown.	1
a	1
Bought 2 of them, good quality.	1
Product as described and arived in good condition easy to put together and looks great	1
Beautiful.  Easy to put together.	1
I love the look of this trellis! It was super easy to put together. The ground anchors are more than sufficient to hold it steady. It's perfect for the bit of privacy we needed at our back door.	1
This trellis is total assembly.  The vertical slats need to fit through openings in the horizontal slats.  Those openings are very, very tight and not lined up properly.  I am having to cut the plastic openings with a razor knife and hammer through, and the s;at openings are not lined up straight.  If I wasn't already part way through assembling, I would return.	-1
I bought 12 of these Trellis's & absolutely love them-they came on time--all pieces intact & I-a woman--put them together one at a time on my living room floor-pretty easy once I figured out what was easiest for me!  I needed some privacy as a neighbor had put in windows along side of her home-looking out into my patio & yard- I have planted orange honeysuckle to run along the trellis-it-is looking beautiful-	1
Great look, holds up to weathering very well, sturdy, but light weight.  I will buy another.	1
I've bought several trellises and arbors from this company, and I love their products. This trellis was so easy to put together, and once together it felt very sturdy. How easy was it?  I'm a tiny woman, and I was able to assemble the trellis and anchor it in the ground by myself. Now that it's installed, it looks great.  I'm ordering another just like it today.	1
Very nice trellis better than I expected and very easy to put together.	1
I ordered two of these for a rambling rose bush and am very happy with the purchase.  The trellis was well packaged and the assembly instructions were very clear.  Assembly does require some manual dexterity and a third hand was helpful during parts of the assembly.  I will admit that the assembly of the second trellis was a bit more smooth that the first one.  After installation, it is very stable.  Recommended.	1
Great little bench for the price.  I needed some benches at the equestrian center.  I was worried these would be too light in the wind, but even in strong winds, they don't move. Well made.  A lot of quality for the price and they look nice.	1
I bought one of these for my yard a year ago.  It is great and looks brand new.  I am going to order a second one for another part of my yard.	1
For the price it is what I expected. Assembly was easier than expected.	1
Easy to assemble, durable.	1
I'm really tired of garden hose nozzles that break or don't work properly.  I ordered this on a whim and it is great.  It is easy to use and control the flow of water.  It's solid and it won't break. In fact, my adult supervision (wife of 35 years) asked me to order a second one - she really likes it, too (that's more than a miracle in and of itself...).  But you have discontinued the item.  Get these back in stock - they are well worth it....	1
great	1
I bought this over a year ago and it's tough and solid. During that same time I've had several cheap-o nozzles on another hose fall apart.	1
The best and most effective sprinkler on the market.	1
Bought one of these locally about four years ago at a home show and indeed it has proven to be highly durable and versatile!  Almost every other watering wand or spray nozzle sold these days is cheap crap that sometimes doesn't survive even one season of use. I am happy to pay this price for quality, especially Made in USA.  The height of waste and environmental degradation is poor quality merchandise that goes quickly to the landfill and does not justify the resources used to manufacture, package and ship it!  My first nozzle still looks and works like new; I wanted this second one to have in the back yard so I don't have to hike back and forth from front to back yard to get my favorite nozzle.	1
Best hose nozzle I've used.  From a drizzle to a long powerful spray.	1
Works well and willing to buy again. Shipping good.	1
High quality, great for all chores from watering potted plants to hosing down the deck.	1
WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE BEST NOSE NOZZLE ON THE MARKET TODAY! TRULY IS "THE ULTIMATE" AS THE MANUFACTURER CLAIMS : ))) - Never leaks - Never spurts - Never rusts or wears out YOU WILL ONLY BE LEFT THINKING . . . WHY DIDN'T I FIND THIS NOZZLE SOONER FOR ALL MY WATERING NEEDS? I was so happy with the one that I bought for our home in CA, than I gave it as a gift to my fmaily back in Wis. And, guess what?  THEY LOVE IT AND RAVE ABOUT IT TOO : ))) Hope this was helpful to all of you out there that have been let down with other non-performing nozzle products out there that simply do not stand up to the test of time and usage. I assure you, you won't be disappointed with this little gem! Mary V. in San Diego, CA	1
Not As expected !	-1
Does not work well for the price. i do not recommend it.	-1
Best hose nozzle I have ever used! I have gardened for years and have used every kind of nozzle. They end up leaking, breaking or falling apart. Not this one! I have used them for five years and they remain unclogged and dribble-free. I love this nozzle! Just a twist of the nozzle and many different kinds of flow are available, from a jet to a dribble and everything in between. This is made so well. It is so tough! I can see many, many years of continued use!	1
Nice.	1
Great product would buy again	1
LOVE this nozzle.  sounds stupid but this is 4th one I have bought - two for my house and two as gifts. closes in both directions (from jet and fan)  no drips.  projects pretty far.  nice,  thick rubber.  had the first pair for two years and still works perfectly	1
Durable.	1
water stars leaking at the end connecting to the hose, after less than a year... it's not even under any sun light.  Quality is bad	-1
Love these. Have replace all four of my old hose sprayers with this. Excellent spray control. Don't rust. Can't recommend them highly enough. Won't use anything else.	1
these are the best nozzles	1
Works fine. I hope it will keep working.	1
This is a handsome well-made lightweight nozzle, but it is LOW FLOW... only about 50% of the  flow of the "HOSECOIL FIREHOSE NOZZLE" I previously ordered, which I got TWO for the price of this Bon-Aire. I'm sending mine back...	-1
I've used this bee and wasp killer before it really works.  If spayed exactly on the Little kritters it kills them instantly.  We also had some borring instects along our outdoor fish tanks just spray into the creave  begone.  I love  this product and highly recommend buying to all looking for a perfect  insect begonew	1
The last thing you want inside your home is a bee or wasp nest. This is my second nest inside my home. The first yellow jacket nest was taken out by a professional pest control service which cost 200.00 and replacement of a portion of my popcorn drywall ceiling. Total damages about 400.00. The second one I took out for about 70.00. If you have a yellow jacket nest, they can sting you over and over, so be careful and make sure that you don't have an allergic reaction to bee stings; otherwise you could end up in the hospital or dead. Take a picture of one of the bees and search Google images to find out exactly what type of bee or wasp that you are dealing with. Honey bees and wasps and carpenter bees can only sting you once; one yellow jacket bee can sting you over and over again. With that said, I did this at night; that is when all of the bees are in the nest. They were coming in under my vinyl siding, thru the brick mortar (yes, they can go thru brick mortar, wood, siding and just about anything except steel) and into my drop down ceiling in my basement. I first tried the Delta dust with a bee duster from outside under the siding which would have probably worked, if I could of got the dust into the nest. I couldn't. So, I removed one if the ceiling tiles, wore a bee keepers hat (7.99 here at Amazon), 2 pairs of gloves, thick clothing, a winter coat, boots and a respirator mask. I pulled away the home insulation gently after removing the ceiling tile in the basement, with a 4 foot Nifty Nabber (also here on Amazon) to get to the nest. At this point, about 10 guard bees flew out right at me and into the basement. I killed them all with a bug zapper.  I replaced the ceiling tile with temporary see thru screening and duct tape, which was about 4 feet away from the nest. Cut a small hole in the screening to put the insecticide spray head in and pushed the button. About 300 bees flew out immediately. Waited a day to remove the screening and removed the nest with a putty knife. I will have to replace 2 of the ceiling tiles. I do not recommend this to anyone unless you take precautions. The spray worked perfectly and killed every bee within 2 minutes as long as you can hit the nest. I bought another can before writing this review.	1
Saw the local pest guy using this stuff on a wasp nest, dropped them instantly and shoots very far as well. Would never use anything else.	1
the item is not fit to be sold.	-1
Works very well in killing bees & wasps. I like the distance that it sprays as it keeps me further away and less chance of being stung.	1
Professional product worth every cent	1
Kills 'em dead.	1
not the precision spray head that I own elsewhere.  Looks similar to the other higher quality head.  dissappointing.	-1
A spectacular hose nozzle.  When something is machined correctly, and is made from good quality material, you can just feel it in your hands.  This product is in that category.  It's heavy to the hand, and the rotating nozzle has a nice smooth feel as you turn from a cone of mist to a stream.  You can spend less, and you can spend more.  You won't get better quality at any price.	1
Pricey, but kills them dead. Dead, dead, dead. Zaps them right out of the air.	1
So it had been awhile since I have attempted to eradicate a wasp nest but after noticing some visitors had recently moved in under my wraparound porch and living in a high traffic area knew immediate action was needed. Having this and another brand on hand due to carpenter bee issues in the spring - no I did not kill the bees in the end - I was luckily armed and ready to go. As soon as it was dark I suited up looking like an idiot - did I mention I live in a high traffic area - and tested both cans so I was sure if one did not work the other would be on hand. I had to practice my exit strategy given the nest was in an awkward spot in the eaves and I have just put a fence in limiting my options. This was the first product I used. I sprayed hitting the nest with ease and ran. Hmmm. No action I could see. Assuming it did not work I went back and tried to hit the nest with the other product which just made an arc twice onto some newly planted shrubs never hitting the intended target - worthless. So I hit the nest again with the Whitmire professional freeze hoping the second time would work and ran. Still nothing. So now I am sweaty due to the layers I am wearing and confused then I look down and see the dead bodies. They had just dropped to the deck I got out the hose and washed them away and sprayed the nest. With nothing else coming out I assume the deed us done. No fuss no muss. Will see what tomorrow brings but so far so good!	1
Worked on paper wasps. I spayed an entire can on a hornets nest and it didn't kill one single hornet. I had the same experience with yellow jacket nest. Waste of money!	-1
Best knock down spray on the market!	1
When I received the can, It was smelling like chemical and I thought there was a leak but couldn't find a leak or drainage. I just sprayed it now and it was a terrible experience. I have used this sort of sprays before with success but on this particular item I am very disappointed.  In the listing and on the package and in the web site of the item it says; 1- Specially formulated to provide instant knockdown of wasps and hornets (it didn't show any sign of instant knockdown so watch out if you don't want to get sting.)  2- Spray can travel 15 ft. to provide applicator safety (lol) (it doesn't have that much pressure in it to spray 15ft away. it was maximum 5 feet away that it sprayed, i will say barely 7 feet maximum. so total disappointment on that too)  3- Knockdown is quick so no stinging pheromone is released, thus reducing the possibility of stings (I don't know about that, at least they are not coming back to the area of nest but they now spotted on my other window, which is worse now)  4- it says the item has 17.5 oz material into it. ( it was half! )  I don't care what the others says or will say, I trusted to reviews and ignored the people who had trusty experience they shared with me. It didn't work as expected or as it is described. I shared my experience and make sure you get some cover to not get sting by yellow jackets.  now i have more angry wasps around of my house.	-1
the only thing that worked	1
Updated: Ordered more of this product...  Or tried anyway.  Received "Wasp Freeze II" which is NOT the same as original Wasp Freeze.  Same exact ordered item right out of my cart.  Advert doesn't say WPII anywhere.  If I had wanted WSII, i could have ordered that from other ads *specifically*.  I know what I wanted.  The stuff as reviewed below....  Watch this space for updated review on WSII which apparently is the "all new, but changed formula", can't guarantee results.  #  This review below only related to original formulation Wasp Freeze:  kill kill kill  kill kill kill kill kill  make them dead  super sized!  dead dead dead!  buy buy buy  that's all i have time to say  spray spray spray  !!!	1
Didn't work any better that the name brands of wasp spray. I had to soak the wasps and still most flew away. It proved to be almost worthless on a nest located inside a wall where it could not be directly hit with spray.	-1
What a disappointment, it doesn't work well at any setting. Although it seems to be well made it is poorly engineered. I get weak concentrated flow or fine spray that is uneven and misty. I took it apart assuming some foreign particle blockage, but it was unobstructed. I cannot imagine a good use for it unless I fasten it to a stake as a sprinkler.	-1
This is the best product we have found for ground wasps (yellow jackets). This is the second season and the second can of this bee spray we have used. The first went quickly battling last seasons 3-4 ground wasp nests. This season, we thought we had escaped the little pests, but alas, two hives have appeared. I had a small amount of spray left over from last year's can, so I went to work on the first nest my youngest son unwittingly discovered while mowing the grass. He was stung quite a few times. We even had them in his shorts in the house after he came in screaming and jumped into the shower!  I waited until this evening to attack. It was a cool night. Dew was heavy upon the ground. Without light, I struck putting the foam delivering nozzle as close to the opening as I dared. The spray worked as advertised. The hole was jetted. Foam filled the tunnel and I worked it back and forth for as long as the juice held out.  Next day, no yellow jackets.  We found another nest a few days later. Same treatment, but this time with a new can. Same result. One application, bees are kaput. I'll keep buying this spray for as long as the bees keep coming!	1
Have it now, going on two years.....my first purchase from amazon.  Best hose nozzle ever....considering buying two additional more!!  Worth every dollar spent, and then some!!!!!	1
Works much better than Raid. Knock down wasps and kills within three or four seconds.	1
the can emptied very very quickly, and the spray did virtually nothing to the bees.  i'd bought them for carpenter bees, perhaps it isn't intended for them, but the darn things did more to each other in their territory fighting than this stuff did.	-1
So far, Very nice and works great.	1
Nice Nozzle	1
There is not much you want to hear from a review of a product like this.  Does it work?  Yes.  Does it work well?  Very well.  Is it expensive?  Yes, unfortunately.  Here's the thing: because this product works so well, I pay.  I can count on its reliability and walk up to a bunch of wasps and do a Mr. Freeze impression while my neighbors worry that a nut has lived beside them all these years.  The wasps it hits, crumble in on themselves, almost in fetal positions, and fall.  The ones hit with liquid shrapnel slow down and wobble.  Usually dying.  The others who get misted, fly off and never pay me an ounce of attention.  They want OUT, AWAY, SURVIVAL.  Then I smash the nest.  Get on with my day.  The can can spray a few feet.  Maybe four at best, when full.  It becomes more of a useless mist the farther you get from the wasps, so don't wimp out.  They will not care about you when this white spray is destroying their world.  Great product.  I wish Amazon carried it at a discounted price.  I'd buy cans of it every year.  No question.	1
We have two small nests under the roof at the front of our house. Spray it at 9pm at night once and that took care of it. :)	1
Most of the reviews that say performance is not good, have their hose connected to a regular hose bib. These have just a 1/4 to 3/8 opening, so no matter what size hose you use the flow is reduced. To obtain the best from this nozzle, change your "hose bib" to a "garden valve" style. These have  a 3/4 to 1" opening that allows 2 to three times the volume of water. This difference is like night and day as to the output of the nozzle.	1
I bought this and used it and then ordered two more. Its that good. Shoots spray a good distance. I hit a number of wasp nests and mud daubers before the can ran out. It didn't really knock out carpenter bees from the air and I regretted wasting it. Where I sprayed their holes there was noticeably less activity. I have put a serious dent in the wasp population. Oh yeah it really kills them instantly. Very gratifying.	1
Needs a lot of pressure and volume to work effectivley.	-1
I've followed the instructions twice on the same yellowjacket hole.  No effect, we still get to watch the nasty critters coming in and out of the hole right by the porch.  Bah.	-1
Worked immediately on a large wasp nest. I hit the nest at the wrong time, hot out mid day, they poured out of the nest and went straight to the ground.	1
Works good, but you need good water pressure to get a good long distance/stream/spray. But, product is solid/well built and seems like it will last a long time.	1
Very good hose nozzle.  The spray pattern is good and there is very limited spray going off in an unintended direction.  The flow will be as high as your hose diameter and pressure allow.  No better than one I got at an auto parts store for $7.99 which has been in use for many years.  Minus one for the price.	1
I've been using this hose nozzle for several years and it's the best nozzle I've ever had.  You don't have to squeeze any levers which make your hand sore.  It's very easy to adjust the spray and has never leaked.  I bought two more just to have as a spare for my two present ones. I've also given a few of these as gifts and my friends love them too!	1
Just to give you an idea of how this company's confidence in their own product has gone downhill...this nozzle used to have a lifetime warranty, now it's one year. Mine, purchased with lifetime warranty, lasted 3 or 4 years. Started with a leak last year and ended with the entire guts falling out this springs first use. Piece of junk company. And of course, after a house move, the receipt is gone.	-1
Great, but keep in mind, this is a two hand activation. However, well made, great quality	1
This works great and no leakage.	1
I've had a home veggy garden for ten and I've been the resident gardener at the restaurant where I cook for 3 years.  I've typically bought 5 or 6 nozzles a year to replace broken ones, always hoping to find the one that works REALKY well and lasts.  It's only been a few months but this one might be it.  Will update if anything changes ... (No update = still working great)	1
Best hose sprayer ive found. Excellent quality	1
Great nozzle.  We have weak water pressure and this is much more effective than the ordinary nozzles we had before.	1
Nozzle leaks in both shut off positions.  Returning for refund.  Big waste of time.	-1
A	1
Works great!	1
Great quality, doesn't leak, awesome product	1
One of the best buys I've made in a  while!  Can't go wrong, and it's SO easy to turn on and off!  Highly recommend!	1
Doesn't stay connected	-1
Had one in my lost home and forgot it ... they do last and work great; I bought a few for me and my job.	1
perfect for my yard	1
Will be buying another.	1
Can't life without	1
poor quality	-1
I'm loving this nozzle.  I have a good, heavy duty hose and good water pressure.  I'm really glad I purchased this nozzle.  I'm going to buy another one or two.  Although I have sprinklers, I like watering my back lawn to make sure I get under the trees and water plants where the sprinklers don't reach.  With this nozzle, I can water my lawn, trees and plants in less time and feel confident that they're watered sufficiently.	1
You will know as soon as you take it out of the packaging that it is all about quality. No leaks, not drips. don't buy one buy two.	1
This is high quality with a wide range of water disbursement. Do yourself a favor, drop the cheap Walmart nozzle and buy this one!	1
I liked this nozzle so much that I immediately order another one.  They work smoothly and leak-proof.	1
Doesn't have enough patterns, especially gentle patterns to not disturb topsoil.  Would not recommend for gardening.  It's also a pain in the butt to turn on and off if you forget which end you're at, and also a pain to switch all the way over to get to the other end.  It may be sort of comfortable to hold, but there are also multi-patterned ergonomic nozzles out there.	-1
Great!  Use it to water my lawn.  Thanks!	1
love it	1
Good product, also have others.	1
20 star....you can't find a better nozzle at any price!  So lucky Amazon carries them!!!!	1
I can't believe this product is still around. I've tried it twice at triple the strength recommended on the label to kill carpenter ants. I sprayed it directly on them and they swim in it, then still go about their business infesting more.  Worst pesticide on the market.  The only thing this will kill is the money in your wallet.  LESS than 1 star. Is zero available? Bayer should stay selling aspirin or maybe this is their secret weapon to get you to buy more. Because if you try to kill ants with this product you will need bottles of aspirin.	-1
Item delivered on time, was as described.	1
I have owned literally dozens of hose nozzles of pretty much every shape and size you can get... and I've hated every one of them...until now.  This nozzle operates smoothly, doesn't leak, shuts off *completely* every time and has pretty much any setting you need from a mist to a sharp cutting stream (all of the settings will give different results depending on your water pressure though!)  I was hesitant about the price... but am sold on the Bon-Aire and am glad to have spent the money on something that I really believe will give me years of use.  Buy one!	1
Received in good shape. Thanks Bob	1
good product have used befor	1
Excellent	1
Seems to work fine. Thanks	1
Great nozzle.	1
This is my second one.  I love the volume and the control.  Very sturdy and will last much longer than other brands.	1
gets the job done	1
Item as described - fast shipping - thanks!	1
Great Product. Shipped quick	1
everything ok	1
Works as described.	1
As advertised, works good.	1
worked out well	1
We use it around the house and inside the house if we find a carpenter ant. It kills the carpenter ant by contact. We are happy about the product.	1
Not as powerful as you think/hope	1
Good nozzle wide variety of settings	1
I got this Nozzle for my Mom's birthday and she loves it. So much that she even takes it inside the house when not being used. I have not used it but she has very positive comments about it.	1
effective	1
I have found that Bayer products work very well.	1
I will reorder this product again and again. We've had no problems with the hordes of little ants that were moving in with us. Minimal spraying to get great results!	1
Not strong enough spray. Heavy to handle needs to. Be longer for comfort	-1
Best nozzle yet, and I've gone through a bunch. I like that there's no up or down so I don't have to fight the hose twist. I like that turn either way is off. Feels very sturdy & I feel like it will last for a while.	1
Thanks.	1
Suggest you avoid "Bon-Aire" and buy a Gilmour 528T solid brass nozzle instead of this design which delivers very limited sprays/jets/range and is clumsy/slow to operate.	-1
Works great	1
Great	1
Works great, I spray around the foundation of the house twice a year, the only bugs that I see are dead, I did not spray one year, and the carpenter ants and the termites tried to move back in, ounce I sprayed, they were gone. I will keep using it	1
Good product and on time	1
Worked great	1
Good good good. Just be very very careful with it.  It can be dangerous to humans.	1
Works fast, fast and lasts.	1
Works like a charm!  Thank you so much!	1
I have the equivalent Ortho bug killer but wanted something specific to ants. I'm taking this Bayer product back to the store. I wonder how can a company as big as Bayer produce something this poor? Not only does it hardly kill anything but the dispenser is the worst I have ever used. I would have preferred a pump sprayer over this one. It has a tiny switch that takes a lot of force to turn it on and then it hardly sprays. Don't waste your money. This year I am using Spectracide's ant killer that has a simple trigger pump sprayer and not only does the sprayer work just fine but the product definitely kills ants. I have tried it on black ants, red ants and whatever else is around and in every case it worked.	-1
Keeps ants and roaches away, even works over an extended period of time.  I spray in the crawl space upstairs in May and especially during the summer months in a higher than recommended dosage and add malathion concentrate for a more lethal formula.  I also spray around the base of the house and if I see any ants retreat.	1
very good, had one and ordered a second, much better than the pistol type	1
Very  easy on and off, lots of power	1
Perfect.	1
heavy duty little sprayer, and seems to be able to stand the test of time. I like the fact that it turns off when twisted in either direction	1
I buy these for industrial use,  they hold up better than other nozzles we have used.  We have purchased them more than once from here and will do so again	1
Love these.  Bought several more.	1
On the setting that I most want to use (a wider shower like spray, suitable for watering a garden) it dribbles a leak out the nozzle which winds up being a huge waste of water. The only setting that it doesn't have this dribble leak out the water holes is when I turn it to the laser beam, which won't work for watering. Completely useless. (BTW, I bought one of those cheaper Made in USA brass nozzles and it works like a charm. Sometimes simple is better.)	-1
Amazing! great quality and awesome spray.	1
This nozzle is pathetic pressure wise. It may last a life time because no one uses it.	-1
THESE WORK AWESOME...I OWN TWO.	1
I love this nozzle.  I spend a lot of time hand watering the lawn and garden.  This works like a firehose and is adjustable from a fine spray to just gushing out water unrestricted and everything in between.  It really doesn't have patterns so much as it has an infinite number of settings in between those 2 modes.  If you haven't used a firehose type nozzle before, they shut off completely on either end of the spectrum.  (easy to shut off from either end of the settings that is)  I have bought about 5 firehose type nozzles before this.  Some I broke, some got sand in them and others just never worked well to begin with.  This one doesn't leak at all and is smooth when adjusting.  I use Nelson quick connects with this and all of my other attachments.  (think of using a quick connect on an air hose, it is similar but bigger and made of brass)  I hate to hand water and get my shoes wet so I bought a second one of these for my other hose.  (had one for a year or so and the second for a month or so)  I was moving the Bon-Aire from hose to hose since the other ones made my Nelson and other companies weren't quite as good.  (Nelson is good though just not as good as this)  I got sick of moving it around so I bought a second.  I don't forsee having to replace these any time soon.  It is quality construction and I leave it out all summer.  I would like to say more but it is pretty much just a hose nozzle.  (I've said a lot already)  It is the BEST hose nozzle that I have used though and I have tried many of them.	1
For the price you can't get a better nozzle.  It is clearly made from quality materials and well engineered.  The rubber exterior prevents it from getting banged up if dropped.  It is easily adjusted from stream to fan.  Seriously it's good value.  Just writing a review of a hose nozzle should provide a clue that it is great, it is pretty hard to get excited about a hose nozzle after all.	1
I'm a fan, good flow and spread control.	1
I don't think I will ever use this. It cannot be used to water plants. I thought it would be adjustible, but the stream is too hard, but not even something that could be used to clean a sidewalk, driveway, etc. Very disappointed.	-1

I have had one of these before - which I got at a State Fair and used for many years.  I made a mistake of taking it off my hose and leaving it on my back porch a couple of months ago, which is an area that has a lot of dog toys scattered about. One of my dogs apparently thought it must be a new dog toy with all the wonderful thick rubber around it. They are normally very good about not bothering anything that is not "theirs."  It still worked - sort of - I could not turn the spray adjustments very well.  I finally realized I got over 20 years of use without any problems before it became an inadvertent dog toy (I have dogs with powerful jaws).  I would highly recommend it to anyone. It will last a lifetime, I'm sure (unless your dog gets it - then no guarantees).	1
Works great!	1
This is my second one because I love this nozzle so much.  It's awesome.  Definitely fire-hose style.  You can adjust it to stream or spray.  It's very powerful and does such a great job, I even got one for my Brother-In-Law last Christmas.  He loves it, too.	1
Great nozzle. Really puts the water out there in a "gentle" way w/o uprooting the plants. A friend watered our plants while we were on vacation last year, and he ordered two of these nozzles.	1
Works good.	1
Product is great and arrived fast	1
Great product that takes abuse and doesn't wear out!	1
At finer spray settings it sprayed ur feet. Maybe the one i got was defective,i returned it.	-1
Well made, and easily moves to spray settings with a twist.	1
I have been looking for a hose end that would last longer than it took to get out of the package.  This one looks like it might be the one.  It is heavy duty and has a smooth on/off action.  Fingers crossed for next year!	1
This is a really well made nozzle and forces the water out with great force. I recommend it.	1
It is everything the reviewers say.  The quality/feel is better than anything you have ever had at end of a hose.  Yes, it takes two hands to rotate it but it feels so nice, you want to do that often anyway :).  Pair it up with a premium hose and you find yourself watering everything twice a day just for the fun of it!	1
Solid, cool looking (mine is anodized red), and love the rubber for when you drop it, it doesn't get bent, damaged, scratched, etc.  Can turn off by turning in either direction, which is nice.	1
its barely 3 months now and its broke. It doesn't shut completely in one direction. Better go for nozzles made by Gilmour. They might last a lifetime. Not this one...	-1
Very nice.	1
don't buy anything cheaper that looks like this nozzle.  I did and regretted it.  buy this one it works and lasts!!  Just to show you I have used this for 3 years on the farm and it's my GO TO nozzle.  I wish I had one on every hose!  See my picks for how it looks after 3 years of heavy use!	1
Water comes out of the end!!!!	1
great product	1
I bought these several months in advance. I will be planting them in March 2013. They arrived quickly and packaged well. After I plant, I will leave feedback again.	1
Here in Arizina it just doesn't stop growing & my 72 year old body is starting to look like I'm 35 again; could it be the Spinach????	1
Great nozzle!  Get two just in case you lose one or run over it with the mower!	1
Works great	1
great to the yard just oil it at end of season for spring	1
works well	1
Yummy spinach. These grew very well in my back yard. You rally have to grow a lot to get a good yield.	1
As Advertised	1
Now I have to wait to harvest!!! It came as promised and we look forward to its fruit. Thank You	1
I'm convinced you can drop these seeds within 10 feet of dirt and they'll grow! Amazing product!! Grows super fast and is very good tasting!!	1
Awesome!	1
5star	1
I have tried every nozzle known to be manufactured and have never had one like this. They are great. I know, a little too much enthusiasm for a nozzle, but  they are exciting in their own way. Indestructible but Expensive.	1
Have several of these. Bought 2 then reordered a third for my last hose	1
Dream Nozzle	1
Works great without the Power Washer; garage, driveways,... the dog :-)  Just remember,... the water force of ANY nozzle is only as good as the Water Pressure behind it.	1
What a great item.	1
Works great, easy to adjust.	1
Awesome product! Great service! Amazing seller! A++++ 5 stars!	1
Finally a hose sprayer that has been able to withstand kids, being run over by cars and thrown on the ground for over 3 years now! I was so tired of replacing our sprayer head every few months and am so pleased to say this Bon Aire sprayer nozzle had been perfect other than a small drip it has just begun within the past month.	1
Great volume and pressure.	1
Very effective, durable	1
Love this moreso than any other standard hose nozzle I've ever purchased. The water comes out so fast and heavy if you want it to or then to a light sprinkle if you need it to. The nozzle is made of rubber which is very durable and is very easy to twist open. It never leaks and I leave it outside even in the winter months and it still looks brand new and works great.	1
Got one, returned it a second one return it again, if you don't bring high pressure water into it not just normal pressure it doesn't work like supposed to ; it looks like water is coming out in uneven ways. I used it with a coiled Water Right Hose that's fantastic. I recommend a cheap Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle it's what I ordered and works great.	-1
Nice nozzle and works well. My water pressure may not be high enough to get what this is capable of but it does the job.	1
This nozzle works great for me. I use it in an industrial setting with extremely hot water. This nozzle holds up the best and I have tried almost every one on amazon. Home depot has some nozzles that's cheaper that holds up well also. People aren't careful with these types of nozzles which I see causes them to break. You should never drop it or leave it outside. I see people at my job throw them on the ground all the time because the nozzles look tough. I have two that I have had for over 3 years. They are the chinese version also. Get the original version which causes 10$ extra if you want to just toss them on the ground and leave it outside.	1
It works	1
Great hose nozzle	1
Great quality.  Easy to hold rubber.  Will not get hot in the sun like a metal hose sprayer.  The infinitely adjustable spray setting is nice to have.  Although it does not produce a fine mist but i guess this is want, not a need these days.  i just need to get that water on the dirt without it washing it all away and making a hole that i have to blame my dog later for digging.  My dog is happier now because of this purchase.  Plus it fills his water bowl up and will give him a nice gentle bath when the kids soap him up.  I like this sprayer - my life is now complete.	1
Make sure you have enough water pressure or it won't work well.	1
Great	1
I had to return this nozzle.  The weight and feel was very nice but mine must have been defective.  The spray was very uneven and sprayed from the bottom rather than all over.  Too bad that it didn't work out.	-1
This is a great hose nozzle. It's made of hard rubber and metal so that you drop it and not worry about breaking it. To operate, you twist it to turn it on and if you keep twisting it will turn off, which I think is a pretty cool feature. It can be made to have a very tight hard spray which is really nice for cleaning built up gunk off a driveway or whatever. The reason I dinged it a star is that the first one I bought didn't last as long as I had hoped. After about a year and a half a seal inside the nozzle broke making it impossible to completely shut off. I ended up buying another because it really liked the first one. The way it's built I expected it to last forever. Maybe this second one will.	1
Great product	1
I have 4 of these one on each hose. I have had them for two years and they still work without leaking and give a good spray pattern. Worth the money.	1
Love the feel of this thing, seems very well made.  It works as well as it looks, no drips in the off position, plenty of spray patterns, including a very powerful jet setting.	1
nice but hard to hold on to.	1
Bon-Air Nozzles are exceptional quality and price. I would not use any other nozzles.	1
Love my new - and first time use - Bon-Aire hose nozzle.  The best thing for me with this nozzle is the very strong flow of water which means water is not being blocked like most hose nozzles seem to do. By turning the black nozzle head the range of water flow goes from off to a long, strong narrow stream to a gentler rain-like pattern, to a mist and then off again.  It hasn't leaked anywhere so far.  I don't like to spend a lot of time watering and by allowing the water to flow out fast it gets the job done in less time.  Worth the investment if you love to garden - the right tool for the job.	1
This is the best.  I lost mine in a move and wouldn't be without it.  Even with low pressure this is great.  Definitely a good buy	1
Best yet	1
Works pretty good,  I have good water pressure but it seems that this needs super water pressure.  It's very well made and easy to use.	1
We do a lot of outdoor gardening, etc. We have had this and used this for over a month. Here are the two things that killed this for me: 1) the turning mechanism to adjust the spray is very stiff. 2) it is impossible to get a consistent rain-type of spray. If you fiddle with the stiff spray adjustment, back and forth, you can get a rain-type spray occasionally, but if you turn the hose off and return later you will have to do the adjustment all over again - and too frequently the pattern cannot be reproduced. I have been using this to water new grass seed we put down in areas where we had trees removed. We are on our city water grid with good, consistent water pressure. As of today I am retiring this to recycling and returning to our Gardenia nozzle.	-1
I like it but it does not work well unless your faucet has high pressure.	1
one star took away for the water flow adjustable is not smooth but the rubber and size + quality is right.	1
I have to admit that this product is well made and sturdy but I will stick to the usual all brass twist nozzle.  This is awkward to use as it twists in both directions from "center flow" and it gets confusing as to which way to twist.  It does do full flow so that is a huge advantage if you're using it for filling pools and such but plants don't like that kind of flow and that is the limiting feature of this unit... it doesn't do "rain" flow.  This will likely be a great nozzle for washing the car as well.	1
Love this nozzle. Heavy duty construction. This thing will last a life time. Excellent for the price. YOU will never need another one.	1
I have a Gilmour full flow male quick disconnect installed on the end.  When attached to either my 3/4" or 5/8" garden hoses, I see a noticeable difference in flow.  You will need a small boost in pressure.  Multi spray feature works terrific.	1
works fine	1
A landscaper friend told me about the nozzle he purchased at a wares show, found these on amazon had to purchase I love these. easy to use.	1
great product	1
I bought it hoping it would last longer than most of my nozzles would, and that it would keep the range of sprays that it came with, and that it might be able to create more pressure for a longer spray length than my other nozzles. It has only been this summer, so I don't know how it will last. The spray length is about the same, maybe a little better. Will post next year how it is maintaining. At least no leaks at the threads yet. The construction seems more substantial, and smoother in movement...so I am hoping.  UPDATE: It has been over a year now and it has lasted, and not broken or started leaking like the other nozzels I have tried, so I have upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars. UPDATED again at 2 years, still working.	1
I had a fire hose nozzle that my daughter got from QVC and it lasted a while. However, the on/off was a toggle switch which broke off one day. With that in mind I went hunting for one that didn't have a toggle and found this one. I read the reviews about this one permanently attaching itself to your hose through a chemical reaction so I am careful to remove it when finished. This one does work just fine but it doesn't put out as much water as the old one did so I am a little disappointed by that. The plus these fire hose type nozzles have over the other types of nozzles is that they don't seem to break as quickly, made of better materials and the rubber around them takes a licking with cracking the nozzle. They also are easier on my arthritic thumb joint since I don't have to squeeze a handle.	1
Best nozzle in my opinion. Great water pressure,no problems so far (I bought two about two months ago and use both daily).Highly recommended!	1
great	1
Worst nozzle I've ever owned.  It will barely create a spray pattern, and the same for the direct stream.  You may as well use a regular garden hose without a nozzle and just use your thumb to create the pattern you want.  I actually just took it out and added it to a new faucet I had placed on the other side of the house and I hate the time has past to return it.	-1
This is a great nozzle, especially for the price, but it doesn't have a "mist" setting, which I missed (sorry for the pun)  The rubber seal does a nice job of preventing leaks, but don't leave it out in the winter as it will crack when freezing.  Great little nozzle.	1
Not made as well as my older one.  Didn't last.  The plastic inside breaks then they leak and water pressure is just average.  A lot of money for an average product.	-1
This item is made of sturdy construction, and is the best one I've purchased so far.  Many uses for all types of washing from watering flower gardens, to washing cars.  I keep it connected to my front hose everyday until the first frost, when I empty the water from my hose and put it away for the winter.  I just love it.	1
Wish I had bought this in the 1st place!	1
It lasted two summers.  Great nozzle, the best I have ever used for pressure, easy twist feature, and percise flow of water on all settings with an even spray.  The threads inside the nozzle where the hose screws on wore down, it leaks, and when tightening the nozzle jumps the threads.  It's in the trash now.	-1
OK but not much range to it , but if you buy that hose its the only nozzle that won't leak on your hand.	1
i hate it	-1
Very good hose nozzle. It helps when you don't have to press and hold to keep the spray going. It has good water flow and the jet is powerful. I washed my car and was satisfied. I use it to water plants too. Highly recommend it.	1
I've tried several hose nozzles and they all either leak or don't have the right setting. I wanted this to water my flower containers as well as shrubs and the occasional hosing down of the patio. It's gentle enough for the containers and powerful enough to really clean off the patio. No matter what water pressure you need it does an excellent job and doesn't leak a drop.	1
It is everything as claimed.	-1
I've been using this for a few months and I just bought number 3 (for the 3rd hose we have).  So much better quality compared to other hose nozzles I've had over the years.  Typically they die a horrible death, the handle brakes, they leak, they usually suck.  But this is a rugged design and does the job.	1
So far this nozzle has held up pretty well. I have dropped it may times and I don't even see a mark on the hard rubber. I like that you can close the water by twisting it all the way in either direction. I give it four stars due to the actual water flow. The pressure seems to be ok when spraying far or when you are washing your car. If you are trying to water plants and flowers it is a little different. The low flow setting makes it to where water just kind of falls out of the nozzle which is a little to heavy for delicate flowers. You can put it on a mist setting but that doesn't water it enough. When putting it on the rain setting there is a little too much pressure. When I say "settings" I really mean just twisting it to get the water flow how you want it. There are no "click" setting like on other nozzles. Overall it works well and seems to be very durable I just wish you could fine tune the water spray a little better.	1
This nozzle is durable but the spray functions were not what I expected. I needed something to water my grass not power-wash my windows.	-1
This hose nozzle does cost a little more but don't waste your money as I did on those cheapest. I threw away five of them that were a waste and got this one it works great	1
I have a couple of these and really enjoy using them. Guess one of the best features is it does not drip. Worth every dime.	1
We bought this to replace another similar one that lasted 10 years.  Looks to be just as rugged.  We use it for washing our cars in the driveway; that's about it.  But we drop it constantly and abuse the heck out of it.  So far, it's holding up!	1
They are very good quality nozzles they just won't work if you don't have a Ton of water pressure you probably need a 5/8 water hose with high water volume	-1
I've tried several nozzles over the past 3 years. While I've only been using this for a few weeks now it's head and shoulders above the previous purchases. It's solidly built, easy to operate (turn either direction) and shuts TIGHTLY.  This really is a great nozzle.  UPDATE 09/18/2014: We used this nozzle all summer and it works 100% as well as it did on day one. It's held up flawlessly and I can't say enough about the quality of the flow/shutoff control. By now any head I've had in the past would be half dead from normal use.	1
They changed something in the design or manufacture cause it's nothing like the great nozzle they used to make.  Doesn't have the level of spray control or pressure that my old one had.  Too bad it broke. But it did last 8 or so years.  Bought 2 of the news ones and gave one away cause I was so disappointed.	-1
If you want the flexibility of spray pattern that a fire hose delivers, this nozzle is exactly right.  I live in Boston and have great wate pressure so the performance is outstanding.  A bit pricy, but definitely worth the money.	1
Nice sturdy hose nozzle. Full open it's like a mini powerwasher. It's heavier and larger than a normal spray nozzle. I don't recommend this for small hands or people with any ailments in the hand wrist area. It's seems very sturdy and well built. Works great for my car washing needs.	1
This is the greatest hose nozzle as it does break and fill up with deposits etc and is very long lasting as it is not PLASTIC parts. I now have 4 of them.	1
Tried a lot of different nozzles and think this is the best of the lot. Pressure is good. easy to use and operate even with one hand. The various flow types provide ease of water gently for small plants and broad and intense flow for things like my rims on my car. Ideal for both watering plants and washing your car or exterior of your home.	1
Our first Bon-Aire Nozzle was a gift.  After using for a short while, we bought another one on Amazon.  Once warmer weather came, we bought another one for the third outdoor faucet.  It has multiple spray choices and does not leak at the hose.  Our property is almost an acre so we use a lot of hoses for hand watering and over the years we have purchased many types.  This is absolutely the best nozzle we have ever used.  Highly recommend.	1
After buying dozens and dozens of regular hose outlets over the years, finally - ones that actually work.  I've had a number of these units for several seasons now, and they're just as good as Day 1.	1
Seems like a quality product. I put it through its paces, using all the different spray options and it performed quite well. Easy to hold.	1
I just started using it and ordered another one today.  I am a garden person with many flowers all over the place.  Nozzles are important to me.  This one is by far the best I've ever used.  Reaches far and many patterns that I can choose.  Nothing better.	1
I do not believe you will find a better manufactured hose nozzle anywhere. The main concern is it is not a straight through nozzle. Every other nozzle I have ever had moved more water through it than this one. If you require a high pressure stream of water this is not the nozzle for you. It is a great nozzle for watering plants, washing vehicles, and filling containers but it is not good for blasting off lose dirt and grime. Had thought about returning it but decided to us a quick disconnect and have another nozzle for the blast effect if needed. I recommend this nozzle to anyone looking for a quality built nozzle with a cutoff in bother directions of rotation and not concerned with having a water blasting setting.	1
This will be the 773rd review for this product, so I'm guessing that this is not the first one you've read. It's safe to assume you already know enough about how it works. As such, I may not have a lot of information to add, except for the fact that I've had this nozzle for at least five years.  I'm not sure exactly when I bought it, but it was definitely no later than 2009.  I've used it consistently over that time, for washing the car, hosing off the patio by the pool, washing the dog, cleaning the pool filter, etc etc. It's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete, it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end, and years of abuse haven't affected it in the slightest.  The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.  Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too, less messing with it when you're done using it. I had intended to buy another one for the hose in the back of the house, but instead I've just been switching this one back and forth as necessary.  If you're looking through these reviews because you're interested in buying one (why else would you be?), get one.  It's worth the money.	1
Great product  easy to use in the drive or in the yard great to wash the truck or hose the driveway	1
This nozzle is outstanding. I puts out a lot of water for washing my car and I can also use it at a less forceful volume for watering plants. It has a good strong stream for rinsing off my deck also. Excellent all around, east to use, tough nozzle.	1
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of this - but it is great! I needed something that would be able to withstand my dogs - they chew everything. And sure enough, they chewed it a little before we even used it. But it works like a champ. The different setting are great and it is super easy to use and switch between them.	1
This is by far the best hose nozzle for the money. It has a wide variety of spray patterns and the rubber cover is nice. If you bang it on your car it protects the car from scrapes and dents.	1
I have two of these...purchased one at a home show a couple of years ago....it is still working great...just purchased another...I had purchased a similar nozzle which failed....these seem to last.	1
I don't really know what to say except this is the best nozzle I've had and I've gone through MANY!  It's heavy in the hand but for some reason, it doesn't bother my "old" hands. I've had workers here who have actually abused them but they keep on working.  Hence the reason I just bought three more to add to the two I have. I am giving 2 of the new ones as gifts to my gardening buddies so you must know that I really like them!	1
replace many of hose nozzle and love everything about this. so far this one last the longest and haven't seen any issue with it	1
I got one of these, and the teflon inside got messed up and the hose nozzle stopped moving relative to the outer shell. I had no issues returning to amazon- and got a new one promptly. Have had no issues with the new one, brought it in for the winter- we will see how it holds up this coming season.	1
so far it a great nozzle like i been looking for that does not leak and shuts off with ease at a fair price	1
This is the best hose nozzle ever bought. Very, Very easy to adjust the spray pattern. Well designed.  Easy to use and built sturdy. Good quality, good price and strongly recommend to everyone.	1
Survived the champion chewer destroyer dog and still sprays perfectly. Lasts longer than the bargain pack from the local home improvement emporium. One of the few things that "they make like they used to."	1
I needed to replace the hose and picked this one because of the prior ratings and I was not disappointed.  It is well constructed and once I hooked it up to our hose I was very pleased with the various power settings.  I would recommend buying.	1
This is a very good nozzle. It allows a good amount of control of the water spray pattern, ranging from a wide fan delivering a low pressure water stream, through to a high pressure, narrow stream. Perfect for cleaning cars (using a medium fan of water to get the car wet and to rinse off the soap, and a high pressure spray to remove road grime from the wheels and underside). It's good for watering plants too, using the fan end of the selector range. If you get it just right you can actually get it to mist too.  The only thing this nozzle is missing is a quick on/off mechanism. As it is, you turn it off by rotating the front to one end or the other. This is the same mechanism used to select the spray pattern. This is a design improvement over the original, which only had the off position at one end of the spray selection.  The rubber coated aluminum design is very sturdy and will last for years... the last one did. The only reason I had to replace the last one was my mistake... I left it attached to the hose for a few years and either the hard water or electrolysis caused it to become permanently stuck to the brass end of the hose, and it got damaged when I tried to remove it. Lesson learned... I remove it from the hose when it's not in regular use.	1
Well finally, I must have been through ten nozzles that broke within a season then I found this one. It not only sprays water nicely from a gentle cone (watering plants) to a near torpedo-like stream (cleaning house sidings) but it has lasted me two years already so I ordered this second one for my second hose. The outside is made of rubber so when you drop it on the ground, it won't hurt the nozzle. Smart design. Love it.	1
This is a very well made hose nozzle somewhat like a smaller version of a "fireman's nozzle". It works well for washing a car or boat.  The control over the spray pattern that this nozzle provides is remarkable all for a reasonable price.	1
I have high water pressure but the nozzle controls pressure effectively.  Well made - I purchased two and would buy again	1
I really like this nozzle.  It's very well made and durable.  I've had it for 2 years now and it's still as good as new.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had a shut off valve.  To shut it off, you turn the nozzle to the end until it's in the off position.  Instead, I'd like to be able to shut the water off without changing the spray setting.  But it's very high quality and looks like it will last for many years, which is hard to find in some products.	1
Super sturdy but you need a lot of pressure and/or flow.  This thing flattens my hose due to high volume needed to spray the water.  I think this will last me a while.  Very comfy to use and can adjust the spray patter using one hand.	1
This thing is bulilt to last. I love this nozzle, it is very durable and works great. I did not have a leak for over a year now.	1
Connected this to a "pocket house" - the expandable ones... and this, without the trigger, makes it very compact and easy to store.  It feels ergonomic, designed well so that it's convenient to hold with just the right weight.  Plus, no stress in the hands since water continues to flow without having to hold a trigger.	1
I am really disappointed that this nozzle broke so quickly. It seems to be awful hard to find a nozzle that has good flows for watering a vegetable garden that doesn't break easily. The old brass ones last a long time but they spray so hard that they don't work for watering plants. This looked rugged and had great reviews but I bought it in August and in October it was broken in two. Inner piece is plastic and it just snapped. Always accommodating Amazon gave me a refund even though the 30 days was past. I guess I will be looking for a new nozzle in the spring. Bummer.	-1
Love the seal, simple operation, and versatility of this nozzle. Only time will tell if it is also durable, but in just a short period of time it has already made me a convert to this style of nozzle versus the squeeze/trigger models I had always used before. Especially like that it can be shut off from either end of the spray spectrum, which is handy when you are rinsing items or watering and want to pause.	1
My husband and i have owned 3 of these. They are the best nozzel's out there. Durable and numerous different sprays. Great price as they had the exact same thing at our State Fair for double the price. You won't be disappointed if you order one.	1
You are better off going to your local department store and buying the Craftsman brand nozzle instead. It is identical to this one except the green part is silver. And it comes with a lifetime replacement guarantee unlike this Bon-Aire one. It's also about the same price.  That said, I prefer a trigger type nozzle because to turn this off, you have to rotate it several revolutions and then it doesn't remember the spray setting you were at. This type of nozzle may be good if you're holding it for a long period of time watering your garden or something like that, but for washing your car when you only turn the water on periodically, it doesn't work as well as a trigger type hose nozzle.	-1
So far it's lasted longer than any other nozzle I've owned and puts out more pressure. Definitely recommend it. Get compliments whenever somebody uses it.	1
This is the best nozzle you will ever buy. It is adjustable and goes from a mist to a strong steam in an easy turn. It will never drip or fail. I have 2 of these and they last for many years.	1
This nozzle costs a little more than some other but is well worth the price. It works great with a lot of power and the water will spray a long distance. Has a lot of different settings for many uses.	1
This is an update to my previous review. Only gave it 3 stars and said it wasen"t as good as a previous one. MY MISTAKE! I didn't think to compare them on the same hose. Seems my water pressure is way more powerful in the front yard ( near the water inlet) than the backyard pressure. It finally dawned on me to compare the old nozel with the new on the same outlet. Both nozels are of the same brand and both are equally good. For best results the pressure must be strong. I am completely satisfied with this product. Sorry for a previous bum review Amazon and Bon-Aire. Original Bon-Aire is 2 yrs old and works great.  No worries mate.	1
I just received this today and it works great!! Something my husband won't break!! I ordered another one for a friend! Great price!! I would recommend this product!	1
Won't tell you that this puts out as much pressure as a fireman's hose, but it is easy to use and does the job.  This is the one I've used all summer.	1
So, I bought a nozzle a while back,,,after seeing an info-mercial, I think....It's THE best nozzle ever..It's blue and says "H.I.S.C." on it. I've since bought 2 other nozzles that LOOK the same at my local store (you know, one for front, one for back). They aren't so good. So... I did a search on Amazon for "HISC nozzles" and this one popped up. I bought it. It was delivered today. It's the exact SAME nozzle I've bought at the store. A cheap imitation of the very good one. Oh, it works fine, and it doesn't leak and it has various settings, but it's NOT the one I have. Perhaps I'm looking for the $40 model they sell, but this one is the very same one I spent $9 for at my local store.  Disappointed.	-1
i'VE HAD SEVERAL OF THESE, SOMEHOW THEY GO MISSING AFTER A VISIT FROM A NEIGHBOR. jUST KIDDING!!Work Great, I keep one on my boat,at the summer place and two at my home.	1
I had one before that worked fine but I had problems trying to get it off the old hose so I bit the bullet and got another. Does a great job.	1
Great tool, this will be the last nozzle you will ever need.  It has many settings that you can adjust with one hand..  It can take a beating and still look new.	1
So easy to use and turn on and off. It dose not burn your hand like the others do when left out in the sun.	1
I own one of these that is much better and that's what I expected. Said it has two shut offs, which I suppose it does since you can screw it in two directions. But my original has a small finger lever on the side that you can flick on and off, which is much handier. Enclosed was a direction sheet how to unclog it when it has an uneven spray. But mine had an uneven spray from day one. Very inferior to the original. I'm inclined to guess its just a cheap knock off.	-1
I had one before  and it still works after many years.  It has the perfect attachment to the hose.  The new one is still pretty stiff to turn to change the pattern, but I guess it will ease soon enough.	1
Over many years I have had many types of nozzles. This is the last one that you will ever change to! Excellent!!	1
This is the best, most comfortable variable nozzle I have ever seen. Very comfortable to use, even for someone with arthritis. I bought more than one.	1
I kind of love this hose nozzle.  I had to use washers to make it work the way I wanted but it does such a good job.  It seems heavy and well built.	1
Seems durable and high quality.  I just didn't like the pressure coming from it.  Perfect for all kinds of watering though I don't think I'd use it for any high-pressure cleaning.  Maybe the pressure is on my end, but seems like my old doo-dad shoots a tigher stream.	1
I had seen this presented on TV & had wanted it since last year.  I decided to get it from Amazon because it was less expensive & I have Prime shipping making it an even better value.  Lot's of water pressure & easy on  & off.  I've used it many times this summer to water my lawn & it's still perfect.	1
This is truly a good product for the price. I have grow boxes for my veggies and you can either make it rain from the heavens with a turn of the wrist, or use it as a fire hose with another turn of the wrist. ( I will say that I have excellent water pressure where I live ). I am going to buy another for washing my Truck n 4 wheelers :-)	1
This nozzle is well made, you can feel the quality. If you want a nice tight, powerful stream, you will be satisfied with this.  My initial thought was to use this to water my flower beds but that's not going to really work for me. I can't get a spray level that is anywhere near the shower type of discharge that I want to water flowers, planters, potted plants, etc. This is almost all or nothing, there's not much range in the middle. So it just blasts too hard for plant watering.  I will use this to wash my car, it will be perfect for that type of use.	1
This is a great nozzle.  Not sure why, but cannot get myself to do more than 4 stars.  Could be it is on a smaller diameter hose that coils, and not quite what I expected.  But overall pleased.	1
these work so well!  We bought the first one we have at a home show, and have ordered many more online since.  They really put out a nice powerful stream of water.  They hold up well over time also.	1
Great nozzle - my only complaint is that it doesn't'' have that 'soft shower' option like the package shows. You can get sort of a shower if you hold the nozzle up high but it's not like the handle nozzles I've used in the past. Great for a pressure-washer type action, tho.	1
This is one heavy nozzle, it feels sturdy in my hand and made with quality, high density material. It seems will last a long time. wait until I wash my car with it.	1
About 2/3 of the beans sprouted.  1/3 are growing Big and Fast.  Just as a gardening tip, when the plants 1st sprout, keep them covered with a clear cup until they start to form leaves or the Birds with Eat the Seedlings and will kill the plans.	1
Sprouted right away (5-7 days) even without following the 24 hour pre-soak instructions. Will update at harvest.	1
We have a short growing climate and I thought I may be able to get away with using these seeds. But no such luck. By the time they were about to start giving me beans, we had multiply frosts and the plants couldn't handle it.	1
Bumper crop of beans.  They are delicious.  Good germination rate.	1
Very happy with this nozzle. I was expecting less but was pleasantly surprised. Use it on a boat and it blasts the dirt away. I will be buying more of these.	1
I do like this nozzle, and maybe we got a lemon, but it does leak a little below the twisting piece.  It is nice and sturdy and overall would be a great item if it didn't leak	1
My friend has one of these, I used it and was impressed, so I ordered one. I like it... it is built tough, it gives good spray control, it shuts off at either end (rotate it, it begins to spray, keep rotating, the pattern changes, keep going and it shuts off again). At one end of the spray pattern it is a power spray, at the other end it is a gentle gush, and a shower spay is in between those two. I'm going to order two more for my other house hoses.	1
I have been through 20 hose nozzles over the yrs and this one is the best.  This was my second time buying one.  The first one was purchased 5 yrs ago and is still working fine.  I just needed an additional nozzle for another hose.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.	1
Another great gadget for making car washing a little easier. Great product for rinsing the vehicle. Has good spray and works really well. Would recommend.	1
I bought this from Amazon a few years ago and put it in my gardening shed.  This morning I found it still in its original packaging and attached it to a hose... it appears very sturdy but clearly it is not built well - mine leaks between the aluminum shaft and the rubber nozzle... I tried to fix it myself but didn't have any success.  Too bad the return window is years past!  Suggest you buy a Dramm nozzle... we have several and they perform well and have held up great!!!  Pass on this one, sorry...	-1
Every one of the hose nozzles I've used has failed in a few years.  Except this one.  It's the only one I've left out back over the winter and has survived the freeze thaw and the snow.  I've left it through two winters of snow and ice attached to the hose and it still works great.  Plus it functions so well.  The worst thing I can say about it is it's tricky to fit under some car wheel wells but that's fine for having a functional nozzle that does what it is supposed to do year and year.  EDIT: 10/16/13 and I have two of these nozzles and one still stays outside all winter and both still work perfectly.	1
We like everything about this nozzle except the fact that it really doesn't have a "mist" setting. On the plus side, because it has such good pressure, it does seem to have more power and control when hosing off the driveway, for instance. I look at this nozzle as more of a work horse, which is great...but when I only want to water the flowers, I have to barely turn the water on, or it's just too strong of a stream.	1
Only had a short time so far. But so far so good and looks like it should last. It shuts off water flow at both ends of the nozzle turn spray pattern. If it holds up for more than a year or 2 in our hard water and hot sun I will be extremely happy.	1
Love this nozzle for washing car and dog baths.  Wide variety of spray patterns and rinses car much quicker than previous standard nozzle.  Rubber cover is nice for dropping hose on driveway and not  scratching everything up.  Much lighter than expected as well.	1
I paid much more for a similar nozzle off QVC and it leaked horribly, this one does not leak and works fine. Seems to made of heavy materials and I expect it to last a long time. The spray pattern in the fine/mist adjustment is not as good as I would like it, but that's me.	1
I bought this nozzle three years ago and it's still working great for me.  I can adjust it for a nice shower for getting dust and dirt off my plants or the car, or for a generous bubbling for watering trees, or for a powerful blast for rinsing the pavement.  I also like the comfort -- it's covered in rubber and it's a good size which makes it comfortable to hold on to.  I'm back here to buy two more because my other cheaper nozzles have all fallen apart and I'm tired of moving this one from hose to hose.  Even nicer that it appears to be on sale right now!	1
I wanted to try this item as I wash our vehicles often.  I was disapointed to find a lack of water pressure when using this item.  I did return it for a refund and seller made this EZ.  It would be good for anyone that has higher water pressure to start with.	-1
This nozzle is reasonably priced, attaches easily to your garden hose and, with the variable spray, can serve a variety of functions.  I use this nozzle primarily in the back yard for watering plants and giving the patio a good wash-down.  It doesn't have the power of a pressure washer, but it has ample force for most cleaning tasks.  And when I adjust it for gentler uses, it works just fine.  I can't talk to longevity (so I am withholding the fifth star), but for now, I am very satisfied.	1
The best one out there. This one shuts off at both sides of the spray spectrum. I purchased all three style of nozzles that looked similar, but this one is the best. I gave away the others as gifts. The warranty is fantastic, a no questions style warranty. I had to pay five dollars for shipping to get my replacement. Not a big deal...	1
there are quite a few of these types of nozels on the market and we have gone the gambit. this one is probably the best one we have tried. I like the function it has of turning off on both ends of the turn	1
Has held up well over the seasons. If is pretty heavy duty and survies my rambunctious child throws it around and steps on it.	1
I bought a second one that is similar but cheaper...Should have got another one of these. The cheaper one leaks and can only be shut off at the high pressure end. This one doesn't leak at all and can be shut off by twisting all the way right or all the way left...Great pruduct!	1
I LOVE these.  They've outlasted every nozzle I've owned.  They are used at the barn and in the pastures.  The horses even pick them up out of the water buckets and bite them and they still work and look like new.  I love that you can turn it either direction to turn it off.  The high pressure works well for cleaning the algae out of the water buckets and the soft pressure is nice for leaving the hose hang in the bucket to fill it.  I've ran over these on our hard stone ground with my quad and ranger, and they still work the next day.  I bought a bunch, so there is one on every spigot of the house and garage and barn.  I can't imagine my life without these.  No, really, having to run the water daily, I am relieved that I don't have to worry about it breaking, finding a replacement, and whether it will offer enough pressure for good cleaning and enough flow that I won't be a slave to thirsty horses.	1
Definitely over hyped.  My ten dollar sprayer works better than this.  It gets 2 stars because it does spray.  That's it.  The ergonomics are terrible.  The spraying choices are limited.  It really comes down to water pressure, if you don't have it, the nozzle can't magically make it better.  It may increase it some, but not to the extent that the manufacturer would like to have you believe.  You should pass on this.	-1
I got this nozzle to try a different nozzle for different reasons.  You can never have enough nozzles for hoses.  It works well, puts out great pressure and you feel like something is getting cleaned instead of just soaked.	1
I just purchased 2 more of these because I loved the first nozzle so much. It's high quality, & the selection of adjustments is perfect for any gardener. The heavy rubber exterior makes this very durable, & it doesn't dent or ding when dropped on pavement. I also appreciate the fact that this has a 2-way shut off. I love everything about this nozzle, & highly recommend!	1
I bought two of these in Spring 2011.  They are "tough", work great, and are easy to control with one hand.  Within a few months, both were leaking a little but not bad enough to warrant a return.  By summer 2012 (and now out of warranty), both were leaking badly.  I wrote the company and even though I was out of warranty, they sent replacement o-rings at no charge.  It takes less than 5 minutes to take the nozzle apart, take out the old o-rings, put in the new ones, and re-assemble.  After replacing the o-rings, both nozzles work like new again.  I do wish Bionaire would spend a few cents more on materials, and perhaps use silicon or teflon-encapsulated o-rings that would last longer than a year.  But kudos for the overall design, and for standing behind the product even after the warranty is up.  Taking one star away because it requires o-ring replacement every year or two, but otherwise a good product.	1
This is the best hose nozzle that I ever had. Easily adjust, smoot. Highly recommend, even though it is 5/8 and standard hose is 1/2" so I had to by an extension to my hose to be able to use it.	1
It has plenty of settings and it's pretty strong! I was using it to clean off my front patio and I thought I'd use it on the strongest stream to reach some of the higher places and it knicked off some of my stucco! I know only use it on the lower settings ;)	1
This is a great tool.  I have had it for 2 years.  Works just as described.  I can use it to wash my vehicle standing 8 feet away raising the hose over my head to blast the rooftop with water.... or just water the front garden using a low flow shower....or to clean the vinyl siding on the house.  Simple to twist the nozzle to the spray/force that you need.  It shuts off twisting to either the right or left so convenient.  I like the large rubbery housing so I don't accidently smack it against my sidewalk and put scratches or chips in it.  I can leave my water turned on at the spigot on the front side of the house and use the nozzle to regulate on/off (note- I have a heavy duty hose which can take constant water pressure).  Absolutely No leaks in the past 2 years.  I keep it outside all year long disconnecting from hose in the winter and leaving on a window ledge outside for the winter.  Otherwise it is hooked up to the hose under pressure full time.  Mine is a metallic purple color that is so vibrant.  Even after two years the purple is shiny and vibrant.  For some reason I feel like a fireman when I am using this.	1
So many knock offs that cost less, but this one works best.  Being able to adjust the stream ever so slightly is worth it.  this is our second purchase.  From hosing cement to dribbling water over a plant and not getting the dirt everywhere, this hose nozzle does it all!	1
This is a must have for those with excellent water pressure and volume and a good hose. I highly recommend this.	1
I have a 3/4 inch hose and I was always frustated that at the end of the hose, a nozzle or a quick connect would create lots of restriction. Well, with this baby, there is plenty of water coming out! To make your life easier and perfect use it with a full flow Gilmour quick connect.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTMGTG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00	1
I was happy with this nozzle until it broke.  The outer black handle (where you adjust the spray) no longer grips the nozzle mechanism and turns freely.  Meaning I cant turn on/off or adjust the spray pattern.  For this kind of money I could have bought 4 "cheap" nozzles and threw one away a year and still come out ahead.	-1
I don't remember if I wrote a review of the Bon Aire hose nozzle when I bought it; we buy a lot from Amazon and it's hard to keep up.  I had to contact the company recently, and I felt compelled to make sure that I shared my experience.  I bought one of these and was so pleased with it, that I almost immediately bought another one for my front yard too.  It is solidly built and feels like a quality tool when you use it.  It operates smoothly and the variety of water streams it produces is excellent.  A slight turn of the head gives you a nice variety of spray patterns.  They are not preset patterns, so you can adjust to exactly what you need.  You can easily get a jet, a variety of sprays, and a bubbling stream perfect for watering a tree.  With my water pressure, I get a jet of roughly thirty feet.  When you twist it to off, there is no leaking.  If I have any criticism, it is that I can't get a very fine mist for watering really delicate garden plants.  The spray is pretty fine, but not ultra fine.  This spring, I left the head on my garden hose and it froze hard overnight.  It was still working after it froze, but the freeze must have cracked the internal parts.  I dropped it on my lawn to do something and soon noticed that it was leaking.  I looked up the company on the internet and gave them a call hoping that I could buy parts to repair it.  I told the person on the phone what had happened, including that I had frozen it.  She asked me what part of the nozzle was broken, where I purchased it, and for my home address.  She then said, we'll get those right out to you.  No bill, really no questions.  A couple days later I got a little package in the mail.  It had the whole (fully assembled) core of the nozzle, which included the back half where the hose attaches.  There were two extra sets of O-rings and assembly lube in little envelopes.  There was another package of assembly lube and two sheets of very clear instructions.  Really, most of this was overkill.  It was so easy to fix that the instructions were almost not necessary.  I removed the stainless screw in the spray end with a hex wrench and unscrewed the damaged core.  I applied the lubricant and reassembled it the way I took it apart.  It took about two minutes including reading the instructions.  I don't buy many things that I am %100 percent happy with.  If I couldn't have gotten parts for the nozzle, I would have bought another.  I was tremendously impressed with Bon Aire's customer service.  If you have a garden hose at home, you should have one of these.  I would seriously consider giving someone one of these as a gift, odd but true.	1
After five years, it looks and performs as well as it did on the first day I used it. I've even left it outside over the winter and it still showed no signs of wear or loss of functionality. An additional benefit that I've found in this nozzle is that it protects the hose connecter from damage by preventing it from hitting the driveway or other hard surface when setting or even tossing it down. I highly recommend this excellent product.	1
This item works great but one concern inside there is an o ring and if this gets damaged where do you get the rubber ring	1
The durable 8 oz aluminum and rubber Bon-Aire original ultimate aluminum hose nozzle screws into the end of your hose and provides 5 differing water sprays from a casual soak to a high pressure stream with a simple twist of the large rubberized end.  The water can quickly be shut off from either direction as well.  The Bon-Aire original ultimate aluminum hose nozzle is heavy and bulky; however I haven't found this to be a problem.  I like the chunkiness of the nozzle and find it easier to hold on to.  The best quality of this hose nozzle is just how durable it is.  Over the last couple of years, we have dropped, stepped on, and left it out in a freeze, yet it still works as well as the first time.  The nozzle has acquired a mild patina, but there are no leaks, stray water streams, or any visible damage.  This has been the best hose nozzle purchase we've ever made.  If you're looking for a durable hose nozzle that will last, look no further than Bon-Aire.  In addition to this version, there is a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/stainless-steel-nozzle/dp/B000E7YYDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">stainless steel nozzle</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/handled-nozzle/dp/B002HLCZSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">handled nozzle</a>&nbsp;to consider, any of which will provide years of leak free service.  PROS: Durable and long lasting Doesn't leak Won't rust Comfortable to hold 1 Year warranty  CONS: Heavier than some alternatives	1
This is the best nozzle on the market. Even my low pressure hose gets really strong stream. 5 different positions allow to modify the shape of the stream. Great for cleaning driveways, walls or patios. I ordered 2 of them and would do it again. Very durable and solid feel/look.	1
As I've written on my other Hose Nozzle Review recently, I have exhausted every Type of Water Nozzle's & Sprayer's, over the last 10 years. From the Brass, to Metal Alloy to Plastic & Resin Units, because I live in a "Hard Water" area, the Typical "TRIGGER-Type" Metal/Brass/Alloy Nozzle & Sprayers all will seize, rust & Crack within 6 months or less. It's very frustrating, time consuming and eventually, you always end up searching elsewhere for options. With the 2011 Spring & Summer Seasons ... which is basically 'year-around' in Hawaii ... your have ample opportunity to built or re-model your Home or Community Garden, and you have to have Functioning Equipment, and there's nothing to cut into your day or weekend, when you are faced with equipment failure ... it takes the fun out of the day, and then to make yet another trip to the SAME CHAIN or HARDWARE STORES, to purchase the very SAME Thing, over and over, get's a little redundant.  This year I decided to shop on Amazon instead, and start the process of replacing some of the same, tired Garden equipment, hence, the Bon-aire product. Here's my initial review after a month of use ... and I will re-visit for an Update in about 6 months, to test the longevity of Bon-Aire Products, as well as , others that I am also using at the moment.  * Quality - it's engineered and made from aluminum, stainless steel and high-grade fiberglass. If you have read any of my Product Reviews, you will already know that I ONLY prefer to purchase High-Quality, and on first impression, this Hose Nozzle appears well- engineered. * Built - Appears to be of a Heavy-Duty "Fire-hose" nozzle construction * Ergonomics - comfort-grip soft rubber, multifunctional spray nozzle has a bi-directional, patented 2-way Shut-off head feature. * Function - Marketed as having a 5-pattern spray nozzle. NOTE - This 5-pattern spray capability is ONLY obvious if you have a HIGH-PRESSURE Home Water System.   If you don't, then you WILL be disappointed, by a weak stream, so on one of the properties, I make sure that all Outdoor faucets are turned-off, BEFORE, I use it.   You WILL Notice that It DOES Move a large amount of Water through it!  TIP - I take it off after each use, so to make sure that our "corrosive" water is not in contact with it, all the time.  Update in 6 months, or less.	1
All of my cheap dollar store garden hose nozzles gave up the ghost this summer. They leaked, sprayed from every angle except the desired one and one, just wouldn't shut off. Cheap Chinese-made Junk! I read the reviews of the Bon-Aire Original Ultimate and it sounded like a take off on NYC's Famous Original Ray's Pizza. However, it was cheap enough so I took a chance. When it arrived, I immediately hooked it up and so far, it's all you could want from a garden hose nozzle. You turn it on or off by turning left or right. The spray patterns go from gentle waterfall to direct stream and all stops in between. I can't tell how long it will last but it looks and feels well made so I give it 4 stars.  It could have had 5 stars but, darn, it's made in China. Fairly-priced Chinese-made not-junk!  The loss of a star is no reflection on China or the product; just my disappointment that we don't have a hose nozzle this good with a made in the USA sticker on it.	1
bon-aire original ultimate nozzle. This was given to us by my brother as a Christmas gift. It has proven to be the best gift ever.  The quality is awesome. The nozzle is easy to use, does not waste away in the sun, and the pressure is awesome. From light to forceful.   You will never regret getting this nozzle and at a truly small price.	1
A few months ago I purchased 3 Bon Air Hose Nozzels & they were teriffic! The products of my recent purchase are inferior to the original nozzels. They don't turn as easily; they don't spray as far. Not sure if they're re-conditioned or seconds or what, but they're not worth the expensive price.	-1
Product is exception on water pressure and has multiple adjustments for the stream. Much better than the one season cheap pistol nozzles.	1
This is fantastic!  We bought another one a while back and have used that in the front yard.  This one we use in the back yard and I think we may get another one for up in the mountains.  This goes from a steady, sturdy stream to a mist by just twisting the head. Goes on and comes off easily due to the ridges on the body.  Very easy to use and the variety of sprays is unlimited.  Perfect for all occasions from washing the car or sidewalk to wetting down the flower beds or flooding the flower pots.  Get one and try it.  You'll never go back to those plastic nozzles again!	1
I really like these high-quality, "fireman-type", and high-output nozzles. They are built VERY WELL and output a lot of water. If you don't want high water output, then don't get this nozzle, otherwise, I would highly recommend spending more money to get one of these rather than the cheaper nozzles. I think it's worth it.	1
My father doesn't want to be bothered with any other brand of hose nozzle.  He first had the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bon-Aire-Original-Ultimate-Hose-Nozzle-Aluminum-with-Soft-Grip-Handle/dp/B002HLCZSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bon-Aire Original Ultimate Hose Nozzle (Aluminum) with Soft Grip Handle</a>&nbsp;but found that he preferred this one without the handle as it was easier for him to use and took up less space on the hose-winder he uses to manage and store his equipment.  Both units provide a wide range of spray options and provide an impressive amount of pressure so that you can shoot water into the more remote corners of your yard or garden.  We call it a firehouse nozzle due to its shape and design.  We've had the handled variety for a few years now and they show no signs of corrosion.  In fact, I expect that they'll outlast the hoses they are attached to because they still look like new.  This is a great buy for anyone who waters their lawn or garden by hand or who have the need to wash a vehicle at home using the garden hose.  Wonderful!	1
This nozzle is extremely well made, and it will last a long time. There is no cheap plastic handle, that would break off. My problem is the "high pressure" setting is surprisingly weak. If I didn't have a nozzle at the end of my hose, and just used my thumb to create a jet spray, it would be stronger than this product can produce. If you just want to water plants or casually wash something, this product is perfect. Just don't expect any real dramatic pressure.	1
This hose nozzle is very well made and very high quality. The black parts are a beefy rubber that are easy to grab and adjust with wet hands and also serve to protect the metal spray parts. Adjustment of the spray is very smooth. The only disappointment is that the strongest water stream, that might be used for cleaning gutters or spraying hard to remove dirt, is much less focused and powerful than the other hose nozzles I have used.	1
I looked for a good quality nozzle, something that would work better and last longer than the home-center junk. I thought I had found it. It worked fine for a couple of months, but then started leaking-badly. I took it apart to find the O-ring that seals the two pieces of the body was cut (simply by the action of adjusting the stream-very poor design). I went to the hardware store and picked up a new O-ring and it is sealing once again. It appears that, based on the design, it will fail again before long. Most people would have tossed it when it started pouring water out, but I gave it a second chance.  Bottom line: Don't buy it unless you are prepared to "fix it" when it starts leaking (pouring) water out and based on the design, that looks like it will be a frequent occurrence.	-1
I purchased this last season after years of buying junky sprayers that break, leak etc. This one really holds up even after dragging it along the driveway blacktop and dropping it many times. You get what you pay for.	1
THIS NOZZLE WORKS SO WELL, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, THAT I WENT BACK AND PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE TO REPLACE A "LEAKER" ON ANOTHER HOSE!	1
Maybe they moved to China don't know.  Bought first one ten years (?) ago.  So much better than any other in my life that I sent another to my brother who says the same.  China may or may not lower quality.  Bought about three since the first one.  They were copy cats, two I think from HD, junk, total junk.  Felt like they were restricting the flow at any setting.  Poor jet shape or any other compared to original.  Remember I had the old one for comparison which defined "perfect".  After several throw aways bought another $20 one from Amazon.  Think the metal part is aluminum in old and new if that matters.  The most recent works just like the old one and on less pressure because the first hose bibb in front yard is ahead of the pressure valve all home have.  Whoops, just noticed in the pic here at Amazon, front nozzle is stainless on both of mine but the colored body toward the rear looks like anodized aluminum on both of mine.  So China or not I have old and new and they are equal in performance.  Of the many things in life that never seem to be right this Bon-Aire Original Ultimate is settled.  None have worked better for me and I look no more.  Suddenly my wife springs to mind.................LOL??	1
I only wish the "jet-spray" setting was a little more jet spray like.... other than that, it works great, and hasn't leaked...	1
Pros: - Never leaks - Good spray patterns - Fool proof, and serviceable design - Great grip  Cons: - The rubber is a bit soft, so just be careful and don't drag it across the concrete. - You can't set a specific pattern to come on every time.  The "off" position is either all the way to one side where the jet spray is, or all the way to the other where the cone/mist spray is.  I've used this for a season now, and I'm very happy with how well it works.  It never drips, and works like a charm.  The only thing that took a little getting used to was remembering what "off" position I used last.  Since there are two choices, you may turn it on an accidentally nuke your tomatoes.  For that reason, I always shut it off on the "cone pattern" side of the nozzle, as that is much more gentle as you start to rotate the nozzle.	1
I love this nozzle.  Used my first one all summer for watering garden, flower beds, spots in my yard, washing cars.  This nozzle adjusted to all jobs.  Decided to get another one for my other hose.  Well worth the money spent on this.  It's very comfortable to use.	1
Bit of a let down here. From all the reviews, I thought maybe my search for the perfect nozzle would come to an end. It didn't. The sequencing of spray patterns on this nozzle is not what you are used to. Sure, it has a unique ability to produce a fine spray and a fire hose kind of effect, but when switching between patterns it passes mostly through various streams of concentrated water that dench anything in its way. If you are trying not to splatter mud, create craters or wash away feshly planted seeds, this is not your nozzle. Maybe it makes more sense on cars.	-1
Just check my review title, says it all. I'm a middle aged car nut and have had countless hose nozzles over the years. This is by far the best yet. Great versatility for car washing and plant watering. Wish I had gotten more than one under the lightning deal this was purchased under.	1
Some might say it's not the size of the ship; rather it's the motion of the ocean. But with the Bon-Aire Ultimate Hose Nozzle, the size of the hose matters a lot! This nozzle is meant to be attached to a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/manly-5-8-inch-or-better-hose-with-some-girth/dp/B000UHDDJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">manly 5/8 inch or better hose with some girth</a>! Seriously. Don't laugh. If you attach this to one of those&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/sissy-1-2-inch-curlycue-garden-hoses/dp/B000QCJRLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">sissy 1/2 inch curlycue garden hoses</a>&nbsp;it really does hinder its performance by dramatically reducing the water pressure that the Bon-Aire nozzle will deliver.  Well? Do you want to impress your snap dragons? Do you want to see steam coming off your car when you wash her down? Then whip out your big hose and attach it to the Bon-Aire Ultimate Hose Nozzle. You don't even need a rubber washer with this baby...bareback is fine. No leaks without a washer whatsoever. 99.9% effective.  So give your hose a Bon-Aire and watch it squirt! Add it to your cart.	1
This nozzle is built like a tank and will last forever from the looks of it and from the 10 year old my neighbor has.  I have the bad habit of sometimes leaving my hose water turned on so that I can have instant water at the nozzle.  Not the brightest idea as your hose can burst or your nozzle can fail.  A few months ago my neibhgor came by and told me that I had a leak.  I looked around and sure enough, my old nozzle had failed.  My neighbor mentioned, "that there's your problem neighbor - that crumby plastic nozzle you're using."  His has been going strong for 10 years.  So I ordered this from Amazon rather than going through two warehouses stores hunting for it.  I must say that I'm very impressed.  PROS - very solid construction, either aluminum or steel - padded with thick rubber - looks like fireman's hose - smoothly fades from closed to soaker to rain to fan to jet with a simple twist - easy to work with wet hands  CONS - none  Now I will tell you that the jet on this nozzle is one of the best I've seen but I'm not going to compare this to a pressure washer, I have one and nothing compares to a pressure washer, but the jet mode of this is pretty darn good.  I recommend you get one and I also recommend you close your water at the faucet when not in use.	1
The sky high ratings intrigued me, so when the Bon-Aire "ultimate" nozzle was available as a Lightning Deal, I bought one to see if it lived up to the hype.  The product appears to be very well constructed, and is quite a bit larger and heavier, than your typical cheapo nozzle.  You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the "ultimate" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.  The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.  Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.  The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the "ultimate" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.  The economy models typically don't last very long, so if "the ultimate" proves to be durable, it might be worth the premium cost.  It's a bit heavy, and encourages using more water, so at this point I like it more than love it.	1
If you want a full spectrum water pattern nozzle, buy this one. High pressure stream (for clearing wasp nests, etc) is extrodinary.	1
I bought mine at the local garden store and paid a tad more than the amazon price (should have checked amazon first).  It offers good pressure and is an upgrade over my current nozzle, however is it worth twice the price?  I think it is i get the a spray soft enough for the delicate plants and a spray that can knock off bird droppings with no problem.  It does take a little pressure from you to turn the nozzle to the setting you want to use.	1
This is a very durably built nozzle, with great thick rubber group and a spin that feels really smooth & solid. I can imagine this thing lasting for years.  The only drawback I find is that for those who turn it on and off frequently, there is a decent amount of friction involved in turning all the way off to all the way on, so it's not as quick to use as a trigger shot.	1
Used to have a lifetime warranty, now only 1 year.  Another reviewer mentioned they are manufactured in China now - (the arsenic they added to the plastic probably weakened the casing :)  Better off paying $5 for a cheaper one and replacing every year or so.	-1
After reading many of the reviews here, my expectations were probably set too high.  Many purchasers have made this thing sound like it sprinkles water from the fountain of youth at pressures to rival Old Faithful.  It is well made and should last many years.  Other than that, it sprays out water prett much like any other hose nozzle I have ever used.  It is a quality product but I do not understand all the raves.	1
Seems expensive for a nozzle but it works well.  Curious to see if my price (16) stays in the title.	1
I love this hose nozzle for several reasons. The main one being I can now clean out and then fill up my bird bath without soaking myself. The control of this nozzle is just what I have been looking for. Good buy for the money and made to last.	1
I think this is a pretty good nozzle.  Works well, decent pressure, very well made.  I use it to wash my car, water my grass etc. and it works well.  My friend Blair, however, is obsessed with this thing.  Every time he comes over he goes outside to play with the hose (no, in case you're wondering Blair isn't 10 years old or retarded or anything, he's a normally functioning adult who just happens to be a hose nozzle enthusiast).  He is absolutely blown away by the quality and workmanship.  He's pretty sure this is the exact same nozzle that our local fire department uses (I remain unconvinced).  His biggest complaint is not with the nozzle itself, but with the water pressure at my house - he keeps rambling on about what the potential of the Bon-Aire nozzle would be if only it were hooked up to some decent water pressure.  I have suggested to Blair he get his own, but he doesn't think he'd get his money's worth out of it because he lives in a studio apartment with no yard of his own, plus he lives in a shady part of town and he's convinced someone would break in and steal this baby.  In summary - if you are in the market for a nozzle for your hose, this is just the ticket.	1
I love this hose nozzle, because it's so well made.  But I'd love it more if I had higher water pressure.  My water pressure is probably around 40-45 PSI, and this nozzle doesn't put out the advertised pressure for me.  However, the spray pattern is just fine for watering plants, washing cars, etc, so I'm happy with it.  But don't count on it being a pressure washer if you don't have high water pressure.  I would buy another, but I probably won't need to since this one will last so long!	1
This nozzle is exactly as describe in write ups.  It has a variety of water patterns from full soaking to hard steady stream.  You can expect water to come out of the hose a full throttle unless you reduce it manually.  My first attempt to use it was with a small diameter hose and they are not the best to use for a nozzle that uses a standard hose.  The small diameter would not permit pressure buildup inside the hose and therefore the exit of water was at a much smaller volume than a standard hose.  No big thing.  Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems.  While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows.  Next, I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder, fertilizer or detergent.  It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer.  Old happy gardener.  When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic.  Some, however, plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $25 for this nozzle.  While it is not perfect, it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for.  Also, I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off.  In fact, it is doubtful that this nozzle will see vehicle washing again.	1
We saw this item at a local home show (for a much higher price) and I came home to find it on Amazon.  It works perfectly and the rubber collar protects it from breaking if dropped.  Highly recommend.	1
Almost indestructible, there is a piece inside made of Bakelite that can and will break under the pressure of freezing water.  I made the stupid mistake of leaving my hose, with nozzle attached, outside during a hard freeze and the 'worm gear' inside that adjusts the spray finally broke, after four years of surviving every sort of abuse from me, my wife and kids.  But, Bon-Aire is true to their word.  When I told them my nozzle broke, the only question they asked was, "What's your name and address?  We will send you a replacement tomorrow!"  How about that, sports fans!!?  That's what I call an iron-clad warranty.  I have two, one on the front yard hose and one on the back yard hose, and am proud to recommend the Bon-Aire nozzle to everyone as the best on the market.  But, remember to bring it in during hard freezing weather!  Kind of a 'well duh', I guess, but I forgot I left the hose on.	1
Pick up your average box store "fire nozzle" and it will have burrs machined into it and stink of cheap Chinese rubber as if you just walked into Harbor Freight. I don't know if this is really the original but it's certainly the best one out there.  After searching for a long time, I eventually caved and bought this aluminum version because the stainless steel version (HN10C) is $30-40 and not even offered at Amazon anymore. For a short time Costco sold them in a 2-pk but Bonaire tells me it was a limited time deal as with many Costco offerings.  My only minor complaint is that the aluminum version comes in one of three colors (red, blue, green) so you may not receive what you expect from the Amazon photo.  5 out of 5 stars.	1
My brother purchased one of these at a trade show for almost double what it sells for here. After I saw it, I had to have one too. This thing is put together very well, with quality parts and good fit and finish. If you have the water pressure, using this will probably allow you to roll a small dog or cat down your driveway (not that you should, but you'd be able to)! Operation is smooth and it's comfortable in the hand. Made in China.	1
After buying many hose nozzles that leak or are inconvenient to use, this one is a winner.  Too often I have grabbed the hose to do something in a hurry on my way out, and then ended up with water on my shoes or clothes. I really like this nozzle because you can turn it off in either direction and it never leaks water where it connects to the hose.  It cost a little more but should last a long time.  The different spray patterns fit my needs but if you want it to be extra gentle on flowers just lower the water pressure at the faucet.	1
This hose nozzle lets out an amazing amount of water and looks like it could survive a nuclear blast.  I'm extremely impressed with the build quality and the functionality for washing dogs and my car.  With my old nozzle, it would take a long time to wash the soap out of my dog's hair.  With this nozzle, the initial gush of water takes almost all of the soap away leaving them squeaky clean.  Same goes for rinsing soap off of my car.  It's hard to imagine being excited about a hose nozzle but this thing is awesome.	1
I have owned no less than 15 different nozzles over the years. One has been worse than the next. The ones you drop after you use which are made of plastic simply break. Then there are the ones with the several settings and trigger which constrict the flow so much that you would think it needed a dose of flomax! I have used many types in between. This unit is simply the best. I never realized the pressure I had restricted by using the other ones. When I turned the spigot on all the way, I could get a good steady stream over 20 feet no problem at all. I drop it after use without worrying about cracking it.	1
First found this at Home Depot... but they don't carry them anymore...  I sure am glad that I found one thru Amazon.  They are the best for either watering plants or washing the car... and you can turn them off in either direction...  that's really a big help because it allows the user to avoid cranking down thu all the stream levels...  and that makes whatever job you're doing get done much faster.	1
This nozzle does everything it's supposed to do, especially when connected to a 3/4" hose.  Smaller hoses do not allow it to reach it's full potential.  I bought my first one last year at the State Fair of Texas and liked it so much I bought a second so I don't have to carry one between 2 high use locations.  The construction is so solid that they should last for many years.  June, 2016.  I now own 5 nozzles at 5 different locations.  Excellent product.	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Do-it-Best-Import-L-G-721080-Do-it-Heav-Duty-Brass-Hose-Shutoff/dp/B001733BSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Do it Best Import L&G 721080 Do it Heav-Duty Brass Hose Shutoff</a>  I have owned this nozzle for three or four years now. I have not had a single problem or complaint at all...well, just one complaint, but it was an extremely easy fix.  The complaint I had was that you would have to cycle through the different levels of spray pattern to turn on and off. The fix; I went to Home Depot and bought the Orbit SunMate Brass Shut-off Coupling (Model 58271). In fact, I bought two of them. Or, if you order from Amazon, you could order the Do it Best Import L&G 721080 Do it Heavy-Duty Brass Hose Shutoff. I put one on the end of the nozzle so I could turn the water off and keep the spray pattern the same without having to cycle all the way through the different spray patterns. This also allows me to control the amount of water that comes out.  The other shut-off valve I put on the other end of the hose. This allows me to disconnect the hose without getting a bath. I just shut the valve off and then open the nozzle in order to release the pressure and drain the hose. This works great for me because I keep my 100' hose in the garage instead of outside for the elements to eat up.  The only thing that would make this nozzle better is if Bon-Aire would build a cut-off valve into the base of the nozzle instead of you having to buy a separate cut-off valve. No big deal though!	1
The best Hose Nozzle I have ever had. Parts of my yard I would have to have extra hose for, I can now water from one place.	1
easy to attach without leakage, multiple levels of spray, able to shut off spray with nozzle---very nice	1
Extremely durable and easy to use.  Upfront cost a little more than normal, but, it should last for years with no problems.  Everyone should have one.	1
Very pleased.  High fllow if you want it on all types of patterns.  The shut off positions actually shut off, and the connections are well made so they don't leak.	1
I bought 2 because they were well reviewed, I'm getting ready to buy 2 more. I've only had them about a month, but they're great so far. After having used these for several years - they are the best! Will never go back to the cheapies from the stores. Have had a couple that broke in the winter & the company replaced FREE OF CHARGE, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. We use these on the hoses that we water our horses with so they are used on a daily basis & not pampered. The best!	1
I musta spent a gazillion dollars on nozzles from wally world, k-notsmart, etc. I just wish I had bought one of these in the first place! I heard about it from a friend who owns several aircraft and he says it's the best for use around aircraft. I figure if it's good enough for his airplanes, it's good enough for me! Love it!	1
Solid piece of equipment, I don't think I'll ever buy the other "garden" variety hose head anymore....WOW I just wrote review on a hose head!!!That saying something	1
Easy to install.  I wait to see how the sun affects it.  But is is almost invisible, except for the poles.  And no deer yet this year!  I uses chicken wire on the bottom to stop larger rodents (groundhog).  So far so good.  And another plus- it seems to hold up to the occasional nick with a string trimmer!	1
Exactly what I needed to keep deer from eating my plants and trees. Easy to cut to size I need and so far is holding up. For some new plants with tasty new leaves, I just lay a piece over the top until they get established. It moves as the plants grow and deer stay away. Once plant is mature the deer often leave it along.	1
Very flimsy and I returned it. Requires a frame. With a full frame it should be fine.	-1
This is a great product that I used to keep the deer from eating my shrubs in the winter and then I move it to around my garden in the spring. It is light weight and cuts easily with garden sheers. I use it with 3/4' metal garden stakes from the garden center with cable ties to hold it to the stakes. It holds up well to weather so, I have used it multiple years.	1
Works great is strong and high enough to keep out pesky doe and fawn.	1
as described	1
Perfect for my veggie garden. Keeps all those deer out. Easy to handle/unroll. Flexible, yet sturdy enough to detract deer. About the right height too.	1
Cut in half and used wire the rest of the way up spaced every foot or so to save money on a big area.  Found groundhogs will chew through, but no deer!	1
Good stuff. Very sturdy yet lightweight.	1
Excellent quality - heavy gauge, have reused for 3 years.  Mount on 8 foot steel t-posts, driven into the ground. We thought deer cute when we lived in the city ... now - don't get me started !	1
GREAT FENCE EASY TO USE. I WOULD RECOMMEND WRAPPING AROUND LARGE POSTS TO TAKE DOWN AND PUT UP EASILY EVERY YEAR. I USE PRESSURE TREATED 4 X 4 INSIDE PVC PIT IN THE GROUND. YOU ONLY NEED FENCE HIGHER THAN YOU NEIGHORS AND MINE HAVE NONE!!	1
Hopefully this will last it's stated 10 years or so, and keep the deer out. We have mule deer in northern CA and so far they haven't jumped over or dug under. We hung 850 ft of this product. You don't really see it unless you're right up on it which is nice. Update: 1 year later, the deer have stayed out. Now the challenge is either the jack rabbit or the raccoons have started making small holes in the bottom. I will now cut and place wire fencing (quarter inch holes) along the bottom of this fence. Keeping the deer out was the main concern so I would still give this product 5 stars.  UPDATE: MAY 2017. This fencing is amazing! It's been 2 years and NO deer have even attemped to jump it. More amazing, a 60ft pine tree fell over it last night, and bent only one of the fence posts. We pounded the posts in a good 2 feet, so it musta worked. Results of the tree crashing through the fence...not much. I cut the tree in thirds, pitched the center piece over the hill, and VOIL&Aacute;! This fencing sprung back up, hardly worped at all. It took some time to put a new top wire across the top of this fencing and had to straightened up the bent fence post. A few black ties and it was fixed. Amazing.  I might add that I put green (3 ft) plastic fencing (comes in a roll at Home Depot or Ace Hardware) across the top of this fence when the fence was put up. I only did this in the back of the property where the deer live. It can't really be seen from the front yard. (Not ugly) The green added another 3 ft of height which gives the deer the illusion that the deer fencing is taller than it is. I think deer can see the color green.  It seems to be working.	1
Worked great	1
Very durable and well made.  Easy to install and strong enough to keep the critters out.  A neighbor witnessed a deer having been spooked in his yard, running full speed in the direction of the fence;  Hit the fence and fell backward.  Slightly bent a post but did not break through the fence.  I have been able to grow gardens and orchard items for several years now and will buy this again if I ever need more. (and no, the deer was not permanently scarred by the incident...it walked away a little stunned but intact)	1
At 7+ ft. the deer haven't tried jumping it yet. It's been a few weeks. This stuff seems very durable. Only time will tell.	1
Tenax C Flex Deer Fence, 6 by 100-Feet ...very well made!	1
So far, the deer have not tried to jump over it or run into it.  We've attached it to T-posts.  The black color helps hide that it is a 6' plastic, grid fence.  I bought another 100' to enclose another side of our property.  I will report back to let you know if the deer are being kept out of our yard.  It is too time consuming and costly to spray all the garden plants with deer repellant products every month.  Neighbors have not complained about it not being an attractive fence/barrier.	1
2018 update My garden grew and I got chased out by bears a couple of times so we engaged a professional company to put in sturdy posts and we used more Tenax C fence. As other reviewers noted, this stuff sags. The professionals put a bar across the top and put hog rings to hold the fence. In a few areas we have a cable with hog-rings rather than a bar. The original roll is still in use! We have used it to protect new plants in reforestation projects. Having been cut, moved, cut and moved, etc. for three years it is still in perfect condition. It survived last winter with over 200" of snow and several winters of 20 below temperatures. This stuff is rad. The bear has not tried to break through although I figure it could if it wanted. Bambi did shimmy under once but when my spouse and she had a surprise meeting over his morning coffee-stroll in the garden, she could not bust though and had to remember how to shimmy under. We subsequent locked down the fence by extending a 2 ft section onto the ground, pointing outward.  Original Review: What can I say. The venerable tenax deer fence fenced out my deer just as it is supposed to and does successfully for so many people. I had a lighter weight similar fence before but I knew Bambi would not stay on the other side of it once my garden produce appeared. I bought this for the 600 lb test. It is not as "invisible" as I would desire but it really is not visible at a distance. I have mine anchored to trees and an arbor that is the entrance to my garden so it fits into the environment without tall poles. When I look at it from the road you cannot see the fence. When I am inside of the garden I can see that I am in a fence. Still, the view is nice. We have bear as well as deer and I joke that the tenax is strong enough to keep the deer out and strong enough that I would have just enough time to holler really loud if a bear wanted in.	1
It's working for me and my German Shepherds. If the fence was out in the open I could see where it might get ripped by dogs, but I set it slightly back in the woods where everything is moving a little slower than in the field. I then walked the fence with the dogs. They haven't busted out yet. My wife and I put up 300 ft in an afternoon. Easy to work with. We used zip ties to attach the fence to trees.	1
Good product. Fast delivery. I will recommend it to my friends.	1
The terms used across several, and even Amazon, product descriptions for Tenax can leave you scratching your head.  The code provided is for C-Flex C.  The "pro" in the description would lead one to believe (especially since other sites also have "professional" listed as C-Flex P, one would believe this was the "pro" version.  I confirmed with the manufacturer that it is NOT the "professional", which they no longer call professional, but rather "Premium".  Also, they have changed their terms on some products.  When under 6' they call it "pet and garden" netting.  When over 6' they call it fencing.  60100109 should be rolled C-Flex C, their basic or standard grade of deer fencing.	1
I made curtains with this stuff to protect the plants from deer. It works and no problems.	1
Yeah! This is the stuff. Heavy duty and easy to install off the roll. Shipped fast, too., Very strong material. Good luck Bambi!	1
Summary ======= The product I received was exactly what I expected based on the photo and description.  Sorry to see that some of the other reviewers did not get what they expected.  All of the similar products I have seen at the home improvement stores and garden centers were either made from much thinner plastic or had much smaller openings in the mesh.  Appearance ========== The product is attractive as far as fencing goes.  It is nearly charcoal black with a semi-gloss shine to it.  Because it is much heavier than netting and has large mesh openings it looks substantial and well made.  Durability ========== Although i have only had this for a few months I rate the durability high.  The plastic is thick and after a full summer in the sun shows no signs of sun damage.  Also, the local deer regularly eat the leaves and vegetables that poke through the netting and yet they have not damaged it in any way.  Use === This is a great product for wrapping an enclosed garden; it is attractive, durable, and substantial enough to not stretch or wrinkle easily.  The 7.5' x 100' dimensions made it large enough to reach the top of my garden walls and wrap around without any seams.  I built an enclosed garden using the frame from a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ShelterLogic-12-x-26-Feet-Canopy-2-Inch-5-Rib-Frame-Tan-Cover/dp/B000OQ3XQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ShelterLogic 12 x 26- Feet Canopy 2- Inch 5-Rib Frame, Tan Cover</a>&nbsp;and this fencing.  I would not consider this a substitute for steel field fencing, it really serves a different purpose.  It is great for wrapping gardens or using as a temporary or semi-permanent fence.  It is much lighter than steel, yet much heavier than thin mesh netting.  Recommendation ============== I am happy with my purchase and would buy this product again.	1
Good item.	1
This is my second "boat and camper" white hose from this company, I use it for my house rather than a camper. I think the white color looks nicer and appreciate the lack of lead. "Never kink" is not really true, but it is pretty good on this issue for a mid-priced hose.	1
Second one of these hoses I have bought. First one still works fine, just bought a back-up. No funny odors or tastes. It hasn't got worn by being out in the sun in AZ so must be quality material. I've had the first one over a year still works like new  fast shipping would recommend!	1
The shipping was fast on this item.  Also, we use this hose with our camper and there is no odd taste to the water.  I like it much better than using a regular garden hose.	1
Great price	1
NO MORE KINKS, NO FIGHTING HOSE AND LOSING THE BATTLE  I'd like to buy one more	1
Really like this hose because it is not too heavy and we haven't had it kink.  Liked so much that we bought another and connected the two together for more length.  Note: use in backyard for grass and flowers and works well, so don't be fooled by boat notation on product.	1
Great hose	1
I use this as the water line for my motorhome, no bad tastes, no kinks, no flow restrictions, and long enough to reach any camp grounds I've ever stayed.	1
Works as expected	1
Great hose. - exactly as advertised. very pleased	1
it says for drinking water, but it makes the water taste bad.	-1
The hose is flexible and the large finger connector on the end makes it easy to connect without pliers. I didn't notice any "garden hose" flavor with the water coming into the trailer.	1
Nice hose for the money. I used it on a wind in hose reel.	1
Just love this hose.  Bought two and connected them together.	1
Avoids those annoying kinks	1
Works great.  Superior to standard garden hoses.	1
These have been great for me so far..they installed easy and the fold up option is nice..they don't come down on their own when it rains so don't forget to put them back down!  they extend out far enough to get rain away from foundation and swivel to whatever position you want to send it (assuming siding corners don't get in the way like my house)...if you leave them extended and its windy they kind of twist a bit but it doesnt damage them..i like being able to extend, swivel, and fold up my downspouts so this was a no-brainer..the price is way better than the hardware stores even the big boys cant match this price!	1
So far so good! Doesn't kink. Water tastes good. No algae build up like last hose.	1
Does what I needed and expected	1
Doesn't hold together. The wind picks it up.	-1
works great	1
This spout works great and does the job! I painted mine green to blend in. Not sturdy, sturdy, but sufficient. Once the 2 screws were in it seems as solid as possible.	1
Great solution to eliminating washout of dirt from plant area close to house.	1
great hose for the price.  I got these for my rain barrels.  The short hose works well with the gravity pressure.	1
No kinks.  Like it a lot.	1
I'm using it as a garden hose for the backyard. No problems at all.	1
Much better option for our downspouts than the plastic trough block models. This one allows the proper slope away from the drain end and up over the edge of the concrete walkway so the water doesn't get trapped beside the foundation. These are very east to trim to a shorter length should you need it while retaining the telescoping ability (the original length was too long for me).  I suggest using a metal landscape hook (the kind that keeps irrigation lines held down to the soil) to anchor it in place for the rainy season, but otherwise it is more than sturdy enough for our mild winter weather.	1
just what we wanted	1
Here's the advantages: 1.  They get the water far enough away from your house to do some good (6 feet) unlike splash blocks that only divert water 16-18 inches away. 2.  To other reviewers who had trouble extending the 2 pieces: Notice there are 2 matching divots at the end furthest from your downspout. You need to pull the 2 divots apart from each other and the lower piece will slide easily from under the top piece. 3.  I had to do some minor adjustments; the back of the diverter was a bit too long and would have scraped into some wood trim. No problem, simply trim any corners that don't clear your house with a pair of tin snips or heavy scissors. Done! 4.  Pivoting feature is great if there just happens to plants, etc. in front of your downspout. Something's in the way? -  simply twist left or right.  Disadvantages: 1.  They're pricey. On the flip side, I've had some for 4 years now and they still aren't brittle or show any wear. 2.  As others have said, there's no way to hold them in the upright position. I solved it with some self-stick Velcro dots.  Bought a couple of these at my local hardware store years ago. Unfortunately, they don't carry them any more. Glad to find them here.	1
Very happy. Price was right and quality is exceptional	1
works good	1
This is probably my favorite hose because it's drinking water safe, made in the USA, and has the "Thum Thing coupling for easier attachment to the faucet".  I also like that it's only 25 feet long so it's not unwieldy. It also doesn't kink.  I actually use it for my backyard because I don't need a long hose and I often use it to fill bird baths with bathing and drinking water for the birds.	1
these are must better than the accordion style drain spouts.  Leaves and water don't catch on to the ribs.  To install these, you might need to hacksaw your gutters if the angle is too flat.	1
Does its job well	1
The only hose I have bought that has not offered to kink..I know own 4 of them. I absolutely recommend.	1
So far, working well.	1
Just bought a new construction home and builder had down spouts coming out next to foundation walls, future water damage apparent. I saw these in a magazine and searched Amazon to see if they sold it and they did. I bought 3 of the brown and 2 of the white for the sides and rear of my home. One particular area was really bad, whenever it rained the water had nowhere to go and created a muddy clay pond between my deck and basement walkout. This allowed me to direct the water to my basement walkout so that it could go down the drainage pipe and away from my foundation walls. Simple product that resolves a huge future problem.	1
does a good job	1
Seem to be well made. We will have to see how they weather various conditions.	1
I recently purchased 2 more NeverKinks in Feb for me to use this spring as a garden hose. I've used one of the 2 and got a dud this time. Water is squirting out below where you screw it onto the tap. This is the 4th NeverKink I've purchased. It's too late for me to return it since I bought it so early in the year. I wasn't sure how to rate this since I really like using this hose for watering my garden because it's lightweight and I didn't have a problem with the others I purchased. I didn't expect to get one that wasn't made right. .	-1
This worked out great, you can direct which way you want the water to flow away from your house. Very cool and flexible. I would highly recommend this.	1
From the box to the street/yard.  No fuss, no hassle, just clamp on and use; what can be easier than that?	1
does the job!!! ok price  a this is great b this is awe some c this is quality d this is out standing e this is	1
It is so easy to attach, with the little handles on the fixture. My nozzle spun on easily too, and did not leak at either end. Once I uncoiled it and spun it out to lay flat it stayed that way. Looks OK sitting by the hose bib in the front yard, matches the house paint.	1
So easy to use without kinking. Had the Camco brand hose like this one- that was the absolute worst hose ever.	1
Ok. I do love this hose...it is well made. I have had mine for several years. The reason i gave it 1 star because it advertises the hose as 'neverkink'...i will turn my water on and it never fails i am undoing kinks...kinks a lot.	-1
Works like expected. Actually bought this hose for washing the car and not for a boat or camper but works great just the same.	1
Great Product, High Quality	1
Not as advertised.	-1
Still tastes of hose water. I suppose stale water is stale water or maybe it must be used for some time before it doesnt taste like hose water. Never the less i didn't buy this to drink ojt of personally i water my plants with it and fill the water dishes for my rabbits with it.  It doesnt kink and seems well built.	1
a must have for rv	1
Light weight ~ perfect for light watering in the garden. I would recommend a 50' length; 25' turned out to be too short.	1
Took it out of storage and used it second time when I put a sprayer on hose leaked from the brass.	-1
Great	1
Works	1
You definitely need one of these to fill up your long term water storage tanks.  DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE.	1
This is very attractive in white for next to our fish cleaning station. Flexible, but not easy to kink.	1
I use this to connect my single tier beer stand to the spigot of the house. It does not have any of the chemical odors that you usually get from a hose. It seems to be well made and a little thicker then some of the other RV ones i have seen around.	1
I used this to defrost my freezer. It worked perfectly	1
Failed on the second use. No matter how I connect it the darn thing leaks water out of the connection. Complete failure in my opinion.	-1
Legitimately doesn't kink, this makes it a very heavy feeling hose, not really a positive or negative about it, just a statement. I Like how it feels personally. The twist on thing at the head of the hose also works great, it then has a Hard plastic piece to keep the hose from crumbling at the spigot if you were pulling on it from laying it out. All in all, does exactly what it's supposed to, and it feels like terrific quality	1
this hose is well made and has been very useful	1
It Kinks..	-1
This hose is the perfect accessory for my pool filter Drain / Valve.  Basically, when my pool fills up a little more than I like after a big rain ... I keep this hose attached to a spigot on the bottom of the filter.  The hose is easy to handle at 25" and is rigid enough to prevent kinks.  I just ordered the 50 footer to keep by the pool (to add water and water some plants).  The fact that it is easy to handle - for the most part - makes it a winner.  We have tried several of the pocket hoses with no luck of them lasting beyond a few weeks.  Bummer.  This NeverKink hose is a nice compromise between the pocket hose and the regular green hose.  It seems lighter and more rigid = less kinking.  They work.  Looking forward to putting the 50 footer to work.	1
NICE HOSE. WORKS PEFECT.	1
Great hose for the rv.	1
Good hose, drinking water safe.  No unpleasant offgassing odors.	1
Light weight hoses that work great! These are small in diameter to help boost Low water pressure	1
Good hose.	1
Just 2 days outside the Amazon return date, this hose blew the brass attach point off. Never had that happen before. Obviously a factory defect. While the hose is good, the cheap brass parts they use are not. I will not buy this again, and you should avoid it.	-1
Used it a few times since I bought it and seems to work great. I always have it in the garage so the sun has little time hitting it. No no leaking and rolled out nice. Feels real durable glad I bought it.	1
So far, it's been great for our boat. Well made and really doesn't kink.	1
Very nice pool hose....does not kink, etc.  buy it!!	1
Great hose for my boat.	1
Doesn't kink, so far.  Well made. Good price. Only after its used for a year will we know how we like it.  Easy to take on and off. Would buy again.	1
Same as with the 25 foot . Very happy with them	1
This is my third hose. I have now replaced all of my older ones with this brand. It is above expectations and no lead!	1
I bought this hose to cut up for several feeder lines in my hummingbird garden, and so far all these lines are holding up very well.  I'm very pleased with this type hose for this purpose.	1
I am using this hose to set sprinkler. It doesn't kink n length are perfect. The price was great as well.	1
This is NOT a solid brass coupling as the details indicate.  I am sending it back.	-1
Brass coupling connection leaks after using it 2 times. Not impressed with this. I will probably go to home depot and buy a new end to replace the ends of this hose. Loved the idea of a non toxic hose for connecting to my RV but don't like the idea of buying poor quality products	-1
The plastic taste took weeks to go away and even then was faintly detectable	-1
female connections/connectors are thin and frail  I purchased two of these hoses and both leak so bad (nothing to do with washer quality) that they are no longer usable.  Expect them to fail absolutely in less than two years. They are light weight and easy to spot in the grass... that's where the good part ends.  Connections are definitely where they saved money in material cost.. I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend this hose to anyone, unless it is to be used sparingly and only for an emergency (though I can't think of a reason for that)... not for daily use.	-1
Only got 6 or 7 months us out of this! And I actually bought 50 foot and one 15 foot hoses, and I'm just waiting to have issues with those. The one 50 foot I'm dealing with now began leaking, actually 'spraying' ftom the cheap, thin brass (?), fitting.  It looks like brass, 'heard' it was brass, and most brass does have lead in it. Whick kind of defeats the whole 'safe drinking water' aspect of this much more expensive hose.  This is 'supposed to be' water supples for marine and motorhome/camper applications!  What was hard to believe, and something I had 'never' seen before in my long life, was the leaking, 'spraying', was actually coming out like 'in-between' the threads of the male fitting'!  Something you could not see any physical flaw or break in-between the threads, but it just had to be the cheap, thin fittings put on this hose, as that's where it was spraying from.  And you would 'NOT BELIEVE' what the manufacturer puts a person through to warranty this piece of junk. So eventually, I'll get a replacement of something I don't even want anymore.	-1
Lasted a year and a half before one end exploded shooting water in my face. Don't be fooled by the giant "NEVER KINK" sign on front. Got a kink on my first use while I was carefully trying to unwind/untwist it. Considered returning it but the main reason I got it was because it's "drinking water safe."  That is more important to me than dealing with kinks. I have had it and used it less than 6 months now and in that time it has continued to have kinks pretty much every time I use it. Saw the "premium" version on sale and got it to compare- makes this hose seem more like a child's toy. Spend the $5 or whatever extra (NOW CHEAPER THAN THIS VERSION!!) for the premium version and you won't be disappointed. 2 Stars because it is drinking water safe otherwise I would rate it only 1, material is very thin and I don't expect it to last long... 1.5 years	-1
-Updated- I bought my hose May of 2014.  About a month ago my hose started kinking.  Now it has a huge leak.  Water skyrockets out of the hole.  I would say I now loose 60% of the water pressure and countless gallons of water.  I will not be buying again.  -Original- These are great!  I feel better watering my plants with the food grade hose.  So far, the have last two months into a desert summer!  Buy the larger one first or you'll end up buying it later.  I now have the 25ft and 50ft.	-1
I received two of these in early June. One of them bit the dust today, September 28.  I knew this was coming, as the end that connects to the faucet had started coming apart about two weeks ago, which I noticed when the water was on--and spraying out from where the hose is supposed to be connected to the metal end. The hose was pulling away from the metal.  Today, I was sitting on my patio with the hose nearby; I had a nozzle attached to its end, with the water turned on at the faucet but off at the nozzle. All of a sudden there was a leak...then a spray...then--as the white part of the hose burst out of its metal end--a SPOUT of water spraying all over the place. The hose literally burst apart from its metal end. I have pics if anyone would like to see them.  Of course, as luck would have it, it's now beyond the return window for Amazon. Oh well...  By the way, I had purchased several "Never Kink" hoses--and they ALL kinked. Every single one of them.	-1
I uploaded photos of the hose I received. I ordered a hose with a brass faucet fitting and received one with a brass/plastic composite fitting. I'm going to use it, but I HATE Bait and Switch tactics!! It will break as most composites do, but by then I won't be able to replace it. Amazon you have disappointed me yet again!  UPDATE: Upon reporting that the hose fittings were not as advertised, Amazon made good with a full return and refund. I believe that the improper fittings represented are an inadvertant error. I advised them to update the photos and description or others will feel misled as well.	-1
Hmm. When the leaves are dry and the ground is flat, this does ok. Just ok. It fills up very fast and blocks up fast too. When leaves are wet, forget it, this thing is not good. I actually only realized this after the return period was over, else, I would have returned. it. Disappointing	-1
Similar to another review, I bought this hose in April 2011 and after 3 months of use, the brass coupler that fits into the watering nozzle began to leak.  It must be a bad weld between the 2 brass pieces.  It's now physically loose and absolutely useless.  I'm very disappointed because Amazon says that I am over the return time window so it's a total waste of $$$.	-1
I'm very disappointed with this hose after 3 months of use. It was absolutely perfect for my use and exactly the right size, it also never kinked. When using this product with an attachable device like a water wand, the brass piece at the end starts to loosen and eventually comes off, leaving you with a useless hose which can't screw onto any watering nozzle. The only redeeming quality is that Amazon is letting me return it for a full refund after this long of a period due to the lifetime warranty included. For that reason I'm going to give it 2 stars, but I highly recommend getting a hose made in the USA like the platinum flexgen hose from Gilmore if a larger diameter is ok for your needs.	-1
I've had problems from the beginning.  The first unit I received looked used and had parts missing and broken.  Customer service was great, I got another one in a couple of days with the same issues broken and incomplete packing.  I was able to get a working unit out of the two that were sent.  The biggest complaint now is that the handle will not stay attached to the tank I have a "portable" unit that is anything but portable! I cannot move it anywhere without reseating the handle every couple of feet! In all not worth the aggrevation.	-1
Sprayer handles constantly fall off, bad design. I had to use gorilla glue to finally fix the problem, until sprayer sprung a leak at the base of the tank. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	-1
Im unhappy.  I just used Scotts STEP 1.  There were several lumps in it that I needed to break up so that it would go through my Scotts hand spreader.  I broke up the lumps with a screwdriver and with my hands.  Now, I cant get the yellow dye off of my hands!  Ive used three strong soaps and I still have yellow hands.  My hands don't hurt (yet) but Im very unhappy.  Also, to cut open the bag I used a dull garden knife.  Be careful when you cut open the bag as it can "tear fast down the side of the bag and in more than one direction.  Use sharp scissors - and hope they do not turn yellow.	-1
Purchased one of these nine years ago and it still working great.  Purchased this one as a backup and it broke after seeding two plug trays.  Typical situation where manufacturer cheapens the quality to save a few pennies per unit rather than maintain (or improve) quality and raise price accordingly.  I'd rather pay $12 for lasting quality than pay $9 on junk that breaks within 10 minutes of use.	-1
didn't work that good	-1
Does not work too good.	-1
It is too difficult to see how many tiny seeds are actually coming out of it.	-1
There's got to be a better way	-1
This does not work well at all.  Would not buy it again.	-1
Didn't have much seed control and found a dispenser made out of paper works better.	-1
Fell apart second time I used it	-1
Never worked well for it. Distributes more then 1 seed at a time. Beth disappointed with this product.	-1
Do not waste your $$. Cheap and small. Doesn't work.	-1
not very good with tiny seeds, like carrots. no idea how it would work with larger seeds because I got this later in growing season	-1
Does not work well for my purpose.	-1
I don't know how long it will last.  I haven't had a chance to actually put seeds in it to see if the holes are sized right, but I do know that turning the dial takes more strength than I have and to take the top off requires a knife (or something) to pry it off.  I have to wonder how many times I can pry it loose before it breaks.  Perhaps I'll update this sometime next spring to let you know how it works and if it breaks soon.	-1
The seeds do not come out of the dial.  You might as well use your fingers as that would be just as effective.	-1
Not too pleased with this product---the wheel that is supposed to be rotated to get the seeds to drop individually is so tight I can't rotate it.  I simply put the seeds in the seeder and, slowly, tapped the seeded with my finger to try to get individual seeds seperated for dropping.  Doesn't work too well, but I tried.  I wouldn't buy another.	-1
I tried cabbage seeds and rutabaga seeds and this things dispenses several with each depression of the plunger.  I tried depressing it part way but still get two or three at a time - it's almost impossible to get one seed to come out at a time.	-1
Gave this a try and ended up going back to using my fingers.  Trying to get this to only let out 1 or 2 seeds at a time is nearly impossible unless the seeds are large, which most of the veggie seeds I use are not.	-1
Works poorly as far as I am concerned. The inserts are not that good at seed selectivity and I do not use it anymore, I just sow by hand now.	-1
Bought some of this at a local home depot today hoping to make some nice red, white, & blue smoke bombs for independence day. The idiot company Bonide doesn't print anywhere on their label (or put anywhere on their website) what exactly this product contains.  Found out later that it contains potassium pyrosulfate. What also should be noted is that the container is only 1/3 full of the substance.  Why the hell waste all that packing material????  Did you think you needed to "stand out" in the isle at the hardware store?  Idiots.	-1
i used it as described in the instructions and id just does not work.  get out an axe	-1
I might have applied it to soon after cutting tree down. Didn't do anythging to stump.	-1
It's wood. lol.  but, for their price you might as well get a whole tree.	-1
Great for smoking, great flavor. Price is not so great. Try wally world.... 2bucks.	-1
The chips deserve 5 stars. But buy  the same brand and size at the big box store for $1.88	-1
Bought this about a year ago worked fine for a few weeks,I use it every other day to blow the trash in the back of my house. So I have to charge it a lot,ever since I started charging it the time got lower and lower,you need a new battery within six months. 18 volts no good.	-1
I just bought this unit at the end of last season and started using this spring. As others have mentioned the plastic impeller shattered when using tonight and now the unit is worthless. I love the interchangeability with the batteries but this was a terrible waste of money.	-1
The force with which this blows is weak--very weak.  It lasts only a few minutes on a single charge.  This was a waste of money and it is off to Goodwill.	-1
weber apple chips is better and cheaper at walmart	-1
Got his product a year ago, since beginning the battery life is very poor and only last for few minutes, same thing with the reserve battery.	-1
While everything from ordering to shipping was perfect, the product is slightly less than an excuse to give someone a job making this blower which really blows.  This is Black & Decker's excuse for what's the point...no lasting power whatsoever.  B&D should pull this product from offers to the public as it smacks of intent to defraud.  In today's world of new age battery coatings for more powerful and longer lasting batteries, Black & Decker should be ashamed.  Fool me once...shame on you; fool me twice...shame on me; fool me three times....I don't buy anymore of your krap...ever.	-1
Well I thought it would be nice to not have to drag my cord around any more and to have a quick way to blow out the garage.  This thing can not break cob webs loose from the wall. Very weak to say the least. I am really sad as I wanted this thing to work. Yes it may blow grass off my 12x12 back patio but no way would it do my drive way. Run time with good power, maybe 7-10 minutes.  After using it I hooked up my electric blower to actually "clean" my garage.  Certain things just do not work well with a battery.	-1
I have used this unit a number of times and always have to have three batteries charged and ready to go.  After about 2 minutes of run time the power of the unit has already decreased by about 50%.  The stream of air does not start off strong as it is and this makes the unit almost unusable.  Until Black and Decker decides to convert their units over to Lithium Ion technology the unit will continue to struggle with maintaining power and battery life.  The unit does create an air stream but it is almost unusable  for blowing all but the tiniest particles of dust and debris.  Save your money and buy a corded unit or if you need portability a gas powered unit!	-1
Very very happy with this clock, work great and keeps perfect time and looks really good in backyard patio, well after several months I just figured out that the thermometer and humidity deials are not working at all. Today I placed both dials to 0 ajhnd one hour they have not moved, temp right now 81 and humidity 17 If anybody know what I may be doing wrong let me know please including you Amazon since there is no way to get to the seller since it was you 05112018	-1
Doesn't hold a charge very long at all, weak, noisy, bottom-heavy, and too wheezy to blow anything away except a pile of dead ants, and dry ones at that.	-1
I loved this clock but one hand just came off. The temp stopped working within a few days. It may have been damaged in shipping and we didn't notice it at first. I was so sorry this happened. I still really need an outdoor clock but I am afraid to try another one of these.	-1
When it arrived the minute hand was dislodged, the temp gauge read 50 when the actual temp that day was 80, and the humidity gauge said 10 percent. I live in Delaware, the last time the humidity was that low here was when a T-Rex accidentally farted next to a fire. If you are going to make cheap stuff at least put a little effort into packaging for shipment.	-1
bought 2 differesnt flavors and bag said same amount 180 Cu. In and apple bag has considerably less chips than maple bag......	-1
I alreadyhave one of these and I love it but it came with 2 batteries, which is a must.  This time the gift for my husband failed because it didn't work at all from the start so we had to return it. Also now the product comes with only 1 battery.	-1
smells awful	-1
I may have given this one star, but when you use the star rating system, one star is for "I hate it".  And the fact is that I didn't hate it.  It is a good size with clear numbers.  The temperature and humidity seemed to work perfectly.  But this is an atomic clock, and it never set itself.  I ended up sending it back for a very similar clock with a different name - but the new one is accurate to the minute and reset itself even though it is hanging in the exact same spot as this clock.  I would also state that any time I have ever had to return a product, Amazon is the king of returns.  You go back to the original purchase, ask to return it and you either print a label or they will send it to you.  No hassle.  No real questions.  Always an apology that it did not work the way you would expect.  Sorry this didn't work - but glad I purchased it on Amazon.	-1
This leaf blower is good for two things: blowing leaves from a VERY small condo or apartment yard and for throwing out.  I cant even finish my driveway before the battery packs run out of steam.  I keep 2 batteries for it charged and I am lucky to get 10 minutes of good blowing power.  Its good for sawdust for about 3 minutes.  Blow Fast or Blow it off.	-1
Products works, but batteries die out very fast.  Barely enough power to blow dirt from garage and driveway without changing batteries.	-1
I have an electric blower and a decent sized yard. I got this blower so I wouldn't be tethered by the power cord. While the specs suggest this unit has decent blowing capacity, it is about 40% of my current blower. All I use it for, most of the time, is to deal with grass clippings. It is able to handle that, but barely and while it may take 10-15 minutes (I haven't timed this) to get the job done, a battery is only good for this one time. There is still some life left to it, but only to barely start it a second time. I typically use my blower to deal with leaves in the fall and I'm sure this one won't handle that task at all. Will need to save up for a good gas-powered one if I want to be untethered. This is fairly light and would be fine for really light duty kinds of things. It suffers the same malady most tools on rechargeable batteries do, as the battery starts to get low, the power on the tool also goes lower. It does ship with two batteries, so that's a plus. I expected more performance based on the specs, as in numbers, they are comparable to the corded unit I have, yet not even close in reality and that's the primary reason so low a rating from me.	-1
WAY too much bark!	-1
This was way overpriced and did not work when it arrived.  Sent it back.  It's too fragile and the barometer is not electronic.	-1
This is my 4th clock like this. All the others work like clockwork. This one does not and I've procrastinated too long to return it.	-1
This outdoor clock has no manual setting knob, which would have been cool, had it set itself properly. The instructions call for you to insert a AA battery, then select a time zone and hang it on an exterior wall that faces Ft Collins CO and within 5 days, it will set itself. Wait... what?? I re-read the instructions, certain I had misread them, but I hadn't. I tried setting time, but hands stopped moving at incorrect time. Then I called Customer Service. The man I spoke to told me to press a button on the back 20 times, then wait 15 minutes & try again. He said it would set itself within 5 days or so. When I explained I had no idea which direction Ft Collins was from my location & wanted to hang the clock in a specific location. He was rude & much more concerned about getting information on the battery I used than resolving my issue. Even after I assured him it was a brand new battery, fresh out of the package, he wanted the expiration date from the battery package. I ended the call & after 30 minutes, I tried setting the clock again. It moved to wrong time. Then I waited 3 days. No luck. Then I packaged up both clocks & had purchased & sent them back.	-1
On the original the light duty zipper failed. The nylon strap reduced itself to hundreds of small stringy threads which trap debris and frequently get caught in the zipper.  This replacement doesn't seem to be made any differently.  The plastic collar is difficult to transfer to another bag.  A bottom zipper instead of the one on the side would work better when it needs to be emptied into a trash bag or barrel  The plastic collar (not technically part of the bag) can be VERY difficult to separate from the blower housing, which you need to do each time you empty the bag.  I have fairly strong hands having done mechanical and fabrication work for decades, I think that many elderly folks wouldn't be able to remove the collar at all.  The machine itself works quite well for picking up dry leaves, but clogs quickly if you use it on pine needles or wet leaves.  The impeller blade has been very durable, I just don't like the bag design or the tendency to clog.  As a blower it is very effective, as a vacuum it leafs (pardon the pun) room for improvement.	-1
I found these chips to be extremely user unfriendly (takes a small act of God to ignite), and when all is said and done they do not impart much flavor to the meat... at least not when using a gas grill.  You can read many more details in my review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WESTERN-Reusable-Smoker-Tray/dp/B004LL7HGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WESTERN Reusable Smoker Tray</a>, but suffice it to say that I do not recommend these chips at all.	-1

These bags just don't last.  The zippers on them are inferior.	-1
You're buying this because your zipper broke, right?  Well bad news, you'll be buying this again in less than a year because this one is just as weak.  WEAK.  Unacceptable.	-1
We were one of the 10% who had a problem.  The first one we bought set immediately.  The instructions are not as clear as they could be.  We found the best way to set up the clock was to insert the battery, then let it default to the 12, 4, or 8 position.  It will stop on those positions if the clock has not received the radio signal from Ft Collins.  When the clock stops on one of those 3 positions, go outdoors and place the clock on a chair facing Colorado.  When the time is approaching an even hour, press your time zone button; and leave the clock alone.  There's a good chance the clock will set itself beginning on the hour.  The clock is set.  That's what happened to us.  However the clock stopped dead at 16 minutes before each hour.  We ordered a replacement.  The replacement clock was even worse.  We inserted the battery.  The long hand traveled 22 minutes and stopped dead forever.  Refund this time.  Goodbye Lacrosse.  We're trying a non-atomic clock for outside.	-1
Purchased it used,followed all directions in Manuel multiple times.would not hold correct time.pretty good reviews so i will try one more time.	-1
It's over priced.  It's just a canvas bag. It doesn't come with the plastic connector that hooks the bag to the blower.  The zipper broke on my original and the replacement cost was $25.  It's literally just a couple of yards of heavy canvas and a long zipper.  Removing the old bag from the connect was difficult because  the manufacturer really did a good job making a tight fit around the neck.  The bag is ok but not worth $25.	-1
This clock was purchased to put in the aisle way of a barn. It was not even placed directly outside, even though it is supposed to be for that. We had previously used a box store $10 clock that had to be replaced about once a year, obviously due to the outdoor humid and/or damp conditions. We figured this would be a more long term solution. However, the clock stopped working after only a few months of use. It seems we got as much use out of a cheap one. We have brought it into the house and got it started again, put it back out in the barn, and it stopped again. Tried that twice. Now it is the third time and it will not go at all no matter where we put this thing. We have had it laying around the house for a few months now and have given up. We've gotten no help from manufacturer. Ready to throw it away. I would not waste a dime on this clock.	-1
Husband really has a thing for atomic clocks, so he picked this one out to hang on the living room wall where we could see it from all the kitchen, dining room etc  We set the clock up per instructions provided in front of a window after we popped in the battery.  This crazy clock is consistently 10 mins behind; tried and true!  We tested and tried it with  a new battery and  then the same problem. We waited a few days and  it still 10 mins slow.....  I can't tell you how disappointed we are because it looked great on the wall!  We would purchase another 18" clock as it was clearly visible from the kitchen dining room and living room!!  Sadly,  it went back.  Thank you Amazon for free returns on defective merchandise.  Perhaps it would work in another area of the country. We live in a rural area on a mountain top. From all the positive reviews I assume that it would possibly work in other areas where the signal is stronger.  I cannot comment on how to figure  out signal strength though; good luck on the one!!  Guessing there are many other folks with the same problem  as there are many used ones for sale ..........so you could probably get a great deal!!!!  :)	-1
I returned the first unit I had bought since the minute-hand would hang for a minute or two at about 46 to 48 minutes on the clock face.  Over a 24-hour period this wold result in up to an hour delay.  I returned it to get a replacement, but it also did the same thing.  I returned the second unit for a refund.	-1
I live in south Louisiana and this clock gets its time from somewhere in Colorado. My intention was to keep this outdoors on an east facing wall, but it doesn't work well in that location. Instructions say to place it on a WEST FACING WALL so BUYER BE FOREWARNED. Wish I would have purchased a more simple clock.	-1
Nothing compared to weber. Sub par smoke. What a difference quality wood makes.	-1
worked great for one year as an outdoor pool clock.  now sets itself to the wrong time and won't keep a manual correction.	-1
Broke after 10 months!	-1
The hour hand sometimes shows up inbetween two numbers, so doesn't display accurately. Since daylight saving times earlier in March, this clock has still not corrected itself, despite me following all the support instructions on the website. It's still an hour behind and won't move forward an hour to the correct time. Waste of money - cheap plastic junk, doesn't work properly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	-1
At first it worked fine. Then it would not sync with Boulder. Then it would operate intermittently. Finally died. I changed batteries, reset the clock, changed position, set the clock manually. Would not and have not bought other La Crosse technology.	-1
Two defective clocks. The first one didn't work and had grinding gear noises,and the second one, the hands got stuck on the Humidity dial. The clock is big and really cool looking, and I would have been ecstatic if they worked. Is the third one the charm?	-1
Very poor quality. First, arguably the most important function of a clock is to display the correct time. I have owned this clock for ~6 months, and FREQUENTLY the time is way off, because the hour hand seems to "slip". By that, I mean that the minute hand always shows exactly correct time, but not the hour hand. So, for example, if it is on the hour, the minute hand points to 12 (as it should) but the hour hand - instead of pointing to one of the 12 numbers - is somewhere in between. At 10:00 this morning, I went out to see if it had set itself after "spring forward" and the minute hand was at 12 (correct) but the hour hand was about half-way between 9 and 10. Pathetic.  Second, the hygrometer (humidity) is WAY off. "No problem", I thought "I can calibrate it" - after all, the user manual that came with the clock (which is identical to the one on the LaCrosse website) has a couple of arrows pointing to things that are labelled "calibration screws", and the instructions state that "To manually adjust the sensors, use a flat tipped screwdriver to gently turn the temperature or humidity sensor screw at the back of the clock until desired setting has been reached". As of today (3/8/2015), the user manual is at version 6, and can be found here: http://bit.ly/1v5rUuf  Well, I couldn't see any calibration screws. So I emailed support, who responded. No mention of the "calibration screws", they just said that I should grab the fitting at the back of the clock with my hand, and twist it. This rotates the needle, and you stop when it is pointing at the desired humidity. Hmmm. Several problems here. First, why does the user manual give completely different instructions? Second, why doesn't LaCrosse support acknowledge this, and fix the manual? Third, and most important, the whole problem is that the humidity sensor is NOT PROPERLY CALIBRATED. So if the humidity in the morning is (say) 80%, I can grab the clock, and rotate the rear fitting till the needle is pointing at "80". Yay, it's correct!!! But later in the day, the humidity drops to (say) 45% - but the needle points to 58% (because the sensor is not properly calibrated). So what now? Am I supposed to go outside, take the clock down from the wall, and twist the fitting again, this time setting it at 45? But then, tomorrow morning, when humidity hits 80 again, the hygrometer on this thing will give an incorrect reading. So, you can't really "calibrate" this at all. To use an analogy - I may as well remove the battery from the clock, and if I wanted it to show the correct time, I could set it manually!!  Even better, I could leave it alone and the timepiece would still show the correct time twice a day ;-)	-1
Does not adjust easily to Colorado Atomic clock.  Time is always self adjusting, using up the battery life.  Who wants to wait up to five days for time to be correct?  Don't have time for that!!!!  Funny thing, we put this in a box to send back and when we last looked at it the time was correct!  Only took the clock 3 weeks to adjust!  Colorado and Florida are too far apart to adjust this clock atomically. Poor quality!	-1
Don't buy this if you live outside of the 48 States, because if you're within range it will reset to closest time zone. I live in Hawaii and it resets to PST. Called manufacturer and all their clocks does that , no manual override. Wasted time to buy and return, item should be noted with shortcoming.	-1
You would think that buying a clock in this day and age that keeps time would be straight forward.  Even if the clock did not pick up the radio signal from Colorado you would think you could adjust it manually and have it keep time.  This clock did neither.  Returned and purchased an Infinity manual clock instead.  1-Star for the clock, 5-stars for Amazon easy returns and reasonable prices.	-1
I own four of La Crosse's so called "Radio Controlled", or "Atomic", clocks ... all four originally worked perfect, then all four failed on the same day (still indicating that they received the NIST signal, but failing to re-set the clock).  I understand that the NIST transmission was upgraded on that day, but they say that no existing receivers should be effected, the original time data is still on the signal, and it was just an upgrade.  I did my research on the web, and found that thousands of other La Crosse clock users had the same problem.  In other words, the La Crosse engineers should have designed a system that would tolerate upgrades to the signal.  I contacted La Crosse, carefully explaining the situation, and asking if they were going to do the right thing, and provide a solution, or new working clocks.  They responded with a standard form letter, suggesting that I "try changing the batteries", or "try moving the clocks to a different location".  I responded explaining that I had already tried all of that, and I again carefully explained that all four clocks functioned perfectly, and all four failed on the same day (still indicating that they received the NIST signal, but failing to re-set the clock) ... this is not a battery or location issue, it's an engineering failure.  The final response from La Crosse was that my clocks are "out of warranty", so it's my problem, not theirs.  So let me ask you this ... if a company refuses to do the right thing, and replace a product with an obvious design flaw, why would anyone ever buy a product from them again?	-1

LIVE IN CENTRAL TIME ZONE - WOULD not SET AFTER TRYING TO SET VIA INSTRUCTIONS FOR CORRECT TIME ZONE.ATTEMPTED THAT FOR 3 DAYS  TRIED FOR 4 DAYS TO MANUALLY  WOULD ONLY STAY AT CORRECT TIME FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN WOULD CONSISTENTLY BE 20 MIN. OFF.  UNABLE TO GET THIS CLOCK TO WORK SHOWING CORRECT TIME.  RETURNING AND WILL REORDER ANOTHER TYPE AND BRAND.	-1
This clock tried to self-set time by radio transmission but failed.  The hands would rotate and settle on a time randomly within a range of about 20 to 30 minutes off.  I tried several times and carefully followed the instructions.  I had to return it.  One star for the product (made in China) but five stars for Amazon return policy.	-1
Did not keep good time. The thermometer was never accurate although it was always in the shade the reading was always off by about 7 degrees.	-1
This clock is great looking, the perfect size for outdoors and well insulated but we could not get it to keep time.  We tried the manual and automatic setting.  We went to the makers website and tried everything they suggested without success.  After 2 1/2 weeks of trying we finally gave up and sent it back.  We didn't want to do that because we loved everything else about the clock.  But, after all what good is a clock that doesn't keep time?  Unless you live in the Pacific time zone, I wouldn't waste my money on this.	-1
I correctly seasoned the wok etc and cleaned it thoroughly. I was HORRIFIED to see after 2 uses the bottom of the wok was silver in color. The black stuff whatever the hell it is had pealed off and gone into out food! I am now worried that my family has injested something dangerous! Complaining to Amazon and returning it immediately!	-1
Food sticks, too heavy, and hard to clean. I'll give it to my brother who will probably be able to manage it better.	-1
This is a real cast iron wok. No Asian will ever use it as it's extremely heavy and cannot get to the high temperature needed to use it as a real wok.	-1
One star for difficulty to use. Must pour boiling water on strip to activate. It's a permanent sticker not a magnet.	-1
We have bought five types of sprouts from this seller and have tried four of them.  Those four have sprouted well, but the sunflower seeds still have their hulls.  Therefore, when sprouting these sunflower seeds, each sprout has to be removed from its hull to be eaten.  It would be better to buy hulled sunflower seeds for sprouting and not to use these.	-1
This item is a waste of money.  I made three careful attempts to sprout these seeds and they did germinate however every single time these seeds experience chronic mold.  After more than three attempts with very meticulous and clean process with the same result I am sure it is with the quality of the seeds.  In comparison to seeds from other vendors these are the only ones have succumbed to chronic mold issues.  Unfortunately with success from broccoli seed sprouting I bought two bags of these thinking these would be great.  Don't waste your money please.	-1
First of the price for one lb is robbery!  I sprout for a living and this is disgraceful!  From the reviews it sounds like it's not even quality seed.  For that price they should be perfect, no mold and all seed sprouting.  Shame on you Sprout House!	-1
Poor sprouting: less than 1/4 of the seeds actually sprouted (3 attempts).	-1
When I made sprouts from them the sprouts had a smell to them.  I read where this is common for Broccoli seeds but even when I rinse them a lot the smell was still there.  I do not think this is a fault of the company but of the seeds themselves.  However, you might like them.	-1
I've sprouted a long time.  I am a sprouting madman.  I usually buy from wheatgrasskits.com or sprout people, and have always had great luck.  These ones from Todd's are not as good as the broccoli seeds I've bought in the past.  The germination is not as good as I have had in the past, but after working out the kinks with my new trays, I think my previous review was a little harsh.	-1
How do so many people post reviews for seeds that are certifiably NOT organic?. Todds is simply a slick bulk re-packer of seeds, and there is no chain of title with the seeds. Here is a sad example of someone throwing out a claim of Organic for the sake of profit, when the few smart ones that noticed no USDA certification on the bags answered posted questions. I suspect these could be from that poisoned earth of China, and none of you will ever be able to discover the truth unless you go dumpster diving at their re-pack factory. Best avoided until a chain of title can be posted with full certification. But it will not happen, as they simply buy whatever the market has at the lowest price.	-1
The seeds germinated OK, but there appeared to be a mold growth and a very strong, foul, sulfurous smell. Had to throw the batch out. Never had a similar problem with alfalfa sprouts.	-1
Unknown. I haven't tried sprouting these yet, since I tried another seed that I also bought with the Four-Tray Kitchen Crop Sprouter and not one seed sprouted. I don't know if the fault is with the seeds or the sprouter and I haven't worked up the courage to try again yet.	-1
The sprouts grew quickly but the taste is just too spicy for me. It must be the radish sprouts. I offered them to my daughter who usually likes spicy things and she said even she could not enjoy them. If you don't like sprouts with a definite bite, don't try these.	-1
I have been using these sprouts and noticed that almost all the red clovers have small black dots on the leaves. I e-mailed Amazon and Todd's seeds about the problem asking if it was okay to continue eatting. Amazon said they couldn't do anything and Todd's never responded. I am not sure if the spots are a problem, but it would have been nice to get some kind of response. Will not be ordering again.	-1
Perhaps I just got a bad batch.  But I did not have good results.  I tried sprouting these seeds on three occasions.  In all three of the cases, less than 1/3 of the seeds actually sprouts or showed any sign of doing so.  That's obviously not a good result.	-1
very dull, used for hacking down brush (blackberry) and didn't work.	-1
At first I was able to keep three small plant lights with these bulbs going, but after I moved I was never able to keep them working. I tried many times replacing the bulbs etc... I am now using a small Sun System HID light and I am much happier.	-1
I bought a Plant Light that uses this bulb.  The plant light and the bulb both were a BIG disappointment.  In fact, I bought another light and bulb and they both died within 3 months.  I don't recommend this bulb at all.	-1
I had to order this tube again for my Intelligent Light as they don't seem to last no where near as long as they should. The tubes are hard to install in the socket too.	-1
Dull blade, difficult cutting	-1
Kind of a joke.  It's heavy and has no sharpness to it out of the box.  I guess if you want a realistic costume piece, it's great.	-1
The blade is only 18" long. The handle is so small it is probably meant for a smaller person. What you pay is what you get.	-1
arrived too dull to cut a sheet of paper.  when you add in the cost of having it sharpened, it no longer seems like a bargain. i've tried to sharpen it myself with a sharpening stone after watching a few youtube videos, but i don't think i did a great job.	-1
Came really really dull and is honestly a bit  thick to be called a machete. I generally really like 1095 steel, it makes good knives, so when I saw a 1095 Machete at a pretty low price I was fairly excited, but when I got it I was very disappointed in a few things. For one, it comes incredibly dull, I mean it wouldn't cut anything, tried some 1 inch thick branches, and it just smashed through them, no cutting involved, wouldn't cut a yucca plant. I don't typically care that much with a machete, a lot of them don't come with great edge and are intended for you to put your own on there, it took a LONG time with a file to get this edge servicable but I don't know if I got a Friday afternoon machete or what, but I don't feel like it should have made it out the door.  Now lets talk about the handle- it's freakin awful.  it's uneven, mine was good 1/8th inch away from the tang in the back which made it incredibly uncomfortable, fine, whatever, 5 min with a rasp and 10 min with sandpaper fixes that. Well then, now that I've spend 45 minutes sharpening the blade and 20 minutes making the handle less terrible surely it'll be good. Go to work on some stuff in my yard with it. Does the job pretty well, the 1095 holds an edge well, but then after about an hour I notice the top rivet on the handle has already popped off. So, I might as well make a decent handle out of some g-10 or wood now...  Also the coating on it is really abrasive and honestly seems like it makes it cut worse, that could be my imagination though, though it does come off fairly easily.  Anyway, if you don't mind spending a good amount of time putting an edge and fixing the factory handle then feel free to buy this, there are better machetes out there for less money, but 1095 is good steel, though I still struggle to call it a "machete" as it's really too heavy and thick to swing as quickly as a machete.	-1
I have numerous Ontario machetes, including this one. After injuring my little finger with the D loop on the handle of another Ontario machete, and having all my smooth-handled Ontarios slip from my grasp at various times, I started to look for something better. I found it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gerber-Bear-Grylls-Parang/dp/B0091AVTR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gerber Bear Grylls Parang</a>, which is now the only machete I use, and I use it weekly.  If you want a safer, easier-to-use item with better blade geometry, move away from the antiquated Ontario products and see the difference.  Note: I live outside the USA and have no connection to Gerber.	-1
Good pice but it was not sealed it was runny and real dark orange in color so the price was ' irrelevant it went straight in the trash	-1
Did nothing for my cuttings. Waste of my money.	-1
Not good results, the tiny tin made it impossible to dip correctly and the gel just did not work as good as clonex tried to contact manufacturer but got no answer. So after 10 years of cloning I have found a product that I will give a bad review on.	-1
Although I have used Rootech in the past with success The last batch of Rootech failed!  It doesn't even seem to be water soluble.  The quality control seems nonexistent.  When I buy products that fail; I fail.	-1
couldn't get anything to clone. bought 2 containers. not as advertised.	-1
Not worth the price 7 bucks . When you can make your own autocloner in a 5 gal bucket. Never ever have to dip again.	-1
I'm sure glad that the tin is so tiny...this way I won't feel too bad when I throw it out!	-1
my mistake for sure missed the info that it was 1/4 ounce -- dear GOD so little got to me more careful on adds as photo can be deceptive sure won't buy anything like this again	-1
What's to like?  I took 24 English ivy cuttings. Half I placed straight into containers and half I applied the Rootech and placed in containers - these are in a climate controlled greenhouse. 100% of the Rootech died within 2 weeks. At least I had a 60% success rate with the others that had no treatment and those have since been transplanted and doing nicely.  Perhaps you'll have different results but I will not use again.	-1
This stuff literally kills the clones. At first I thought I did something different. But, no. I've tried several times to clone mmj using this gel and it rots the stem. Every time. They will not root. This last time I did a side by side with no hormones and those clones took while those dipped in the gel rotted.	-1
Didn't work for me	-1
did not see any growth	-1
The safety seal failed and there were tiny orange globs on the bottle and inside the bubble manila mailer.  There was a thin brown liquid in the little bottle but no gel.  I should have believed other similar reviews.	-1
This is a really, really small amount for the price, 1" bottle.  Find the larger one listed on Amazon, better value.	-1
I had no success with it, but maybe my technique was poor. The gel isn't easily taken up by the root you are trying to coat. Maybe it just takes some practice.	-1
didnt do the job	-1
Expensive and did not work... I used the whole container on various plant starts to no avail. Disappointing.	-1
I had way better results with regular rootone powder for my cherry and roma tomatoes.  Maybe it works better for other things but def not tomatoes.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I bought this cloning gel with the intent of producing a variety of cuttings for my mother's home. The tub is inexpensive enough, despite the size, as you'll only be using a relatively thin coat on your cuttings to begin with. I took cuttings of abelia, various semi-hardwood bushes, coleus and other things, placed them in some sterile, moistened coir with drainage holes, put them into bags misted with water to retain moisture (airing them out every so often), and waited. Every last cutting failed to root, even after sitting in the coir for over a week. That is odd, as both coleus and abelia root remarkably well from cuttings, but there it is. I did read that perhaps some damp sand would make for a better medium, but zero percent success rate? With coleus, no less? I'm just not impressed, so far. Maybe I'll give this another shot some other time.	-1
I have had this unit now for a little over a year and it has been replaced by the company now 3 times and it just failed again. Its not the bulb that is burning out it is the power supply and/or unit itself that fails. The Season button no longer works and the light does not come on.  The company has been very good about replacing the unit for free, so I give them a 5 start on customer service but the product is garbage. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you like getting it replaced every 3 to 6 months and having to contact support...	-1
My light overheated and burned out 2 months after buying it. Supplier was excellent about replacing it, however the second one burned out just as fast.	-1
Only 1 star because there are no shepherd hooks strong enough to hold the planter;they either bend with the weight or swing out of the ground when it is windy. You will end up with a planter on the ground and a broken tom plant. Great idea, but it needs some kind of companion stand that works with it. Anchoring to a railing will loosen your rails. Hooking to the side of your house will wreck the shingles or panels.	-1
I did not have very good luck with this thing. I thought it would be a space saving option but then ended up having to give it a large area so the plant wouldn't swing and hit something and damage it. Not that doing that did any favors for the poor plant. It came out one very long stem with a few tiny leaves and only produced two tiny tomatoes. I have heard others haven't had good luck with this thing either.	-1
My tomatoes got blithe or something as the leaves turned black. Not saying it was the unit here but I think the amount of water that drips on the plant made it susceptible.  Update 2018: this item fell apart after 1 year.	-1
doesn't hold enough dirt for a healthy tomato plant	-1
very poor results with tomatoes. It was nothing like the brochure photos included in your shipping box. I was very disappointed and will never buy this product again.	-1
It just did not hold up. The first time I watered it the bottom ripped out.	-1
Meh... tomato plant grew but was basically a single stalk without any branches or leaves which resulted in no fruit.  Then I had to throw it away before I could try again next season, because it had already fallen apart.	-1
Don't be fooled by the photo-shopped product image. Plants never goes that way. They turn their necks up to get more sunlight. You feel like you're torturing them against nature's own direction. Just didn't make sense to me after using them for two seasons. Went to trash.	-1
Description of the product says new, but it is very clear that it is a used product. The sticker on it says Goodwill and priced at 1.49. I paid 9 bucks for this. Be careful!	-1
Cable broke within the first 2 weeks of hanging it.  Had to make my own make shift cable to keep it level and upright.	-1
Works fairly well but not as productive as my tomatoes I planted in the ground.	-1
I followed the instructions, used good soil, bought a healthy Roma tomato plant.  It bloomed waaaay after all my more traditionally planted tomatoes... And the fruits themselves would turn black and rot on the bottom before they would ripen.  Everyone I talked to after buying one said they have never had any luck with them, and tomatoes are pretty darn hard to mess up.	-1
Just one question... WHAT VARIETY of tomato grows so nicely straight down like the pictures??? The tomatoes I planted in the DOZEN of these useless UPSIDE DOWN planters that I bought at that home garden depot...  ALL WANTED to try to grow upward!!! This caused vine breaking problems when tomatoes formed and weight was added to the equation! Planters from last year are sitting in my yard rotting. AND I AM BUYING tomato tub & trellis systems for this year!	-1
I only used it for two gardening season's. For some reason, it would fall down, breaking the tomato plant. I did get tomato's from it.	-1
Totally hate this thing... going by the damn instructions killed the last living tomato plant my Grand mother had brought over from her  old neighborhood in Italy.	-1
I followed the directions to the T and hung these up in my garden, and VERY CAREFULLY stuffed a tomato plant into place, then sat back and watered, and fertilized it meticulously throughout the summer, the JUST AS MY PLANTS BEGIN TO PRODUCE TOMATOES, it completely disintegrates (from 4 months of sun exposure) and falls down, crushing the tomato catastrophically, leaving me with a big mess of crushed tomato plant, and disintegrating plastic, torn straps and bent wire hoops. I was really mad, but to my horror, I watched all 4 of these planters I bought also fall to the ground in a similar heap, killing all my tomatoes, just as they began to produce. As if that wasn't enough, all 4 of my Topsy Turvy strawberry planters also fell in the matter of a week, also crushing all of my strawberries and killing the plants.  It absolutely AMAZES me that a company can design, and manufacture a product, then sell it across the country and the next greatest thing in agriculturewithout EVER HAVING TESTED EVEN 1 OF THEM AT ALL. ALL 8 of mine failed, fell, and killed my plants within just a week. There is absolutely no excuse for a product this defective to be on the market. SHAME ON FELKNOR VENTURESyou get an FAILURE for product design, testing, and quality controlbut congratulations, you get an A+ in marketing for fleecing all your customers in the process. You don't even deserve 1 star for ripping everyone off and getting away with it.	-1
I don't know why i bought this but i did ! Actually i know why it was the marketing. Dont believe everyting you read or even see. Not under any conditions could you possibly get a harvest like they show never this needs constant watering and maintenance just not worth a second look its just a fad nothing more nothing less	-1
Plastic bag with a few metal rings.  Within a few weeks the metal had pushed through the plastic edges so water would just run out the sides.  The metal also started to rust and the whole thing looks as classy as a bag of trash hanging on a hook.  If this was free, you would still not want it.  Get a pot and a tomato cage. ;)	-1
I AM AMENDING MY REVIEW AND OFFERING A MEA CULPA TO ANYONE WHO HAS BOUGHT ONE OF THESE IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. I do stand by the idea  and have had great success for many seasons but apparently the popularity  and the flooding of the market with these has the Makers cause to drastically reduce the quality of this product. I bought four this season and have had the CABLES BREAK, even as I was planting two of them.  Also the accessories like the foam disc inserts that hold the plant decreased from one inch to about a quater inch thickness (with good density) and even that is of such poor quality that the plant bulges out from the now shallower cup meant to hold the plant in place. Additionally there used to be two larger, perforated light foam discs (the width of the planter) to be placed at intervals in the soil to slow down evaporation and to keep the water from running right through --- not any more. The lids are ill fitting, the plaster liner is MUCH less durable and not attached well to wir ring that supports it. I am not deleting my previous review so that it will obvious that this is not simply a "Sour Grapes" opinion.  They just arent't worth buying anymore, even at their reduced prices. ---- MAY 28, 2009 I thought that this would just be a fun conversation starter when people visited my garden - it is so much more! This product far exceeds the description in the ad. The inverse orientation seems to encourage hearty plants - super strong stems requiring no staking - so many tomatoes that I'll be giving them away by the bushel - BEST of all the bugs don't seem to notice it is even there (and the rabbits can't reach it). After the severe rains this past Spring the whole rest of my garden is bogged down with mold, mildew and more insects than I have ever seen but the hanging tomato garden is thriving and pest free. The only access a crawly creature would have would be the wire that it hangs from (a much more clever design than the expensive 'Upside-down Tomato Garden' ($69.97) that is in actual contact with the ground and besides, that one has to be put together). Make sure that your plant 'starts' are a good five or six inches tall before they go into the planter and be consistent with the water (about a gallon each day) tomatoes are heavy drinkers. Have fun watching your whacky garden grow!	-1
I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.	-1
Now im a green thumbaholic when it comes to trying anything new in the gardening world. I love the feeling i get when i literally cant wait to open the box and try it out and see the results... Nothing was different when it comes to this topsy turvy. I bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes. Well to make it short, the harvest was embarrassing. I had a crimson cushion in both mine and my mothers plus one in a 1 gallon and one in a 3 gallon pot for the ultimate test of durability, watering, nutes, and overall yield per plant. Well the 3 gallon performed the best, giving me way more than 5 pounds of tomatoes easily every couple weeks. The topsy turvey even underperformed the 1 gallon and thats hard to do. These crimson cushions are HUGE and PLUMP, almost as big but not as dense as a beefsteak and in the T.T. they looked like cherry tomatoes, the color was , flavor was missing, and most of all the beauty of the plant just wasn't there. Great idea gone bad since this a path off of vertical growing. Vertical can get you 10 x the yield of any ordinary plant in any size container, but this is not as good of an idea as originally thought up. Hope this helps, stick to nature and dig a hole, don't have one than buy a 3 gallon pot and reap the benefits. One love my friends	-1
We purchased ours at a hardware store sale, so didn't pay the enormous sum that some people have done. By being sensible, we had no trouble positioning the two tomato plants, filling the bag, and hanging it:  I kept the bag on my lap, held the plants in position with one hand, troweled the planting mix in with the other until there was sufficient mix to keep the plants in place, turned the bag vertically to finish filling, THEN hung and watered it. Never had a problem with it drying out because we set it up as part of a drip system and turned the system on every morning until the planter dripped. The hardware is sturdy and gave no problems as we rotated the planter nearly daily. The bag did not rip or fall apart last summer or during last winter, when it was exposed to 7 months of storms off the Pacific.  All that said, it did not produce tomatoes despite the fact that the plants grew well, so we wasted our $6 and the cost of the tomato starts, since the purpose of it was to grow tomatoes. Hence the one star rating.  One person's comments here about using it as a vertical planter seem sensible, since the planter seems durable and is available at far less cost than advertised here.	-1
We had thought about one of these for some time, but the reviews were not good.  My wife finally got one.  Finding a place to hang it so it could get full sun was tricky.  We followed the directions exactly.  I added Miracle Grow and only used Miracle Grow potting soil.  I got a goood plant with a tall, firm, straight stalk. Everything  was good and wet.  In the morning the plant was dead. I don't know what dit it in. I will try one more time.	-1
This is a perfect example of great marketing. This product is a horrid piece of trash that, at any price over free, is not worth the money. However, from a marketing point of view these have been a tremendous success. As a gardener, don't be wowed by this. It's not worth the money.  I followed the directions exactly. The result was a scant few tomatoes and a lot of work. These things need daily, if not more, watering. Because there is very little soil, you will soon run into nutrition issues with this device. The vessel or plastic side material is trash. Mine ripped before the summer was over. Further, they are extremely heavy when filled with soil and water. Perhaps at least 50 or 60 pounds if not more. This will limit what you hang it on. I did not have much luck finding anything that could hold up. Hanging this dirt anchor on your house is out of the question.  This product is junk. You can do better with a pot and dirt. Avoid.	-1
I bought 4 and built a special hanger like a swing set for all 4. I planted cucumbers, tomateos, and other vegs. No matter how much I watered or fertalized I got more out of a five gallon container than this product. I wanted vegs. protected from dear and other ground animals and invested $9.00 per planter and $50.00 in the set up of swing set with wire no less. Got one cucumber and none of the other vegs. they dried up. The cherry tomateos did okay but not much of a yield.	-1
Absolutely USELESS...virtually impossible to keep an adequate water supply on the plant...showed wilting in less than 24 hours....no fruit; long vines; few leaves; my advice"  don't bother and don't WASTE your money!  I wish there was a ZERO stars rating...I would have used it!	-1
One month after planting these dry rotted and fell to the ground.  I used the recommended peat, etc but the sides are worthless.  You won't enjoy the fast production if it's on the ground after a month.  It's impossible to get red ripe tomatos in one month which is the life span of these poorly constructed planters.  Pure garbage.  Avoid like a plague.  You'd be better suspending a flower pot with wire than use this product.  Awful, waste of money.  Loss of all my plants, fertilizer, peat soil, etc.  Should be sold in a 99 cent store for 10 cents.	-1
Before you buy one, perform this simple test.  Lay a tomato seedling on its side. Water and fertilize normally See how the plant grows up, at a right angle, towards the sun?  That's what happens when you plant anything upside down. My plants exhausted themselves trying to grow in a 'U' shape and ended up with all sorts of problems; unlike the SAME SEEDLINGS PLANTED IN A GARDEN JUST 20 FEET AWAY!  Notice the huge price decrease (from a couple of years ago) on these?  That's because those of us who were fooled by the slick marketing would never buy another one.	-1

I have now had this topsy turvy bag kill three little tomato plants.  They just don't like it in that bag.  After the first plant died, little less than 2 weeks after planting, I emptied the soil (organic soil no less, kind of pricey) and replanted with another seedling.  I was struck by how stinky the soil was!  Dreadful odor and white worms in the soil!!!  Anyway, same thing happened and again this third time the poor plant looks to be about days away from death like the other two.  So am going to cut my losses at this point when the 3rd one dies and throw this dreadful planter away.  I live in Southern California so weather isn't an issue and I watered like it says.  But the water drips down onto the plant and the leaves get discolored and that sponge split the first time I planted a plant!  Then I read a lot of online reviews from different sites and realized a LOT of people haven't had much success with this planter.  Even when they got tomatoes to grow they were rotten inside!  So skip this, it doesn't work for most people.	-1
I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.  More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down	-1
I bought two of these YESTERDAY and they cost me $12.98 each, TODAY they are under $10.  I checked with Home Depot last night and realized they have them for $10.  Dumb me, I should have read the reviews.  We'll see how they work for me in our hot and humid summers.	-1
This is little more than a novelty item.  I bought two and really wanted to like the product.  I followed all the instructions, growing tomatoes in one and bell peppers in the other.  I'm a space starved vegetable gardener, and really hoped that this product would help me out, but it just never delivered.  The tomatoes (and there weren't many) were all runts, meanwhile the same variety of tomato is growing 20 feet away in the ground surrounded by a conventional cage and I'm getting dozens of huge tomatoes.  Same thing with the peppers.  I live in Southern California, and used these over the summer.  I spent most of my time dumping copious amounts of water and it still dried out too fast.  There may be other vegetables that do grow in this thing but I did not have a good experience and threw them away a month or so ago.  A shame.	-1
I actually had good luck growing things in these.  They shredded after only one season of use. My green peppers, tomatoes and zukes were great. The whole thing depends are proper watering. I have to get a refund at Home Depot because they don't have them anymore. They can't hold up in the Florida sun. I found that my Earthbox was a better idea.	-1
As has been mentioned by many others, this product is a waste of money.  The collar will cut through the stems of plants, result...dead plants. The sun will heat up the soil in the bag, result....dead plants. The plants will become root bound (if they survive) in the small bag, result...no tomatoes. There is no way to keep this thing properly watered. I tried them for 2 summers for tomatoes, the few tomatoes that survived had Blossom End Rot (BER), and production was lousy. I gave mine away on Freecycle, and purchased some Earthboxes.  MUCH better!!	-1
The images on TV and in the magazines and catalogs of this thing show bushels of huge, red tomatoes hanging from a plant that's about 5 feet long. Reality, at least for me, is nothing like that.  I bought 2 of the planters, good planting soil, and tomato plants for a total of around $30, a good investment if you're expecting a summer of fresh, home grown tomatoes. I first found that just because it rained, didn't mean the tomatoes got enough water, and even one day without watering made them shrivel up and look dead.  So, I got creative and began freezing plastic Perrier bottles full of tap water and sticking those into the openings.  It works, but here in the South, with our heat, I have to change them around noon to fresh ice; I feel as if I'm raising puppies.  Anyway, even though the plants livened up a bit, the tomatoes ranged in size (I kid you not) from marble size to small golf balls.  On my blog, I posted a photo of one of my red, ripe tomatoes beside a penny, and the penny is a little larger.  Hubby thought maybe it was the wrong kind of plants, so Sunday we ripped out the old ones and planted new ones, here in late July, so if they do produce any tomatoes (which I'm doubting) it will be September.  Sorry I invested in these planters, wouldn't recommend them to anyone, but the makers sure have made a mint off of them.	-1
My husband bought two of these for mothers day. We put a tomato in one and a sweet bell pepper in the other. One month later the plants have died and the topsy turvys are falling apart. te bottoms are cranking and have turned brown. Don't waste your money on these!	-1
I could not get my tomatoes to grow in this thing, either. The dirt got too hot and it was ALWAYS dry. I devised a hanging system that works much better. Take a five gallon pail and drill a drain hole on the side about 3 inches from the bottom. Fill the bottom with packing peanuts (non-disolving kind) up to the hole. Fill with dirt to within an inch of the top. Plant your tomato plant in the TOP (it will later hang over the side). I start my seedlings out right in my bucket (indoors) several weeks before the weather warms enough to put them out. The 3 inch reservior in the bottom holds excess water from waterings that the plant can absorb as it dries out on top. I water it about twice a week unless it rains. The drain hole lets out water in case of heavy rain. I hang my bucket on the end of my clothesline, and it weighs no more than thirty pounds soaking wet. I'm going to try cucumbers in one this year.	-1
I read most of the reviews to get the best tips. Bought 2 along with 2 50 day old Tomato Plants.  Cons:  1 out of the 2 plants broke off in the wind. I live in SC, it's not terrible windy here, so keep them out of the wind or move them when it gets windy.  I hung them on my porch and need a ladder to stand on to water them.  Tips:  Put the foam disk on the plant before inserting it into the planter.  Roll the plant in a piece of aluminum foil to feed the through the small hole (I had no problem getting the 50 day old plants through w/o damage to them).  Leave room at the top of the planter for a plastic container with holes punched in it to allow the water to gradually filter through the soil.  One of my plants broke off from the stem in the first 24 hrs. The other I had tried to get more of the stem into the soil, so that's another thing to consider since it's hanging upside down I guess it needs better protection from the wind.  I save old plants that died because they were seasonal and used that soil to fill the planters, this made it very light and easy to do in comparison to using "fresh" soil. However, you don't know what kind of chemicals were used in the soil if you purchased them from a store.  Water daily! You can't over water, it leaks right through.  Keep away from squirrels, I had @ 14 small tomatoes and they ate half of them!	-1
I ordered three of the Topsy Turvy Upside-down Tomato Planters last spring for the summer of 2006, thinking it would be great for saving space in my small garden area.  I ordered it and had my husband install hooks on our south-facing back patio.  When they arrived, I inserted the plants just as described and filled them with the best possible bagged soil I could find.  Not only did they not grow any better than the traditional ground method, but it was too heavy for me to lift up to the hooks.  My husband (operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil, both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October, with our first frost. If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs, don't purchase. Considering the trouble I had with this product, I would not purchase this item again, and would recommend that if you have any disabilities as I have or are elderly, try the traditional method. I'm thinking about having my husband build me some small raised beds about 2 feet off the ground!	-1
As far as I can tell, the only active ingredient in this product is CITRIC ACID. So I am quickly coming to the conclusion that so many of these hydroponic products are overpriced, over-hyped, and a big, unnecessary waste of plastic.  If someone can tell me differently, I will delete this review.	-1
The problem with this item is lack of oxygen. The pots are tall and only fill partly with water but the bottoms stay wet too long and the top dries too soon. This is not a well thought out item. Net pots would help with the problem	-1
Thankfully, I bought this AFTER I had taken the plunge and made my own ebb and flood system from a Rubbermaid bucket and parts purchased here and there.  I bought this because I wanted another system but didn't want to bother building it myself.  Foolish optimist!  The pump was so weak the table never flooded, so I replaced that.  The water outtake valve was too short, so I had to replace that.  Since I was overhauling the thing anyway,  I also added an air pump and air stone to keep the water oxygenated.  I didn't use the square black plastic buckets.  Instead, I laid down a bed of Sure to Grow and covered it with black plastic mulch.  I grew radishes.	-1
worthless	-1
Hate to give it one star and it might be an awesome product and meant for someone who knows a lot more than i do about plants.  Can u mix a gallon at a time and save for future or once diluted does it loose its umph?  Just hard to get product info on specifics on how to use on my houseplants...can u add protek to it and mix and store for a few months? etc	-1
Easy to adjust and use. I plug it into the Hydrofarm 7 Day digital program timer so I don't have to think twice about it. It was easy to set up and the plants are coming along well!  ******1 year later UPDATE: Regrets, this fixture is dead after one year. I couldn't even start my second season using this grow light. Ballast is dead, lamp is burned out and one of the clips on the inside that holds the lamp is also broken. Wasted Money.	-1
Put together easily; assembled per instructions.  The light does not work.  I ensured the light was inserted properly into the slots.  Very disappointing.  Now I will have to purchase another light assembly.  Really ridiculous given the price.	-1
Worked fine the first year but the light burned out after only one year of use. The box said the light is good for 20,000 hours.  I need to see if they will replace the light.	-1
Worked ok for a few seasons, bulb blew out (so I thought) couldn't find a replacement (finally did Home Depot 11$) and those bulbs don't work. So I guess it's done. I expected more use since I only use a few weeks once a year. Disappointed.	-1
I originally purchased this for $53 in 2011.  It was very sturdy.  It has held up very well and the frame is solid steel construction.  I purchased a 2nd unit in the fall of 2015 for $57.  This one was made if lightweight aluminum.  It was a bit unsteady.  The posts cone together with plastic connectors.  They work, but not nearly as sturdy as the original.  A decent product, but I wish they would have kept the steel construction.  As a follow-up...after completing the outdoor transplanting, it was time to put away the light until next year.  Surprise!  The unit does not come apart.  I am fearful of exerting too much force because of the lightweight aluminum.  The heavy duty steel one uses screws and comes apart easily.  Also, the string attachment to raise and lower the lamp comes with a cheap plastic hinge.  It is very difficult to keep the light in a raised position.  It continually slips.  In fact, one night it slipped and burned several plants.  The original was great, the new ones are a waste of money.	-1
Unit was a little hard to put together had to use a hammer. Plastic on joints pealed off a bit. And there were scratches on the top bar when it shipped. Guess not QC on appearance. But keeping it to see how it does with my plants	-1
I was really disappointed from the moment I saw it on my front porch leaning up against the wall for everyone to see who ordered a grow light.  Anyone who know's anything would know that this is not the right kind of light to grow Marijuana but I live in Colorado.  Everyone thinks everyone is growing Marijuana. The box itself was open and missing the bracket pieces so all I received was the bulb and housing.  As I was removing the housing I could hear pieces sliding around inside the bulb itself.  Sure enough, plugged it in and nothing, busted filament, bad bulb or for all I know it doesn't work period.  Honestly, without seeing the stand, I cannot see how this is a $60 product.  It is very cheaply constructed.  Much better lamps providing more light for your money out there.	-1
well i bought this for my hydrofarm dome. this could be great but it is not the little clips that go over the light are not centered. And the welds are not level so when you hang the T-5 it leans to the side against the bar. also the stopper that is in the center is cheap plastic and is very well lets just say that it is hanging on by  a thread and you have to wrap the extra rope around the bar to keep the light at the height you want. Very disappointing	-1
stand is cheap crap, ended up building my own stand	-1
This is a very cheaply made product.	-1
PLEASE do other research before getting this! I always read negative reviews more than positive ones. Sure enough, others had warned that the depth of the reach of the light was narrow. However I went ahead and got it. My bad! I would say that you could light maybe 4 rows of the seed starter.cells effectively. That I find, unacceptable. A typical flat has 6 rows. So not really deep enough for a standard flat. I had all kinds of foil hooked up to intensify the light. What a waste of time and effort. And a mess! I'm going out later to get a new light with at least 4 bulbs! The stand isn't bad, but if you look on line- can make one of PVC for around $10. If possible 1/2 star, as it was a learning experience. An EXPENSIVE one however. I emplore you to do a net search for making your own set up. Some are even effective made of rubber totes for set up of grown lights etc...	-1
been using 5 long years .no new stuff, starter pack is best for beginners im  guess can't believe they didn't keep other nutes	-1
Received this as a Christmas gift from my wish list. Looking forward to starting dahlias indoors. Didn't get around to setting it up until today (1-25-15). Good thing I did it now, because the light didn't come on. It didn't even make a hint of coming on. It was packaged pretty well, and it was seated in the fixture properly, so I see no cause for it. I did remove the bulb from the fixture once I determined that it wasn't coming on (it came already installed in the fixture, despite the directions which indicate that you have to install the bulb) and when I shook it gently, I did hear a tiny something shaking around inside, but don't know if that means anything. Just finished dealing with the return on Amazon chat-for some reason, they can't just send a replacement. Sent me a return label, and I have until 1-31-15 to ship it back. Meanwhile, I had to purchase the second one with my money, mainly because I need the shipping box. To purchase one suitable to ship this long item would've cost $20.00 or more. So as it is, my funds are on the line and I'll have to trust that this works out and that the refund for the first one goes through. AND that the second one actually works. crossing my fingers..............	-1
Having an intermittent light issue, can't return to Amazon. Contacting Hydrofarm.	-1
Seemed to work well, but the tube did not even come close to lasting as long  as advertised.  Had I known that only 2,000 hours would be the life, I would not have purchased this item.  In fact, I shall use the frame to install a different system of lights, and forget about replacements.  I purchased this item in Oct. 2014, and am surely out of the warranty period, so would-be purchasers be warned about short life of a not-so-easy-item to replace a dead tube	-1
Great but small, should have got a 4'	-1
It never even effected the algea that built up on our pond here in the south. Had to go to other ways to fight algea.	-1
This light worked last year for a short time.  Light quit working, the light not the bulb!!	-1
A few years ago this was a good light. But now they make it with plastic connectors, and mine were already broken when I received the box! and you can't use it with broken connectors! Just another piece of Chinese crap now.	-1
This is a n overpriced  product based on what else is out there in the market place. The single t5 bulb is insufficient for any but the smallest growing system.	-1
I ordered two of these at first. One broke after two months of gentle use on a table inside my house with little to no handling. just on a time so I didn't even touch the thing. One day it wouldn't turn on no matter what I did. My return window had passed with amazon, so emailed the company... they sent me a new one (minus the green stand). Great. So fast forward to early 2015, another one did the same thing! The company replaced it, minus the green stand. Meanwhile I order two more, so now I have 4 total. Just went to put lights on my seedlings, indoors (we are in 2016 now) and understand, these have never have these been outside, in inclement weather, tossed around, or in any other way used or stored un-gently, but now two of them just magically will not turn on! Now I am back to two. I have no clue which 2 of the 4 were replaced since I didn't record that  on them when I stored them. But since they are all relatively new - since they were replaced or bought new, this should not be the case! Also, the metal frame part (which they do not replace when they send you a new one) has some how corroded or weared where it just snapped the plastic off. I can no longer use the stand as is, but will have to improvise, which at this point is inconsequential since the lighting mechanism no longer works. I would say if you want what is seemingly one season of gentle use, not years of use over and over, then this is your model. If you are like me, and value being able to reuse instead of replace, then this thing is wayyyy overpriced for the quality. They have great replacement plan if you can produce an amazon receipt. But as I said, I have already gone that route on two of them, and I have two more that are bad, and I have no idea which is which... For that reason, I'm out.	-1
Thought these were cute and my better half would get a kick out of them.  At first all looked good, but now that we have been using these for a couple months now, the paint is cracking and bubbling and the metal is rusting.  We have been washing these by hand so it is not a dishwasher thing.. Just cheap crap from overseas.  1.5 stars...  1 star cause that;s the lowest you can give, +.5 star cause it was cute.	-1
This Autumn, I dug up two jalapeno pepper plants in the garden, potted them and now they're spending the winter indoors, with us. Next spring, I'll plant them back in the garden and they'll be making peppers by early June. I've done this before but never with such a great light system.  UPDATE: (01-03-15) This review has gone from 5 stars to 1. The ballast failed after 15 months (8 months of winter use). I've read that others have had the same problem and that Hydrofarm has been of no help / service in replacing the ballast.  I am assuming it's the ballast for two reasons. I tried two replacement lamps and they didn't light. Also, before it failed the ballast made a loud humming noise. I'm disappointed to hear from others that Hydrofarm has not responded to this problem. I have no idea where the ballast is in the lamp, or if it's replaceable. Sounds like my only option is to open the fixture, try to find the ballast, and try to replace it. If that doesn't work, I'll toss the fixture (as one person advised) and find a reliable one. I ALREADY plan to avoid Hydrofarm in the future.  It's unacceptable/unethical to sell a light fixture that fails after 15 months.  UPDATE (02-04-15) I opened the fixture tonight. The "ballast" is a small circuit that cannot be replaced (unless you want to etch your own board and buy & solder in the electronic components). I think there are a butt-load of 5 star reviewers who will be frowning when they discover that their fixture only lasts as long as the first ballast. Somehow. Hydrofarm has managed to take a 100-year-old technology and turn it into garbage -- at the expense of their customers.  UPDATE (05-17-16) Soon after the previous update, I ordered two of Bayco SL-300 8.5 Inch Clamp Light with Aluminum Reflector and two Future Harvest Development Sun Blaster 26W CFL 6400K bulbs. As of May 2016, they are still available here and they have good customer reviews. I threw away the Hydrofarm light fixture and used the Hydrofarm scaffolding to mount the new lamps.	-1
Will not stand up straight the plastic assembly parts are very flimsy. 1 day after assembly the stand broke at plastic joints and fell over and broke two bulbs	-1
Was looking forward to having a grow light in my classroom so my students can see how we can grow plants indoors.  Ordered this lighting system early so I could make sure it worked and I would be familiar with how it worked.  Was delivered today and just got it put together.  The light does not work.  In my opnion, the frame is cheaply made and the light fixture seems to be twitchy. Returning it.  Hopefully, someone who is thinking of ordering this unit will not do so from the Amazon Warehouse, where I am sure this lighting unit will end up, with someone at Amazon trying to resell it. So disappointed.	-1
Because of other people reviews, I only placed 2 rows of seedling along the light so they can all get same intensity of lighting and also lower the light to 5" about the seedling, still I got ALL seedling germination with long legs..... REALLY??	-1
There was no plug (a/c adapter).  Also, you can see from the picture that there is supposed to be some sort of clamp that allows the rings dangling from the structure to attach to the hood (the light fixture) itself, but there is nothing in my package.  So I have a circular ring and a big piece of metal with no holes or anything of the sort.  The instructions just say to "attach" it.  WTH?!  Most frustrating is that there is no way to contact these people to get the missing parts sent to me - my only option is to send it back.  Now I have to disassemble it and re-box it (neither is an easy task) and ship it back, then start from scratch with weeks lost in the process.  Just a year or 2 ago I loved Amazon and made a point to order things they fulfill themselves.  Now I think I will start avoiding them.  On the upside, I received my defective product quickly.	-1
If one would arrive intact I'm guessing I would like it very much-with the easily adjustable height level system. The first one looked fine but wouldn't light up when plugged in. I returned it and tried for another. The second one arrived with a broken bulb, I was smart enough not to unpack the entire contents before checking the box with the broken bulb first, and so returned it for a refund. I bought two 60 watt CFL spiral bulbs instead to use for seed propagation. They seem to be doing fine.  Amazon's price is good. It appears that Hydrofarm does not check to see that it's products are in working order before shipping them out, so buyer beware. With Amazon's free delivery and return policy the returns were easyonly time was lost in getting started with this years plantings.	-1
Bulb is small and, while I will give it a try, in my estimation that's a $5 fixture which is being sold for $50. The adjustable" string slips much too easily and does not hold the light up correctly. The wire is too thick and interferes with setting of the light height.	-1
This is without a doubt the worst thing I've ever bought from Amazon. The frame is "redesigned" with these plastic quick connectors that are supposed to make assemble a breeze. There is one major problem with that. They are JUNK! The connectors either snapped when you tried to put them together or they won't seat properly in the holes and then you can't get the legs/feet the whole way together. Then you can't get the connectors back out. I'm not sure how the old design went together, but these connectors are way to flimsy to hold everything together. I'm in the process of sending this back for a refund. Don't waste your money on this one.	-1
I have purchased four Agri-Fab units over seven years and have had to repair or replace the gearboxes on every one.  I keep buying them because they're cheaper than comps in their class.  But I've had enough.  [Have you ever experienced the frustration and anger of the freakin' thing 'seizing' during your "Weed 'n Feed" run?  It sucks, believe me.]  Spend $100 more and save your heart and your lawn.  I have written Agri-Fab extensively over the past five years asking them to fire the engineers responsible for designing this POS.  [What good is them sending you replacement parts if they fail identically in short order?]  I write this review only because they continue to put a cheap plastic gearbox ... costing maybe $1 ... on their $100 and $200 units.	-1
Love the sweeper and attached a dethacher, but it came in a damaged box with parts missing	-1
This item is cheaply built and probably won't last a whole season as it is already in some disrepair after only a couple uses. If they didn't make it such a hassle to return this particular item I would have sent it back immediately.	-1
Thermometer did not work	-1
Good idea, maybe I have not learned how to use it well but I find that this gets stained easily and is hard to get clean. It does keep the veggies and fish from slipping through the grill but I can get the same effect from pan cooking or using foil instead. I don't think I would purchase this again. Overall I have loved all my weber products, this is my least favorite.	-1
Bought this based on Americas test kitchen but mine fell apart almost immediately.  Even dollar store grill brushes performed better than this one.  Hopefully mine was just defective, but my honest opinion is it is cheap and inferior quality.  Not going to try again.	-1
OK, I've been duped, too.  I bought this thinking it was the Cook's Magazine recommended grill brush.  It isn't.  I'm not happy but I guess I should have looked at the other reviews.  This sucks.....  I bought this after a review from Cook's magazine.  They for some reason rated it as the best grill brush on the market.  After using it for a while, I'm not sure why.  The brush isn't awful.  It's just not any better than an $6 brush from a big box store.  The grill pad doesn't clean any faster or better and I sort of miss the hooked scraper on other brushes to get junk from the bottom of the grill rack.  It's certainly not a waste of money but I'd never buy another.	-1
The product information reports that the unit comes with two pads. Mine came with only one. I returned it.	-1
Had to return two of these.  Both were ripped when they arrived even though they were supposed to be new.	-1
I had the same issue as the May 21 reviewer -- the cupholder is VERY different from the cupholder in the picture.  In fact, I had this same chair for years and based on the photo, thought I was replacing it with the same model, which had the cupholder in the picture (which folds neatly during transport, and is quite durable -- made with metal and good quality gripping plastic).  This new chair has a cheap plastic cupholder that has to be snapped on to the chair, and will last maybe 6-12 months at best before breaking -- that's how bad the quality of the new model's cupholder is (cheap, lightweight plastic, and having to remove the cupholder for transport will be a pain - it will either break or get lost).  Really a shame -- Amazon should at the very least update the photo to this new, inferior model.	-1
dead now, died very fast. I took good care of it too.	-1
I bought these because they said they were waterproof which is important if you want to keep cushions dry.  The day I received them, put them on the chairs.  First problem, only 2 of 4 covers had velcro attachments.  Second, it lightly rained overnight and in the morning I checked, and each chair pad was wet.  I do not recommend this product at all.	-1
Bought these chair covers in August 2016.  In August 2017 having to replace because there are holes everywhere and became brittle. .  I would not suggest buying these chair covers if they will be in the sun.  They lasted one summer in the sun/weather.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!	-1
I purchased two of these on February 28, 2016. It's 3 months later - THREE MONTHS! and they are falling apart. Ripped with holes in it. We've had a mild spring, and have not even hit the hot months of summer yet.  Completely worthless. However, there's a 3 year warranty...and during that time, I'm sure I'll be requesting more than one replacement.	-1
Looks good, but it does leak at stitching	-1
Be sure and try it immediately upon receipt to ensure it fits.  I ordered two, one was too small but I had kept it too long to return nd it would have been too much trouble to return it.	-1
Only lasted about 9 mo. then started to crack. Don't  buy.	-1
Mine arrived cracked!  Right near the feed door on the fire bowl.  This seems to be a common problem.  I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance anyway.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a problem that will continue as it is a design issue.  I was excited to get this and put it into action, but sadly it will be going back and I will not be messing around with getting a new one or trying a bunch of times to get one without defects.  There are several other options out there, try one of those.  Sorry Lodge, I really do love you guys.	-1
It is very poor for our area.  How can you say weatherproof when it leaks like a sieve.  Rain is weather.  Very deceiving.  Would not recommend.	-1
I had bought this brand years ago and they lasted. These are much thinner and serve little purpose. They leak horribly at the seems soaking cushions.	-1
I bought this as a temporary cover until I got a better one. What a big mistake. Not only did it leak, the dye from it stained my chair. One of my worst and most regretted purchases ever. Trying to save some money cost me multiples more in the long run. Even if not for the leak, the quality is very poor. It is an old style vinyl cover which means it doesn't breath and that is not good because you get mildew and such. Yuck. I bought a duck brand cover for my sofa at the same time that I bought this one. The quality is ten times greater than this even though it cost just a bit more. No leaks, it breathes and you can see and feel the quality difference is light years apart from this one.  Lesson learned, passing it along to you.	-1
For starters, there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front, seems intuitive, but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow, but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.  Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it, but, so far, we're not doing well.	-1
I purchased your Hibachi-style Charcoal Grill (L410) May 2011 and the cooking grill/grid is rusting terribly.  There are spots where the rust is coming off in layers.  My built-in gas grill has cast iron grids/grills and after nine years only get surface rust which is easily wiped off.  At the rate the grid/grill is rusting, it will be rusted through and destroyed in another year.  The grill is stored out of the weather and has never been rained on.  Other than the cooking grill/grid, the rest of the unit shows minimal surface rust.  Lodge says, "The grill is losing its seasoning.  I would recommend re-seasoning."  DUH!,  The first time you cook over  charcoal producing temperatures well over 1000F, any seasoning is GONE.  Be careful with this grill.	-1
The first things to go bad in my Weber Genesis were the flavorizer bars.  It was a little over two years.  The porcelain burned off, and they rusted through.  I replaced the bars with stainless steel bars so they would not rust out again.  Now the steel box on the ignigtor is rusted out, and the grill won't light.  The cheap tin electrode enclosure rusted so bad that half of the enclosure was gone (vaporized ?!).  Now my grilling grates are begining to rust through.  The porcelain is burned off and the grate is rusted through.  It's costed me over $150.00 in replacement parts already.  I would not reccomend that you cover your grill if left outside.  The cover will keep the moisture inside the grill and the components will rust out.	-1
Good quality and sturdy ! Not as good as I first thought .  I've only had it for a year and a half and it started leaking excessively a month ago and this is February 2018.  It's falling apart !!!	-1
I've bought about four of these now, and I'm on the hunt for something better quality.  The failure point is always the same.  It's the point where the feed line enters the reel fixture.  You get about three years out of these reels, and then you start to see some serious leakage at the connection point.  For the first two, I made the mistake of storing them in our shed outside between seasons.  But the water froze in the reels and split the plastic.  Okay, that was dumb on my part.  For the second two, I bought them into our home in my shop where they were stored over winter at room temperature.  But I only got three years out of the second pair when the connections started leaking.  So maybe Suncast will come up with a better design.  I'm getting really tired of US designed, Chinese made JUNK that doesn't hold up.  It seems US companies are happy to get by with "just satisfactory, and they won't last forever anyway - what were you thinking?"  But for those old enough to remember, it never used to be that way, and products were designed to last, not fall apart or spring leaks in three years.  I challenge Suncast to come up with something better.	-1
looks good and works good update broke in oct 2016 after only a couple months	-1

I currently have 100' hose on there and I would not put anything longer. It comes with a small hose that runs from the down spout to the hosemobile and is replaceable with a longer hose if desired. It is hard to roll up because the play in the plastic parts. It is almost counter intuitive to use such impressive parts for larger hoses. I have had it for a few months but I am worried about the plastic holding up for the longer run in the sun, I will move it inside for winter. I tried a heavy duty non-kink hose and it does not work.  It really comes down to your needs. If you use a long hose a lot, look elsewhere. If you use it once, or a few times, a summer it is better than nothing. It has helped with reducing kinks in my hose. But, be careful the first time you roll it up, if there is a kink when you roll it up you will have to unwind the entire hose when you want to use it.  It is a lot cheaper here on amazon in comparison to big box stores.	-1
Missing parts	-1
I've had mine for two ( going on three ) years, but I treat it delicately, rarely wheeling it around, just back and forth at the beginning and end of season. You have to "help" the crank with the hoseI have a 100' hose that barely fits on it. My biggest complaint with it is that it has leaked from every gasket since I purchased it, I replace them every year. I gave up on the short hose and replaced it with a better quality. I think I'll save for an "all steel construction" model when this once bites the dust.	-1
UPDATE:  I've had this hose reel for about 1 month now and used it maybe 3 times.  On the last usage, the leader hose completely broke off of the main hose reel, which makes this entire hose reel useless.  There was no pressure put on the leader hose to make it snap off, it just simply came off, and I'm unable to reattach it.  Of course, I'm just outside my window of return with Amazon, so I can't get my money back, but I'm going to contact Suncast to request a refund.  Pretty ridiculous!  DO NOT BUY!  As most people have stated, it is cheap plastic, and even my lightweight 50 ft. hose puts strain on the wheels when it's being rolled down a flat concrete walkway.  NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT!  ORIGINAL REVIEW:The hose reel arrived on time and it was well packaged.  I noticed a lot of complaints in the reviews, but so far I haven't had the problems that others seem to have.  It appears to be constructed well and I see myself having any years of usage for it.  I only have a 50 ft. hose attached, so I'm not straining the reel too much.  The only concern I had right out of the box was that the leader hose was slightly kinked when it arrived.  It was wrapped around the reel and thus had a stress kink in it.  Hopefully this won't prevent it from working smoothly.  The wheels roll nicely, and I like that the handle is collapsible, which makes storage a little easier.  I recommend!	-1
Flimsy	-1
I bought this Hose reel outside of amazon,  This unit did not last a full year.  Cheaply made (you get what you pay for).  It leaked, was hard to roll up, and didn't release the hose smoothly.  I would not buy this again, and thus I can't recommend it!.	-1
I inherited this model at a motel I took over.  Hated it from the get go.  Though out of plastic, it is durable enough.  But these two traits make it difficult to use:  1. It is short.  I am 5' 10" but to pull the thing around I have to hunch a bit.  An extra 3" to 6" in height would make it so much easier.  2. It has no reel lock.  So you wind up your hose and though I'd like to hook the end of the hose through the notches toward the top of the handle, this causes the reel to unwind and makes the hose floppy.	-1
I didn't buy this off of Amazon. I bought it at a big box. The crank on it spread apart so bad that after a few years of use it would not real in the hose any longer. Total Garbage for the price you pay. I was always careful to "help" the hose into the spool by pulling slack then winding that up and I still have landfill material after a short time.	-1
To its credit, this thing has lasted 8 years.  But it's leaked for most of that time, right at the inlet/bib where the connector hose attaches, and it gets worse and worse every week.  Oh, did I mention the connector hose?  I'm on my third - doesn't last, kinks really easily.  But the nice, hand-towable design?  I'm normal height, normal arm and leg length; it bangs against my leg under tow, and bounces everywhere, because it's not designed right for towing.  (It's not designed right for staying in place, either; a pull on the hose is just as likely to tip the whole thing over as it is to unwind more hose!)  Unlike other reviewers, I still have smooth, excellent crank rewinding of a heavy 5'8" hose after 8 years.  But like the other reviewers, thinking about this hose bib makes me positively cranky!  One star!	-1
I have owned 2 Suncast products - and they were both JUNK.  This hose reel is made of thin, cheap  plastic. It is very under-built.  With a hose on the reel, the handle is not even strong enough to tip it back and roll it across the yard without snapping loose - you end up just dragging it around.  After one season of use, the inlet hose connection to the reel leaked non-stop.  I bought mine at a local hardware store for $20.  Speaking from experience I would say don't buy this product or any of the other junk Suncast makes - it seems that cheap plastic junk all they make.	-1
This is a terrible product. I have used it for a year now. It is flimsy, bends and flexes far too much when it is cranked or moved. I think it is made of flexible vinyl or polyethylene. This is the wrong type of plastic for this application unless it is very thick. The wheels fall off. It bounces when moved because the wheels are either out of round or hang up on the axle. I heavily greased the axel, but that had no effect. I usually give products a good review, but this thing is horrible!	-1
This hose reel is misleading.  It may hold 175' of thin wall hose, but it has trouble holding 100' of a heavier hose.  I was able to buy a different hose reel that holds more hose (it is much larger) from Walmart for less money than I paid for this one.	-1
The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.  This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all.	-1
This trowel has the size of small trowel.  The interchange locking is only worked with short handle because you don't want to attach a trowel with the size of your palm to a long handle.  It looks ridiculous and not effective.  Buy this the same size trowel at a lower price at your local stores.	-1
These sheers work great when they are new.  I bought one of these in a fancy nursery in Santa Barbara where I was told they would last em a life time. Yes, They cut through things beautifully even when you have a a bunch of branches adding up to half an inch and sometimes 3/4".  But the honeymoon lasts only a month or two even for lite use at home.  They become rusty very quickly.  The blade on the one I got became black with rust after a year and I stopped using it after that.  I have bought cheap sheers from the 99-cent store that have not rusted at all under similar use.  I just bought a new Felco last month and have been keeping the blade edge dry by wiping it and sharpening the blade once a week.  I have used it on cut flowers inside the house only and it is already rusty.  The rust does not come off easy.  There are youtube videos on dismantling, oiling, cleaning and sharpening these but I think either Felco's were always over-rated or they have gone down in quality.	-1
As Felco as such an excellent reputation, I expected higher quality.  The blades became dull almost immediately though the pruners were only used for "light duty".  Within a couple of months the blades were rusty AND dull, so when the spring popped out and disappeared into the garden I said, "to heck with it!" and went to Wal Mart where I spent less than $10 for a pair that are serving me nicely their second year.  I dunno--others LOVE their Felcos.  Go figure.	-1
This is the fourth Felco hand pruner we have purchased (so we can have at weekend house also).  The first 3 were good (although not great) but bought one more as none seemed to get better reviews.  But the new pruner does not work well.  The blade is not sharp and twists on stems about 1/4" in diameter, making only a partial cut.  Also, the locking lever keeps closing when in use and we have to stop to open the blade again before doing the next cut.	-1
THESE HANDLES WILL BREAK AT THE BUTTON AFTER 3-4 SEASONS. METAL FATIGUE AND A DESIGN FLAW. SQUARE HOLES IN METAL DEVELOP  CRACKS AT THE CORNERS. ALWAYS HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL. It's why they are NOT used on ships and airplanes.  SOME OF THE WOLF GARTEN HEADS ARE GOOD THOUGH. THE HOES AND THE RAKE. THE THREE TINE CULTIVATOR.  SOME OF THE ATTACHMENTS YOU'LL BUY AND NEVER USE.  GET THE AFORE MENTIONED HEADS AND MAKE SOME HANDLES FOR THEM. A FEW MINUTES AT YOUR WORK BENCH WITH SOME HAND TOOLS AND SOME EMT STEEL CONDUIT AND VIOLA! HANDLES.  BUYER BEWARE.	-1
Well, I guess I will never know. Ordered the wooden handle so that I could easily cut it to a shorter length since that seems to be the only option to get a normally sized handle from Wolf-Garten. Cut the aluminum handle down with much more effort. Not happy.	-1
This is a true waste of time if you have any moisture or anything but sand to plung this in.  It plugs each and every time.  It would work much better if the tubing was tapered so you could at least have a chance of digging the dirt out after each penetration.  I gave up and rented an aerator.  It worked.	-1
I got this product based on the many positive reviews and was looking forward to using it, but for me it did not work. After only a few "pokes" the soil got stuck in the tubes and I had to clean them out with a screwdriver. I tried again with the same result. The soil was moist but not wet. Maybe it works with bone-dry soil, but in my region (New England) it rains more-or-less regularly year round so the soil rarely get that dry. I probably won't bother to return it, but I will definitely need to find another way to aerate my lawn.	-1
Worked for about three "pushes" then one side plugged up.  After cleaning out the plugged side it will slightly work another couple times.  I measured and found that the entrance diameter of one of the holes is smaller than the other side.  I hope that mine doesn't work simply for this reason and not because the product sucks in general.  It would also be nice if there were four tubes in stead of two but Im sure that might not be practical.  Either way, I'll find myself a small electric aerator rather than take my chances with another one of these.	-1
Given the high reputation of these pruners (and the great reviews they got on Amazon) I decided to invest in them. But as much as I wanted to like them, after six months of use I have to admit I'm disappointed. The blade has already dulled and shows signs of rust, and the pruners now often stick (i.e., do not snap back open after a cut and need to be nudged open). I have oiled them regularly and sharpened as well. It's possible I'm missing something on the maintenance front. But after only six months one would expect a quality product to work well even with less-than-perfect maintenance, no? In short, in my experience these have been no better, and actually a bit worse, than the "regular" pruners you can buy for 1/3 the price.	-1
The Felco pruner is very high quality but sticks together if any decent amount of plant material gets on the blades. I believe this is due to the spring not being strong enough to push back adequately. My old cheap fisker pruner is left outside in the weather all the time and still doesn't have any issues with rust or sticking. I find myself using the junk pair more often for small everyday pruning jobs while leaving longer and involved tasks for the Felco. Don't buy this if you want a convenient accessible pair that is worry free because these have to be constantly maintained, oiled, wiped, and kept indoors. This is the Ferrari of pruners, and with that comes the upkeep.  EDIT:  Tried to loosen the unit in order to fix the sticking. Looked up videos at the manufacturer website and on YouTube on how to disassemble. The secure keeper bolt was so tight that it was literally impossible to remove, tried everything, even the included tool and Wd-40, it wouldn't budge. Returning the item.	-1
I was very disappointed in this. It has high reviews but the item I got was nearly useless. If I cut 4 or 5 stems the plant juices will cause the blades to stick together and I will have to use both hands to force them open. Then the next thing I cut they will stick closed again. Considering the other reviews I can only think that they are making this much more cheaply than they did in the past and the spring that opens the blades is much weaker. Anyway, it is useless. And I even bought the leather sheath for it. Which shows that sometimes even 96 positive reviews can be wrong. And leaves me still needing a decent pruner.	-1
SOME WOLF GARTEN ITEMS ARE JUST NOT GOOD. THIS ONE USES VERY SOFT AND WEAK STEEL.  THAT MEANS IT BENDS EASILY.  THEY ARE NOT KEEN TO REPLACE IT EITHER.  LOOK AT OTHERS OR HAVE ONE MADE LOCALLY.	-1
Clearly of quality construction, but far too expensive given options that are available.  Mine were stolen from my garage, and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $19.00.  They come with a life-time replacement guarantee. The $19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use.	-1
Does not do anything to sharpen my mower and tools.	-1
I bought this to make it easier to me to not have to remove the blade and take it to the grinder twice a year.  I tried this and for it to work well you'd have to use it on your blade for 15 minutes and your hand would fall off from exhaustion before its sharp.	-1
It worked twice and then broke.  You don't want to waste, time, money and energy on this silly low quality product.	-1
We have a very small lawn, so this mower seemed perfect. In the 6 years we have been using it we have been very happy. Unfortunately, the battery died at the start of summer.  Imagine my surprise when I tried to order a new one and found out there is a "3 to 4 week" wait until they send it. You cannot get this battery anywhere else. I ordered it on June 9th, they shipped it on July 16th and it arrived on July 20. Over 6 weeks! I had to rent a mower to do my lawn during the down time.  I would never buy another mower from this company with such poor service.	-1
Summary: I bought my C5 mower through a special offer from our electric utility at $[...] delivered. In my opinion it is it is almost worth that amount, but at $[...] it is way overpriced for what it can do. If you want to do anything more than cut grass slowly, go with a gas mower.  Pros: Light, no gasoline or oil, minimal maintenance, easy start, quiet, well constructed.  Cons: Poorly designed handle, cut is only fair, mulches poorly, mediocre bagging, bag is small, narrow cut, overpriced, poor battery life.  The Bottom Line: Buy it if you have small clean yard and the price is less than $[...]. It will work. Do not get the trimmer, a separate one is much more versatile.  Tips: The battery is pricey from DR [..].  You can find UB12100 batteries online that will end up costing about half what your pay from DR.  You need two UB12100 batteries and a #15 torx driver to change out the batteries in the case that comes with the mower (I do not know for sure but I would guess that the C6 takes 3 batteries).  The savings is about [..].  This mower cuts grass and that is about all. It does cut St. Augustine grass, but with no particular distinction. It does not cut as well as a good gas mower but it will compete with an average mower to merely cut grass. It does not mulch well and leaves fairly large pieces of leaves and noticeable grass clippings. If the yard is leaf free, after using the mulch attachment it looks OK. It does not bag the leaves very well and there remains a significant amount of residue. The wheels are not offset enough and the plastic body rather thick preventing close mowing against fences and walls.  The hand grip is poorly designed and requires a healthy grip and good size hands to keep the mower from constantly turning motor on and off increasing the battery drain significantly.  It is light and easy to maneuver even on a slope or over curbs. Since it is electric there are no gas cans, carburetor, no oil changes, no smell in the garage and no problem starting it. It is blessedly quiet. For those features alone it may be worthwhile.  However, on the downside if it needs a new battery every year at $[...] from DR, you have to weigh the cost of that silence.	-1
Maybe I have too much sludge....two containers of this...I get some dirty bubbles and crud float up...but no net change.	-1
This product turned my pond milky and created pockets of bubbles on the surface. It took many days to clear. The manufacturer did return my call regarding the failure of this product but they said it was due to my particular water conditions. NOWHERE on their own website, nor on their Amazon description, was there ANY warning about a specific, necessary water chemistry for this product to perform as advertised. While the maufacturer's rep answered my questions he did not show any concern or care about the situation. Even after I explained to him that I had used their enzyme products for nine years.  I rely heavily on the reviews here and hope to help others avoid wasting their money. The maufacturer refused to refund the price of the product to me.	-1

This was purchased a month ago and installed today - just a couple of days too late to return it.  I think it is junk.  It is supposed to move 250 gallons of water an hour.  I doubt if it is moving 50 gallons.  It is on a fountain and the old worn out pump worked better but I threw it away when I ordered this one.  Stupid me!  Expensive mistake but I will order another brand and get the fountain working correctly.	-1
Received first pump sounded like the bearings were bad. Sent it back got a second one did the same thing. Sent it back no Danner pumps for me.	-1
Unfortunately, I used this As Directed and killed 3 Koi fish and 1 goldfish.	-1
I have ordered this twice once I returned for another because it was leaking. Just got the replacement and the envelope almost feel apart and my top got all wet because it was leaking again. Not happy not returning and not ordering again	-1
Did not clear the water as guaranteed.  I bought 2 gal as well.  It was a waste of money.	-1
Killed my fish even though it was applied as directed.	-1
This really didn't do much for my pond. Instead I used quilt batting cut to fit my pressure filter and placed it between the foam filters. This addition filters out the smallest debris and keeps the water clear. Less chemicals is better for the fish and plants.	-1
Not what we expected	-1
did not work at all .	-1
I used this product to treat my approx. 1400 gallon fish pond, adding the appropriate amount daily over a 5-6 day period. I am sad to say that while my pond isn't any less clear, it's certainly not any more clear. As expensive as this product is I was super disappointed by the results. I guess I'll just keep searching for something that works :(	-1
Didn't work!	-1
Tried this in conjunction with other "solutions" suggested to no success...  There is a moment of clearing water...then a return to the green, sigh. Great reviews, but not for my problem....  I do note, however, that my green pond is baffling the local experts and they've had no solutions either... Guess we are on to a pressure filter, when we can afford one...till then...healthy fish in murky waters...	-1
didn't do anything to clear the pond	-1

When I was getting into hydrogardening I was recommended this pump. I needed a pump to drain reservoirs for nutrient changes in a passive hydro setup. I used it very infrequently, but it soon began having problems with overheating and not pumping propperly. I had the pump for about 6 months, with not much actuall service use before it totally failed.  I soon after changed my hydro setup to an active system, using a TNC pump. I still found myself needing a utility pump to mix nutrients in premix tanks and to move nutrients or RO water from holding tanks and sometimes as a continiuos mixing pump. Pretty light work for such a pump, but to my surprise, the second pump failed within 30 days.  The pumps both failed the same way, the impeller rotation was slowed by build up on the shaft and supporting race. Nothing heavy at all, just a little crud. After the first failure, I was keen to this potential and I did find crud buildup and I cleaned it, but it built up very quick, less than a week. The second failed quicker than the first, and the same way, eventhough it was not used in an identical fashion or nutrient solutions.  The first failed with me using a more "organic" nutrient solution. I figured somehow, eventhough it was highly recomended by a retailer for my specific circumstance, the nutrient solution was contaminating the impeller shaft.  The second was never exposed to the same solution as the first, but the failure was identical; overheating...and boy did the second one get hot!  I of course now am drilling my retailer as to what the heck is going on and why I am having continued failures.  They had no explanation...and no refund of my $100 bucks that i paid for each of them either!  I mulled things over and finally decided to just try the less expensive Active Aqua pumps.  That was over three years ago, and all three, under the same circumstance or harsher, have not once given me ANY issue what so ever...  They all pump just like the day I brought them home...  So, before you make the same mistake I made; thinking that the more expensive, sleeker, and suposedily best pump on the market is actually what you need...consider trying a much less expensive option, as it is likely to serve you as well.	-1
I have had my pond about 3 years now and have searched for a product that will keep the water clear. I have two heavy pumps so the water is constantly moving so that is not the issue. I drained the pond and bleached the liner, then filled the pond back up. The water stayed clear until our 1st spring day with warm temps. I used this product exactly as directed and my pond has never been greener. What really makes me mad is we have not had any days above 75 yet and usually it takes several hot days before the algee takes over. My search will continue, but this is not the product. I do not recommend this!	-1
Does the oposite of what it clames.	-1
I have been maintaining small koi ponds for over 10 years. I recently made a larger 1000 gallon pond for two12 inch koi and four 4 inch chubunkin. My 300 gallon pond for the same fish was always clean with a UV clarifier and various plants. I thought I would use this product till I got the water plants established. It did nothing. Very dissapointed.	-1
This was not effective for our small fountain (no fish) after multiple applications. The algae is still going strong and we will need to look into alternative measures.	-1
This company has very poor customer service, in fact down right rude!!, you will not get to speak with someone who builds or designed the pumps, only the secretary and she is extremely unprofessional who either speaks English as a third language or did poorly in school. The below is the reply that I received. I am sorry you're not understanding what I'm saying.  Our parts for the pumps are manufactured specifically for our pumps, not intex or anyone else.  There is no one else that will answer your question any better than I have.  You will need to google intex and call that company.  I have worked here for almost 12 years, I  know what I'm talking about. The item you're looking for needs to go through the name brand.  We don't do comparative parts for any other company. This will be the last time I explain this to you and your confusion.

The bales soak up water quickly and sink. The packaging says to remove the bales when they are waterlogged and sinking but I find myself switching out bales daily.	-1
Doesn't work at all. In fact it was killing my Lilly plant in my pond.	-1
Don't know if these worked to clear my pond or it was the filter change I made, but these keep sinking, and the directions says they only work when they're floating.	-1
didn't work  waste of money	-1
did not work, I left it in the container and the algae just attached it self to the straw,  I left it in for 6 months or more.  Got nothing, I'm using the others for my chickens nest boxes	-1
I have purchased 3 of these pumps over the last few years.  The first one worked great and lasted about 5 years in my Koi pond. When it died, I ordered a new one - I noticed that the price had dropped a lot and that made me a bit suspicious, but I had such good luck with the first one and went ahead and ordered it. The new pump worked for about 4 weeks then failed. I sent it to the Danner warranty center and they repaired it and sent it back to me. The repaired pump only ran for 2 weeks before it failed again.  I was in desperate need of a pump so I ordered another one (maybe the last one was just a dud?).  But I am sad to report that the new pump (#3) failed after 3 weeks.  I'm done with these pumps. It costs $20 to send it back to the warranty center! I think the quality is pretty bad on these pumps.	-1
Plugged it in and it ran for about 24 seconds. Amazon great about returning, but very disappointed in function and time wasted.	-1
I've had a bale in my pond for a month now, and it isn't doing anything.  I put it in fresh water, and now the water is green with algae.	-1
I Never saw any change in my pond water of 600 gal.	-1
It did not do a good job clearing the algae in my bubbler, a little disappointed.	-1
green water still.	-1
First time I use it , I followed the instructions, put it at night , next day all the fish die	-1
Used as  Directed and within two days 5 of my large fish had died. I added extra aeration to pond and the foaming got worse as well. Would not recommend.	-1
Supplier was great. Product was a big disappointment.  I treated my pond numerous times and very poor results.  Never got rid of algae.	-1
Followed the instructions, but if what I wanted was pea soup, I had bought peas. Waste of money!!!!	-1
Some people swear by this method; I don't.  The instructions indicate that the barley not be allowed to sink;  to remove the bale and allow to dry.  Then place the bale back into the pond.  This is ridiculous!	-1
didn't really see any changes in pond water clarity.	-1
Says for ponds, also tanks,how to to determine how And how much to use in a tank?nTreats 20,000 Galloohs, not exactly a tank size. Lay a tank size	-1
not so happy in second week with very little improvement. Yes I followed directions!	-1
Waste of money. Doesnt even work	-1
clorox works just as well	-1
did not know it would take oxygen out of water	-1
Didn't help.	-1
Didn't see any difference. "Roundup" next time	-1
I used this in a 270 gallon pond that is continuously aerated by a 600 gal filter/pump. 7 small goldfish, 6 small lilies, handful of water hyacinth in a pond that is drained and refilled with fresh water in mid-April. The pond receives morning shade only. Over the course of several very hot and very sunny days the pond turned green and visibility was at 3 inches. I used this product for about four weeks and saw little difference in clarity or in the amount of algae rinsed from the filter. The weather cooled (water cooled slightly), I added more water hyacinth and fresh barley straw and the pond cleared in two weeks. I'm not sure if the Algaefix finally worked or if other factors did it. This product is certainly not a quick fix if that is what you are looking for.	-1
It's hard to tell if they did any good or not in the pond. The green water cleared up but I think that it was more to do with another product. Since then I have taken them out and I don't see much a difference	-1
I would give it zero stars if I could, but Amazon requires at least one star. This killed 14 fantailed goldfish in my pond and I still have algae. I won't ever use this crap again. It's so toxic to the environment, it shouldn't even be legal.	-1
didn't help with pond	-1
They shipped quickly but I could tell no effect from the Barley. Some algae had already formed in the pond, it might have worked better if I had started before the algae formed.	-1
I have a large fountain and I wanted to get a product that will not hurt animals that will drink from it , for that purpose the product is good ( don't have any fish in there , so I can't say for sure it will be safe for fish . When it comes to controlling the algae it's not so effective, take a little out but comes back really quick. Once the algae starts this product will not take it away.	-1

I tried this for 4 weeks, still does not work water is still murky started 8/21 today is 09/18, exactly 4 weeks.  will give it another week and will draw the conclusion.	-1
It does not work.	-1
so far this stuff hasn't done anything to speak of two days and half the bottle and still string algae and it don't come off I will see how it does for few more days if not its back to amazon for refund I will update you on monday	-1
No changes after using a ton of this stuff all summer. The algae soup in my pond continues to bloom out of control. I wish there was a better solution!	-1

Did not help at all. They sunk to the bottom in 48 hours, it said to let dry out before putting back in. They spent more time drying than doing anything else. waste of money.	-1
Did nothing to help with our alge problem. Had it in the pond for well over a month. Went with a UV filter that cleaned up the problem within days.	-1
Killed my fish.	-1
I have only a 55 gallon pond, so it is difficult to tell how well this works.  Water is clear enough.  It was clear enough before I used it.  I purchased as a preventative for cloudiness.  One big problem I had is the tadpoles love it, the smaller ones fit in between the mesh that holds the straw together.  Then the tadpoles grew there and couldn't get out.  There they died and it created a bio bomb.  I pulled it out and threw it away.  This product may work better in bigger ponds without tadpoles.	-1
does not appear to have any effect on my small pond	-1
it does not work at all.waste of money.	-1
really didn't work in the pond the way it was advertised.  About all it did was take on water and sink to the bottom.  didn't do anything to help clear the water of prevent algae growth.  Rather a disappointment and waste of money	-1
It cleared up the algae but put my Koi fish in terrible distress. I thought it was quite disturbing watching the poor guys huddled in the bottle of the pond, refusing to attempt to get near the top of the water. They acted like it is battery acid floating in the foaming broth. I would have given it a zero if there was the option. I used less than 1/10 of the recommended dose.	-1
Very disappointed as it only made the water worst-followed directions and couldn't believe how the water went green after such a short time-it never turned green before using this.  Wasted money.	-1
I didn't see much use for this. Plus, after a short time, it sinks to the bottom. The instructions say it should float. You can dry it out and put back in pond, but it will sink even faster. I would not recommend as I don't see much value in this product.	-1
doesn't works at all	-1
Seems to work but need to add every few days Didnt hurt fish yet	-1
I don't know if these work for algae because after a few days they turned my water yellow brown and so I pulled them out.	-1
I have used this in the past and it kinda works, I have used it this time and 5/28/2016 and this batch killed 8 of my koi in my 5800 gal pond. I would not recommend this for treating algae stick to barley clear, it is a lot safer then this.	-1
Well, I have given these a chance to work. Followed directions exactly. I even started with a pretty clean pond after I drained and refilled it 3 times for my semi-annual cleaning. The water was clear and the filter new. I had really high hopes for these barley straw bales after reading so many great reviews, waited and waited as my water got greener and greener. It has been nearly a month now, and remember I started with fresh, clean and clear water. This is the mess I have now. It is as though I have used nothing at all. I have no idea what product I should try next, this was not the solution though. Anyone have any recommendations on what has worked for you? I have turtles and fish in this pond. Have never been able to get rid of algae and keep it away. Can't have plants as the turtles destroy them the minute I put them in. Ready to re-home the animals with a friend who has a pond and fill mine in with dirt and be done with it.	-1
All it does just keep floating on top and disturbing the fish! Not worth it at all!	-1
They did nothing.	-1
when i read the instructions on the bottle, it warns that it can kill fish in the pond - that should've been made more clear on the advertisement	-1
This company has very poor customer service, in fact down right rude!!, you will not get to speak with someone who builds or designed the pumps, only the secretary and she is extremely unprofessional who either speaks English as a third language or did poorly in school. The below is the reply that I received. I am sorry you're not understanding what I'm saying.  Our parts for the pumps are manufactured specifically for our pumps, not intex or anyone else.  There is no one else that will answer your question any better than I have.  You will need to google intex and call that company.  I have worked here for almost 12 years, I  know what I'm talking about. The item you're looking for needs to go through the name brand.  We don't do comparative parts for any other company. This will be the last time I explain this to you and your confusion.

The large print giveth, and the small print taketh away! Safe for fish, BUT NOT FOR PEOPLE AND ANIMALS!	-1
Did nothing on my small pond string algae ..... Waste of money.	-1
This didn't work to clear up my green pond water. I had to add more hyacinth and water lettuce to clear it up.	-1
so far no positive results of any kind.  Just purchased some liquid algae killer to add to the water.	-1
NOt working for me.	-1
don't work , killed all my fish.	-1
can't tell any difference yet, it's been one month.	-1
POISON!	-1
does not work	-1
I bought a set of straw bales last year that worked very well, deserving 5 stars. But my order this year is completely different. The bales are much looser, not densely packed like my 2015 order. The 2016 bales do not last even one third as long. I am very disappointed.	-1
useless	-1
Worked about as well as the API Regular 16 oz Algae Fix in my 275 gal tote. It Didn't.	-1
Purchased these in the past from Different Supplier, and the was great, these are way to big for the pond I needed them for. I should have read the dimensions first. Same packaging but a lot bigger than the others I ordered	-1
Doesn't do anything for the water that I noticed.	-1
Won't float more than a few days then it sinks. Instructions say to take it out and let dry. I do that and it sinks again. It's a pain and so far has not been effective. I might try the liquid, but won't buy these again.	-1
These have done absolutely nothing in the month that I've had them. My pond is ~500 gallons. Had 1 in for 2 weeks with no change so I put the second in the waterfall itself while the other floated near the falls. The pond is still as green as before.  In case this is somehow my fault, I don't know much about ponds. The pond was drained, cleaned and setup about 2 months ago. I put 2 koi in and a pleco about a week in(Yes, realize I should have waited longer to put them in). Within a couple weeks, I couldn't see but a couple inches into the water which is when I got these. The PH is a bit high and won't come down and the water is just as green as the day I put these in.	-1
not what we expected, did not help our pond any.	-1
Ok.	-1
I put two in my pond last summer and the moss never died  or slowed.  I waited till the bags sank before  putting two more in.  Still nothing  changed.	-1
Used them for about  of the summer.	-1
Did absolutely nothing to my algae issue.  Nothing.	-1
I could not see any change in the amount of algae that formed, and it did seem to darken the water, making it difficult to see the fish - which continued to die anyway.	-1
Always floated and worked!  This pair was old, dry, and sank within a day's time.  Waste of money.	-1
I used this API Pondcare Algaefix Algea control, 1 gallon on my 400 gallon koi pond. After 3 days, the  pond water was still murky and green .2 days later my 2 biggest kois died (each was about 4 pounds). Then 3 of my gold fish died. Being so anxious, I poured the remainder about 32 oz into the pond...2 days lapsed, the water was still murky ! I should buy something else !	-1
Kept the water clean but allowed algae to form on the rocks, not what I was looking for.	-1
it seems useless at all	-1
Didn't work. My koi destroyed the bag and made a huge mess in the pond. By the way, you can get this at walmart about 50x more for only $7 (huge bag) at the Halloween department.	-1
Maybe it worked for other people ... Not for me in a 275 gal tote.	-1
Followed the directions to the letter .... looked like it was going to start working but failed within 3 days	-1
While there is no mention of caution on this website that I can find about this product, the label on the container clearly statues:  "CAUTION: Do not use with freshwater crustaceans, including shrimp, crabs and lobsters",  with the further statement: "PRECAUTIONARY STATEMENT: HAZARDS TO HUMANS & DOMESTIC ANIMLS.  CAUTION: Harmful if swallowed or absorbed through the skin.  Avoid contact with skin, eyes or clothing.  Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling.  NOTE:  This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause Cancer"  I am returning this to Amazon unopened since my dog swims in my pond every day and I am not willing to take the chance that he will die along with the algae.	-1
Waste of money	-1
Not one ounce of difference in my 4 tier outdoor fountain.  I had high hopes for this product but it has not done for me what it is advertised to do.  I can not recommend this item.	-1
Made little to no difference in our pond.	-1
I've had these before, and they seemed OK, but these last 2 were terrible, the netting ripped prematurely, compared to the previous one. So next year I am going to see if I can find me some barley straw bales, and some netting and make my own.	-1
I have a bad algae situation. Worst in 4 year history of my pondless waterfall. I used this every 3 days at twice the recommended dosage. After 5 doses every 3 days there is no difference. I am surprised based on the other reviews. I just bought some Algae-Off to try and resolve my problem.	-1
Don't notice any difference whatsoever with these, other than that they get covered in green gunk too.	-1
Works eventually I guess. I won't buy again.	-1
I used this product in a pond with 8 goldfish in the 6-10 inch range, some plants, oh and thousands of tadpoles. I went light on the dose because I figured it was easier to just add more if needed. I sprinkled the fluid in at the waterfall, and in a few other spots. Low and behold it didn't remove the algae, but boy did it do a number on the tadpoles. The goldfish don't look too pleased either, their behavior is odd to say the least.	-1
Now at the bottom of my pond after so much green slimy algae grew on them.	-1
I have a 2000 gallon pond.  It cleared my algae, but at the recommended dose it seemed to really stress my goldfish. None died.  Makes your pond a little foamy for a day.  I stopped using it, got a bead filter, and now have crystal clear water.	-1
usless	-1
Does not work.	-1
They did not serve my purpose.	-1
said it would cloud the water, well it did and never did clear up, certainly didn't put my fish in there.	-1
Certainly didn't take the algae out of the 20 gallon fountain.  Even after I dumped the entire bottle in because the recommended amount didn't work	-1
I have used this product in the past and it was fine. This time it did not clear the pond and my huge goldfish who have endured many other trials died with in 24 hours.  I drained and cleaned my pond a few weeks ago.  After just a few days there was a lot of green algae.  I ordered this product and used it as directed.  Used it again as the directions instructed when the water did not clear.  Put in a 3rd dose a week later as per directions.  I still had green water.  I removed the fish, drained the pond and scrubbed away the algae and refilled the pond.  The next day I decided to add a maintenance dose of the product to prevent the algae from growing.  The next morning the pond was very sudsy and the fish were dead.  As I write this review 3 days later, I am looking at a pond with green algae and no fish.  I will not use this again.  The best thing I have found is a UV light.  Mine died last year and this is way I tried this product again.  Do not use this product if you have fish.	-1
They didn't work at all, and fell to bottom of my pond in a couple of days. Still as green as ever.	-1
Did not work for us. We've had our pond (approx. 1200 gallon) for over 20 years, so am well versed in 'pond stuff'. I actually used two different brands of this type of medium....neither worked at all, we let it run/float/etc. for almost 8 weeks without any clearing up of our water. Not until we went to our local koi dealer here in town did we come up with the cure of the "very cloudy, yucky greenish brown, unable to see the bottom, unable to see our fish" scenario. Was more expensive, but purchased some "bugs in a bottle" stuff.......this finally worked...and in just two weeks.	-1
Had zero effect on my 1200 gallon green cloudy pond....  I finally added a UV sanitizer I got from Home Depot.  And in combination with added quilt batting to my filter system the water was spring clear in about 3 days.  Neither the quilt batting or the UV light does anything by itself - I had to have them both before I met success.	-1
Everyone's pond is different, that said, this one did not work for mine. It did not kill algae or make any noticable difference. I used as per directions (even a little higher doasge after it didn't work in the beginning) but to no effect. I found another product by Tetra Pond that works MUCH better. Will not buy this one again.	-1
not really good	-1
I don't get it...it just sinks after sitting in the pond for a few days.  Constantly have to take out and let it dry.  At this point, i'll just let it sink.  It's not near any flowing water, so i don't get why it keeps sinking.  i have not yet tried the 2nd one that came in bag, but no reason to think it would perform differently.	-1
We have a ~1000 gallon pond, used this as described (double dose for two weeks) and it has not cleared our green water.  We do live in the Mohave desert, but the pond only gets about 6 hours of direct sun a day, during these summer months.  The pond is 3 feet deep, so it stays about 78-80 degrees in the summer.	-1
THIS PRODUCT IS 100% A GIMMICK.  THIS DID NOT EVEN TOUCH THE ALGAE.  PLEASE OFFER REFUND ASAP!	-1
I wish I could say it worked but after 3 weeks--nothing!	-1
These bales would float for a couple of days and then sink to the bottom of my pond.  They did nothing to clear the water.  I threw them away.	-1
Expensive, did not work, but killed some of the plants in the pond and the algae was still there. never try anything like it again	-1
I had just bought this product lately and followed the instructions and went even less than what it said , an a disaster happen it so far killed all of my Koi BIG ONE except I don't know who to blame or contact to get some thing out of this but I don't think am the blame.	-1
Does not work... will clog your filter and pumps. I went for a filter with a UV light and save money... Think of 1 year buying this straw that does not do its job vs investing on a UV light filter that will keep your pond clean with minimum maintenance.	-1
I put both of these in my 150 gallon horse trough. They don't seem to make any difference what so ever.	-1
I guess I expected more. I developed a problem ina new installations that got a little more sun than usual. I wanted to get rid of the black slime and this product only partially worked.	-1
Very expensive for what you get!  A little bit of barley straw wrapped into a plastic netting.  Calling it "Bales" is very overdoing it, they are about 10 inches long and have a diameter of about 4 inches.  I would call this a small roll of straw but definately not a bale! I don't even know if they work because the algae growth in my pond did not show any difference.  They might work if I would cover my entire pond with them, but any cover would do that!	-1
Turns the water BROWN.  It's been weeks and we still have BROWN water.  The top few inches are clear but the brownish colored water is all underneath.	-1
Sank almost immediately waste of money	-1
per the label don't use on warm days  well thats when most ponds need it  used it 2 times in a pond that 37000 gal  saw clear er water for about 3 days each time i used it  mite be good if u used double what they say and u use it every 5 days  is any 1 knows of a product that really does work  please leave a comment	-1
didnt notice anything different other then the straw floating around the pond, didn't look good. won't buy again. didn't work for me	-1
If you buy a 32 oz bottle, expect to get only 16 oz. Product is shipped without any kind of seal to keep the contents in the container. Mine arrived with almost all the product spilled out of the bottle into a sealed plastic bag. Lid/measuring cup was smashed. Inexcusably bad packaging. Returned what was left.	-1
Used as instructed and even put two in my 850 gallon pond.  It is a green mess!  Can't recommend product based on my experience.  Have used all year, replacing as necessary and pond still green with string algae.	-1
I was unable to get these to work for me.  And I didn't like their smell.  I have friends in other states that like them...maybe our climate is just to hot	-1
Have used this product for 8 years with and found it effective and had no problem with fish.  Last week I used the usual dose in my 2500 gallon pond and it appeared to have no effect.  Normally, I only use the product once a week or less.  This time I used the same dose 48 hours later.  The next morning my two oldest and largest Koi were dead.  Algaefix depletes the oxygen in the water and sadly the biggest fish need the most oxygen.  I fault myself for changing dosage from the level that has always been safe before.  But I fault Pond Care for not being more explicit about fish kill danger.  I kept my pump and waterfall going full blast and have a secondary air pump so that satisfies the recommendation on the bottle about keeping good circulation going.  My favorite Koi still died.  Every time I look in the pond and see them not there is very depressing knowing their death was PREVENTABLE!  The product usually works and will probably be fine if you stay with a safe dosage.  Just be careful and Google AlgaeFix and Dead Fish for more info on the dangers.	-1
I used algaefix in my two thousand gallon pond. It killed algae, all koi, all tadpoles and adult frogs were dying slowly. It will take me hundreds of dollars to replace my koi. I followed directions, I have aerator and waterfall. Who said it doesn't kill fish is lying. They said the same thing about cigarettes...	-1
