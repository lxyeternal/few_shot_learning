Nice, soothing sounds.  Recommend.	1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
All the songs are wonderful. I am a little bit bias as I love Needtobreathe, but this album is definitely worth a listen.	1
Love the whole CD.  These guys are great musicians and the lead singer has a amazing voice.  This CD is fresh and different  They don't get in a rut, producing the same sound on every CD.	1
I love this song	1
Need more Needtobreathe! Great Night will be stuck in your head for sure. All the songs are very good.	1
Such a great song !	1
great band, never lets me down with their music	1
This band is one of my favorites and this album does not disappoint. The songs are thoughtful and fun and there's only a couple on here that I feel kind of "meh" about normally I expect to like about half of the songs. This album is top notch right on par with the rest of their stuff.	1
These guys are amazing and the songs on this record are so good!  I highly suggest this album!	1
I am always amazed when NEEDTOBREATHE puts out a new project because I always think they can't top what they've already done--but then they do! I actually like the different sounds on HARDLOVE. It is fresh and free and deep and everything you expect from a great band. I personally don't think the differences are a far departure from their Southern Rock sound. I can't wait to learn all the lyrics so I can sing out when I see them in Greenville, SC, for Tour de Compadres! Great job guys! LOVE! I recommend!	1
So good!	1
Wow! Very upbeat song. Perfect song for dancing. A different type of song for Needtobreathe, but so great. This entire album is turning out to be quite a delight and experience.	1
Another winner from NEEDTOBREATHE	1
I am a die-hard NeedToBreathe fan, so I had to get this album as soon as it came out. Luckily, I was solo roadtripping on release day, so I had lots of time in my car with this album.  Needtobreathe is a great, great live band. Probably my favorite. I will take any opportunity I can to see them in person. That said, their records have always been a bit of a disappointment to me. Good, but not amazing. I really think that this is the exception. The sound is a bit different for them, but after a month of listening to this album, it still holds up. I love it.	1
Prime Cuts: Happiness, Money and Fame, Testify  After 2014's "Rivers in the Wasteland," which was a more reflective and rootsy recess, NEEDTOREATHE are back in the saddle with open cylinders.  Sounding rejuvenated and upbeat, "Hard Love" (stylized as "H A R D L O V E") finds the quartet back with their familiar grunge rock sounds with undercurrents of soul and EDM.  The band is composed of Bear Rinehart (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Bo Rinehart (backing vocals, guitar), Seth Bolt (backing vocals, bass) and Josh Lovelace (backing vocals, keys). Prior to this release, they have released five studio albums: Daylight (2006), The Heat (2007), The Outsiders (2009), The Reckoning (2011) and Rivers in the Wasteland (2014).  Co-produced by NEEDTOBREATHE and recorded at their very own Plantation Studios in Charleston, SC, "H A R D L O V E" is the quartet's sixth studio album.  In sync with the bulk of their own canon, these 12 songs pendulum swings between downright secular love and moralistic songs to thinly cloaked spiritual songs.  Opening with the 0.56 minute prelude "Mountain Part One," we get a foretaste of the album with the song's electronic warbling and the distorted sounds.  With its distance-sounding vocals that calls to mind those analog records of the 70s and with swirling fat electronic beats, the title cut "H A R D L O V E" is where nu folk meets EDM.  Featuring some Motown brass horns accompanying a tune that could have well been written by Marvin Gaye in his prime is "Money and Fame."  This soul-pricking tune warns against the temptations that the two commodities bring told with some arresting lines: "I was sleeping with a loaded gun/I was scared of all the things I've done."  "No Excuses" finds Bear utilizing his Prince-esque falsetto over an electric guitar-led rock tune.  Though the song doesn't mention Jesus directly, the punchy and upbeat "Happiness" gets to the heart of our Lord's teaching: what constitutes contentment?  "When I Sing" and "Great Night" step away from the spiritual hefty terrain for more down time fun.  Yet, for a band who has got on ruminating about life's meaning via "Happiness," to hear them singing:"Let's have a great night on the dance floor/I'll be the cowboy on the white horse" sounds incongruous.  Much more substantial is the romantic folkish ballad "Let's Stay Home Tonight."  "Testify," which is a modern worship anthem about surrendering to God, gets back into the CCM territory.  The same can be said about "Clear" which is essentially a love song to God.  Though it is understandable that NEEDTOBREATHE is trying to reach beyond the CCM crowd, but when it's a blatant worship song, is it too much to ask if the name "Jesus" is mentioned perhaps once or twice?	1
Another great song from Needtobreathe	1
Great CD.  Love it all.	1
Really good!	1
Some of the songs are a little unexpected and it's more of a crossover album than some of their others, but I love this album.  There are a lot of "love" songs in it, more so than any of the others, which can sometimes get a little awkward to sing along to, but they're still good songs.  The others are fun, there are a couple that are really hard hitting, and then there's some really encouraging ones.  Typically on an album I find that I skip through about 3 or 4 songs and on this only a couple are kind of "meh" for me.  I'm a little biased in that I love all of their albums, some more than others.  This one is a good one!	1
Each CD from Needtobreathe is better than the last! This is fantastic and fresh. Enjoy!	1
One of the best New NTB songs!! Great beat! An anthem that everyone who knows God comes to realize...  In our pursuit of happiness, we end up discovering "There ain't no life worth doing what I did to You!" and our deep need for forgiveness... The happiness comes in knowing that He gives forgiveness freely and shows us the fulfillment of a real "pursuit of Happiness" They know the same God who gives Joy & Happiness as David Crowder&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Oh-Happiness/dp/B002NSOHIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Oh, Happiness</a> Americans will especially relate to this as we understand the "inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness..." and where it has lead many of us...  Happily, I have experienced & been able to give the true measure of love: "Some times you leave the one's you love, but if it's love they won't give up, 'cause they know war's raging..."  "I've been working all night, can't You help me to believe...This song ain't nothing, the song can't set you free!" Many of us have literally worked ALL NIGHT in our pursuit & understand that songs of joy will only take us so far, we to know the One who gives perseverance & endurance (Romans 15:5)  Again, Need to Breathe is able to express the feelings and experiences of so many of us and allow us to praise God at full volume!	1
Love them!	1
Amazing song!	1
Love this song.  It's so perfectly Needtobreathe.	1
Love the song and the entire album!	1
This is my favorite song right now. It has a very catchy beat and it is so full of joy. This song will not disappoint any Needtobreathe fans and will make those who have never heard of them instant followers.	1
Love them!!	1
I have waited so long for another release from Q-Tip..I didn't even know he had a cd out till I went to BestBuy, and i'm so glad I did..this cd is excellent if you liked A Tribe called Quest...then this cd is a must very enjoyable to the point where you have just listened to the whole cd without realising it.....In one word Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Q-Tip's solo career reads like a bad joke. As A Tribe Called Quest's frontman, he led the alternative hip hop movement and helped establish hip hop as a literate and creative art form during the 90s. After the Native Tongues moved on and ATCQ disbanded, Tip released his solo debut&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amplified/dp/B00002R0K9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amplified</a>&nbsp;in 1999 and looked forward to a career of production and performing as his abstract genius and legend would warrant. And after ten years, at least three inexplicably shelved LPs (most notably "Kamaal the Abstract," which got as far as promo pressings), and countless record labels, Tip's long awaited follow-up "The Renaissance" arrived almost silently. Release delays date back years, and since rumors of "The Renaissance" have floated for so long, the quick and quiet release seems odd, especially given his huge fanbase and genre-defying appeal.  At 43 minutes and twelve tracks, it's a concise and focused listen and is immediately enjoyable. While it emits a spirit somewhat comparable to a Tribe recording and shows a hint of the smooth Soulquarians vibe of the late-90s, I'd say it's most similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amplified/dp/B00002R0K9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amplified</a>. However,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amplified/dp/B00002R0K9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amplified</a>'s most frequent criticism is that it is too forced and pop-oriented, and "The Renaissance" does not have that problem. The music is comparably playful, upbeat, and bouncy, but is less poppy and more mature and soulful than its predecessor. The production, mostly piano-based, is layered with a range of artistic instrumentation that sounds classy despite its fun and appealing nature. It's a very clean and consistent sound, and transitions are so fluid that the first half seems like variations upon a single idea.  Tip still has the charm and wit of the wily teen from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/People-s-Instinctive-Travels-and-the-Paths-of-Rhythm/dp/B0000004WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</a>, but his focus has shifted with time and maturity. He's happier to drop a clever one-liner or a latently insightful verse than elaborate upon social ills as he did in the 90s. He doesn't often display the style that led to his "abstract rapper" tag; instead his lyrics concern different manners of love, music, and levels of inspiration. The hooks are strong and his approach is well-rounded, seemingly intent upon the combined quality of the music and rap. No guest MCs appear, but vocal contributors include Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo, Norah Jones, and Amanda Diva.  The disc opens to the pleasant, bouncy guitar strums of "Johnny Is Dead," which give way to an appealing arrangement with rumbling bass and piano chords and a strong performance from Tip. The breezy "Gettin' Up" and "Official" are similar in approach, structure, and sound to the opener and achieve the same appeal as well. "We Fight/Love" is an excellent collaboration with a particularly airy Raphael Saadiq, who complements Tip nicely over a great arrangement. Another highlight is the hidden title track after "Move," which has a hypnotic beat and the album's most insightful lyrics. "Dance on Glass" picks up when the rich beat finally kicks in about a minute through, and the Norah Jones duet "Life Is Better" is smooth, inspired excellence. "Won't Trade" is clever, and "You" is a decent love song that sounds good but moves too slowly. However, "Believe" with D'Angelo is wonderful musically and lyrically, and the closer "Shaka" is the track that most resembles a classic Tribe cut.  "The Renaissance" is not the revolutionary opus that some might expect from Tip after such a long layover, but as Dr. Dre should soon learn, hype builds around years of delays. The music is totally enjoyable and well-produced even if not totally uncharted (granted, some of these tracks are years old), and the LP reminds me why I had so eagerly anticipated Q-Tip's return a few years ago. This album is a great listen and should not disappoint.	1
As I been listening to his group, A Tribe Called Quest rapping through with hip-hop, soul, and jazz going on. Q-Tip making good lovin' with the same stuff on his own music to show for the another kind of creatively.	1
"one of the best hip hop albums i've heard in a long time."	1
I've been listening to this disc for a minute now, and had to give it a shout out. Nice, Q-Tip and posse broke out with some cool cuts here. Opening with "Johnny is Dead", all I can say is nice way to open the show. "Getting Up" is Q-Tip checking in with his roots, sounds like to me. And in this case no problem, do your thing youngman. "Official" is a smooth vibe. But, We Fight /We Love" is a crazy smoldering, hot funky beat. I like  smoldering crazy, hot funky beats.   The next half of the disc puts you on the dance floor for some more with "Manwomanboogie", same thing goes for "Move", and "Dance on Glass". Nora Jones is here putting some work in on the slow jam "Life Is Better" which is also a great "Cha cha" groove. Finishing off with "Shaka" Bringing the heat, Q-Tip style, yes it's funky Hip-Hop too :}	1
Q-Tip returned in 2008 with "The Renaissance", his first album in nine years. This album had been in the making since 2005, under it's original titles "Open" and "Live At The Renaissance". Two songs were released in that time, "Work It Out" and "The Fever"- neither of which made it on the album, but the official first single "Gettin' Up" did. It starts off with "Johnny Is Dead" and leads into "Won't Trade" which isn't a bad song, but is the weakest compared to the rest of the album. Later on in the album is the song "You" in which Q-Tip confronts a woman over her infidelity. The long absent D'Angelo appears on the inspirational tune "Believe" and the closer "Shaka" touches on the deceased, including his former manager Shaka, jazz musician Weldon Irvine and the late J. Dilla, who produced the only song that Q-Tip didn't- the rather brief "Move". "The Renaissance" has only twelve songs, but all of them are worthy of listening to from start to finish. This record will not disappoint.	1
I am in awe of Q-Tip's sophomore LP, "The Renaissance."  "Getting Up" captivated me from the first listen and inspired me to listen to the album which featured it. It's easily one of the best rap tracks I have heard in a very long time. This album is indulged with a neo-soul/1990's hip hop feel; Q-Tip rhymes over each beat effortlessly and effectively.  He still has that distinctive voice and his lyrical skills are as good as they have ever been. Yes, the lyrics on this album are a force to be reckoned with; he obviously devoted much time into writing these songs. "Shaka" is a song which pay tribute to those who have passed away.  "Johnny is Dead" is full of great one-liners.  This track has a rock feel to it and Q-Tip does a fine job with delivering the lyrics.  Raphael Saadiq lends his vocals to the track, "We Fight/We Love" and the result is marvelous.  Both Saadiq and Tip are "abstract artists."  This album exemplifies good hip-hop and all are encouraged to add it to your music collection.  Mikeisha's Top 5 1.  Getting Up" 2.  "We Love/We Fight" 3.  "Official" 4.  "Shaka" 5.

Finally. Passed from label to label, a classic album called Kamaal the Abstract held in the mix, A Tribe Called Quest frontman Q-Tip has at long last released his first record in music's Brave New World, titled The Renaissance. Less blatant (read: less poppy) than his solo debut, 1999's stellar-enough Amplified, Tip's latest is - more than anything he's yet released - the work of a seasoned auteur. Save for a few drops of production goodness from the late J. Dilla and a handful of hooks offered by the finest of today's high-profile soul singers, The Renaissance is 100 percent Q-Tip. He wrote it. He produced it. He recorded it. He played a number of the live instruments. He mixed it. He even offered up the not-always-great scratches sprinkled throughout. These are all good things; all you really need on a Q-Tip solo album is Q-Tip - few in the history of the genre can equal the man's understanding and all-around aptitude. Also, unlike the majority of today's charting artists, Q-Tip can handle the weight of a full-length without stocking his productions full of guests, interludes and other distractions that work against the high level of cohesion his records are long known for.  Similar to his Tribe, who offered a more authentic hip-hop sound than the peers of their time, Q-Tip presents soulful, jazzy hip-hop in the face of the trends the genre is currently drowning in - namely cheap production, unfocused work and empty lyrics. That said, the composition of the album isn't as fluid or jazzy as the Tribe records - hardly a detriment to this very solid album. Production handled not on a souped-up computer but on the classic beat-based tool of the 90s, an MPC, The Renaissance comes off as a collection of organic loops, subtle live musicianship and dusty drums, just as many of the greatest hip-hop albums have since the beginning of the genre. Lots of piano, lots of sturdy bass lines and breaks; imagine what the often-too-clean Soulquarians' productions would've sounded like in, say, 1991 and you'll have an idea of the sound here. None of Tip's arrangements here are too complex or deep, rather, the production focuses on clarity and soul, resulting in a sound that will likely remain just as timeless sounding as The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders - a longtime focus, clearly, for the artist.  It must be said: damn if that classic voice and delivery doesn't manage to sound just as good as it did 15 years ago. That it's still so strong and consistent is a surprise, given the break in output. Lyrically Tip often plays the role of Elder Statesman, though never in a preachy or pompous manner. His writing still doesn't demand any level of academic study or interpreting; everything here comes off as mostly obvious, but in a way that has always worked for the artist. While most of the big-name hooks (most notably the ones sung by D'Angelo and Norah Jones) work well enough, as a whole the blatant R&B element (most notably Raphael Saadiq's lackluster contribution) feels a bit forced and gawky. Q-Tip himself can sing just fine and, more than maybe any rapper ever, Q-Tip himself can supply a memorable hook - as proven on the tracks not featuring other artists. As proven on countless Tribe tracks.  Opener "Johnny is Dead" kicks things off in an upbeat, fleshed-out manner before "Won't Trade" kicks in. Over a simple start/stop beat Q-Tip shows off his influential lyrical lucidity, offering some of his best verses since 1996's Beats, Rhymes and Life. "Getting' Up," a radio hit in-the-waiting, follows, offering a display of the artist's fully developed understanding of his genre - coming off almost as a perfect model for boom-bap song craft. Really, every song here is worth getting to know. The stellar J. Dilla produced "Move" ends quickly before segueing into a mid-album hidden track (huh?) that functions as the album's title - and maybe best - offering. Okay, I'll say it: this song - as well as "Shaka," the slow-building "Dance on Glass" and "Official" - sounds like classic A Tribe Called Quest. It's true, and it's an amazing thing to hear after all these years away from that sound.  The Renaissance may not be the best hip-hop album of 2008 but it's certainly the most needed. Hell, it's probably the best, too. All the young whippersnappers out there still have much to learn from this man and his art. Now if Tip could just get the critically acclaimed (though never released) Kamaal the Abstract, his intended label-shelved follow-up to Amplified, out for the jazzy hip-hop world to learn and love. (Greg Locke)	1
Thats right, if Q-Tip hasn't tried so hard to keep himself relevant we would have no idea what he would be doing in 2008. After jumping from many labels (ATCQ was on Jive, his solo&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amplified/dp/B00002R0K9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amplified</a>&nbsp;along with the one that sat on the shelf (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kamaal-The-Abstract-The-unreleased-album/dp/B00005OAE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kamaal / The Abstract (The unreleased album)</a>) was on Profile/Arista), he finally lands a deal with Universal and finally comes out with his second solo, his first in almost a decade. Now Q-Tip has kept up quality work, but don't expect this to be a replica of any Tribe albums. Q-Tip's music has a slick vibe that one can just nod and relax to. The beats on here are dope as well.  Standout tracks are not hard to find, if one doesn't get lost in the vibe. "We Fight, We Love" with Raphael Saadiq is a nice standout. "Official" is a track that vibes nicely and will make your head nod up and down softly. Further down the album is "Life Is Better" with singer Norah Jones that I enjoyed truly. "Believe" is great with the help of (AWOL) singer D'Angelo. the final track "Shaka" is a dedication to his brother Shaka, J-Dilla, and his father. An introspective track that I've had to hit the repeat button a few times.  We finally get an album from Q-Tip. The whole album vibes great, and Q-Tip seems like he hasn't missed a step despite some setbacks. I'm glad that he hasn't given up and was very persistent during situations like this. For some this will be a breath of fresh air with whats playing nowadays. I highly recommend this album. Peace.  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: A+  Top 5 Tracks: 1.

I have always enjoyed the music that Qtip and TCQ made. Electric relaxation is one of my favorite hip hop songs. The renaissance has a mature jazzy flow that almost anyone can enjoy and it is not vulgar and trashy like alot of the stuff that's coming out today. I would have given it 5 statrs but in my opinion the  release is too short. I would have love to see at least 15 -17 songs on here. This better get an award for the year and put the garbage that artists like little Wayne releases to rest.	1
All you want to be hip hop super stars should take note, Q-Tip rhymes like a rapper.  His lyrical content is so potent, words w/dual connotations is the recipe for this installment.  He is truly over the top on this one and it is a shame that he won't get the accalades he should just because the hip-hop community is stuck on stupid and refuses to recognize the true purpose of this musical genre.  But Tip makes it clear that he won't be denied his opportunity to speak the truth and he does it quite well over banging beats and old school tracks that have been in our community for decades. This is real hip-hop, Tip has written a Blueprint for all those who are earnest students of this musical form to follow.  The Tribe Lives On!	1
Ok, there have been a few lengthy epistles on this album here on Amazon, including Amazon's review/description, so I'll try and keep my review brief.  I loved "Breathe and stop" from Q-Tip's debut CD some 9 years ago, as well as his rap on Janet Jackson's groovy "Got til it's gone". I didn't realise he had a new CD coming out till it was recommended to me by Amazon, and also when I read my buddy Kayode Balogun's slamming review of it, I just knew I had to get it.  It's already my top Hip Hop album of the year, it towers above every other release. I love the laid back earthy sound; real sounding percussion, horns, the Neo Soul/Jazzy vibe, and absolutely no profanities - excellent!  My favourites include the choppy groove "WeFight / WeLove" with Neo Soul king Raphael Saadiq (telling a soldier's story of love and war), "ManWomanBoogie" with Amanda Diva (with funky guitar and an unbelievably groovy bassline), the shimmery Erykah Badu-channelling "Life is better" with Jazz chanteuse Norah Jones which is basically a languid groove with more singing that rapping (not such an odd pairing seeing as she's appeared on albums by Outkast and Wyclef Jean), and the self assertive "Believe" on which he managed to drag out the AWOL D'Angelo to provide a killer hook. Fantastic!!  This is one of those CDs where every song stands out really. Opening is the piano driven Jazzy "Johnny is dead", followed by the Seventies sounding "Won't trade" (with a rather emphatic rap), "Getting up" (which samples a Black Ivory single from the 70s), the scratch-filled Jazzy "Official", the half spoken/sung "You", the J Dilla produced "Move" (which is two movements; a more upbeat segment with Gaye-like harmonies, and a laid back two minute coda with electronic Jazzy flourishes), "Dance on glass" (which starts off a capella with spare instrumentation built in as the song progresses), and closing Neo Soul joint "Shaka", also produced by Dilla.  The last Hip Hop album I enjoyed this much was Mos Def's "Black on Both Sides". A masterpiece!!!	1
5 Stars really, C'mon? I had to find out for myself is this album was really worth 5 stars and Yes, it's true the album REALLY is 5 star worthy. The Renaissance represents everything we expect from a Hip-Hop album without being commerical. Unique, clever rhymes and simple head bobbin' rhythms. There's no serious material to digest, no thuggish ego, and no sexual deviant bragging about how skilled they are. (Hence the fact that there's No "Explict Material" label either) Just lots of great material to listen, have fun to and enjoy.	1
No doubt about it. I haven't had this much fun with a hip-hop album since Little Brother's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Minstrel-Show/dp/B000A9QKCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Minstrel Show</a>. I have to admit I haven't listened properly to a lot of the stuff that's out there at the minute but if this doesn't win some kind of award for hip-hop album of the year somewhere, then all hope is truly lost.  Mostly produced by the man himself (except for "Move", which is produced by the late, great J Dilla) this is precisely the kind of thing I'm looking for when I buy a hip-hop album. I don't claim to be a connoisseur but the with the use of a couple of cleverly used samples here and there, music's tight, the beats are tight and Tip is at his lyrical best. He drew criticism for his last album&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amplified/dp/B00002R0K9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amplified</a>&nbsp;and while I remember dancing to "Breathe And Stop" and "Vivrant Thing" until I thought my legs were gonna fall off, I can see what people were saying. It was definitely more radio-friendly and more pop-oriented that we ever remembered ATCQ being in their heyday.  No such concerns here. Guests like Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo and Amanda Diva pretty much deliver what one might expect of them but Norah Jones sounds like I've never heard her sound before and never thought I would. Good on her and wise choice, Mr Q-Tip.  If you like your hip-hop authentic and are looking for an album that's solid from start to end, you most definitely need to check this one out. You'll be bouncing and bobbing all the way through. "Joyfully motivational" was how my local newspaper described the album and I couldn't agree more.  And the most remarkable thing of all? No profanity. Hence the lack of a parental advisory sticker. My buddy Derek might love this.	1
Q-tip definitely shines on this album. Hip hop mixed with slight tinges of other genres definitely work well with the abstract style of Q-Tip. I was kind of scared about this release because in my opinion the other solo releases by him were more on the weak side. BUt with a good solid listen to this album, I was impressed. A classic 5 star album? NO. But definitely better that the commercial crap that gets played on a regular basis. The only guest appearances are R and B artists. I didn't go for the 5 star rating like almost everyone here due to there are songs like MANWOMANBOOGIE that i skip on a regular basis. The song doesn't suck, it just doesn't fit my taste. All in all this a god album and will be a great addition to your collection.	1
... it was good ol' Q-Tip who saved Hip-Hop in 2008. Please support one of the last real lyricists in modern Hip Hop. No commercial tracks can be found, only great story telling over dope beats. Cool to listen to in addition to ATCQ classics such as "Low End Theory", "Midnight Marauders" and "Rhymes&Life". Best tracks are "Gettin Up", "We Love/We Hate", "You" and "Believe". Q-Tip's THE man!	1
boy o boy o boy o boy! q tip really brought it on this one! it feels just like a tribe cd on every song the only thing he did wrong was not putting phife on the cd but i cant lie he held it down on the whole cd himself! classic hip hop right here. beats, rhymes everything on this cd is off the hook!! people go buy this mf! let the real hip hop artist survive! don't bootleg good hip hop if we do it will not survive!	1
You have to love Tribe/Q-Tip fans.  While I respect their opinions and appreciate their vigorous support of Tip, I have to tell the folks looking for objective opinions that some of these reviews are way over the top -- and this is coming from a 32 year old Tribe fanatic.  All that being said, there is still an abundance of dopeness to be found throughout the album.  "Gettin' Up" is a feel good piece that Tip issued as one of his first singles for the album -- and deservedly so.  The J-Dilla produced "Move" is another (internet?) single that's quite funky.  I found it hard not to nod while that track was playin'.  There are a bunch more --  like "Dance On Glass", "Believe", or "We Fight/We Love", for example -- that make this album more than worthy of your dollars.  There will be very, very little disappointment should you decide to cop this album.  There are no tracks on the album that I would label as wack, but there is some forgettable material to be found.  Like, even though I do dig "Won't Trade", I skip it more often than not.  I would put "Official" in the same category.  Again, there's nothing technically wrong with these songs, and they are good, they just didn't hit in the chest like Tip's music usually does...if that makes any sense.  lol  Really, though, those are the only two joints I would label as skip material.  The rest is very nicely put together.  The Renaissance is LP worthy of (most of) the praise it receives.  A lot of these reviews are a little over the top -- classic talk is a bit premature and undeserved as of yet, and you have to give Tribe fans credit for being fiercely loyal, but, come on...  The production is dope and Tip is still capable of putting together a rock solid LP; which ain't half bad bad for a 38 year old has been (according to todays fickle standards).  Youngsters should take note, though they probably won't.  Chances are, though, that if you're looking into this album, you already know the man's pedigree.  Let me tell ya, he comes through this time around.  I recommend adding this one to your music library.  Standout Tracks: Believe feat. D'Angelo, We Fight/We Love feat. Raphael Saadiq, Shaka (My Favorite), Move, Gettin' Up, Dance On Glass, Johnny Is Dead, & Life Is Better feat. Norah Jones	1
Really like this song and the lyrics.  All of the songs by Jason Gray are good.	1
Amazing adaptation of scripture to a very inspiring and uplifting song!  Jason Gray is among my favorite contemporary Christian artists!	1
I love this beautiful and encouraging song! These are words that I needed to hear and that I need to continue to hear in the midst of life's storms and trying to hold strong to my faith. Thank you Jason Gray for sharing this precious song with us!	1
Great song by Jason Gray.  Love it.  Downloads easily at Amazon.	1
Beautiful song that reminds us that God will provide	1
The carefree tune of the song goes with the lyrics. Helps put anxiety in perspective.	1
Love it	1
GREAT SONG BY A ROCK LEGEND :)	1
This piece was on John Lennon's last album, and I have always gathered it was his way of telling people that he was content.  I love the lyrics and the melody, and think it's just a really good song...on a really good album "Double Fantasy."	1
It was a gift for a friend.	1
One of his best!	1
One of my favorite John Lennon songs.	1
I really like this song. It's one I had forgotten about, but was happy to hear again.	1
One of the few Lennon songs I like	1
Warning, bias opinion...I like this guy's voice. He could sing nursery rhymes w a throat infection and it'd still sound better than most people. Have  previous release got this one, happy w music!	1
Thank you Dierks.....great cd	1
GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE. VERY FAST SHIPPING.	1
another awesome album by dierks bentley love it	1
I liked the CD well enough. I didn't think it was as good as Riser. Several good tracks on it. Dierks as usual has his fun loving songs but also his more personal songs that are serious.	1
Another CD by Dierks in that he sings pretty well. It has his current hits.	1
I love the song he sings with Ella	1
Seen Dierks Bentley, Tucker Beathard, Cam, Randy Houser in concert and love the music.	1
Great CD	1
not up to his previous albums	1
Lovin this new album.  Of course it is a different speed than his previous albums but it is good.  I do prefer the other styles of songs and this new "drinking pop country" that all the singers are performing is not my favorite but its a good album overall.	1
Great CD Love Dierks Bentley	1
Very good	1
One of Dierks' best albums yet. Lots of uptempo songs as well as wonderful ballads.  A couple "Drunk On a Plane"-like bops as well.  A well-rounded, enjoyable CD from one of my favorite country artists.	1
I really like this album and songs such as "Black", "Somewhere on a Beach", "I'll be the moon" and many others and might be his greatest album yet.	1
i have been a fan of  Dierks Bentley's music from the first CD. He has such a clear,  .smooth, warm voice.  I will never tire  of " Riser" he really made a turning  point with that CD, He reached a maturity and put out  his great masterpiece. This new CD is great and what i expect from him. When i first heard "Somewhere on a Beach" i thought "please why do this?" "Drunk on a  Plane" was a fun song but no need to do a sequel.  He always puts out music that i  can tell comes from his heart whether it be a fun song or  his great ballads which i especially love.  I like this CD  it is  another example of a artist who brings something different  with each release	1
Don't buy them if I don't like them.	1
Love it	1
Really like this song....says a lot for us who have had broken hearts. Finally someone got the idea to put into words that understands what it's like	1
Love this song	1
Great song!	1
Love, love love this song	1
yes	1
Great duet!	1
Brilliant album addresses social issues in positive light.	1
Very nice song.	1
This piece moves me to tears. What genius! Yo-Yo Ma is amazing. I like the vocal version too, but this is the one I get lost in. It soothes and lingers long after it's finished. I listen to it often. My download ends abruptly, as if a bit is cut off, but I still recommend it.	1
A haunting, elegant, and emotional work that moves me to tears. Nella Fantasia is a beautiful derivative, but this is the masterwork. Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone have created a classic that should last forever.	1
This is a beautiful piece of classical music. YoYo Ma's does a beautiful job of playing the piece on his cello. I would have given it five stars, but Amazon's MP3 file is truncated near the end. I have downloaded the file more than once and both copies were truncated. Not having ever heard this piece before, I can't say whether this abrupt ending is intentional or not. If any one else is familiar with this piece let me know and I will correct this review.  As a side note, Amazon does not make it very easy to report a defective MP3 download. In the case of this tune I believe the copy on their server is defective. I have submitted a complaint to their help desk. We shall see what happens. I have asked Amazon to either offer a corrected full version, or refund my 99 cents.	-1
Yo-Yo knows how to blend his brilliance but not eclipse those he accompanies like few others. Take a listen and you'll understand.	1
A new and exciting sound for Jackie Evancho.  The next step in the evolution of her career as she strides into the Pop genre.  More emotional than her previous endeavors as she projects the emotions of the song to the listener and reminds us of the trauma of lost love.  Her unparalleled ability to captivate us with her pure gentle voice has developed to include more perceptive aggressive tones that enhance the emotions she feels.  A new direction for Jackie.  This is a must buy for everyone waiting for Jackie to demonstrate her diverse ability to sing Pop music in addition to her classical crossover standards.  Although she is new to this genre, she makes you believe she has always sung this style.  Buy it and enjoy every second of it!	1
Great job on her first original Pop song.	1
This isn't just a Pop Ballad.  This is an emotive experience only Jackie Evancho can bring to a song. The incomparable voice and the nuance she brings in this unique yet common message for her age also reminds us of our own Apocalypse experiences. Buy this. Buy a gift copy for your family and friends.	1
World's greatest female singer... like no other	1
Another terrible pop song by Jackie. Of course if you enjoy watching a 16 year old fight with her video boyfriend this is for you.	-1
wow11 Jackie is GREAT ~~~~~~	1
I am absolutely in LOVE with this song and her voice! Her voice is breathtaking in so many ways! Love this song and I hope that she puts out more songs like this!	1
Jackie's newest Pop original song. A wonderful piece as only Jackie can sing it.	1
A tremendously moving and beautiful song that Jackie delivers with her gorgeous voice, this time alternating sublimely between her peerless classic voice and her newly revealed pop voice. The combination of an unusually touching melody and Jackie's best-in-the-world voice might make your skin tingle during the refrain, which happens to me every time I hear it. Also, everyone can relate to the powerful lyrics, and the companion YouTube video showcases Jackie's superb acting skills. Congratulations, Jackie - another complete triumph!	1
Glad to see her finally go a little mainstream. She is getting older and it is good to see such a successful effort.  Her voice is getting more  mature, and this is an excellent production.	1
Heres something weve all been waiting for! All X billion of us! And now that we have it, it gives us all the opportunity to talk about our disappointment in it, for isn't that what we all do now? But Im not going to do that. (At least not right now.) I am just going to talk about how much there is to enjoy about this set, and why I purchased it, despite owning 95% of it already in original, as well as archive editions. And the reason is that its Paul McCartney. Pure and simple. What follows is a bit of a lengthy essay to put this release from this artist who straddles the centuries  into context. Please click on "read more" to read the complete review! But the bottom line is: If you're a fan, strongly consider it. If you're a casual listener, don't hesitate. Eight bucks a disc for 16 songs on each disc in the best sound currently available? I call that a deal. Even without the dirty flowers" that are scheduled for release later this year.  Several years ago, there was a well-meaning but ultimately pointless release entitled The Art Of McCartney. That two-disc set was a collection of McCartney songs performed as xerox copies of the obvious choices by an eclectic group of artists. The results ranged from good to embarrassing. It left most listeners with one question in their heads. Why?.  This collection seems to be McCartneys response, and a way to make amends. How does one create a collection - even a 4 disc set - that satisfies the needs of a legion of fans all over the globe who have nurtured, followed, left, returned, gotten older with, and introduced new generations to the music of the cleverest, most prolific - and at times most frustrating banal - composer of culture shifting popular songs? A pop composer whose skill and popularity is rivaled only by Irving Berlin in the 20th century? The answer is, you cant.  Despite the stated intentions of the corporate-McCartney-spin-machine in putting together a collection of my recordings with nothing else in mind other than having something fun to listen to. Maybe to be enjoyed on a long car journey or an evening at home, or at a party with friends this remains a pretty random overview of McCartneys post-Beatles work. Its guaranteed to meet the needs of folks who haven't bought a disc since Band On The Run, just as its guaranteed to frustrate those who have followed Macca through New. Thats Paul McCartney. Havent you learned that by now? So jump in your hot rod or relax in your hot bath and give these ditties a spin..???  (insert groan/grimace).  So what is Pure McCartney? Its simply a superb collection of pop tunes that sound really great - and in the case of some of them, have never sounded better. Get the discs, add some tunes, delete some tunes, re-order the tunes - whatever. This collection is guaranteed to put a song in your heart, taps on your toes, and a smile on your face (even if its not your brave one.) Even you are not one of the legions of rabid Paul fans who have each release, you will be delighted anew by Jet, Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Say, Say, Say, and My Love. And you will undoubtably enjoy making your acquaintanceship with Jenny Wren, New, Dance Tonight, and Sing The Changes (wonderful, brave choice that) and others. Special appreciation for the inclusion of Only Mama Knows and Queenie Pie, two truly great songs - if you're unfamiliar with them, you're in for a treat.  That said, lets get the obvious omissions out of the way. First, as I noted in discussion thread on this page, there are no songs from Flowers In The Dirt, one of the strongest albums of McCartneys solo career. The reason is simple: Pure McCartney is a set-up for its release in the Archive series. This way, it is assured that we will all dutifully purchase it to add to our playlists. Paul McCartney is not merely the greatest composer of the past 100 years, he is also a masterful self-promoter, with Donald Trump and J.K. Rowling running a close second and third.  I say that with absolutely no disrespect to Macca given the successful span of his career. But you really will need to get Flowers In The Dirt  when its released later this year.  In terms of omissions, be thankful that we're not subjected to C Moon (It will be L-7/and Ill never get to heaven/if I fill my head with gloom). Or, Mary Had A Little Lamb. Or Temporary Secreta....or yea. Thats here. Oh well. And in fairness, TS has picked up its fair share of fans recently. Second - and less understandable - are some other omissions. Where is So Bad, arguably one of the greatest pop songs of the 1980s. Or Run Devil Run, where McCartney Little RIchards" his vocal cords in a style not heard since 1965 - proving that he still can. Or at least still could at that point in time. Or the Academy-award nominated (and light weight) Vanilla Sky? Or the perfectly charming Little Lamb Dragonfly from Red Rose Speedway? Better yet - where is the blistering Souvenir from Flaming Pie? Ill stop there. You can add you're own 2 cents. Im sure you all will ;)''Third - Given what was omitted omissions, how on earth did McCartney and his crack team include the atrocious Bip Bop? Or the overly sentimental and treacly Warm And Beautiful ? (Sunlight's morning glory/tells the story/of our love  Moonlight on the water/brings me inspiration/ever after ) Maybe thats the one to listen to in your hot tub.  And alright, all right -  I concede that Temporary Secretary seems to have developed an almost cult-like following that has lead to its inclusion on the current tour - but Winedark Open Sea? Or the creaky, rhetorical Early Days (contradicted by the 3 remaining Beatles themselves in the Anthology DVD set)? Or the dreadfully dated disco ditty Goodnight Tonight? (GT divides fans, much in the same way as Silly Love Songs does, though I love the catchiness of the latter. And SLS is a perfect distillation of McCartneys songwriting philosophy and craft).  I would only add one other point (as Im sure others will pipe in with their piece). Maybe Im Amazed, one of the greatest songs in the McCartney canon was a really, really poor selection as the opening track. (Why start the film with the money shot?) My choice would have been Dance Tonight. With it thump-thump-thump opening, its joyous mandolin, and its message (Everybody gonna stamp their feet/Everybody's gonna feel the beat/Everybody gonna dance around tonight) it would have invited everyone in to have a great time.  And minor gripes aside, thats really what youll have if you get this collection. I pity the naysayers who will be unable to experience the joy of McCartneys music due to either what was included, or what was omitted from this set. Ive defended Paul McCartney quite a bit in the 70s and 80s. That isn't necessary now that hes gotten older, wiser, and more - um, shall we say - clear headed. He was awarded The Gershwin Prize! A Grammy Lifetime Achievement award winner! Hes a MusiCares award winner!  He has had a 46 year career AFTER The Beatles. He survived the loss of the deeply profound love of his life and the subsequent marriage to the bane of his existence. His internal flame of optimism lead him to the spiritual renewal of his marriage to his valentine, Nancy. And throughout all of these ups and downs, he has kept a smile on his face and has provided us with songs that have provided the joyous soundtrack to our own lives. ''And by doing this, Id argue that McCartney has brought more joy and happiness to more people on this planet than any other person. (My God - hes played for both Gorbachev and Putin counting them among his fans (''I had some Russians come up to me and say: 'You say yes; I say no. Hello, goodbye. I am real nowhere man.' '')  Whats the point in complaining about whats wrong in this collection? There is nothing wrong with it. Its just that McCartneys music is so omnipresent -  so inscribed in our consciousness, so deeply personalized - that we all have our opinions about it. Nonetheless, McCartneys preternatural gift for melody and song has, in some way, been a gift to each and every one of us. And our lives are better for his presence.  So, thanks.  To a person Ive never really met (there was that one time seeing him and Nancy  on line for popcorn in a movie theater in  NYC) yet have been on a first-name basis with for 52 years. Godspeed Sir Paul. And again - thank you.  Listen to this collection with appreciation and gratefulness. If you can do that, Pure McCartney is pure gold.'''''	1
100%	1
Pure McCartney? Yep! Every song!  Hours of enjoyment.	1
Great	1
Thanks!	1
Finally!!  A proper multi-disc boxed set by the other main songwriter in The Beatles!  It's about time ...  While John and George have had their own boxed sets released in the past (and good ones, too!!) and Ringo has released a 3-disc "Anthology" of himself with his All-Starr Band project(s), Sir Paul was the only one left to compile his massive amount of recordings into a nice collection of exactly what this boxed set holds within it!  You will NOT be bored with any filler or whatever from start to finish.  It's Paul Bloody McCartney, fer crissakes!!!  How can you possibly go wrong with a talent of this magnitude?	1
I think this is a great set. It contains a lot of my favorite McCartney tracks, and it also includes many that I didn't have before I got it. Paul has been the most prolific ex-Beatle by far --- of course, two of the Fab Four are sadly no longer among us --- and has put out tons of stuff over the past several decades, so even a set this size  inevitably isn't going to please everybody, as a lot of people are bound to have too many favorite tracks that weren't included (and to dislike too many of the tracks that are here). As far as I'm concerned, this is the best McCartney comp to be put out so far. The CDs come packaged inside a book containing an opening "note" from Paul --- though no notes on Paul's musical history or any stories behind the songs --- as well as track credits (the names of the people who played, produced, etc.) and a lot of photos of Paul. The photos are cool (although they aren't in color), but I find it a bit odd that, despite the fact that the set spans Paul's entire career, none of the photos include any members of his group Wings --- in fact, that group name is never  mentioned anywhere, except on Paul's shirt in one of the photos. Not even Linda is pictured anywhere. Of course, though, the photos have absolutely naught to do with the music, which is what really matters! Like I said, this set won't please everybody, but I think it's terrific, especially since it isn't super-expensive!	1
Completely satisfied.	1
Terrific seller! Fast shipping! Great merchandise! Highly recommend!	1
The best McCartney has!  PERFECTION!	1
A decent 4 cd set of Paul's music, including hit songs and deep cuts. I would have picked a few different tracks, had I been the one to compile this. Maybe I'm amazed that Paul actually included 2 songs from "Red Rose Speedway". It seems that he doesn't want to remember it. Notice that there isn't a McCartney Archives edition of RRS (yet?). I'd have tossed in a few hard to find things like "The Mess" and the two versions of "Give Ireland Back To The Irish". "Wild Life" is almost completely ignored, and doesn't the recording of "Bip Bop" sound like a mono mix? Still, this isn't a bad batch of tunes from Paul. Someone let me compile the next McCartney compilation.	1
Great sound quality and if you are a McCartney fan or the Beatles this is a good purchase.  If you have this set it really covers his solo career.  Not all of the songs by any stretch, but a very nice sample of his music.  I really like McCartney, so I may be a bit prejudice, but when I bought it the price was really good and it was a no brain'er for me.	1
If you're an old Paul McCartney fan or a relatively new one you'll enjoy this great collection!	1
Wow!!  Every hit going back to the 1970's . I forgot he did a lot of these songs. It was like time traveling, listening to this. I recommend it.	1
Love it	1
excellent and fantastic	1
Where is Helen Wheels? I mean really? How is that song omitted compared to some of this filler. That being said the sound quality is amazing and overall a great album. I listened to it , but didn't buy it. Compilations nowadays are a waste of money. As much as I love Paul and The Beatles I'm not getting hosed anymore. I will only buy remixes or complete remasters.	1
This past year so far, 2016 we've have lost a lot of legends that really did know the strength of making great music with the losses of David Bowie and Prince. But also, we've seen a few legends really come back into the music industry after leaving the industry for personal matters. With Phil Collins coming back after retiring and re-releasing his catalog, many fans have really rediscovered his brilliance and talent as a musician, and a noble solo songwriter. But that has also been said to with the great Paul McCartney in his own legacy, with him re-releasing his solo collection of songs and what he did with Wings and other projects on his own, the legendary Beatle has really shown a lot of joy with people revisiting his solo work. But unfortunately, it is also a year of deviating sadness for Paul, with the heartbreaking death of legendary Beatles producer Sir George Martin, whom guided him with the fab four, and his solo efforts abroad. Paul has had some sadness, but with him releasing a career-spanning box set of his works, after The Beatles, and a new tour on the horizon for Sir Paul's brilliance, his solo work in tact just as strong as The Beatles and even broader alive and well. But for his work, the question is, Is Paul McCartney still relevant and strong? Yes he is.  Pure McCartney is a career-spanning collection of Paul McCartney's solo hits. There are two collections of this album, deluxe and regular, but this will focus on the 4 disc deluxe collection. The collection of his solo works is a strong ans distinctive reflection of McCartney's work with Wings and and his solo work that does display how brilliant Paul's gifts in song have been strong and show a nobly deep reflection of his great solo career, over 45 years of the making strong. The songs have all been remastered well, and show a lot of Paul's genius well from classic tracks like Maybe I'm Amazed, Let 'Em In with Wings, as well as newer hits for Paul that have been not as strongly recognized like New, No More Lonely Nights, Dance Tonight from Memory Almost Full and Sing The Changes from 2008's work The Fireman. The collection does highlight Paul's own work well, but the collection does have a few setbacks in play. First, Pure McCartney does overlook a few of Paul's biggest hits from his career and standout songs that Paul are richly distinctive like The Girl Is Mine with Michael Jackson, Ever Present Past, the theme song Paul did for the movie Spies Like Us, Freedom which Paul composed from Driving Rain in regards to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks and a few other classics. Not only that, but second, the collection is not in chronological order, where it can be more confusing for new Paul McCartney fans, that are just getting into his music for the first time, not though for die hard fans of Paul's greatness.  Despite a few flaws, Pure McCartney is a very good buy for both die hard Paul McCartney fans, as well as newcomers that have never heard a song Paul McCartney had ever done before. this collection shows that Paul's legacy is still alive and well, and just as richly, widely celebrated as well as his work with The Beatles. It has been a legacy worth celebrating in every way from one of the world's distinctive and curious songwriters that is worth its money. I have always loved why Paul McCartney's classics are just as strong today, as they were back then in the 70's, 80's, and 90's, etc. I absolutely recommend this compilation a lot. We'll still say Maybe I'm Amazed, well we're amazed well with this album.  Album Cover: B+  Songs: B 1/2+  Price: A-  Remastered: A  Overall: B+	1
I'm a lifelong Beatles fan (like everyone else). I've always enjoyed McCartney's solo hits on the radio, but until I got this box set, I never realized just how consistently good his solo career has been, for 45+ years and counting. This box set is easily 5 stars, with the only notable omissions being "Helen Wheels," "Sally G," "Letting Go" and "Take It Away" (everyone will have a few nitpicks on every comp, and those are mine). But don't let that detract from what _is_ here. At 67 songs for less than $35, grab this while you can. The sound quality is excellent, drums and bass are crisp and clear.  The songs are the full-length album versions, which is nice. Compare the playing lengths of duplicated songs on "Wingspan" and the running times are longer here.  I listened to this box set all the way through, and rather than feeling like "that was too much McCartney," I felt like "darn, it's over already?"	1
Yes, even I, with my limited technological skills, can fairly easily make a mix CD/mp3...whatever.  I've got most of these songs on 4 to 5 different sources: single, LP, CD, remastered CD, Archive CD, etc. ad nauseum.  What happened to the original conception for a box set; i.e. to provide an historical, well rounded view of the artist with some rare/previously unreleased (legally) material thrown in to make it more enticing???  No use being longwinded.  There is nothing here to entice a longtime fan who has nearly everything the man has released.  So I draw the line.  I did not buy the last John Lennon remasters,  SHOULD NOT HAVE bought the Harrison Apple years (horrible remasters, only 2 decent LPs ATMP & LIAMW, both already beautifully remastered and reissued), and I will not buy this.  Put out something that I can justify adding to my collection.  I'm tired of buying what I already have.	-1
Paul McCartney is arguably, the most prolific singer/songwriter from the Beatles.  Unlike Wingspan which was a greatest hits collection, McCartney hand-picked these sixty-seven songs as some of his favorites.  Most people will argue that its missing many many great songs, which says a lot about the quality and quantity of his career.  I cannot imagine that anyone will not find a song that is omitted or wonder why another was included.  If viewed as a McCartneys favorites, this collection will inform the listener as to what their musical hero considers his most favorite works.  If anything, this collection provides a vast overview of a long career that is as varied as it is productive. The booklet contains some historic photos.	1
a great overview on one of Pop Music's most important artists ever. this is the first ever overall compliation of his works as a solo artist and it does him musical justice. for the casual fan this is  a great overview of a man who is a multi Instrumentalist, Producer, arranger,vocalist and by the way did I say One of the most Important Songwriters ever. now the important pieces of his solo career are here and they still sound on point. this makes a great gift for a Paul Mcccartney fan. or for someone just getting into his solo career with Wings and Beyond.	1
Probably would be impossible to put out a set that will satisfy everyone, the McCartney catalog is massive. That being said I really enjoyed taking a trip down memory lane. I must admit I tear up almost every time I hear "Here Today".  Overall a whole bunch of fun listening to this, mission accomplished Paul. Looking forward to the deluxe reissue of flowers in the dirt. In my top three favs of Paul's solo work.	1
I had to revise my review. This is a excellent collection. I heard all 4 disks and of course not everything is here if you want everything go get all his albums. This has the hits and deep tracks.	1
with all respect to sir paul and his team this collection could have been great if some this were not missing .the whole FLOWERS IN THE DIRT album is ignored probably because its the next cd to be remastered and rereleased but he included a lot of for lack of a better word FILLER here he skipped most of OFF THE GROUND except for on song this also is probably set for remaster soon.some of the discs run an hour or a little over he could have included GETTING CLOSER,and why the single version of WITH A LITTLE LUCK and VENUS and MARS /ROCK SHOW there is plenty of time for the full versions ,WE ALL STAND TOGETHER one of the worse songs ever. Paul how much money do you need to make i quote an old KINKS album GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT make a good solid collection that we all deserve.	1
Up until now, Paul McCartney has released five audio "best of" anthologies - 1978's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wings-Greatest/dp/B00000721P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wings Greatest</a>, 1987's ALL THE BEST!

A sixth anthology, the rare Japanese release&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Greatest/dp/B0000087OZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Greatest</a>, does go up to 1997, but even that is a little behind the times. In 2007, Paul issued a 3-DVD video retrospective,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-McCartney-Years/dp/B000VRJ37I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The McCartney Years</a>, which contained music videos and live performances from 1970 to 2005. That set filled the gap quite nicely for its time.  In the liner notes for PURE MCCARTNEY, Paul states that its purpose was to provide a broad-based collection of songs from throughout his career, which people could enjoy in their car, at home, at a party, or wherever they happened to be. More likely, it was Concord Music requesting a best-of set; the ones listed above were all issued on Capitol/EMI (except for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-McCartney-Years/dp/B000VRJ37I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The McCartney Years</a>, which was issued by Rhino Home Video/Warner Strategic Marketing). UPDATE: PURE MCCARTNEY will be Macca's last Concord Music release; in mid-August 2016, Paul - much like the Prodigal Son - returned to his original label (not counting early U.S. Beatle releases on Vee-Jay, Swan, and Tollie), signing a worldwide multi-year deal with Capitol Records, now a Universal Music company.  The set does have a wide range, from 1970's "Maybe I'm Amazed" to 2014's non-LP track, "Hope For The Future," which makes its CD debut here (though the alternate mixes on the 12" single and digital download were not included). The 1984 British single "We All Stand Together" makes its U.S. commercial audio debut: a demo of the song appears on the 1997 Best Buy promo CD,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Oobu-Joobu-Widescreen-Radio-Ecology/dp/B0002IW8QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Oobu Joobu - Widescreen Radio - Ecology</a>. The cartoon "Rupert And The Frog Song," for which "We All Stand Together" was written, appears on the 2004 DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Paul-McCartney-The-Music-And-Animation-Collection/dp/B00UGP9XKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Paul McCartney - The Music And Animation Collection</a>.  Most of Macca's hit singles appear here, along with many choice LP cuts. There are no live performances on the collection, and no instrumentals (which rules out the first two Fireman albums,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Strawberries-Oceans-Ships-Forest/dp/B013GVNICQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Strawberries, Oceans, Ships, Forest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rushes/dp/B019GQYV0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rushes</a>). There are also no cover versions on this set, which means there is nothing from either 1988/1991's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CHOBA-B-CCCP-Back-in-the-USSR/dp/B000002UZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CHOBA B CCCP (Back in the USSR)</a>&nbsp;or 1999's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Run-Devil-Run/dp/B004U8URF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Run Devil Run</a>, although there are a couple of McCartney originals on the latter, such as the title song and "Try Not To Cry," which could have been used on this set.  Other albums that Paul overlooked are 1989's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Flowers-In-The-Dirt/dp/B01ABBIBDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Flowers In The Dirt</a>, because that album is scheduled to be the next release in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection (Paul confirmed this in a July 10, 2016 Washington Post interview, where he stated that Nancy Jeffries, the set's compiler, did not select any FITD tracks for that reason), and 2001's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Driving-Rain/dp/B004U8URGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Driving Rain</a>, which suffers from mostly poor material, and may bring back bitter memories of Paul's failed marriage to The Golddigger (Heather Mills). No classical (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/McCartney-Liverpool-Oratorio/dp/B000002RSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">McCartney: Liverpool Oratorio</a>) or experimental (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Liverpool-Sound-Collage/dp/B00004WMZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Liverpool Sound Collage</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Twin-Freaks/dp/B0009R1D4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Twin Freaks</a>) material is included either.  I would have chosen "Some People Never Know," rather than the silly "Bip Bop," as the selection from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wings-Wild-Life/dp/B000005RPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wings Wild Life</a>; the 12" disco version of "Goodnight Tonight," instead of the standard single version; the complete version of "With A Little Luck," instead of the DJ edit; a few more tracks from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tug-Of-War/dp/B0131KAIS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tug Of War</a>, particularly "Ballroom Dancing" and "Take It Away"; both sides of the "Wonderful Christmastime/Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reggae" single; and a few more tracks from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Off-The-Ground/dp/B00EEPFQ88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Off The Ground</a>, such as "Hope Of Deliverance," "Get Out Of My Way," and "C'mon People." On the other hand, I'm delighted that the single edit of "Venus And Mars/Rock Show" was included; it appeared on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wingspan-Hits-History/dp/B00005BA03/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wingspan (Hits & History)</a>, but should have been a bonus track on the 2014&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Venus-And-Mars-Deluxe-Book/dp/B00M2OZMIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Venus And Mars (Deluxe Book)</a>&nbsp;reissue; unfortunately, it wasn't.  I'd still like to see Paul assemble a rarities/anthology collection of his non-LP tracks, alternate 7" and 12" mixes, CD-single only tracks, alternate takes, unreleased songs, and guest appearances on other people's albums.  Even with the bonus audio tracks on various CD album releases, Paul still has a lot of material that is only available on vinyl, out-of-print CD singles, or hard-to-find releases in distant markets, such as Japan.  There is also a less expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/2-CD-edition/dp/B01DN253HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">2-CD edition</a>&nbsp;available for the budget-minded. This 4-CD collection is in a nice hardcover book with plenty of archival photos. Not much text, though, except for Paul's intro, track listings, and production and publishing credits.  Because of the excellence and wide variety of the music, I'm still going to give PURE MCCARTNEY five stars, despite my mild criticisms.  And Happy 74th Birthday, Sir Paul! June 18, 2016 - "Will you still need me?/Will you still feed me?/When I'm SEVENTY-FOUR?" (I'm sure Miss Nancy [Shevell] will).	1
I first received information about this album via HDTracks It was very hard in the beginning to decide if I wanted to buy this via HDTracks or here on Amazon. HDTracks was offering the download at $58.98 @ 41.1/24 and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't offering it at 96/24 or 192/24. I also had the chance to buy it at HD at 20% off, but still that's expensive. So after thinking about it for hours, I decided since it's not 96/24, I bought the 4 CD here at Amazon and got the free RipIt and downloaded to my Fii0 X5. The mp3 sounds almost as good as the flac files I had downloaded of McCartney from HD. Then what was a real surprise today on Sunday I got an early delivery from USPS and was surprised that it came with a book. Man, this is an excellent buy. The quality sounds great, you get a nice book, and it's delivered on Sunday.... Very good deal....	1
"Pure McCartney" is a compilation put together by Paul himself, it's just solo material, so no Beatles stuff. If you have all of his albums, it's redundant, if not, this is a fun listen. Of course all of the big hits are here, but also a bunch of later album cuts. Nearly every album is represented (except for his 1989 "Flowers In The Dirt", which is too bad because it has some great stuff on it). What I like is that more well known songs are mixed in among the newer or otherwise lesser known tracks. Pretty much the only song I haven't liked is "My Love" which I've never liked. I have the live albums and the other Hits albums, I have a handful of the solo albums, but I think the last one I got was "Flaming Pie". So for me, this set is sort of an introduction to his more recent material. I've been playing this all day and it's done what Paul set out to do with it, it's just a fun playlist of various solo songs.  My only complaint is that nothing from "Flowers In The Dirt" is on this, the reason probably being that the Archive Collection edition comes out later this year. However if this "My Brave Face" or "Put It There" I'd give this five stars.	1
What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude...but COME ON PEOPLE...By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space...to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.	-1
a ok	1
good song.	1
I love Cole Swindell...one of my favorite artists ever! Great song!	1
Love it	1
I love Cole Swindell's music.  Its unique and refreshing and I usually dance around the house in the morning getting ready for work with his music blaring.  The words are fresh, uplifting and make me smile and sometimes I recall some important times in my life with laughter, love and a few tears (especially his song, "You Should Be Here").  I'm guessing Cole's probably a good friend and son in real life and I hope he continues to do well and be very successful.  You rock, Cole.  All the best, Kat.  P.S.  I'll be looking for more music in the future from Cole Swindell.	1
Awesome, awesome song	1
The download of this album worked great and didn't take long to download.	1

Just a good old boys having fun kinda song. I am not at all a Dierks Bentley fan. You will find not one of his songs in my vast music collection. So that should say something right there about the song! Had never heard of Cole Swindell. Saw it on CAM liked it and as they say the rest is history!	1
GOM representing the Kingdom, Lyricism, and Creativity! Sevin this a great1st GOM record!! I co-sign! I like this one ALMOST as much as I like his "I'll Wait" WORSHIP Album! That one is STILL my favorite, thus far!	1

Very good.	1
I had to reschedule some appointments just so i could finish listening to this....  maaaaann..  REAL.	1
I heard a lot about Sevin before I saw him...I heard he was very talented.  I sense something very authentic about his anointing... about his lyrics... about his gift. He's one of those artists, like Bizzle, like Dee-1, that command a presence, that creates intrigue.  His album is awesome, very transparent, authentic, potent, and in depth.  The awesome thing is all the things he suffered worked out in his favor. Thank you JESUS for bringing up an artist that is well needed to Hip Hop and to the Body of CHRIST.	1

Usually put this song on repeat, listen to it two or three times in a row, and do a slow, hip-swinging, dirty dance all by myself....	1
One of his best.	1

A great combination for a cross over.  I love this side of Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood asking him questions of his intentions make it a great song.	1
Wow...this actually grew on me. I remember not knowing who these two people were just two day's ago. I finally decided to read the reviews...I was surprise at first, then I decided to download it. It was not bumping on my first an second listen. I remember cutting off that last song "London Bridge" {it was terrible at first}...I was done with this E.P an was ready to play Musiq "Life on Earth" l.p...I'm glad I gave this another chance because every song grew on me...Tracc 8 included. I do remember there 9 minute long vid on wshh...it was good.	1
Twenty88 is a collaboration project that I've never expected, and honestly it is a project I never wanted but after listening to this album a couple of times, I am thoroughly convinced this album is good, maybe even really good. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko as solo acts can be a hit or miss for me. Big Sean's ability as an MC have always been underwhelming to say the least and Jhene Aiko's vocal range have been always limited. But I must say, there is an amazing synergy between these 2 that I rarely seen between other duo acts. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko's chemistry on this album is an undeniable and I would be lying if I said they don't sound great together. The real star on this project however is the production. The sounds on this album can range from slow experimental one minute to soulful the next; needless to say the music itself deserves some much needed praise. There is a nice balance of new and old that R&B fans and alternative hip hop fans can appreciate.  All praises aside, this album has many flaws with the first have to be the songwriting. This album is an R&B album if anything else with the two of them exploring the different sides of love. It's sexual, intimate and passionate which is great, however I cannot stand some of the incredibly cliche lines that are on this album. These songs are very straightforward with little to no room for subtly which can be a problem at times. The second complaint I have is with Big Sean. Big Sean is known to be corny at times and very monotone which is still present on this album, but I can't help but feel that Big Sean was trying his absolute hardest to do his best Drake impression. There were far too many times where Big Sean sounded identical to Drake and I have to knock off points for that. Other than that, if I don't get another Twenty88 problem that would be fine with me. This album accomplishes what it needed to and it sounds great; I don't see a need for another one.  Favorite 5 1) Deja Vu 2) Talk Show 3) London Bridge 4) 2 Minute Warning feat. Detail and K-Ci & Jojo 5) Memories Faded	1
Money well spent.	1
If you had the chance to listen to Big Sean's Dark Sky Paradise and liked the songs he did with Jhene Aiko on there, you'll dig this. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko are already pretty great on their own, but together they kill it. I hope there's more to come from them because this EP is great.	1
great collab!	1
It grew on me, the first time I heard it, I felt like it was a step back from Jhene's prior work, but after giving it a second listen I really enjoyed it!	1
OMGoodness..... What an amazing song.... Who is that Taylor Swift person???  I thought that Fight Song and Rise were powerful songs until this song came out. The other songs made you want to get up and keep fighting... Castle makes you want to destroy all that stands before you.	1
aaaaaaaaaaa	1
This is one of my favorite songs. especially when I play it with Lorde- Glory and Gore song. the two really compliment each other. This is definitely a bit of music I listen to when in the gym working out.	1
Love this song and Marian's unique voice.	1

I continued hearing this song (because of the commercial) and it kept playing in my head.  I had to hear the entire song and I was not disappointed.  In fact, she has several other songs that I got that are just as good if not better.	1
Great song.	1

Bob Dylan has long been known as a phenomenal songwriter, with varied opinions on how good of a singer he actually is. Numerous artists and bands have made huge names for themselves recording songs that Dylan wrote. The fun part here is that this is a cover album! So now it's Dylan singing other people's songs. It all feels very backwards. But it's his 37th studio album, so I guess he's earned the right to sit back and let other people do the songwriting for once.  The super ironic part is that he voice sounds better now than it ever did in his prime. This cover album works at times, and its just sort of there at other times. There's not really a bad track in the bunch. There are 2 songs I didn't love, but even those were okay. I think you have to go into this understanding that it's not a groundbreaking album that's going to change the world. (Bob Dylan has literally already done that. It's hard to pull a thing like that off twice). It's an old guy singing songs he personally loves because they mean something to him. Understanding that, I loved this album.   Young At Heart - Okay at first it's just weird to hear Bob Dylan signing lounge music. It feels very out of place at first. But as you listen, you hear Dylan really nails it. Since he is in his golden years this song works perfectly for him. It ends up being a great version of a classic song.   Maybe You'll Be There - Its' very soft and very mellow. It's very relaxing. This is one of those songs that just sort of there. It's nice, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it.   Polka Dots and Moonbeams - This is so peaceful and relaxing it's almost therapeutic. The music is awesome. Dylan's singing it awesome. This one literally just put me in a better mood.   All The Way - This song is all about loving someone to the fullest extent possible, because there's no point in holding back love. It's a GREAT song. That is such a wonderful message and a valuable lesson coming from an older person telling younger people a good way to grow old without having regrets that you didn't love hard enough. It's a beautiful song. It's got a slow rhythm and Dylan makes it sound like he's alone in a room signing only to you and the person you love....and that you should be slow dancing with each other while he sings.   Skylark - More soothing wonderfulness. I am not familiar with the original on this one. But I like Dylan's version.   Nevertheless - Again, Dylan makes you feel like he's signing this to you and only you. I don't know how he pulls that off but he does it on several tracks on this album and this is one of the better examples of it.   All Or Nothing At All - This was one of my least favorite tracks on the album, but it's still decent. Like everything else here it's quiet and soothing. It's just the song never did anything for me. But music is a personal preference sort of thing so it might be someone else's favorite track ever and they wouldn't be wrong.   On A Little Street In Singapore - This is a good story. Listen to the lyrics. It sounds great set to Dylan's raspy voice.   It Had To Be You - Best track of the album. Hands down. And I went into this album thinking I was going to hate this because I absolutely love this song. (The Harry Connick Jr version played at my wedding) I wasn't sure Dylan could do this one justice. But he absolutely owns it. It's a very slow version of this all time classic and it works in every possible way.   Melancholy Mood - Dylan has still got that raspy voice of the people sound, but it's more refined now. And his voice style is PERFECT for this song.   That Old Black Magic - This one is soft, but fast. It's soothing but peppy. I don't know how those things mix, but it's happening on this track. This is one of the most fun songs on the album and Dylan's voice does it well. You can almost hear him dancing while singing.   Come Rain or Come Shine - I didn't love this one. Again, it's not bad. It's just kind of 'there'. Nothing really comes together on this track. Dylan's voice doesn't work for the song. The music is almost too simple to be interesting. It's not a song I skipped at the end, but it wasn't super engaging me.	1
Bob Dylan.  Ya hate him or ya love him.  Not sure there is an "inbetween".  For some of you "doubters" you might want to start with some of his later recordings.  He has done some out of the Dylan realm type songs that may interest you.  Me?  HUGE FAN.  Always have been.  I have over 3/4 of his albums and still deciding what to get next.  A singer - songwriter who has an Academy Aware, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Nobel Peace prize, that made his roots grow in the tumultuous 60's ... probably has something you might relate to.  This is one of 3 albums that is a tribute to Frank Sinatra.	1
Better than Shadows in the night inmo. Really surprised that i love this album! My favorite out of the Three releases.	1
It's good	1
This is the second Bob Dylan album in a row where he sings pop standards.  It's a very good album.  Some people don't like Dylan's voice, but they just don't get it.	1
I saw "Sing Street" in the theater this past weekend (more on that later). As is the case in a John Carney movie, "Sing Street" also oozes music from start to finish, and I couldn't wait to check out the soundtrack after having seen the movie. My search led me to this, which combines both the original songs (performed by the movie's fictional band Sing Street), as well as a bunch of the other classic 80s songs that we hear throughout the movie.  "Sing Street - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" (17 tracks; 57 min.) is an equal opportunity provider for both the original songs and the 80s classics. We get 8 of each (the soundtrack starts off with a very short snippet of the movie's dialogue). Let's take a closer look at those original songs, all written by John Carney and/or Gary Clark, and performed by studio session players (including, yes, Glen Hansard, the star of "Once"). If you wonder what a "Futurist Band" might sound like, it sounds remarkably like Duran Duran-meets-Franz Ferdinand. Check out the first song (and one of the movie's key scenes) "The Riddle of the Mode", with its irresistible melody and instrumentation. It is clearly the best of the 8 original songs, and should be a hit on mainstream commercial radio (if that was any good, which of course it isn't). The other must-have original song is "Drive It Like You Stole It", with a clear Hall & Oates influence, and sounding oh so good. Of the others, I also like "Girls", short and sweet, as well as "To Find You", the only slow song of these 8 originals (and playing towards the end of the movie, not midway as it is sequenced here). As to the 80s classics, there isn't a single weak one here (save, perhaps. Motorhead's "Stay Clean"). Duran Duran's "Rio" plays prominently in the movie (including the song's video), as does Hall & Oates' "Maneater" and M's "Pop Music". Maroon 5's Adam Levine's new song "Go Now" (not a cover of the Moody Blues' song of the same name) plays in the movie's concluding scene and over the end titles. The other songs included here such as The Jam's outstanding "Town Called Malice" only plays a few seconds in the movie (even though it played prominently in the trailer). Inexcusably missing from this soundtrack is Flash & the Pan's "Walking In the Rain", which plays prominently in the movie. How is this not on here? The last 2 tracks on the digital release are bonus tracks of some sort: I don't recall hearing The Score's "Up" in the movie, and then there is an unnecessary repeat (and note-for-note) rendering of "Drive It Like You Stole It" by Hudson Thames (who?).  As to the movie itself, it is the spiritual prequel to "Once", and a delight from start to finish. I found myself with a smile on my face pretty much the entire movie, and love its sheer exuberance. Ah, to be young! If you liked Carney's "Once" and "Begin Again", you will love "Sing Street", I guarantee it. "Sing Street", both the soundtrack and the movie, is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	1
The soundtrack to "Sing Street" is great. This is a great soundtrack with a great collection of songs that are well-picked. It is also well-done, well-made and entertaining. All (19) tracks on here are great.  Track Listing: 1. Rock N Roll Is A Risk (Dialogue) - Jack Reynor (3 out of 4 stars) 2. Stay Clean - Motrhead (4 out of 4 stars) 3. The Riddle Of The Model - Sing Street (3 1/2 out of 4 stars) 4. Rio - Duran Duran (4 out of 4 stars) 5. Up - Sing Street (4 out of 4 stars) 6. To Find You - Sing Street (4 out of 4 stars) 7. Town Called Malice - The Jam (4 out of 4 stars) 8. Inbetween Days - The Cure (4 out of 4 stars) 9. A Beautiful Sea - Sing Street (4 out of 4 stars) 10. Maneater - Hall & Oates (4 out of 4 stars) 11. Steppin' Out - Joe Jackson (4 out of 4 stars) 12. Drive It Like You Stole It - Sing Street (4 out of 4 stars) 13. Up (Bedroom Mix) - Sing Street (3 1/2 out of 4 stars) 14. Pop Muzik - M (4 out of 4 stars) 15. Girls - Sing Street (4 out of 4 stars) 16. Brown Shoes - Sing Street (4 out of 4 stars) 17. Go Now - Adam Levine (4 out of 4 stars) 18. Up - The Score (4 out of 4 stars) 19. Drive It Like You Stole It - Hudson Thames (4 out of 4 stars)	1
You have to love Dylan to love this album. Now feel like I can sing out loud in church without apologizing. Thanks Bob. To be clear, I really like the album	1
Great!	1
thnks	1
This is one of the greatest soundtracks to one of the greatest coming of age films ever made. Great origonal '80s influenced songs with some legendary '80s tracks. A must have for anyone that is a fan of new wave and rock music as well as a perfect paring for its film. How 'Drive It Like You Stole It' got snubbed at the Oscars for best original song, I will never know.	1
Bob Dylan is staying relevant.  He is crooning ballads.  And he is not supposed to sound like Frank Sinatra, he's supposed to sound like Dylan.  Dylan crooning ballads.  Of course, it would be fun to hear some sort of a protest song from this septuagenarian.  Here are some suggested titles: "Leave Our Social Security Alone" or "Obamacare is the Law; Get Over It".	1
Another excellent CD of covers!	1
Watched the movie and knew I had to buy the album. Great music on this.	1
no problems	1
Not as heavy of an album as some of their others, but enough heavy guitar exists in it to still be able to crank it up. Volbeat never fails to bring something new and interesting to the table.	1
Vinyl review....  First let me say, the American radio/music industry is asleep at the wheel.  Every band that was once great is trying to keep the wheels greased....but to no real sales.  Volbeat is about as Guns N Motley as you can get with todays music.  Their consistency is top notch!!!  Why they aren't getting airplay isn't beyond me?  The U.S. music industry is about as f*%^@#"d as the U.S. Gov't.  I'm not afraid to say it.  ok,ok,...The Vinyl out of the sleeve is crackley.  Yes I clean my needle (like any good druggey (my drug is MUSIC)...so, vinly crackle, sux....If a good cleaning doesn't fix it, then 3 stars, if it fixes the crackle, then 5stars....so 4 is the average!  Volbeat is 5 stars all day.  Not many bands have ever...EVER!!! made record after record that are as good or better.  feel like debating???  Most bands end up with a filler record sooner or later....VOLBEAT HAS NOT!(YET anyways)....I don't need to say go buy this recording....I think the 39 gazillion reviews speak volumes.  Although it is kik@$$	1
I don't like every song, but I love the movie's songs, so heck with it. It deserves five stars anyway, the movie was so good.	1
Give me a break, I like Dylan - one of the best ever songwriter's, but he's not the singer he wants to be.  Frank he's not....He can put out stuff like this and people will buy it... because it's Dylan. IF you LOVE his voice then this is for you.... otherwise I would pass.	-1
I like to Boogie ( I guess it's the Irish in Me) and I really like this album.	1
So damn good! Best Volbeat album,  straight up rock, those distinctive vocals! The radio has many cuts on this album to choose from, so many potential hits. Thank you Denmark!	1
both the originals and the classic 80s tunes will keep your toes tapping.  love the adam Levine song too!!	1
Man, this song rocks!	1
Item as described, service as expected.	1
I love this soundtrack.  I grew up in the eighties like the kids in this movie.  I really like all the eighties song like "In Between Days", "Stepping Out" and "Maneater". I also like the songs that Sing Street  performed in the movie. "The Riddle of The Model" is a clever song lyrically. "Brown Shoes" and the slow romantic tune entitled To Find You" are superb too. The Adam Levine song entitled "Go Now" sounds very good too.  I like the music on this sound track very much.	1
love it	1
channels Leon Redbone.  At least that is the way it appeared to me on the first listen.  I am surprised at how good the vocals are on these cuts, considering Bob has never ben known as a great singer.  Great interpreter of songs?  Yes.  Great vocalist?  No.  But he actually does a very credible job here.  And I was also surprised at how laid back the songs on this release are.  Like I said - it is like he channeled Leon Redbone.  My favorites: Young at Heart, Polka Dots and Moonbeams (ok, when did you EVER think Dylan would do this song?), Skylark, It Had to Be You (again, when did you think he would do this?), That Old Black Magic and Come Rain Or Come Shine,	1
Great !!!!!!	1
I can think of only a few musical artists who can do whatever the bleep they want and not lose fans, and may even gain some when they step out of their usual style. I can think of Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Tony Bennett, Yo Yo Ma, and Dolly Parton. There is no question that Bob Dylan is at or near the top of that list. Thus we have "Fallen Angels." I admit, while I usually buy Dylan the moment new stuff comes out, I had no interest in his last album, which contained covers of songs made famous by Frank Sinatra. That was not because of Dylan; it was because I just don't like Frank Sinatra. This album, "Fallen Angels", comprised of mainstream standards written by some of this country's greatest songwriters of the 30's up into the early 60's. This album works. This album is a great album. On "Fallen Angels", Dylan surrounds himself with a small group of very talented musicians. To a certain degree it has the "live in the studio" feel. I admit I was surprised by how good Dylan's voice sounded, given the obvious deterioration over his last few new albums. I was also impressed with his phrasing and elocution of the lyrics. The man really can sing, that talent often hidden by the power of his own lyrics and the quality of the music produced by whatever band with which he is working. I listened to the entire album about five times before I felt ready to write this review. It was on my most recent listen, as "Young At Heart" was playing, that I realized that Bob was really "into" this music and that he sang such that it was clear to me he believed the words he was singing. I think that song in particular is fitting for BD as he celebrates his 75th birthday. The quality of the album is very even, in production, in song choice, in arrangements and in performance. For that reason, I find it hard to pick out any particular tracks as "standouts" on this album. I will say that in addition to "Young At Heart," I particularly enjoyed his renditions of "That Old Black Magic", "Come Rain or Come Shine," "All or Nothing at All," and "Melancholy Mood." This is a very good album and increases our appreciation of Dylan as the gift to the music world that he is. Highest recommendation.	1
With 2015s Shadows in the Night, Bob Dylan surprised us all with unique and compelling takes on some of the best songs the Great American Songbook has to offer. The record was a haunting, cohesive effort that also had some of his best singing in years. While normally not one to follow the same path for too long, the now 75 year old troubadour has followed up with another selection of Sinatra-esque standards, Fallen Angels.  Despite the ominous title, Fallen Angels is a generally lighter affair than Shadows in the Night, which was exclusively torch songs. Here, Dylan diversifies the palette a little, with lighthearted takes on classics such as Young at Heart, the silly but charming Polka Dots and Moonbeams, and wily rendition of That Old Black Magic, which is the most fun Dylan seems to have had on record since Love and Theft. He even shows his romantic side, particularly on a wonderful take on the classic All the Way. What he lacks in matching Sinatras smoothness of tone he makes up for in terms of beauty, emotionality and phrasing, all of which are top-notch here.  Vocally, Dylan is once again on top form here, sounding surprisingly smooth throughout and rising to notes he hasn't been able to hit in years. His readings are uniformly impassioned, and the arrangements are appropriate and effective. Fallen Angels won't go down as a genre-defining masterpiece, but its a an extremely solid effort that showcase the Master on top of his latest game.	1
This is so awful I cannot take it. It is like I want to be James Hetfield playing pop music. Every song sounds the same in every verse ends with a James Hetfield gararrrr.	-1
Happy with the purchase.	1
Not a bad song on this one!	1
i love it	1
Absolutely love this new Dylan album. Loved his last "standards" album Shadows in the Night too but this is arguably an even better song selection and he performs these classics with real feeling and obvious passion for the material. I really lament the so called fans who expect rerun after rerun of Highway 61 Revisited or Blonde on Blonde; the same people who go to his concerts expecting to see a 25 year old Dylan singing songs from over 40 years ago just like he sang them 40 years ago and then moan that "he's not like he used to be". Times and people change and so has Dylan. We should feel privileged to live at the same time this extraordinary artist  is still performing and producing great music	1
the last couple of Dylan albums have been nothing but morbid and depression. this album is no exception. I listened to some of these songs on YouTube and all Bob does in this new CD is droan and wine his whole way through. my Dad likes Bob Dylan and is a serious fan. he listened to the last album, "Shadows in the Night" and told me it was terrible. he gave back his CD to me and I returned it and bought something more sutible, "Tempist", which is a masterpiece. if you want to slit your wrists, this new droany Bob Dylan album is for you.	-1
With none of the arrangements on Fallen Angels being true to the originals, it would be easy to say that this was just Bob Dylan being Bob Dylan, and putting his personal mark on these songs ... though almost to the point where they are unrecognizable.  I have to wonder whats going on with this his second album of covers, and I have my thoughts, having seen and heard this concept done time and time again by other aging artists.  There are some muted jazz arrangements here that should stand with more strength and life, yet Dylan, a huge jazz fan, has chosen to nearly hide what he appreciates most.  That Old Black Magic has been turned into a rockabilly shuffle, It Had To Be You barely holds together, as he seems to be nearly reading these songs rather than singing them.  In all honesty, this album sounds like another dreamy look back at his own youth [in much the same manner as Sinatra did] trying to figure out where he fits in during this, the first half of the 21st century, or if it even matters that he does.  Call this gathering of songs whimsical if you will, but please, do not call them great or inspirational, as they come off rather lightweight, shadows of shadows, delivered by a man who may or may not be in the moment as these tracks were recorded.  In a strange way though, the songs all do hang together, but mostly in a manner where Dylan is trying to prove that these vintage ballads are still valid, and thus, if they are, then so is Dylan.  Of course there are those who are gonna tell you that its all brilliant, but its not, and its a real shame that for all his greatness, Bob Dylan cant take his time and present his vision of his later life, or the worlds hes lived through, rather than stepping back into some long lost comfort zone where he no longer needs to gaze out of his window.  But ... you may find it all touching and romantic, so by all means celebrate with Mr. Dylan, for his times, they certainly have changed.  Review by Jenell Kesler	-1
I love Volbeat and this latest release is awesome. My new favorite!	1
Volbeat is definitely a band that makes me want to get up and jump around or start dancing and this song is no different, this album is no different and it has a lot of great songs on it. Some are slower than others but all band albums are like that not every song is going to be super awesome but as a whole it is good to listen to.	1
This album has great riffs and breakdowns. The musicianship of this guys is amazing.	1
not good as previos album	1
the new volbeat cd is a cd that is a must have. they continue on putting out great music.	1
I love the way the singer flips his voice in this one, kinda like Elvis used in his music.	1
LOVE IT AS I THOUGHY I WOOD VOLBEAT ALWAYS DELIVERS!!!	1
As with most Volbeat cds the first run doesnt do much for me, but by the second or third spin after I have deciphered some of the lyrics and started hearing some of the nuances of the songs I become hooked. I have had this disk in my truck now for about 3 weeks and there are 6 songs that will make it off on to my iPod when the Saliva disk comes in and replaces it. 6 doesnt sound like a lot out of 13 songs, but that is better than most bands I listen to. I didn't even realize I was such a big Volbeat fan until an audit of my iPod songs showed me that behind Black Stone Cherry I had more Volbeat songs than any other band. the 6 I like her are Devils Bleeding Crown, Black Rose, Battleship Chains, Bliss, Let it Burn and the title track Seal the Deal. several other songs are good, but if i cant remember the lyrics and name of a song by the 4th or 5th time i hear it then it is not going to be that special to me and i will just end up skipping it. Keep in mind i have almost 800 songs at this point in my ipod, and thats how they all got there. By way of comparison I am a Black Stone Cherry fan, Shinedown, Theory of a Deadman is ok, i like Hell Yeah and Godsmack and others like that ..  it you like Volbeat this will be better than some releases but not as good as others .. if you don't like them then this will not win you over.  Cant wait to see them live again .. these guys lay it down live and are worth every penny.	1
We dig Marian Hill.	1
Great album worth every penny. If a Volbeat fan will like this album.	1
One of my fave rock albums so far this year. This band never disappoints and keeps turning in quality music. Sure, bands all change and should. They still stick to their trademark style with some tweeks here and there. Which are the ingredients for a fine, rock album. If you've been with Volbeat since the beginning and enjoy their style, there is no reason you shouldn't pick this one up. It rocks and doesn't have one dull song, at least to me. Try it and you will like it. Rock on!!!!  Aloha~~~~	1
This is a fantastic album. A different and new sound to add to my music library. I love the music and her voice	1
Beautiful packaging. Volbeats new music was made to be listened to on vinyl. Love it!	1
Loved the Act One by Marian Hill that was on TV but even better when listening to all of it.	1
Only heard from the commercial, but once I sampled the songs, they sounded pretty good so I bought the album, and it's not often that I immediately like an artist that I've never heard of, but it;s happened	1
Fantastic album	1
Starting to love this album, it's really starting to grow on me the more I listen to it. But I do miss the heaviest of past albums like Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood, Rock the rebel/ metal the devil, and the Strenght/the sound/ the songs. But like any awesome band they new to grow with each release. They has starting to change with each release starting with Beyond hell/ above heaven and continue with Outlaw gentlemen shady ladies which I think this album sounds a lot like. The album starts off with the catchy single The Devils Bleeding Crown. Sounding like a really catchy Metallica song from load or reload with a more modern sound and Glen Danzig singing over it with more melody. Some of the rhythms almost sound like Cape Of our Hero from their previous album. The second track Marie Laveau rocks a little harder but doesn't turn into a full on thrash metal tune like you would expect. All the songs sort have the same vibe and rhythm. Most of the album just reminds a lot of Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Like these songs could almost be outtakes or b-sides from that album that's how similar they sound to that album. All the songs have sort of a 90s era Metallica vibe about them. Like a mixture of the Black album, Load and Reload mixed the Misfits and a dash of southern rock. Probably the heaviest song on the album is the last song track 13 The Loa's Crossroad. A sort of medium paced thrasher with a bagpipe solo in the middle. Volbeat on this release do two covers one of a band I've never heard of called Rebound by a band called Teenage Bottle Rocket. The second cover they do a song called Battleship by the Geogria Satellites. A guest appearance by Danko Jones on the song Black Rose. But all in all this is a solid album. Volbeat seem to inject more melody into their brand of Rockabilly heavy metal that seems to really work. Maybe the only downfall on this album is it sounds to similar to Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Maybe not for the die hard metal heads that prefer their old stuff. But I enjoyed it all the same banjo and bagpipe solos in all.	1
Nothing Short of brilliant, reminds me a lot of a heavier version of Australia rock a billy rock band The Living End and Greenday - but more deeper lyrical tones . There are even subtle influences of Godsmack riffs here. If the new Deftones Gore was not your expectation as I did not like it that much this album will make you feel better. High point tracks -The Devil's Bleeding Crown, Seal the Deal, Marie Laveau, Gates of Babylon  Check out new Decyfer Down - the other side of Darkness also and  the band The Word Alive.	1
I've listened to this album probably 5 times since this morning. I've been a long time Volbeat fan. These guys bring it all to the table with this album. Trust me. GET IT! NOW!!	1
Volbeat continue to show why they are one of the more creative radio rock bands out there with this effort. This is an album that still maintains their hard rock/"country" metal (if you really wanna call it that) sound, but makes it diverse from their other albums in some way. Recommendable for hard rock fans.  Rating: 82/100	1
Volbeat always outdo themselves!!	1
I completely love Volbeat and absolutely love this song, it makes it to where I am even more anxious to hear the rest of the album.	1
Seems like I have been waiting FOREVER for a new VolBeat release!  Saw them with HellYeah, 5FDP, and Nothing More over the summer and these guys KILLED that show. 5FDP cut their show short that night, I assume because they just couldn't follow VolBeat's performance .. it was that good.	1
great song	1
Awesome	1
Not a huge Volbeat fan but, as with most songs, if it has a catchy enough beat I'll listen.	1
Good Modern Tune.	1
Cool song!!!	1
love it!	1
Very upbeat, energetic sound.	1
A good track but not at all indicative of what you'll hear on the rest of the album.	1
Amazing.	1
less than a year ago Allen Toussaint left us after a concert in Madrid, made him after finishing the sessions of this album under the magical production of Joe Henry. The album is a continuation in a sense the wonderful "The Bright Mississippi". It is an album full of melancholy and emotion. After his title "American tunes" a gem of other times hidden, another way of understanding music, sounds belonging to that wonderful city that is New Orleans. It is a very classic and evocative album. Today you can not understand this city without their music. Arranger, composer and musician who distills New Orleans from every pore. It is difficult to explain all these feelings and all the experience behind her notes, HOWEVER Joe Henry has done it. Beautiful themes, emotional voices and musicians first, Bill Frisell, Van Dyke Parks, Charles LLoyd ... but especially his piano. Always on the front line of sound, always evocative ... The man who got love Costello, The Band ... and many others. There are issues of Allen piano solo, intrumentales issues and sung, but always exciting and splendid. New Orleans always background, always with magnificent arrangements, always with class and simplicity already lost. An eternal CD that transports us to another place to other feelings. Magnifico, an indisputable classic. Eternal glory to Allen Toussaint. Great	1
I'm still listening to this cd one year after I bought it.  A classic!  It is one of the best albums by such a monumental figure in American Music.  A great musician with great timing and exceptional tunes to work with.	1
I am willing to bet that 99 percent of you do not have anything like this album in your collections. I have well over a thousand albums in my collection (I haven't counted), and I didn't.  Like me, you may have classical piano, and jazz piano, and pop piano, and even easy-listening piano, but you probably don't have this. We still have piano bars, we have dueling pianos, we have tasteful and unobtrusive pianos played in museum atria, but we no longer have piano music as it's own art form. We don't have piano houses with rollicking piano music. We don't have drawing rooms where people gathering around a well-performed piano piece is the only entertainment in the home. Allen Toussaint can take you back to those times. You may not even know that you want to go, but trust me, you do. Toussaint pours his lifetime of musical accomplishment into this album, and makes it seem effortless. He plays with class and style and an unerring ear for what is musically right. His fingers tickle the ivories and your ear. There is a delightful diversity of musical styles represented on the album... some lean toward pop, some toward light classical, others are barrel house blues straight out of New Orleans. Invite Allen to come play in your home... this extraordinary and yet at the time unassuming and relaxed album belongs in the collection of every true "music lover."	1
Absolute magic! The best recordings I have purchased. Fantastic artistry. I listen to this music and I am lost for words. Brilliant!	1
A great collection of New Orleans piano by the master.  Sadly, his last production	1
Sarah Jarosz is a class act.  She's a fine musician, an excellent songwriter and a very good singer, all of which are in evidence here.  I thought her last album, Build Me Up From Bones was one of the best of 2013.  Undercurrent (quite an apt title, I think) is rather different in character  quieter and more contemplative overall, with several tracks featuring Sarah Jarosz playing and singing solo.  It takes a bit of getting into, I found, because it doesnt always have the immediacy of, say, Over The Edge or Gone Too Soon, but after half-a-dozen listens, I'm hooked.  These songs are beautifully crafted musically, and often have very good lyrics.  They are personal and varied, with tender celebrations of love, harsh break-up songs (the excellent House Of Mercy) and yearning hints at reconciliation in the lovely, haunting Lost Dog.  There are some excellent collaborations, including with Aiofe O'Donovan on Still Life (returning Sarah's appearance on Aiofe's fine album Magic Hour). Production is restrained but spot on for these songs, I think, allowing each one to speak as it should and the more I listen to this album, the better I like it.  I saw Sarah Jarosz live at London's Bush Hall a couple of years ago.  She was brilliant, performing superbly, making it look effortless and plainly putting everything into the music.  You can't fake that sort of quality, and Undercurrent is a worthy next step.  It's an album of real quality and it's a great listen.  Very warmly recommended.	1
Sarah sneaks up on you. It took me a few listens for this to sink in but I'm hooked now.	1
Absolutely wonderful new work - a cut above her previous material. I really, really love Lost Dog as well as House of Mercy. Both tell heartbreaking stories and the melodies are just lovely. Looking forward to more from this artist now that she is out of school and devoting full time to her music.	1
Great folk music	1
A talented songwriter and gifted musician come together wonderfully on this cd. My favorite song is "old dog". A song that captures the sorrow and the willingness to take in a stray with a mysterious past. Love it!	1
I don't have time to write a long review, but take my word for it, buy *anything* you see by Sarah Jarosz and be happy!  Some artists just have it. Sarah Jarosz is an incredible talent with a unique and enthralling voice and all the chops to go with it.  Her previous CD's "Song Up In Her Head," "Follow Me Down," and "Build Me Up From Bones" all blew me away. This one is no different. Each is a treat.  There is no one like SJ. Her sound is her own. Her songs are moving and inspiring. They will take you away from your daily cares and into a wonderful place where life is good.	1
Great service, very nice album...	1
Just recently started listening to Sarah Jarosz. Het simple style is perect. This album to me is a really good album	1
I first discovered Sarah Jarosz watching The Transatlantic Sessions on PBS. I couldn't believe how good she was and that I had never heard of her before. Also amazing is someone starting out in folk music at such a young age and also being such a talented songwriter. She is also amazing on guitar and the banjo.  I now own all of her albums and she continues to put out great music. Now I can't wait to have the chance to see her live. Also. Watching the Transatlantic Sessions introduced me to several artist that I was not familiar and now own a lot of their work also. I highly recommend either watching it or at least listen to the several albums that are available of the TransAtlantic Sessions here on Amazon!	1
All I can say is wow. I wasn't sure what to expect when I heard that Bruce wasn't playing any piano whatsoever on this record but I'm thrilled to say that this is his best recording since Hot House and is as good as his first efforts with the Range. The hooks are endless and the lyrics are fun and loose.	1
This is one of my favorite of all Bruce's cd's.	1
Honestly , I've never been a big Bruce Hornsby fan and probably would not have bought it if it wasn't autographed . That said , this really is a pretty good album and with the auto rip you can put the record away and just listen on your tablet .	1
I have been a fan of Hornsby's music from the beginning with "The Way It Is" back in 1986. I saw him live at Fiddler's Green in Denver, Colorado in August 1988 for the "Scenes From the Southside" tour. He was fantastic.  Hornsby has dealt with the Best New Artist Grammy curse well. While he isn't as popular as he was 1986-1990, he has maintained his artistic integrity, earning the respect of die-hard fans. Unlike Elton John (who I like), Hornsby hasn't cranked out schlock. Unlike Billy Joel (who I also like), Hornsby has kept going. To me, Hornsby is the best piano player in popular music, period.  So here is "Rehab Reunion", Hornsby's first album in seven years, since 2009's "Levitate". This time he dispenses with technology, avoids the piano altogether, and pretty much goes acoustic throughout. This radical approach serves him well. In fact, if labels were tossed around you could call "Rehab Reunion" 'Americana' sounding.  Hornsby has retained his humor with "Tipping" and "TSA Man", his intellectual noodlings "Hey Franz Kafka", and his ability to tell stories "Over the Rise", "Soon Enough", "M.I.A. in M.I.A.M.I.", "Rehab Reunion", "Tropical Cashmere Sweater" and "Celestial Railroad". To me, a new version of "The Valley Road" could have been left off in favor of the bonus track only found on iTunes. "The Valley Road" is completely re-imagined, and to be honest, I still prefer the original version on "Scenes From the Southside".  "Rehab Reunion" has an uplifting, playful spirit about it. Something new. It has an organic feel that hasn't been present since 1990's "A Night on the Town" album. It's refreshing and invigorating. Now I just wonder if it will be another seven years before we get another Hornsby album (much too long!)  Here's how "Rehab Reunion" compares to Hornsby's other works:  1986 The Way It Is: Four Stars 1988 Scenes From the Southside: Four Stars 1990 A Night on the Town: Four Stars 1993 Harbor Lights: Five Stars 1995 Hot House: Four Stars 1998 Spirit Trail: Five Stars 2002 Big Swing Face: Three and a Half Stars 2004 Halcyon Days: Five Stars 2007 Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby: Three and a Half Stars 2007 Camp Meeting: Three Stars 2009 Levitate: Three and a Half Stars 2016 Rehab Reunion: Four Stars	1
loved the music on this CD.	1
It has been a very, very long time since we have really heard anything from Maxwell, musically and personally. He had promised at one point to make a trio of albums, after his past 8 year absence from the public eye from 2001-2009. When he did come back at that time, he released the acclaimed BlackSummers' Night, which garnered a few Grammy awards, and a set of really great songs in the process. Now, he is planning to come back with the follow-up to BlackSummers' Night, set to be released in July. Based on the lead single planned for that album, he definitely is in a good vision to his work. Lake By The Ocean, Maxwell's latest single definitely is a good soul song, that is really at the par of his classics that he had made before in his work like Fistful Of Tears, Wherever, Whatever, Wherever and Pretty Wings.. It really feels like a throwback to The Isley Brothers classic Voyage To Atlantis in sound, and definitely a compliment to Maxwell soulful satisfaction in his own work. This is a good download for die hard Maxwell fans, whom are eagerly awaiting his new works.  Song: B-	1

It has been a very long time since we've heard anything from Maxwell musically and personally. After 2009's Blacksummers' Night album, many welcomes his soulful voice and swooning heart brilliantly. Nevertheless, many have welcomed him back and awaited to see what he would sincerely conjure up with next, as he promised to make a trio of albums. Well, now with his similar titled album blackSummers' Night coming out soon, many in soul and R&B have waited for him to swoon all over again. His returning single is absolutely no exception that he has not lost what he had shown musically for years. Lake By The Ocean is a more upbeat and soulful song that still brought out the best of his voice and charming sophistication in music. Maxwell delivers a lot of heart into his work nicely, and this song flows well with a lot of the songs he had released for the past several years like Fistful Of Tears and Pretty Wings. It is a very upbeat song that takes your breath away. I recommend this song for any die hard Maxwell fan, and a nice listen to for any die hard fan of neo-soul and R&B.  Song: B 1/2+	1
Great song!	1
I live Maxwell and this song.	1
Outstanding song by one of music's best and yet appreciated male artists. This song again shows the depth of Maxwell's talent. The song is loaded with longing soul and hugely influenced by the recently deceased Prince. Some may like the underwater-sounded production, but to see it enhances the song. Others keep going back to the same writers and producers, while Maxwell keeps doing his thing. I hope that people wake up to him again.	1
Ladies and gentlemen, here is another piece of evidence supporting the decision to award Paul Simon the Library Of Congress' Gershwin Prize for popular music. This album is a strong, vital piece or work. And like other albums in Simon's long and storied career it will offer multiple delights to those who actively immerse themselves into listening to it, hearing it multiple times. And then there are those who will dismiss is as more "I-miss-the-old-stuff" music. I feel sorry for them. This is a fine, melodic album featuring unusual and varied instrumentation and musical styles. More important perhaps is the fact that Simon's delicate, immediately recognizable quicksilver voice is in good shape. Hang in there while I try to place this in brief context.  The critical accolades that greeted the release of So Beautiful Or So What seems to have re-energized this brilliant, somewhat melancholic composer. At the ripe age of 74, Simon has produced another album that defies expectations and pushes the boundaries of his compositional style. A composer who values the role that rhythm plays in song ("these are the roots of rhythm, and the roots of rhythm remain") Simon has hired Italian dance club king Club! Club! to re-invigorate his approach of infusing his music with the rhythms of exotic instruments. (Like So Beautiful, this album is an aural wonder through a good pair of cans).  The rhythms themselves surround and envelop some wonderfully acerbic lyrics (the obit lyric quoted above is preceded by the lines: "Milwaukee man led a fairly decent life/made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife. She killed him - sushi knife./Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife. The werewolf is coming." Ah - The Afterlife. "You got to fill out a form first/And then you wait in the line."  Like The Afterlife, it's easy to get caught up in the rhythms and not immerse yourself too deeply in the song itself. That would be a grave mistake - no pun intended. Just as The Afterlife dealt with the composer's imagined death, songs like "/In A Parade" are not what they seem to be upon initial hearing. In the case of the latter, the parade refers an ER tech (nurse? physician?) delaying with an endless stream of patients with critical needs ("Some nights the ER is quiet as an EKG/But tonight it feels like every broken bone, tonight it feels like every wounded soul is filling out a form or on the phone./I can't talk now, I'm in a parade.) The song itself reflects Simon's desire to return to Mardi Gras; it's rhythmic foundation sounds as if he recruited every Mardi Gras Indian Chief to pound out the soul of New Orleans.  And therein lays another level of genius in the music and the songs, of Paul Simon. They can be heard and appreciated on so many different levels - but they are typically not obtuse (i.e., Dylan) or treacly (i.e., McCartney) or musical re-treads (i.e, Taylor) as is the work of many of his contemporaries. Paul Simon continues to break new musical ground.  I'm still absorbing this muic myself, and hope to add more detail to this review as I do so. I find it ludicrous to compare this album to earlier work, just as I find it ludicrous to compare it to Simon's alleged masterpiece Graceland, certainly his most important album. But at this early point, I think I would compare Stranger To Stranger to one of Simon's most under-rated albums, and one I would consider to be among his greatest works: Surprise. Each is an album that defies expectations. Each is an album that confounds some, while revealing great mysteries and connections with repeated listening over time. And each one is a statement of a true artist - a true genius if you'll allow me that - working at the peak of his creative powers at that particular moment of time in his life.  If this is the level of creativity and vitality associated with being 70+ years old, it isn't "terribly strange" at all. At a stage in life when artists can rest on their laurels and release albums of "so what", Simon has pushed himself to create another album that is "so beautiful" rather than "so what". Stranger To Stranger is so fresh, and full with the joy of discovery that it gives me something to look forward to as I move through the sixth decade of my own life. Well, unless the Werewolf becomes our next President and the riots of those without wristbands becomes prescient rather than merely clever.  Finally, let me echo the sentiments of those who recommend purchase of this "deluxe" edition, particularly for the live performance of Duncan from Prairie Home Companion which is absolutely exquisite, and dare I say superior to the original. In this recording the pan-pipes in the refrain are replaced by two fiddles, which give the song an ageless Stephen-Fosteresque quality. Not only is this in keeping with its recording as part of PHC, but also elevates the stature of the song to that of a truly timeless classic.  I feel fortunate to have grown older along with Paul Simon. He continues to provide meaningful entertainment. And inspiration.	1
Over this past weekend I had the opportunity to sample a pretty good chunk of Paul Simons stunning new release Stranger to Stranger on NPRs First Listen website.  As usual, listening to a Paul Simon album proved to be an exciting and mostly joyful experience.  Simon always succeeds in delivering the unexpected as he experiments with an eclectic variety of sounds, genres and instruments. I liked a tune called Wristband right off the bat and was not surprised to learn that it has been chosen as the first single to be released from the album.  One has to marvel how at the age of 74 Simon is not content to rest on his laurels but rather seeks to synthesize seemingly disparate musical forms into highly enjoyable new tunes.  There are a generous 16 tracks on this album and you cannot help but be impressed by the quality of each and every one of these songs.  I especially enjoyed Pauls moving musical tribute to Negro League baseball legend Cool Papa Bell as well as a neat number called The Riverbank.  The disc closes with the very fine duet New York Is My Home featuring fellow New Yorker and rock and roll Hall of Famer Dion.  A very nice touch indeed!  After listening to Stranger to Stranger a couple of times it becomes abundantly clear that time has not eroded Paul Simons musical prowess one little bit.  This is an outstanding recording from start to finish and there is little doubt in my mind that it will be another huge success.  While it might not be quite on the level of his masterpiece Graceland this is nonetheless an album that deserves your attention and support.  After all, there are not that many new releases for us aging baby boomers to glom on to these days.  Highly recommended!	1
I'm pleased to say that this is a good album. I have been very fortunate to have had access to an advance copy and I've listened to this a lot over the last few days; it's varied, unexpected in places and contains some very good tracks.  Paul Simon has always been a very fine musician who has developed and experimented throughout his career. He once, for example, set himself the challenge of using every note of the chromatic scale in a single song: the result was Still Crazy After All These Years, which is a magnificently beautiful song and a true classic. Not all his challenges have been met so successfully and I'm not sure that there's anything of quite that stature here, but this is a fine album nonetheless.  Simon incorporates all sorts of styles including rap, jazz and many others. Several tracks are very rhythm-driven (like Wristband and The Werewolf), but beautiful melodies are still in evidence in the title track and Proof Of Love, which I think is a truly lovely song. The album is very varied in instrumentation, feel and style and I'm delighted to see Simon still stretching the boundaries in his seventies  but this is still recognisable a Paul Simon album and collection of really good songs. His voice is still in good shape and he's a real master at putting a song across.  Simon's lyrics have always been outstandingly good, and they are as sharp as ever here. There is a good deal of rage against social injustice as well as profound expressions of personal emotion. Take this, from the Werewolf, for example:  "The fact is most obits are mixed reviews Life is a lottery, a lot of people lose And the winners, the grinners with money-coloured eyes Eat all the nuggets, then they order extra fries  Ignorance and arrogance, a national debate Put the fight in Vegas, that's a billion dollar gate Revenues, pay per views, it should be pretty healthy The usual deductions, and it all goes to the wealthy"  Strong stuff  and it's good to see that real social bite still remains in at least one veteran songwriter.  I've loved Paul Simon's music since Kathy's Song was among the first songs I learned to play and sing, almost half a century ago. He hasn't always hit the spot with every album, but this is a really good one and I like it a lot. I don't know whether everyone will agree  I have always thought Hearts and Bones was quite brilliant, but it wasn't one of Simon's biggest hit albums, for example  but I think there's real quality here, and I would recommend it warmly.  [By the way, the Deluxe Version contains "bonus material" which is actually well worth having, including a fine live rendition of Duncan and the excellent title track from Dion's (also good) recent album New York Is My Home, which Dion and Simon sang together. It's not always worth getting the Deluxe Version of albums, but I'd recommend this one.]	1
Nice	1
I am a fan of Paul Simon's music since the 60's. Another forage into the creative music that is Simon. As long as he keeps composing, I will continue buying. I have never been disappointed in his offerings.	1
Very cool album Recommend highly	1
interesting and very modern	1
Mr Simon has not delivered a solid album since Graceland.  Sure each album has a song or 2 that showed that old songwriting spark, but in reality, each album since Graceland has been awful.  Unfortunately, Stranger to Stranger continues that trend.  To be blunt, Paul Simon can no longer write a melody.  Period.  Sure, nice sounds and voice, but he has not written a solid melody in a very long time.  Just like his last 5 , this is garbage.  Avoid!	-1
What an awful album.	-1
Grows on you - its up against some strong Paul Simon previous material!  Get it on vinyl so you can savor it.	1
I was so excited about this disc, put it in the changer, and was disappointed.  Each time I put it in the changer, I liked more things about it.  Until the 4th spin, wow!  I connected.  Blast off with me and "Stranger to Stranger."  I went through a period in my life when I was upsetting people because they didn't get my sense of humor.  Paul Simon's humor is like mine, very dry.  His lyrics abound in ironic twists like the opening of "The Werewolf," "Milwaukee man led a fairly decent life, made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife; She killed him -- sushi knife; Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife."  Great irony there with a wry comment about the commercialization of religion.  The first single "Wristband" seems to parallel a scene from Michael Keaton's film "Birdland" where the star gets hassled about getting into his own event, remarkable for its throbbing rhythmic track, much like the "Birdland" soundtrack.  "Proof of Love" appeals to me with its melodic dirge and great acoustic guitar, "The road is steep; The air is thin; I hear a voice inside my skin, "Don't be afraid; Your days won't end with night; Feel the sun, drink the rain, let your body heal its pain, bathe beneath a waterfall of light."  Lovely poetic images.  "The Riverbank" is the track that's been in my personal top ten this summer, entrancing me with its marriage of melody and lyric, "Army dude, only son, nowhere to run, no one to turn to, he turns to the gun; It's a cross, it's a stone, It's a fragment of bone; It's a long walk home."  "Cool Papa Bell" is a song about a Negro League baseball player which Simon laces with well-placed profanity.  On the deluxe edition, Simon closes the set with a duet with classic rock singer Dion on "New York Is My Home."  Gorgeous!  Paul Simon's "Stranger to Stranger" sits well within his body of work, fresh, laced with wry wit and inventive arrangements.  Enjoy!	1
Still making a different kind of sound from anyone else. Mr. Simon's music continues to change as he incorporates almost ever musical instrument there is without making the music sound forced or corny. Truly a gifted man who most likely won't be fully appreciated until he's left us. Yes, he is in the hall of fame, twice) but an artist who dares to change his/her stripes on almost ever album, yet can keep his or her sound is very rare and usually die a painful death for being what people say they loved about them...Creative. Paul is one of the few musical artists who got away with it with flying colors for more than 50 years. Remarkable.	1
Not his best effort. His voice is as good as it ever was. Songs are a bit to strange for me.	1
Oh...my...gosh...Paul did it and did it so very well. Not every production by Paul  was a WINNER, but this on certainly is worth listening to from reading the lyrics, listening to the different sounds produced by instruments created to get the sound we hear. The artwork is amazing, the words are killers words and if anybody wants to listen (for a change) this album is the one way to go and understand. Give it as a gift to those who do no listen, maybe they will. Praise Paul for this one.	1
Long dreary. Similiar sounds..  Looking for more of him.... I'll try again..	-1
Paul is still going like that bunny.  Reminiscent of the Graceland band with some new twists.  Mr. Simon has always been a groundbreaker. Music of a universal language.  Congratz to be so good and hip in to your 70's.	1
Amazing. Some brilliant tracks. An inspiration at 75 years of age.	1
Very good, but not great.	1
excellent	1
paul simon always  keeps his own vibe and groove going and he is truly one of the  best songwriters ever and the man stays in his lane and makes music stay steady with his presentation. this album finds him continuing his  hybrid style and groove and yet he stays true to his lyrical content and the music flows really well.	1
The entrance to Paul Simon's latest creation with "The Werewolf" shows his wit to be as sharp as it's ever been. The music to this song is as stunning as anything he's ever written. It opens with an Indian instrument called the gopichand (unknown to me) and it makes you do an about face. It's unsettling, just like its violent lyrics. Though "The Werewolf" (and most of the album) is percussive, when the pipe organ creeps in, the song's deathly feel is manifest.  In "Street Angel" and "In a Parade", Simon faces a social taboo with raw emotion. They're both subjects of the same homeless person. The fine melodies give service to their great rhythms. Again, percussion effects dominate here. With "Street Angel", the character has something to latch on to, but on "In a Parade" he checks into the ER with total absence of a vision. These two cuts could have made for one of the most tough-minded concept seven-inch singles.  The wonderful "Cool Papa Bell" is musically upbeat in the "Graceland" tradition of the fastest baseball player in the pre-Jackie Robinson era. The profanity in the song is subtly sung.  Simon still embraces his melodic folk roots. The two highlights are a sweet, brief instrumental entitled "In the Garden of Edie" , which is dedicated to his wife. The other is the closer, "Insomniac's Lullaby". This last song has two instruments I'd never heard of; the zoomoozophone and the chromelodeon. Maybe these instruments sound odd but every sound is layered oh so right. It's Simon's more halcyon death song than "The Werewolf".  The only thing predictable about Simon is that he spaces his studio albums by half a decade. There's nothing beyond the realm of possibility in him finding sonic surprise. Most of this music offers that evidence.	1
I really like this album by Paul Simon.  He has always had the ability to uplift me and soothe me with his voice  My favorite song is "Wristband". The bass playing on this song is really groovy.  Only Paul Simon can sing a song about wearing a wristband sound cool.  I love the horns playing on the song "Cool Papa Bell". This song makes me feel happy. I can tap my feet to the beat of the songs "The Werewolf and In A Parade".  These songs are so enjoyable to listen to.  There are two great instrumental tracks on this album.  In the Garden of Edie" is simply a minute and half of soothing guitar playing. This is a lovely tribute to his wife. I love the simplicity of a song like "The Clock". The chimes featured on this song are beautiful.  "Street Angel" is an upbeat song about the sacrifices that street performers make for their craft.  The drums playing on "Street Angel" are very good. I love the saxophone playing on the song " Stranger To Stranger". "Insomniac Lullaby" is a lovely song.  I will play this song when I am unable to sleep.  Paul Simon sounds so peaceful on this song.  I love the song "Duncan".  It is a good story song about coming of age.  "Duncan" is actually an older song from the seventies, but it sounds fresh performed live on this CD.  I love this music by Paul Simon.	1
Some of my earliest popular music memories consist of Paul Simon (and Simon & Garfunkel) songs. My father bought their music in the 1960's and 1970's, so I remember hearing "The Boxer", "Mother and Child Reunion", "Me & Julio Down By The Schoolyard", "Kodachrome", "Slip Sliding Away", "Late In The Evening" and most importantly, as a child of divorce, "50 Ways To Leave Your Lover".  All this primed me for 1986's "Graceland". I say "Graceland" because 1983's "Hearts and Bones" didn't even register. So, it was, in the autumn of 1986, that I saw the video for "You Can Call Me Al" and then "The Boy in the Bubble". I bought the cassette tape of "Graceland" in March 1987, and since that time I have bought all of Simon's solo albums and a Simon & Garfunkel "Best Of". I have consistently purchase each new Simon album since 1987, though I have not once seen him in concert.  Anyway, "Stranger To Stranger" does what I complain most artists do not do--be original, keep experimenting. I give it to Simon, now age 74, for continuing to experiment musically, unlike, say, fellow contemporary, Bob Dylan. "Stranger To Stranger" is also lyrically thought provoking, a first for Simon since, well, "The Rhythm Of The Saints" (1990). For me, anyway.  "The Werewolf", "Wristband", "Street Angel", "In A Parade", "The Riverbank" and "Cool Papa Bell" are all standouts.  The three ballads, "Stranger To Stranger", "Proof Of Love" and "Insomniac's Lullaby" are okay. I've always taken an issue with Simon's ballads as I find them rather bland, usually.  There are two instrumentals, which to me, are disposable: "The Clock" and "In The Garden Of Edie".  Then there are all those bonus tracks, five to be exact. Disposable, all of them.  So, as you can see, for me, this is four stars, not five. Five would be "Paul Simon" (1972), "There's Goes Rhymin' Simon" (1973), "Still Crazy After All These Years" (1975), "Graceland" (1986) and "The Rhythm Of The Saints" (1990). I can listen to any of those and not skip a single track. I could sing the entire "Graceland" album in my sleep, I know it so well.  Keep rocking (or is it now lilting?) Paul. The music business still needs artist like you. There's so few of you around--Bob Dylan, Randy Newman, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Tom Waits, Don Henley, Fleetwood Mac, and....Leonard Cohen.....and.....?  See you in another five years.  This is how "Stranger To Stranger" compares to Simon's other solo works:  1972 Paul Simon: Five Stars 1973 There Goes Rhymin' Simon: Five Stars 1975 Still Crazy After All These Years: Five Stars 1980 One Trick Pony: Two Stars 1983 Hearts And Bones: Three Stars 1986 Graceland: Five Stars 1990 The Rhythm Of The Saints: Five Stars 1997 Songs From The Capeman: One Star 2000 You're The One: Four Stars 2006 Surprise: Three Stars 2011 So Beautiful Or So What: Three and a Half Stars	1
Being one of probably a "handful" (relative to the vast sky full of boomers, some of whom may have joined me back then) of Simon devotees who started collecting his music (with and without Art) beginning with Wednesday Morning 3 AM, I have a different take on his releases than most.  I've literally grown up with the man, his music playing in my ear nearly as much as the Beatles who I literally grew up with also.  Paul S and Paul M have been with me all my life.  I am crazy enough to have purchased The Paul Simon Collection simply so I could have a CD copy of Slip Sliding Away which was NOT released as a bonus track on any of the remasters.  Columbia, you tick me off.  STRANGER TO STRANGER fits my modus operandi when it comes to describing the releases of Paul Simon.  Each and every album release is better than the last and yet I do have my favorites.  But the long and short answer, musically, is that Paul Simon strives each and every time to raise the bar on himself and without fail, he succeeds each and every time.  Yes there are evidently a small few "disappointed" fans for whom this one didn't do it.  I feel differently but that does not assuage the fact that they (and you) might be disappointed.  However, critically, one has to acknowledge that this master of composition is astoundingly creative and each effort masters a new score.  Some folks felt that One Trick Pony and Hearts & Bones were slippages.  For me they were stepping stones from Still Crazy to Graceland, and both of them were steps up on the rungs of his musical genius.  ROS was another quantum leap above Graceland.  And since the turn of the millennium, the man just keeps amping up the dial on his creatometer!  Surprise and Beautiful were monumental for me.  He never loses what he accomplished before, it is all there in the notes and if you look carefully in the small corners of his compositions.  There are hints of Hearts & Bones, Graceland, Rhythm Of The Saints, You're The One, Surprise, So Beautiful, even Still Crazy and There Goes... all over these songs, and yet they are simply beautiful and new and fresh and heartfelt.  Paul's tribute to Harry Partch fits in perfectly with what he himself has accomplished as a composer, and this experiment with new tonalities and sounds just becomes organic in the hands of Paul Simon.  Lyrically, there is an arc of aging which is readily apparent in the last 4 albums, songs where he sardonically and humorously self-deprecates himself as if preparing for "the afterlife" in a mirthful Judeo-Christian way.  STRANGER TO STRANGER continues this mother lode and the title of the album itself becomes double entendre as both a tip of the hat to Partch and a nod to himself in that his music continues to evolve into stanger and stanger embryos.  Personally I love it.  Paul Simon never sits still on top of an art form, it is in a constant state of flux and mutation.  Again, this album is organically perfect in the caravan which Paul debarked upon in 1963, his travels taking us on a mythic journey of sonic development that is full of beauty, grace, profundity, and curiousity.  I hope the majority of Simon fans will find this another treasure trove, as I have.  Sometimes you have to give his music a few more than one or two listens before it grabs hold, but once it does, your hooked.  The sounds on this album are subtly (not hugely) different, you will hear things that sound familiar but are craftily engaging and auraly honed on an almost imperceptible scale.  This was the beauty of Partch's instrumental inventions.  Like oriental and Indian music, the tones and scales are measurably different but they invoke a dreamy substance that is at once enjoyable and influential.  What you end up with is a Paul Simon album that sounds astral, current, pleasurable, and even instructive.  If he stops here, he will have donated as much as any other artist in music history if not a vast treasures worth more.  Hopefully Paul has more to give us in the future, but this album alone is worth every penny and listening effort for any fan of sonic creations.  Oh and the "deluxe" version is well worth the extra $ as there is no "filler" here, just wonderful tunes to love and enjoy, especially his performance of Duncan (from his first post-S&G solo album) on The Prairie Home Companion radio show, simply stupefying, and a great duet by two founders of Boomer Era music, Paul and Dion musing about their NYC.  Enjoy the music friends!	1
I think perhaps with the commercial & critical success of So Beautiful.. has given Simon the confidence to really push out the boat with this record, though he's never been scared to go against the grain. Reacquainting himself with old cohort from his S&G days Roy Halee,  "Stranger.." is a very rhythmic & percussion based album, filled with unusual time signatures & great Paul Simon lyrics (he even cusses at one point) & according to the liner notes quite a spontaneous song writing approach. The Deluxe version contains, apart from Wristband,  more traditional acoustic based songs, quite a nice contrast to the main album. So another outstanding album, Simon is really on a good run at the moment.	1
Saw his concert in May and it was excellent. I'll keep it simple, this album has a new style while still retaining the Paul Simon sound that we all love and it sounds great. All songs are good but my particular favorite is the album title song Stranger to Stranger. Paul Simon is a master songwriter, so glad he's still going.	1
Papa Bell is cool. Its named after a Negro baseball player from nearly a century ago, led by bouncy island strings and like something from Graceland. The rest of the album is like something from Wasteland. That is to say that the decline of Paul Simon as a songwriter, which began after The Capeman; his best album as far as Im concerned; continues. Its as if hes forgotten how to make good songs, let alone more classics.  Hes still one of my favorite songers, but Id rather him retire than tarnish his legacy any further. Wristband is conceptually akin to The Afterlife from his last album and just as silly. Street Angel brings some interesting hip-hop effects, but structurally the song is a mess. The Werewolf is a grower, but In A Parade never stops sounding stupid. Two short interludes on an album barely over a half-hour long reek of laziness.  He sings of words and melody, but its the latter thats the problem. Paul Simon is still a wordsmith. Its the way he sings those words that, more than anything else, make his new songs mundane. The Capeman mustve robbed him. I can almost count on one hand the good songs hes released since then. Cool Papa Bell is one of them, yes, but good songs on a Paul Simon album are supposed to be the rule, not the exception.  marcellee.com	-1
Paul Simon has made a magnificent album, a mosaic of sounds, one songs that somehow always broadly the wide space of your music. In a first I listen I could seem somewhat discursive but in the end you realize that it is a dense and magnificent work. Arrangements of every song is a gem in itself, sounds flowing without interruption with a complexity only available to very few musicians. If anything defines the CD is precisely the amount of sound that is capable of combining. There is everything and everything good. Since typical ballads Simon, Stranger to Stranger for example, songs that address new and uncharted territories. It is an unpredictable album, fragmented into thousands of visions, as indicated by its cover. extraordinary service of a complex project musicians. Extrordinaria great work that brings us back to Paul Simon excessive and at full maturity. Magica production and especially mixtures. Beautiful and amazing PD.

Its catchy, its fun but its loaded with typical rappers vulgar lyrics. "Put my D in her P till she feels it in her toes" C'mon Lil Yachty - your on the biggest stage of the world, you can express epic feelings or shed light on humanities problems to inspire change but instead you telling the world you think with your D and you hit it " grezz-ali" - so lame. But the music is great. The lyrics man, they are just getting dumber and dumber	1

It has really became clear to me that Jennifer Lopez has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade. Not only for her own work, but she sadly has had some of the worst work for the past several years. While she might have pleased some from her On The 6 days, she had really taken her own turn for the worst, since her Love? album back in 2010, and she failed to ignite from her sound back in the late 90's. Now she is trying to be like the 90's all over again, and this love did cost a thing. It actually shows that she had not been able to ignite in the fire she says she is putting on. Ain't Your Mama feels more like a joke that she will never be able to ignite musically ever again. Jennifer Lopez really has showed again that she is a failure when making better choices in music to grow with her own sound. Just like Loubutons and Fresh Out The Oven, and her A.K.A. album which was a lemon, Jennifer Lopez doesn't want to grow up in her music, but stay a little girl in sound. She might not be your mama, but Jennifer Lopez isn't really good in music or career moves.  Song: D-	-1
Love this song and love jlo	1
Something new for Jennifer, classic and very up beat. Loved IT....	1
Love this song	1
I don't understand why this song is hated by a lot of people, yes it was directed by Dr. Luke (and I don't like him for the Ke$ha incident) but so what? It's still an amazing song! It's a feminist anthem that I love, and I'm a guy who is not a major feminist. Jennifer Lopez is not one of my favorite artists but this song is just outstanding to me.	1
Great song and video!!	1
Music like this continues to dumbify the minds of young people, especially females.  If you can't put out decent music, and you're looking to make a quick buck on the expense of young minds... you're not a musician.  You're a media controlled entertainer.	-1
What turned out to be Volume I of a series (3 so far) of chamber music boxes from the Bach Guild concentrates on the Romantics and late 19th Century nationalists.  We have Schubert, Brahms (the 3 Piano Quartets), Dvorak, Borodin & Bruckner, the last represented by his rarely heard String Quintet.  Some of the Schubert (e.g., "Death & the Maiden") are the same performances that were issued in the Schubert Box several years ago but I find the Schubert String Quintet here, as performed by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, markedly superior to the one in the Big Schubert Box which, in any event, now costs $9.49, not 99 cents.  Similarly, the Brahms Piano Quartets were also included in the Big Brahms Box of 2012.  Still, when there's this much music of this quality, I don't mind a few duplications.  Between the three chamber Big Boxes and some of the composer specific boxes, we have a pretty good survey of chamber music from Haydn to Berg but there are still some gaps.  Where are the Brahms String Quartets, or quartets by Mendelssohn, anything by Franck or Faure, or the Schumann Piano Quartet or Piano Quintet.  How about it, Bach Guild?	1
These Big Box deals are the best thing I've found on Amazon. 50 to 100 track albums of quality music for a fair price.	1
This box is a wonderful place to start hearing some of the classics of chamber music. It contains the Schubert String Quintet, the Trout Piano Quintet, and the Death in the Maiden String Quartet. The collection also contains Dvorak's American Quartet, Borodin's Second Quartet, and the three Brahms Piano Quartets. Please see the Amazon website for a complete list of the music.  The pieces I have listed are beloved by chamber music fans. This is a wonderful chance to hear great music that costs you very little. The sound quality is very acceptable. The performances are from good to great.	1
Great value, price lots of music	1
I like to have a background of classical music, not for serious or critical attention, but for a pleasant sound environment. The series of which the collection of chamber music is a part ideally serves my purpose at a modest cost. For my purposes, the product could hardly be better.	1
Excellent recordings of some of the very best chamber music from the romantic period. There are many standard works here by Brahms, Dvorak and Schubert; all very well played. There are also some selections that music buffs may not have heard ; Bruckner's string quintet and Dvorak's Cypresses. I have several Bach Guilds compilations. This one is the best. I have been playing it constantly.	1
Great music collection.	1
Truly an enjoyable collection of music by small ensembles. I was not familiar with the Dvorak Cypresses, but it is a really charming work. All the performances are top notch, the recorded sound superior. What a treat to find such notable performances by name brand musicians at such a bargain price. Thank you!	1
Don't you hate when your honest review gets rejected for some odd reason? Even stranger, when you give the product a passing grade?! To take it a step further, how does one rate  art/ music, when it's really up to the person to decide if it's enjoyable or not? I'm at a loss. I enjoy listening to this cd, that's all I know.	1
I had the seen the Avett Brothers on a PBS show but hadn't followed their music much, till I saw them on the Megan Kelly show and was inspired once again to listen to the stories in their songs. Loved it so much sent it as a gift to my son.	1
Excellent musicians Highly recommend	1
Love it!	1
A different sound for AB. I like it but I like some of their other CDs better. Not enough slow, melodic pieces on this collection.	1
Wife loves it.	1
Concord NC contribution to great music have scored again. The amazing talent of this group is incredible. Love it.	1
What's there new to say after all the other reviews.  This is the best Avett Bros album, better than Carpenter.  I've listened to it dozens of times and still seem to find something new each time with the words, the music or the musicianship.  So many emotions rolled into one album - happiness, sadness, awe.  Can hardly wait for their next work of art.	1
Not their best CD but still very good	1
A really good album for the Avett Brothers.	1
Good stuff	1
Great CD.  Every thing the Avett Bros do is golden.	1
Probably more like 3 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.  If you are new to these great musicians, start with "I and Love and You"...you won't be disappointed.  It is starting to look to me like that album will stand as their masterpiece.  Having said that, I DO like it when bands experiment and try new things, and here it works on some songs, and doesn't on others (Satan Pulls the Strings is so good live...what did they do with it here? Sheesh).  There are quite a few slow tempo Avett songs here, so the pacing isn't great, but the slow songs are beautifully done.  I definitely agree with some of the other reviewers here who suggest that the Avetts ought to try a different producer (enough Rick Rubin already).  It would be interesting to see what someone else would do with these songs.  Anyway, it's a really good album and even with a few missteps on here it is better than 90% of the "Top 40."	1
It's hard to tell specifically what the goal was here. While not outright pop music, this album has so much going on that it's like they tried to cover every conceivable base. What happens is confusion and sensory overload, and nothing sticks.  I really think they should just stop working with Rick Rubin. His approach does absolutely nothing for them anymore, it's unfortunate but this band has stagnated and nothing here is worth listening to more than a few times.  Just a terrible record with very little energy left.	-1
Good Music	1
I love Musiq's music!	1
7 out of 14 ain't bad...similar to Beyonce self title album that I gave a four. This get's a 4 also."Who's To Say" is a good bonus tracc that saved this album from a 3 rating.	1
Nice to see Musiq go back to the sound that made us love his music. The entire album is awesome. The king of Neo Soul is back	1
I just got a chance to listen to complete album.this is going to be a classic	1
These guys are really talented. They go heavy on the bass rhythm without drowning everything else out. They create an amazing deep sound that's just hypnotic. Then they lay down a vocal track on top of that that's just brilliant at times. I really enjoyed this, and this isn't even typically my style of music.  I don't think this is for everyone. I think there are people who are going to honestly hate this. But I encourage everyone to at least try it even if its not your typical cup of tea. It might just hook you.  Take it From Me opens the album in a way that literally forces you to get up and move. I defy you to sit still when this is playing. It's just energizing. It makes you want to get up and accomplish something.  The World Would Run Better particularly stood out to me too. It's got a great sound and brilliant lyrics. Like really brilliant lyrics that highlight the insanity of individuals thinking the world should run the way they feel it should, and how that simply doesn't work on a planet with 7 billion individual opinions.  Autocorrect is another song that really stands out as lyrical brilliance. On the surface it's all about having your brain physically plugged into the internet. On a deeper level it's got some pretty serious philosophy going on. And it's all set to some great energetic music.  Where I Belong was the only track that didn't thrill me. It was the music. Somehow the band wasn't hitting it's stride with the sound they made.  Again, I don't think everyone is going to like this. But I think everyone should try it out. As musicians these guys are amazing.	1
This was a gift for my wife for Christmas. She likes the CD and has become a Kongos fan.	1
Good cd.  Nice to find newer bands that are actually good.	1
Didn't have the same dirty southern rock feel as Lunatic, more of a slick tone and focus on hooking up.  Perfectly understandable given what the band has been through over the past few years.  For me, the album suffers for it, but it is still enjoyable overall.	1
Kongos are a great band!	1
Not nearly as good indie rock as their previous release! Still, I liked several of the tracks that weren't singles! Thanx!	1
Inspiring.  Sounds like and anthem.	1
Very good music	1
Exactly as expected - arrived quick worked great.	1
Love it.	1
Awesome song from an awesome movie.	1
I enjoy this song.	1

I'm a fan of this song.	1
Music to my ears!	1
Movie sucks , song was great though	1

Great song	1
Great Song.	1
Another song from Pink that Rox. I was out doing yard work one day and this song came on, I was shocked when I found out who sung it. I had to wright it down ASAP. As soon as I got done I looked it up on Amazon, and purchased it. It has a great beat and the lyrics are excellent. I am one who grew up on the 70's, and  80's music; but I would recommend this hit to anyone.	1
Love it	1
Love Pink!	1
Great Song	1
I like the beat	1
Pink is awesome	1

Great vocals and beat.	1
THis is my JAM! Awesome Song	1

great. So P!nk.	1
One her best songs	1
Excellence...	1
Another hit song by P!no. Good to job to.	1
Catchy!	1
No complaints.	1
Pink always delivers a great song and this another amazing one	1
Love it!  Pink strikes again!	1
music is sooooo lazy these days, catchy for a time or two then turns to mush	-1
Not a huge fan of the song itself,  but if you're a DJ or play live you must have this song due to the nature of the whole Mannequin thing.	-1
Didn't really like the album	-1
So this isn't a terrible record but let's be honest: it's not very good. I don't hear a lot of Matt Skiba in these songs but that's okay. Mark and Travis are good songwriters on their own (I really enjoyed their +44 album). But you know who I do hear a lot of here? John Feldman. And that's a problem. How has John Feldman become an in demand producer/ songwriter? His band Goldfinger were notorious trend hoppers without the good taste of writing memorable songs. As a producer he scrubs all the dirt from any song and then fills every empty space with generic, bland "whoa-oh' vocals, assuming that's melody or memorable songwriting. There are a few decent songs here and there but not enough to recommend this album.	-1
Get the band back together this is polished and bloated with catchy hook choruses and repeat the formula in other words this is going to be popular. It sounds manufactured because it probably is everybody is in their forties and well punk rock doesn't pay the bills. I think this album is a disappointment but the last few have been.	-1
No good	-1
awful.  please stop making music.	-1
Sounds like I need to do drugs to listen to this electronically manipulated song... I don't do drugs.  Sorry.	-1
Awfully Bad	-1
It is so sad that whenever someone is talented, they really throw their voice away, and no longer show that they were once talented, and instead scared with strife and heartbreak. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those "products" that has stopped showing her own voice. Instead, she has been forced to severely overexpose herself, where other artists haven't even been able to deliver in sound and soul from the voice within. It is too sad that Beyonce' Knowles has been such a joke, that her voice tragically died over a decade ago, after she and Destiny's Child broke up. A few years ago, when she came out with a surprise record in 2013, it really has been more of a joke, and showed that she does not want to flex her vocals into higher territory. Her 2016, "surprise, not surprise joke" album Lemonade has been another disaster, focusing in on a scarred heart, with a upcoming split between her and Jay-Z whom had cheated on her. Most of the tracks were pathetic and Sorry, her latest single from the album is another weak song from her.. The song is chinsy, cheap, and is another faded joke in song. She really hasn't grown up enough. With more bad songs like this, I'd say to Beyonce' Knowles, retire from music and start her life over again. She has a lot of scars from her breakup with Jay-Z that need more healing than her career could show. Another failure.  Song: D	-1
It is so sad that someone young and talented has became more of a product, than a real songstress. Unfortunately for Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more of a product than a real singer. It is so sad because she hasn't even made music that spoke from the soul, and instead tried to pull out another surprise as a product, than the person on the inside. Her Lemonade album has been more like a joke than a stand. Sadly though, she has shown some real cracks unveiled in her personal life. I didn't find the song Formation to impress me at all, and it was more of a joke than a real stand. Sorry, her latest single from Lemonade really takes shots at the two men in her life, her estranged husband Jay-Z and her separated father Matthew Knowles, for cheating on her, and her mother Tina. I found the song to be very poor at soul and didn't impress me at all, and shows that Beyonce' Knowles still hasn't grown as a singer. Perhaps she should take a listen to Gwen Stefani and what she made as a album about being cheated on before hers came out. Sorry is a bust, and Beyonce' Knowles should consider retiring.  Song: D	-1
I don't know... is she singing?  Is she rapping?  Or more like talking with repetitive folk music in the background. Not real music, in my opinion. But, it's "Beyonce"... so it don't matter, right?	-1
It is so sad whenever we have a artist become so overexposed, that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside. The tragic truth about Beyonce' Knowles is that she is a product, not even a singer. Her albums have been so poor, that she does not impress me anymore. Now, with the oversaturation she had endured with making Lemonade, many people wonder if it was worth it, and tragically it is not worth it at all. The album in itself has been her lowest performing in not just sales, but airplay as well, since the failure of 4. Beyonce's latest single is more of heartbreak in regards to her marriage with Jay-Z, and also the failure of her mom, Tina's marriage ending in divorce, after Matthew Knowles cheated on Tina, and fathered a child out of wedlock. Hold Up, the third single from Lemonade, is the exact same and so-called heartfelt feeling of being taken for granted at the affair of the heart. But tragically, Beyonce Knowles fails to impress at the soul of the song. She really felt more spooked at the essence in her voice, but overall it really does not work at every note. If you're new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back to Crazy In Love, and trust me it feels better than the wasted heart of Hold Up.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
awful.	-1
It is absolutely so sad that Beyonce' Knowles has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record, and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a songstress whom has been more of a stunt, than just letting her voice speak for itself. It is sad, because she has not been making really good songs, but borrowing the same stunts and overexposure hat artists like Michael Jackson and the recently deceased Prince have had for years. But they have really had some excellent songs that have stood the test of time. Unfortunately, Beyonce has not been able to do that. When I first heard her song Formation a few months ago, I honestly would have to say that I really was dearly unimpressed with where her music was going. It fell flat like the soul passing on. I really found this song to be her worst dance anthem since Partition. She really put out all they hype for # Lemonade, for nothing but a sour lemon. This should go into the same place Rihanna's Work has been, tired and worn out.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
Another bad song from a boring artist.	-1
Because it's "Beyonce", people buy it... even when the song is untalented garbage.  Don't believe me?  Pretend it's someone else, would you buy it?  Of course not.  I never hate, I always congratulate... but this one does not deserve one. Truth.	-1
It is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone whom is young and talented has thrown their own voice away, by making music that really doesn't ignite from the heart, and instead hears exactly what they had heard before. Unfortunately, for Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more of a product than a real songstress at the soul. Somberly, she had been through a lot in her personal life from Jay-Z cheating on her, and having a child out of wedlock. Also, her own music has failed to ignite with her controversial performance at the Super Bowl, which overshadowed Coldplay's delightful recognition at the halftime show of the Super Bowl. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has also lagged at the soul. Beyonce's song Formation, the lead song from her so-called # lemonade doesn't ignite, and in fact sounds wimpy from the soul. She doesn't ignite in song at all, and somberly Beyonce' Knowles misses the soul in her work. She really wanted to make a controversial song which worked, and instead it falls flat on deaf ears for new and die hard fans. Maybe it is time for Beyonce' Knowles to stop trying to be like what Michael Jackson did as stunts for promoting his work, and instead she should try and be a vocal diva that shows more from the inside, which Mrs. Carter doesn't have anymore. Vocal formation.  Song: D-	-1
This is the album that never should have been made, a HUGE flop and the once King of the charts can sell no records no more!	-1
Oh man , I had a feeling that this song sucks sucks sucks big time! You'll never be good as mj and you'll never will be.	-1
If I was a 100% Drake fan, I would feel totally insulted that after a very good IYRTITL album and pretty good banger-filled WATTBA mixtape, that he puts out this underwhelming mess. I've been hear only the stanniest of Drake stans praise this album as some transcending genre-bending album, but all it is is a terribly mediocre, formulaic, water-down version of Take Care. It's almost embarrassing to even listen to. There's literally 4 tracks...4....FOUR tracks worth anything. Views, 9, Faithful, and......wow, I can't even think of the other song, that's how forgettable this album is, that even the good tracks aren't even all that. The rest of the album is filled with corny haiku-like ballads, reggae riddims that would sound better if they weren't so forced, and overall WEAK production. Drake should be embarrassed for feeding this album to his fans, and the worst part about it is they all eat it up and shoot it to the top of the charts, forcing upcoming artists to attempt to make the same type of garbage he put on on here. This HAS to be the least replay value worth album in Drake's entire catalog, which is a shame for such a popular artist.	-1
Drake has a standard style to all his songs.  It usually involves him trying to be soft-spoken ladies man trying to woo his next conquest.  He often incorporates an atypical music component and, sometimes, has a featured female singer.  "One Dance" has all those 'Drake-ian' elements to it and the result is uninspiring.  The heavy-duty Drake fans won't listen to such blasphemy (after all, they did push it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100), but an objective analysis has to be honest.    Drake's chosen musical component is an odd, auto-tuned series of exotic horns that seem over-produced.  While this part is mediocre, the real shortcoming is featured singer, Kyla.  While Kyla appears to have been around for several years and has had some success in the industry, her contribution to "One Dance" is just bad.  Her 'verses' simply do not match the flow of the song.  They are slow and disjointed and she is also trying too hard to be sexy.	-1
drake kind of song	-1
I like Radiohead and own some of their other albums, but this one is meh.  I was drawn to the album by one of the songs I heard on a movie.  I should have downloaded only that song.  Live and learn.	-1
Boring, uninspired, derivative, lacking ideas and just overall sad. This is what's become of them. You saw it coming. Especially when they attempted to borrow some electronic soundscape and effects type stuff reminiscent of Aphex Twin, you knew the road would be bleak for a rock band to try to live in that space. And here it is. Yeah sure it's Radiohead, I suppose, only because Yorke's voice is there, but remove that and what do you have? Sounds like anybody out there, you have to be honest. This stuff is pass, but as I was saying, once you dip your feet into the soundscapes of Aphex Twin type electronic ambient and effects type stuff, you might just go there all the way and get rid of the singing. And you'll end up at Boards of Canada and that type of stuff, even The Orb, and then onto John Hopkins. I'm surprised people aren't tired of Yorke's whining. Takes energy to shake off this cloud, to go back to a more rocking sound away from the ambient laziness of this album. Lets see if they can.	-1
Ive gotta admit that after La Gargola, which probably became my favorite Chevelle release, I was anxious for what The North Corridor was going to bring. My anticipation turned to disappointment upon my first listen. There was far too much CLONG-CLONGCLONG-CLONG-CLONG bass and Petes singcreaming stripped songs of any nuance. After a few more listens I can say that TNC has grown on me, but not much. The album is a blisterer and the nuances are there but they're buried pretty good. The overbearing power chords, punk rock drums, the monotonous bass lines, and that singcreaming! It beats you over the head pretty relentlessly. Its Chevelle, tightly wound. I like it when they're a little looser, allow some quieter moments to carry you into heavier moments, focus on some longer melodies, and have Pete screaming a lot less. If I was grading this after the first listen it would have been a 2 star, leaning toward 1. After listening to it a few more times over a few different speaker systems I can appreciate the music more, I certainly hear more of second guitar lines that imbue the songs with that much more interest (like on Young Wicked) but its simply not all that prominent throughout this release, and the music creeps my rating up to a 3 star but the singcreaming just ruins it altogether this time around. All in all a still disappointing 2.5 stars. I won't be listening to this one much.	-1
This album is not de la. It's a compisition of artists they're cool with n de la soul eg gorrillaz. Album feels lost. Like De la soul, pick up some their earlier work trust! Whooedinni ft 2chainz go hard n pain ft snoop for me.	-1
Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.  Usually I like when Jackyl do cover versions, but even "Everyone's a winner" here is a song that is just meh, not a song I liked before and still don't. The only track that seemed to have anything going for it was the final one, but then again, how many times is Jessie Dupree going to try and write the same song? Enough with the "Rev it up and go" already. The same can be said for "Just because i'm drunk"... it's just a watered down version of "Secret of the bottle".  I don't get why some have already said "Rally" is a favorite of theirs? The song sounds silly with lyrics "Rally, Rally, Rally, Uga, Chugga, Ugga Chugga"... really? Was this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that 20 year old dancing baby animation thing? Not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sounds out of place together.  This album has failed to rock me, roll me or jackly me off in any way. Sure, the production is good, but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish. The attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesn't seem right for Jackyl. It sounds more like them trying anything to keep current, and thats not why fans stick with them.  I haven't given up hope, and think Jackyl can still bounce back, but they sure are not the same band they once where. They really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of albums great. Nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a Jackyl classic.	-1
I guess if you're a devil worshiper then this band is for you.	-1
Muddy, blurry are just two of the words to describe how this was recorded.  I thought there was something wrong with my speakers.  Nope - the vocals throughout the entire CD are like this.  How could they even think this was a good enough to release?  Granted, it was recorded in 1986.  The technology was available to record vocals correctly.  It sounds like they held a microphone up and hoped for the best.  The reason I gave it two starts vice one is that the song choice was pretty good and the band sounded ok considering.  Again - horrible vocal recordings.  Save your money.	-1
To All : do yourself a favor and get the 2 disc UK version "Bob Dylan and Tom Petty Across the Borderline" on Amazon UK. I bought it for just under $18.00 USD includes postage. You get 31 songs on 2 discs for a total running time of 161 minutes. A great deal and well worth the few extra bucks compared to the domestic release. Don't know why the format is different, really goofy marketing. C'mon Amazon USA  your sister in the UK beat you on this one.	-1
not a fan previous album way better	-1
one recording too many.  sad.  sorry E.	-1
Stay there, down in  a hole.  I have heard several songs from this CD.  So no I did not purchase it and after listening to those song selections I would not purchase it.  One star for an actor thinking he can be a music star as well.  Then he goes with the best chance of succeeding music: country.  I think Robert downey Jr. released a CD a few years back.  It must be nice to get overpaid for a 4 month shoot on a film and then invest in yourself.  That is what I heard from this CD.  I invest in myself.  Have some more whiskey Reefer Sutherland.  Hey what ever happened to the Bacon Brothers?  Early David Cassidy puts them to shame.	-1
Worst LP or CD they have ever put out. I have all their music & have loved it all till now. By the way , I have seen them in concert 3 times. No excuse for going political. It's one thing to insert something political in a storyline. It's another to be lectured by a bunch of stupid Liberal Musicians for the entire CD. Give me Skynyrds God, Guns & Country anyday of the week. They have just lost me as a fan after at least 15 years. Get back to Muscle Shoals & grow up! Very very sad.	-1
DJ Khaled is terrible, and can't even eat hot wings. Drake cries all the time. Pass.	-1
Boring and unmemorable, perfect this CGI-laden mess	-1
The lesson here might be to stay away from records produced by Paul Butler. Don't know for sure that he's to blame, but what else accounts for songs that seem to have funky R&B potential buried in them but emerge from the studio mired in a sonic morass of indistinguishable mediocrity?  The second track manages to rise above it on the strength of a killer guitar line and syncopated arrangements that play off it, but much of the rest of the album gives the impression that after exerting themselves on that cut, the band and producer just didn't have the strength, or care enough, to put the same effort into other cuts. And its not like the potential isn't there. The band and producer need to get their Sly and Terrence Trent D'Arby records out, go back to the woodshed and figure out what makes R&B music great.	-1
This soundtrack album has about 3 songs with replay value. The rest are pretty lame. CCR, imagine dragons, and twenty one pilots made decent contributions, but the remaining songs are either remakes or mindless wanna be ghetto nonsense.	-1
I realize what caused the "panic" at the disco: it's called an inferior band, in every way, tried to do a cover of a Queen classic, and in the process soiled and disrespected the original. This is a pathetic effort.	-1
Enjoyed the snippet of the song that I heard in the movie, and so decided (while I was picking and choosing what tracks to get from the album) to pick up this one.  It is not my usual style, and destined to stay at the bottom of my playlists, but that's what I get to for not listening to it all the way through prior to purchase.	-1
I enjoyed the songs played throughout the movie. A few of them are here, but most seem to be replaced. Not a fan of the crummy rap version of "You don't own me"...it's not original and is annoying. Just a cheap ride on Grace's coattails.	-1
God Imagine Dragons are a one hit wonder that have not gone away.	-1
This is ordered by mistake-was not what I wanted!	-1
There are sometimes songs that are worth being remixed and sampled that they are better later on. But in the case with covering a song today, it can be as bigger or smaller than when the song had originally came out. Fall Out Boy has had a nice return to the industry a few years ago with Centuries and Uma Thurman. But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song, I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard. In fact, it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80's. Fall Out Boy's version of the Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago. It is not only a poor remake, but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say, "Boy, did I waste my time on this song!" The guys from Fall Out Boy did better covers before, like their rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It several years ago. You're better off downloading the original, or the original sample from 1984. This version is definitely not worth the money!!  Song: F	-1
Not Black Sabbath.  The classic Iommi riffs are great but the vocal performance of the classic Sabbath songs is very weak and the Tont Martin era songs are really weak all around.

No you didn't bring sexy back. Just desperate to keep your music career going. The song is overrated & way overplayed. You can stop making music and movies all together. Please stop your terrible !	-1

This song doesn't sound good I want my money back.	-1
This is absolutely atrocious. I was hoping this was a mono mix of this timeless classic, but I was wrong. You can prove it by inverting one of the channels and then setting them both to mono. If it were mono, everything would cancel out, but this one doesn't. What a joke.	-1
this is not the original it is a remake probably for some legal ownership reasons or some such bull. Complete crap. sorry i dowloaded it without listening first. i feel ripped off!	-1
Remastered, squashed, rearranged?  Did someone alter the space-time continuum?  Are we still in Vietnam?  Avoid this at all costs, and purchase "Turn Up The Radio" from album Sign In Please, below.	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1

Part 2 is pretty unnecessary. Just go get Part 1, and you'll be better for it.	-1
I have to agree with another reviewer, Michael.  While the song is one of my Beach Boys favorites, this particular remaster sounds very tinny (even by Capitol Records' standards).  The outer ranges are piqued too high and the mid is shoved way down, over-emphasizing the vocal spread and making the instrumentals sound jarring as they move between ranges.	-1
Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.	-1

love music and work in Music Publishing, I do not like only.playing this on computer.  Not phone or play on CD in car or stereo	-1
Muted sound, not a good version. Too quiet. I had to buy another version to get good sound, not impressed.	-1
When I first heard Here Comes The Hammer was the video ,IT Rocked ! So I bought the song different as night and day . If you are not a Hammer fan stay away from this product .	-1
this 12" extended version it has odd extra music that is just bad. Like the original version.  The band is great and tthe song is rockin' but not this version.	-1
OK	-1
Not the full version.	-1
I downloaded this because it gets stuck in my head all the time. Its not good. If you haven't heard it, don't start now. Its a pop classic, with breathy vocals and lame creepy lyrics.	-1
I don't know where all these songs went... There gone.	-1
Didn't mean to purchase this song.	-1
AAAAAAA	-1
Love the song, been looking for it for years...however was very disappointed in the tract I purchased...it skipped...a lot.	-1
Sound quality was not that good with this download.	-1
had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!! 2 other CDs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!	-1
Moderately good to the ears.  Lyrics are too cryptic to be appreciated.	-1
too expensive	-1
Nothing in the description said it was a remake.  The original was a classic, but this variant is completely forgettable.	-1
this song is awful	-1
I ordered the wrong song.	-1
Don't get me wrong, the Song is AMAZING... But I've downloaded NUMEROUS tracks from this sight and NEVER had much of an issue. THIS TIME though, there were issues with my payment method- which hasn't changed at all - then the song WOULD NOT  download....   A little advice to everyone downloading music on this site who ISN'T using their CLOUD PLAYER - download it illegally... Much less B-S and you won't be disappointed  (much).	-1
oldie tune	-1
Elton had cut his ties with his old band in hopes that this would inspire a fresh approach. Unfortunately that didn't work in his case. I bought this in the late seventies when I was hoping that he might enjoy a return to form. No such luck.  The instrumental "Song For Guy" is the highlight and is the sole representation for this album on Elton's 4CD box set. "Part Time Love" was a pleasant enough single for the radio stations that secretaries put on to get them through the workday. Of the rest, only "Shooting Star" might be of note.  There are thousands of great albums waiting to be discovered out there. Unless someone is determined to consume every album issued by Elton John, "A Single Man" is better left to history. I know my copy went to the used record store, not to be replaced by a CD version.	-1
As the title, cover art, and certain lyrics (read: all the lyrics) imply, this is a breakup record. The difference is that the breakup in question was not a romantic one (or at least I don't think so), but an artistic one - this is the first Elton John album without Bernie Taupin adding lyrics! Gary Osbourne provides them instead, and where Taupin is blindingly misogynistic, Osbourne is sickeningly obvious - honestly, if I hear one more song that contains the lyric "Playin' with my heart!" (i.e. "It Ain't Gonna be Easy"), I will get a bunch of other people who are sick of that lyric together and file a class-action suit against every songwriter who ever used the term, which means a lot of money would exchange hands. The good news is that, musically speaking it's still Elton, and Elton melodies and arrangements were always spot-on - indeed, the strings, guitar, and vibes on "It Ain't Gonna be Easy" are no exception to this rule. All it needs is better lyrics. Sadly, a lot of the "rockers" are bitter pills to swallow: "I Don't Care" is drenched in "good-time" synths; "Part Time Love" seems forced and has a dated guitar tone; "Big Dipper" sounds too much like "Suzie (Dramas)"; "Madness" is the closest Elton's come to arena-rock, and I'm glad he never came anywhere near again. Elton's better off when he sticks with balladeering, on gospel-influenced tracks such as "Shine on Through" and "Georgia" (with the famed Brit referring to it as "his home" - ha! Stupid Gary Osbourne. Was he from Georgia?). And, well... wait a sec? What was I doing praising the ballads? "Shooting Star" is a flaming bag of crap left on Taupin's doorstep! But the synth-drenched beauty of the instrumental "Song for Guy" sure isn't a bag of crap! It's a bit long, but still all right. Unlike most the rest, which is not all right at all.	-1
not rly a fan of a guy that sounds like hes still going thru puberty	-1
This "remaster" is HORRIBLE!!! How this can even be put up for sale is pretty shameful. The music is pushed so far back and tinny while the lead vocals are in your face and backing muffled and far away. Just bad bad bad.	-1
Crap	-1
Crappy, over glorified, annoying, whispered noise.  I never saw the appeal of this crap, twenty years later it still sounds like garbage.  Johnny cash must have been looking for a trendy hit before he died when he covered this junk.	-1
A great slow song.  I loved this slow song when I was a teen in high school.  I think it came out immediately after "If I Ever..."  I thought the tall one was sooooooo fiiiiiiine!!!  Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.  Their tenor and baritone voices are great in this song.  It's a classic.  They remind me of the guys from "The Platters," I think that's my grandparents generation.	-1
I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off. No; I would not recommend this to my friend.	-1
I would like my money back	-1
This is a horrid version of an amazing single. Remixes are supposed to be improvements on songs, also, this should specify whether it is the radio version of the song or the remix. I would never have bought this version.	-1
If you want the original version of "One Thing Leads To Another," you won't get it here	-1
there is no need to listen to music in the sense that music is garbage nowadays. no music is better than music.	-1
Bought it for a friend. Not a fan	-1
Actually I bought this song I GET WEAK, CIRCLES IN THE SAND, and HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH because I was missing my dead brother and he really liked these songs of hers and it brought back some good memories of him.	-1

This song is hate speech. Threats abound. "God's gonna cut you down"  There is no god. The only hell we have here is what is created by religionists.  This is religious propaganda and hate speech.	-1
Poor quality...but great song!	-1
Meh.	-1
A stupid repetitious song.  Real Downer.  I may shoot the finger at Sting for writing and singing this dirge.	-1
If you get an average song and play it and play it ad nauseum it becomes far more lackluster still. I can appreciate quite a few good Sting/Police tunes. But overall, maybe just like The Eagles,Aerosmith, and Springsteen, The Police was just one of those groups who garnered maybe far more fame than it deserved.	-1
Not club nouveau....... this is the Timex Social Club. Don't buy it!!!!!	-1

Well I'm writing this review to improve Amazon's algorithm on recommended music on my account.  This is going to be brutal. To be clear I'm a Rivethead/Prog Metal Fan.  Which means if it doesn't have a seven string guitar  thrash line supported by an atmospheric synth line. Don't bother.  Dude.... yuk. Like my stomach really churned when I hit the chorus. Not bad mastering, I guess. Yeah gross. I don't even want to be friends...	-1
Remade, NOT the original!	-1
Was looking for the original this isn't it	-1
I downloaded this track by accident. This is the live version of the song. I wanted the original studio version.	-1
I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.	-1

Despite what is said, it is not the radio version.  It starts out really bad and doesn't get much better.  The good version is on the "Blacklist" soundtrack.  The only problem with that is you have to buy the entire album.	-1
Too much repetition the whole song will tick you off after a couple times listening. This is the rhythm of the night was echoing in my ears as i dreamed that night.	-1

i'd like to find a cd of this cringeworthy cover and defecate on it! Ever heard Ringo Starr's superior version of the same song on Vertical Man w. guest vocals by Alanis Morrissette?? Uncle Stale-A$$ Krackhead should've heard Ringo's version first and ...out of respect to a "real" artist, decided not to release his boring, redundant version of the song...	-1
song	-1
its ok I guess	-1
love it but ordered twice	-1
Does anyone even know the REAL song??? This is just a generic dance song compared to the superior, more conscious and politically defiant original. I used to blast it as a radio dj in college until somehow I guess the record label virtually erased it from all airwaves. Political correctness and radio friendly garbage. Smh. Sean Paul wrote a great song and someone made him ruin it!	-1
Eric may not be God, but he was close. Iwish I was grooving to this album, but I never got it. I'm all hung down.	-1

just a filler song i guess	-1
Don't download just this song, you only get the tail end when they are singing the "do do du dupe" part.	-1
If you like Jeff Foxworthy you'll like his treatment of this Christmas classic. This is why we watch and listen to him,i.e., because he's talented.  This song is proof.	-1

UPDATED REVIEW: This review is similar to one I will write for a number of new albums and is essentially a statement.  It seems that more and more record labels are choosing NOT to include digital downloads with vinyl purchases which I think is absolutely unacceptable given that the cost of the album on vinyl is usually more than *double* that of a CD or straight digital download, and because recording a vinyl to digital format is a bit of a pain when compared to ripping a CD. I was happy years ago when more and more labels began offering digital downloads with the purchase of a record, but that seems to have changed with the popularity of vinyl again increasing steadily. When you factor in that the cost of vinyl has been increasing right along with that popularity with no added benefits other than the label receiving more money then I get angry. Of the past 4 albums I've purchased, 3 have not included a digital tracks from lables Shanachie Entertainment, Not Now Music, and even freaking RCA.  My apologies for the 2-star review, but this needs to change. Not Now Music should offer a digital download and I"ll revise my review to reflect the album rather than what I did not receive. I'm just tired of this and will simply resort to streaming or pirating album releases that don't provide what has become expected and standard in the past decade, simple as that. If hosting and bandwidth resources are at the crux of these cutbacks then just include a simple paper-sleeved CD instead as some labels have done for quite a while. And, if that is still too much cost, forgo the "fashionable" heavy weight, double LP release for a simple, more cost-effective single LP release. Double LP, 120g albums are almost always unnecessary anyway and take up too much space on my shelf let alone having to flip the record twice as often.  Here ends my rant. I'm not going to buy albums at these prices any longer if this is the direction we're heading. At double or TRIPLE the price of a CD, digital tracks are nothing but a courtesy. Period.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Near Perfection - One of my favorite collections in any genre, from any artist. The 3 LP vinyl is gorgeous and masterfully done. Whoever rated this one star for not being a 'live' album should be banned from Amazon.	-1
Again, I had this downloaded but it did not come with the rest of them.  I keep downloading all 5 songs but 2 of them never make to me.  I have never had this happen before.	-1
Yep, Madonna has been a has been for a long time. I give her kudos for being a shrewd old shrew in a business sense and also applaud her incessant bids at staying relevant in the entertainment business, which is by nature a fickle beast, with a lingering loyalty only to the almighty dollar. Madonna did this with electronica producer William Orbit back when electronic music became "the thing". All of a sudden, you've got U2, David Bowie, Perry Farrell, Boy George, everyone, trying to be like Chemical Brothers or Prodigy when they were flavour of the month back in the late 90s and early 2000s. Some artists, like Bowie and U2 succeeded and put out good albums that were electronica flavoured. IMO, Madonna's bid fell flat though.	-1
I didn't order this, no clue how it shows up on my "write a review".	-1
Not a traditional song done by The Flaming Lips? Got it free as a sampler when Amazon MP3 downloads was a section of the Amazon store. It's now called Digital Music.  The vocals are sub-par and so I can't recommend this tune.	-1

song	-1
It consisted of one verse and one chorus. The other 14 minutes were a jam featuring an organ solo by Doug Ingle, a guitar solo by Erik Brann and a drum solo by Ron Bushy. Bassist Lee Dorman got half a duet with Ingle, but Bushy proved with his drum solo that you can get away with repeating "Shave and a Haircut, Six Bits" for a long time. As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen". So when Atco edited out everything but the vocal section, you got three reps each of the verse and refrain. So it didn't make much of a single. Be warned--you're better off with the album.	-1
Lol this sounds like the gay sounding song James Taylor never wrote...Horrible, formulaic dung destined for the elevators and easy listening country pop FM stations of today...	-1

you only get half of the song, when jackson brown did it, it included Stay , someone needs to fix as that is what makes the song.	-1
Unfortunately, this album marks the debut of David Lindley on Jackson Browne albums.  What a disaster!!!!  David Lindley totally ruins this otherwise pretty good album.  His lap steel guitar sounds like finger nails on a chalk board.  He single-handedly ruined many good Jackson Browne songs...	-1
Its Ok.  Not one of my best songs but needed it on my playlist.	-1

song was great BUT Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again.	-1
NEVER DOWN-LOADED EITHER	-1
Do not like it at all!!! another case of the powers that be screwing up a great recording with their remastering and remixing junk. I have the original cassette and the vocal sounds nothing like this one. this digital version also lacks energy. I wish i could get my $1.29 back!	-1

Don't like it at all	-1
I like the song and already had an MP3 of it in stereo.  The reason I bought this was the length of over 5 minutes led me to believe that this was a longer version of the song.  Instead of that, what I got was the same 2 minute and something song in mono followed by another tune.  While it may seem like a bargain to get two songs for the price of one, I was only interested in it because I thought it was a longer version.  It was very diappointing to me.	-1

It is honestly so sad when a artist has became so overexposed, that they haven't been able to shine the way the used to when they were younger. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those artists that has been so severely overplayed, and overexposed like a robot that is too much, that she has just been not worth listening to anymore. The only talent she had was when she was a part of Destiny's Child. But on her own, she has oversaturated the market where it has been too much about her, and no one else. When she was starting to get out on her own, she had one or two songs, but that was it. Her collaborations with her husband though, not even exciting. Her song Deja Vu from her 2005 album B' Day, has not been impressive, trying to recapture the chemistry she one had with him on Crazy In Love, and sadly she does not impress at all. I really did not enjoy the song, and sadly it is not worth listening to, especially when it has been overplayed so many times. If you are really new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back and listen to when she did have talent as a part of Destiny's Child.  Song: D+	-1

Therefore, I've been cheated--perhaps I should have compared the edited version with the original one before purchasing it. If I could, I would request a refund or have Amazon replace it with the longer version.	-1
It's a oldie and now where and nothing like stairway to heaven.  Just want to see / hear the simularaity. Slight rifs at best.	-1
As it turns out someone is upset that they are saying Led Zepplin stole this and morphed it into Stairway to Heaven.  Guess I'm tone deaf because I sure don't hear it.  I have heard Stairway so many stinking times on the Radio my skin crawls,  the skin didn't crawl with Taurus.	-1
When i first heard this i thought it was Aaron Neville. Take That was one of the worst bands spawned by the 90s Britpop movement (Blur, Oasis, Suede et al)	-1
Baught this album because of the preview but some how it doesn't quite sound the same since I've been playing the cd. Can't enjoy this rendition...in my humble opinion the tempo in this version is way too fast!	-1
Crossfade wasn't known for their creativity, and the band didn't change any of that with their follow up album. They found their niche as a mainstream band capable of attracting fans with well-worn renditions of tired rock themes with Ed Sloan's great vocals and a catchy style. For the most part, it fell flat this time around.  I liked Already Gone, and Washing the World Away as well as Falling Away were decent tracks too, but the rest were incredibly weak. Invincible, Someday, were just feeble and the lyrics were not only generic, but pretty embarrassing and pathetic.  Now, I can listen to this album, and mildly enjoy it. If I wanted to, I don't need to skip any songs. But there is much better out there.	-1
I saw this on Zach and Cody and I was like yeah this is my Jam but Jesse is not rad and not popular.	-1
hate it	-1
As much as I liked the Crash Test Dummies and Brad Richard's voice, this album was one that left me flat.  I suppose the album cover itself should have been a warning.  It's as though that chick, and I do mean in the bird-like way, is looking at you thinking, "A-ah!  Another one!"  Worm's Life, like one reviewer said, should have stayed buried.  This is definitely a do-over for me.  Should I ever lose this disc or someone borrows it and doesn't return it, I won't be hunting down a replacement copy.	-1

I was recently in search of the best L'Elisir d'amore that I could find.  Because Pavarotti was admired as the Donizetti tenor par excellence, his two recordings, early and late, were obvious contenders. The Decca version has always been preferred, thanks to the freshness and charisma of Pavarotti's singing - he owned Una furtiva lagrima for decades - but as much as Sutherland is beloved, her Adina is girlish or light; she tries hard to bring the right comic tone, and even her notorious pronunciation is improved - but a second drawback for me is Bonynge's conducting, although he too tries hard to bring rhythmic life to his ordinarily slack style. Of course, the testimony of countless fans sees beyond these limitations - so be it.  The later DG L'elisir corrects the weak points in the earlier with alert, expert conducting by Levine and Battle's utterly charming Adina, her voice and characterization a delight. But Pavarotti! This recording dates from a series of live Met performances that began in 1989 (there's a met release in MP3 at various download sites), and the great tenor's voice had grown creaky  and threadbare - to me, it's painful to hear.  When the lead singer is unacceptable, so is the entire performance. Apparently this isn't the case for the enthusiastic reviewers here, but newcomers should be warned. I bought the set sight unseen and threw it away.	-1

love music and work in Music Publishing, I do not like only.playing this on computer.  Not phone or play on CD in car or stereo	-1
I simply don't understand the hype. Same tired formula seems to be applied to all Beyonc&eacute;'s recorded output. This stinks as bad as her solo work. All you have to do is look at the songwriting credits for the song to see exactly how little talent and songwriting ability Destiny's Child actually has. (Let's see...It was written by Beyonc&eacute;, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Fred Jerkins III, Sean Garrett, and Shawn Corey "Jay-Z" Carter- IT TOOK 8 PEOPLE TO WRITE THIS CRAPPY SONG???? )Geez, it took an army just 2 write 1 WORTHLESS song...	-1
It wasn't the song I was thinking about!	-1

Bad Song!!	-1

It's fun, it's poppy the chorus is energetic but ultimately, the song itself is kinda forgettable.  Katy's a pretty girl and I commend her for writing or co-writing all of her tracks on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/One-of-the-Boys/dp/B0017ZB8M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">One of the Boys</a>, but from what I've heard from the singles, she's got a lot of growing to do.  The upside to this is that she seems to be very down to earth in interviews which I've seen on youtube so that's a plus.  The song is about "Waking Up In Vegas" and kinda being disoriented. Katy loses her fake I.D. and I think her "boyfriend" has lost the room key.  It's OK, but could be better. I prefer Thinking Of You which has substance or even I Kissed A Girl which is more addictive.  2.75 stars.	-1

This song would not play on my cloud on my computer, wouldn't play on my phone. I emailed customer service about it and never heard back. I don't have a problem playing any other song... just this one. This is one of my favorite songs too so I am bummed. Im not going to fight to much for it though since it is only a dollar!	-1
I am a fan of TLC although this song is highly played out now. I mean I think it's in the top 10 most played out top 40 hits of the past 20 years seriously. I can't stand it anymore. I remember when it first came out I LOVED it. But now I'm sick of it. Anytime it comes on the radio I want to turn it. If I'm able to, I probably will. Just not a fan of this song anymore. It's crappy music now.  2 stars.	-1
Bought by mistake.  Not among Kelly's best (check out Ne-Yo's song of the same name).	-1
It's a typical contemporary song. It makes a great high school reunion song. For me it's John Mayer's debut song. "You will know what all this time was for," indicates his confidence in his songs.	-1
Don't get this!!!!	-1
This is overproduced lame a$$ muzak by a dude who thinks he's cool enough to jam with Bob Weir. He's a schlocky, corporate muzak playing goofball. The proof is in this lame-o tune made to play in elevators and department stores across America. I am generously giving 2 stars cos it isn't as annoying as Oops I did it Again! by Bitchney Slut.	-1
I used to think this was 'dope.' Little did I realize, it had an awful beat and terrible lyrics.	-1
Just okay.	-1
Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!	-1

I hate it when I download an older song and I have to jack the volume up on my MP3 when it gets to this song and others like it.

With all the hype surrounding The Pussycat Dolls, and their last single, When I Grow Up, it remains unfortunate that they haven't really hit that nail on the head when it comes to the girl group doing ballads. While Stickwitu wasn't so bad, it has really been awhile since they've tried to take that turn with their music. But, unfortunately, their latest ballad, I Hate This Part, the second single from their sophmore album, Doll Domination, doesn't seem to hit the nail on the head. I really felt the melody, but the lyrics itself were really a turnoff. It just didn't seem to click when it came to the mends of a breakup, the dolls knew what they were singing. They needs to do better ballads, but they also need better singles. The next single from Doll Domination should be better than this.  Song: D	-1

It has honestly been very sad, whenever someone who is talented as a songstress, becomes so severely overexposed, that they are unfortunately a manufactured product than a real person. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers who has been so severely overplayed, that her own voice has passed away in the process. Her music used to be popular, but now it has just became annoying. Her own work used to be popular in the 2000 decade when she released songs like Single Ladies and Crazy In Love. But honestly, the songs do not ignite, even when she made herself overflooded. Ego has been one of those songs that lags spirit, soul and voice badly. Beyonce' Knowles does not even come close from the heart. It feels more jaded, than any of the songs she did when she was a part of Destiny's Child. I think because Beyonce' Knowles has made so many bad and poorly made songs, that it is just time for her to retire.  Song: F+	-1
File under: Worst Song Lyrics or  Terrible Lyrics  Listen I'm here to bash the simple pleasure of listening to pop songs. There's a certain shallowness that i associate  with being up all night, partying hard, throwing your hands in the air like you just don't care, and saying baby just one more time.  THE LYRIC:  It's too big (big) / It's too wide (wide)  [Ed: We get it.] It's too strong (strong) / It won't fit (fit)  [No, really.]  It's too much (much) / It's too tough (tough)  He talk like this 'cause he can back it up  He got a big ego / Such a huge ego  I love his big ego There ya go! This begs the question "Whose King Kong dong was Beyonce talkin bout??"	-1
In some language, "K-Tel" must mean "re-recorded" or "not the original". Surely K-Tel must have some quality recordings for sale somewhere, but this isn't one of them.  Wonderful World is yet another collection of re-recorded hits by groups with the same name as the original artists. I don't understand why anyone would want anything like this when those original hits are still available, often in other great collections such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/50-U-S-Number-Ones-Of-The-60s/dp/B00EA0BZ2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">50 U.S. Number Ones Of The 60s</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Best-of-Rock-n-Roll-Greatest-Originals-from-the-50s-60s/dp/B00GHUSXN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Best of Rock 'n' Roll (Greatest Originals from the 50s & 60s)</a>.  K-Tel's re-recorded packages are a rash on the MP3 oldies pages, with many more sad examples to choose from. The only reason I bothered to review this one is to get Amazon to stop suggesting it for me.  Take-away lesson: Listen to samples before you buy. If you don't recognize it, you probably don't want it.	-1

There honestly has been question about Britney Spears, and her comeback album Circus. While she hasn't been able to score that wide-appeal with all the problems she had gone through. While she has had some appeal, the songs aren't really there hand in heart. That honestly has been proof with Radar, the 4th single from Circus. I thought that the song was very weak, and not really filled with the strength that she used to have. I really was honestly not that impressed with the whole album, and this was one of those songs that to me felt like a big, fat snoozer. She needs to try and appeal to a more broader audience, than staying in that same zone she was trying to recapture. It feels like a waste of mind.  Song: F	-1

I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer. This sounds like a remake and it's a slower tempo. It does have the "brilliance" that the original had. I used "brilliance" NOT as brilliant but as in the audio term. The original has a rich sound that pops from the speaker where as this version sounds like a wedding band's cover. Of course this is merely how I hear it.	-1

There is no question about why Kelly Clarkson hasn't really been able to shine in her songs lately. They all have felt exactly the same on top of each other. She hasn't been able to get herself seperated from her American Idol image very well. Her latest single doesn't seem to really shine that brightly to my ears. I Do Not Hook Up, the second single from her 4th album All I Ever Wanted feels like it is just one in the same from her pervious earlier songs. It really isn't a great song after a few times, and feels like it has lost its luster very quickly. I overall wasn't very impressed with all the tracks from All I Ever Wanted, and for Kelly, she needs to find something different to seperate herself from the same angry-driven songs she has created for awhile. She doesn't really hook up at all.  Song: D	-1

-Love, Sex, Magic (Feat. Justin Timberlake)- Track two on the album and the second single. Not the worst song but definitely not really feeling the beat. Sure, you guys have heard this one before. It's her current single. You either like it or you don't.  It's definitely not the worst song on the airwaves by far, but it leaves quite a bit to be desired. The beat feels a bit lazy.  D+  end note: And WHY are popular singles so expensive now? Amazon used to be great about providing 89 cent songs, which trumped iTunes' 99 price but now, they are just going overboard!  High Price should be the next single. Or at least on radios. It's hot.	-1

When it honestly has came down the music out there lately, there just hasn't been much when there are definitive songs right now. Even those like Daughtry who had broke out from the shadow from American Idol haven't been able to score a high note. The band's latest single No Surprise, doesn't feel like it honestly is as invigorant as was the case with hard core fans when they broke out a few years ago. I felt that the song wasn't over the top at all. I just thought the song honestly didn't measure up to the feeling they had on songs like What About Now? or Home had. Hopefully, the next single from Daughtry can strike the louder Rock notes that could've been expected.  Song: D	-1

I don't think this song should be a first out of the studio for Kris Allen.  I watched him perform it TWICE on American Idol and each time he came to the higher notes he seemed to struggle to keep his voice from cracking - - - PITCHY - - - as Randy Jackson would say.  Both performers were given this song to put their individual spin on it and while it is not the best song for a finale,  I feel that Adam Lambert did a great job with something that was never heard by anyone before it was introduced on American Idol.  I also feel that Adam's studio version far excels Kris'.  Sorry, but Kris isn't polished enough as yet.  I bought Adam's.	-1

I am more disappointed in Amazon than the music.  This is not the original recording.  It is very good; the voices are very similar to the original, but they are definitely NOT original.  So I will listen to the song, but will always feel a bit ripped off.  This version appeared at the top search list. Note the parentheses in the title:  Originally.....  Reading quickly I thought "original," a slightly deceptive title.  I would give the original recording five stars as a wonderful ballad.  But not this one.  It's probably better than 2 stars, but I took off a star because of the slightly deceptive sales tactic.	-1

I feel like this: If it weren't for the hot beat that Pharrell Williams give the Neptunes, there would be nothing at all special about them. In fact, they would be those brothers (yes, the Clipse are brothers) selling their albums out the trunk of their cars. I have never heard a song by them that just blew me away lyrically. Their hottest song to date, and one of my favorite rap songs to come out in recent years, is featured on this album: "I'm Good." I really, really like that song and it's positive nature. The beat and hook are fantastic and their energetic, optimistic vibes make the song even better. Simply put, it's a feel good rap song.  I lost count of how many times they mentioned their chains, how good their chains looked, and how bright their chains are. That's what stands out most after listening to these 13 tracks. I can say this matter-of-factly, though: The best tracks here are "I'm Good" and "Champion." The rest of the album is basically the same as far as quality is concerned. "Never Will It Stop"and"There Was a Murder" are the LP's biggest most glaring missteps. These tracks are just all around bad. "Showing Out" is an energetic track if nothing else. It has an OK beat and a decent offering by Yo Gotti.  I gave this album 2 1/2 stars and I wonder if I was being too generous in doing so. Perhaps.  Mikeisha's Top 5  1. "I'm Good" 2. "Champion" 3. "Freedom" 4. "Popular Demand" 5. "Showing Out"	-1

Katy Perry teams up with the singer?/producer Timbaland on this one and it is one boring affair. The lyrics are extremely simple and the song really goes nowhere. I wish someone would help spruce up Tim's songs to make them something because I still haven't heard A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G from him worth putting on an iPod.  What's wrong, guy? You usually make magic in the studio (for others). Why can't you make a hit for your album?  Even with some of the good collaborations, his songs usually go nowhere.  2.5 stars or a 5/10.	-1

Do you remember that old philosophical debate, about whether a million monkeys pecking random keys on typewriters for a million years would eventually produce the works of Shakespeare?  Kellee Maize's work reminds me of that, though as yet she hasn't produced much that resembles music (not lyrically, anyway).  She's apparently had the big insight that lots of words rhyme with each other or sound a lot alike, and thinks by stringing them together something profound may result.  Well, not quite.  Using big words that rhyme does not an artist nor poet make.  Gosh- consonance, continents and consequence DO sound a lot alike, wow.  You can visit any mental hospital and find dozens of such "visionaries", what they produce is called "word salad".  It's gibberish, utter nonsense.  Ms. Maize is either unbalanced or having a good laugh at our expense, possibly both.  There's nary an original thought here, no- strike that- there's not a THOUGHT here, not one that's coherent or complete, at any rate.  The words SEEM to suggest things, like a verbal Rorschach test, words randomly thrown together DO, but the meaning is imposed from without, a projection, as they say. Granted, the tunes are catchy, the beats infectious.  But if you see anything profound and revelatory in the lyrics, I suggest you Google them, and have a look some Sunday morning, in the clear light of day.  I warrant that YOU are the source of your epiphanies, the inspiration and beauty comes from within, not from Ms. Maize's ramblings, which are alternately pretentious, gratuitous, and in poor taste, to put it mildly.  In fairness though, why this strikes me as rubbish and songs like "COME TOGETHER" or "I AM THE WALRUS" by the Beatles strike me as genius, I don't know (LSD way back when may have had something to do with it, admittedly, in this case, so who knows).  BTW, what is an "aligned archetype"?  An archetype is ONE facet of a person, one of many that complements other facets, their confluence or amalgam forms personality. I could have made some sense of "aligned archetypes", plural, its use in the singular is baffling- how so, aligned with what?  Below are the lyrics to Something Sacred.  I had to work around the obscenities, Amazon wouldn't accept them.  Some might think it a travesty, an insult to the things that people actually hold sacred to use the word thusly.  "Something Sacrilegious" might be more fitting.  Neither sacrilege nor obscenities bother me in the least, actually, but utter twaddle taken as profundity does, especially when there's so much out there that IS profound, explicitly so, like THE AVETT BROTHERS or LOVERS or HOLY GHOST! or MATTHEW DEAR, for example. I'll give you a million dollars if you can cogently explain the meaning of this song to me (well, not really, I don't have a million CENTS). But here are the lyrics, judge for yourself:  SOMETHING SACRED:  Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this  Justifiable rythym Asking what you been missin' Pimps so corporate n' kissin Values are tied in the lynching All the fat needs some pinchin Steady youth in a prison No lovin' supervision There's no cooks in the kitchen Poison water no fishin' All the sales men are pitchin' To steal cause circumcision [Sexual assault] us continue snitchin' Money drugs over [female dogs] I see something real different I'll be holdin' a vision It's not just superstition  Something sacred sewed me sideways I'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way Holy hell on a hardened highway Feeling freaky focused Friday to Friday  I'm fighting my ego I think may be it's sequel Is opposite of evil Sugar f***ed up my equal Never researched the prequel Toxins all in your fecal Poppin' pills swelling measle Tell me where is my people They don't bow at no steeple Lightworkers gettin deepa Quantum physics'll teach ya My lyrics they might reach ya Read the poems I preach ya This full length is my feature A mysterious creature We are one blood all keepers  Something sacred sewed me sideways I'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way Holy hell on a hardened highway Feeling freaky focused Friday to Friday  My spaceship is leavin' Out the window I'm seein' End of left brain per diam Psychics say they can see them Daddy's fightin my demons Beside me steady dreamin That he helps me make freedom From the grave he is screamin F! the man and his s*men Kinda fishy no reason Corporation is reakin' Smells of workers well treated Earth mother she is fiendin' For a break in the season Discontent no one pleasin' Called a [female body part] that is bleedin'  Something sacred sewed me sideways I'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way Holy hell on a hardened highway Feeling freaky focused Friday to Friday  Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continents I hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this	-1
Time: 2015 Place: Yankee Stadium Event: The Debut of a new Pop Diva: Nekkid Nicki  The lights dim, the crowd is silent with anticipation. In the next moment, fireworks go off, laser lights begin to flash and the drum machine begins to thump.. THUM-THUMP-THUMPITY-THUMP-THUM-THUMP-THUMPITY-THUMP-THUM-THUMP-THUMPITY-THUMP..  Then it happens! Nekkid Nicki is flown onto the stage amidst all the noise and flashing lights by a guy wearing a jetpack. True to her name, Nicki has no clothes, wearing only a bird's nest in her bouffant hairdo populated by two small doves. She walks to the center of the stage and begins her "performance". Nicki's act begins with her screaming like a dog being murdered: "AAAAAIIIEEEEEEEEAUGH!!! AAAAAIIIEEEEEAUGH!!" - for more than 2 minutes. Then she starts running around, barking like a dog and swinging her artificially enhanced breasts at the screming audience. "We love you Nicki!!", the lemming-like fans cry out. Other, less enamored audience members begin to feel dizzy and start to bleed from their ears...  YOU CAN PREVENT THIS POSSIBLE FUTURE. DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE CD. DO NOT SUPPORT NON-TALENTED POSERS LIKE KESHA. SAVE THE FUTURE. SAVE MANKIND..	-1

o.k. but not great	-1
I downloaded this on Amazon because it was free. I was hoping to find some good tracks on this album, I only found one that I actually kept on my computer - Turn Cold by Cut Off Your Hands. It's more upbeat however the vocals just don't sit completely right in my ears.	-1
Was in the moment!	-1

Doesn't seem to have any direction. Keeps repeating the same few beats over and over and over again. Not really as exciting as it might have been. Sounds like someone was rushing this to put it on a CD by a deadline.	-1
Nope...not a fan.	-1
this was not Dorothy Moore...I didn't pay attention to this	-1
This is another one I bought for my girlfriend.  I can't stand the song and wouldn't buy it.  But since it's not my style of music, don't take my word for it.  Listen for yourself.	-1
Sold through the Capitol Record Club as a "collector" premium, via his fan club at the time. Latest track on the Lp, "Once More With Feeling," is an Lp filler from TRY A LITTLE KINDNESS Lp, which dates this set into 1970-71 or so.  This album set was packaged with a folded 24" x 36" poster (same photo shot as the front cover of THE GOODTIME ALBUM, Capitol SW 493, roughly August, 1970) and a copy of THE GLEN CAMPBELL SOUVENIR PICTURE BOOK, normally the brown cover version, though some of the earliest runs on this set used the previous yellow cover edition with GC in a WICHITA LINEMAN photo shot.  Beware that used record dealers may split out the extra packaging--the poster and the picture book--to sell separately. This is basically a reissue of the obvious fillers, with some nice extras.	-1

Terrible song...horrible filthy lyrics! NOT for children. Parents do NOT buy or let your children listen to this song. It has the c word in it MULTIPLE times...I have counted how many times but it is at least 20 to 40 times the c word is said in the song. Every time "peacock" is said she means the word without the "pea" in front of it. I repeat do NOT let your children listen to this! The song is about a woman who craves a man's private parts and is mesmerized by the size of it. DO NOT let your children listen to this! This song is in the movie Katy Perry Part of Me DO NOT let your children watch that movie! The C word is said multiple times since part of this song is in the movie! It has a fake PG review since the person who rated the movie clearly did not pay attention to the movie, the movie is actually rated R. And do NOT let your children watch R rated movies.	-1

Well! Not what I thought.	-1
Purchased this without knowing it would be taken directly from the movie. It is a beautiful song but the background vocals, the firing of the MK-47's and M16's and jumps off into a whole different song. The history of this moving melody is as interesting as the song itself. Unfortunately, trying to find an unadulterated version of it may be just about impossible to come by. I'm debating about the "In The Style of" album, which may contain it, but can't confirm it. The writer and musical group (Clann An Drumma) don't have it for sale. Truly moving score, but am reluctant to end up buying the same edit.	-1
A beautiful song, but it's full length of five minutes plus is not achieved, so I will only give this song a one star only.	-1
Like the other reviewers described this ....Starts out great, then degenerates into rap xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  .. I see no need to cause  offense....That being said, I use this music to make movies, so I just used what  I paid for...The ''good stuff '' and deleted the rest.. { rap }..	-1
OK	-1
