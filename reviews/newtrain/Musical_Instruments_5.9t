This is a beauty. High, mid and low tone controls make it very versatile. Great thick clean sound.	1
No offense to Public Enemy fans, but DO believe the hype; particularly around this pedal. For fifty bucks, you really can't lose. Yeah you can replace the valve inside with a better one, but out of the box, this thing sounded amazing. I just wanted to test it on my little modeling headphone amp by Nux (which sounds great on it owns for a cheap modeling headphone amp,) I got lost in all the different hard rock sounds this can achieve. I haven't tried it through my Blues Jr. yet, but I felt that it was too good after just using it in a solid state headphone amp, that I had to rave about it. It had a warm tube tone...obviously, but it sustains beautifully; doesn't sound fake at all; notes will just ring forever. And if you crank everything, it doesn't blow up like some pedals do. I have too many overdrive pedals, and even some of the one that are twice as expensive as this is, sound awful when cranked. There's a lot of feedback and windy hissing, but this doesn't seem to do that at all. Maybe I just got lucky, but I think this might be my favorite overdrive pedal at the moment. It certainly is versatile enough to replace most of mine, not to mention big enough to be all of them combined. I definitely recommend this, for $50 you really can't lose.	1
This pedal leaves me wanting more.  It has a nice crunch to it, but notes die off quick - the sustain is abysmal.  I used it linked up with a tube-based boost pedal, which gave some ok sustain, but finally the Tube Monster from my pedal board.	-1
I have to agree with many of the reviewers who have listened to this piece of equipment. This unit is in ways, superior in sound to many of the most popular overdrives on the market which cost two to three times as much.  It is voiced correctly for playing lead guitar and it has a noise gate to boot.  I A/B ed it next to my Butler Tube Driver and it held up nicely.  I also agree that something is wrong with the tubes shipped with these overdrives. The box proudly states that each unit has a selected Bugera 12AX7 tube. It does but my tube was defective.  Thankfully, I've collected tubes for over four decades and had just the right 12AX7 to replace the Bugera.  While having the box opened, I was able to see that most of the circuit is solid state with a ceramic tube socket in the middle of the design.  I don't know how reliable it is.  Most Behringer equipment holds up, so I expect this unit to hold up as well.  I experienced a bit of moto boating sounds when first turning on the unit with the power switch.  Don't know if it's unique to this particular unit, but I keep the volume down on my amp when powering the overdrive up! Good work Behringer!  You've done well!	1
I play electric in my church's band, and I'd been using a boss blues driver for quite a while since it puts out a nice low gain distortion. But the sound of that pedal isn't nearly as dynamic as this one. I will say that I swapped out the tube it came with for a low gain gold 12au7. Yet, I'll still be able to sell the old blue boss for at least as much as the total I've invested in this. Let me put it this way...I go straight into the sound board, so this is the best and cheapest way to make sure the sound in the house speakers is a real guitar sound....not a weak digitalized sound.  If you get it spend time going back and forth between the clean and distorted channels to adjust the eq to make sure it's not narrowing your sonic spectrum...then just enjoy the great tone. I barely have the gain on 1.5 most of the time, but it makes all the difference in the world.	1
I've owned lots of overdrives and distortions through the years. I've never owned a tube amplifier, but I've always loved that sound! I think for cheap this is as close as you can get to a tube overdrive sound. I'm going to try the mod everyone is talking about (changing the tube). I'll keep you posted how it sounds when I do the mod.	1
Swap out the tube with some good Russian tubes and you have a real screamer with excellent warmth and gritty tonal bite you in the arse guitar goodness.	1
This things is tough and has a tremendous punch.  I did put a 12at7 because the bugera tube was terrible.  The new tube makes it sing.  I use it as a preamp for my Kustom Defender 5.	1
As many of the reviewers have stated the stock tube just isn't good,  The stock glass (Bugera 12ax7) gives way to much gain.  Stock the gain is usable between 0 and 1.  To make this pedal amazing, simply take off the cover, and replace the stock tube with something with lower gain, I tried several 12ay7 an at7 and ended up sticking with a 1960 NOS 12AU7.  Even then there is a ton of gain in reserve.  Pros: Built like a tank.  Probably not going to get destroyed unless you set it on a stage pyro.  Has three band eq.  Easier to get it dialed in.  Hint:  Try and keep the tone controls as low as you can to tap in less gain.  Cons:  Does have a big current draw.  Don't want to hook this up with other pedals on your board with a one-spot or similar multiple connection power supply.  Best use: Overdrive pedal for solid state amp	1

Those seeking a hot rodded sound to your amp would be wise to check this product out, as the level of boost and gain derived from the Bugera 12AX7C is enough to push any tube amp's clean channel into saturated overdrive.  Featuring 3-band EQ that ranges from barely noticeable to perhaps "too much", I was surprised that I actually found myself backing off some of the knobs because I expected this to be a cheap pedal that needed it's EQ to be pushed to max in order to get any playable tone out of it. I was wrong. The Master and Gain knobs work exactly like a tube amp channel. The Noise Suppressor is a nifty feature that drastically reduces white noise.  Roughly taking up the space of 3 standard pedals on your pedalboard, many probably wonder if it's even worth the real estate compared to other overdrives. However, when it comes to tube-based pedals, big is par for the course.  The stock tube is decent to the point where you can get some musical tones out of the pedal. I personally don't plan on changing the stock tube any time soon because I want to test its limits, but the gain range is effectively Boss OD-1 to DS-1, so YES - it is possible to get some metal tones out of this pedal, especially those late 80s/early 90s Marshall-driven metal tones.  I honestly can't say anything overtly bad or wrong with this pedal. I judge gear with my EARS and by its VALUE, not by PRICE, but honestly... for $50, you literally can't go wrong. There are worse pedals you could buy for more money quite honestly. Even with a $10-$15 mod to change the tube to something more your preference, you're still looking at a relatively inexpensive pedal with an amazing value. But if you're looking for other tube overdrives, check these out: Effectrode Tube Drive ($350), Maxon TBO-9 True Tube Boost/Overdrive ($263), and the Ibanez Tube King ($170).  If you're on the fence with this thing, go ahead and jump over and get one.  UPDATE: After utilizing this pedal extensively for the past few months, I decided that the Bugera 12AX7 onboard was effectively put through its paces enough for me to make a qualified review. I finally decided to replace the tube socket with a spare Sovtek 12AX7WA that I had on hand... and what a massive difference it made! The EQ curves are smoother, more balanced, and the overdriven gain tones had far less "snap, crackle, and pop" than the Bugera in comparison. I run this pedal through the FX loop of my Marshall JCM2000 DSL50/English, and it gives me a completely different and distinct (VOX-ish) overdrive tone to use compared to the Marshall ECC83 flavored overdrive.  I am now recommending this pedal to all my guitarist buddies. It's just that good.  A NOTE ON THE VIDEO: I made the video for YouTube, but it's a short full-band song of how the VT999 sounds in the mix for studio recording. All guitars and even the bass were ran through the pedal.	1
It sounds good. Not as a professional tube driver, but quite well for the price. Perfect for begginners and intermediate players that can't afford something else that is a little bit more expensive.	1
I have a Blue Voodoo all tube amp. It's a dinosaur but has a great tone. Sadly, I tried revamping it with all new tubes, but though it gave me the drive I needed, it also raised the noise level tremendously. This was my last resource before selling an amp I did not want to part with. I thought this pedal would do the trick. I was right. You would think with just one AX7 tube you would get just so much drive, but this puppy gives more than expected. Behringer used to be known as junk, but no more.	1
This would be an awesome, to die for kind of overdrive pedal if the drive stage had some variation to it...it goes from nothing to "holy sh*t" in almost no time!  Granted, the grind this pedal produces is definitely* musical sounding, but for subtle applications, it's just too much of a good thing.  I'm still gonna keep it though...it's a cool counterpoint to my reissue Big Muff pi!  Different tubes did produce smoother tone, but no less over-overdrive...I wound up with an Electro-Harmonics 12AT7EH in it, and it sounds better than the generic tube it comes with.  Maybe a 12AU7 could cut back on the grindage level?  Who knows, guess that'll be my next move...or I might try one of the mod kits out there.  Can't beat it for the price, the EQ is actually very responsive and helps make this usable as a very dirty sounding bass preamp too...I'm one of those guys that loves to try weird stuff to get a great sound from my bass rig!  UPDATE 03/09/2016...Well, I've had this pedal for about 2 1/2 years now, and I've grown to love it's idiosyncrasies...the over the top overdrive has given my reissue Big Muff pi the boot from my guitar pedalboard (it was really quite redundant, and I only needed 1 HUGE metal box on my board lol), I've learned how to tweak the EQ to maximum effect, and I'm even farting around with the noise gate...a feature I truly felt no need for at first, but have since discovered its value!  I never did venture into the mod kit world, because the design as it came from Behringer is pretty killer in its own right!  All the kits promised to deliver less overall gain with some minor tweaks to the EQ structure, and from my extensive experience with this wicked cool fire breather, that'd be like taking a classic Marshall Plexi full stack (the ultimate rock and roll carnage machine) and replacing the fire breathing EL34s with EL84s and disconnecting 7 of the 8 speakers because it's too loud...why get the Plexi in the first place then?  So in closing, the rating goes up another star to 4, and I added a low gain OD pedal to cover the end of the clean boost/mild grind spectrum that this one doesn't do to my taste...but, for all out mayhem and honest to God tube powered old school brutality, this big ol' box can't be beat!	1
I have to add my 5 stars to the conversation, this is truly a fun and amazing pedal to own and play with. The first thing I did when I bought it was plug it in and played as is, then I took the advice of a few reviews and took the back off (very easy) and put in a 12au7 tube that I pulled from an old radio. I switched back and forth multiple times using lots of different settings and finally decided the 12ax7 it came with was more to my liking and sounded better with my gear. I'm considering buying a new 12au7 and experimenting. I've had a blast getting a ton of different sounds out of the pedal,every time I turn a dial it's a new tone. The combinations are endless given the adjustments I can make to the pedal,my guitar and amp. The pedal also sounds good whether I'm playing through single coils or humbuckers. I've had one other experience with Behringer when on a whim I bought a VD1 Vintage distortion pedal and was plesantly suprised given the pittance it cost--$40. The Vintage tube monster pedal(VT999)is definitely worth the modest investment.	1
This thing is amazing. Like many I cannot afford a tube amp. This transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps I played years ago. Sustain and harmonics are insane. Preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones.  The unit is very heavy and rugged. The only component I would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost.	1
Nice unit and well worth what I paid. check out the dimensions before you purchase. It may not fit too well in a foot pedal unit too well but for stand alone usage it has a very nice tone.	1
With the stock tube, this pedal makes for a good distortion/heavy overdrive. But I swapped in a JJ 12AT7 tube and now it has more clean headroom, creamy overdrive, and can still do a heavy distortion. I might even put in a 12AU7 for even less gain.  You can always run a boost in front of this pedal to get more gain for heavy distortion (like you would any tube amp), but you can't roll back the volume knob and expect good results. Not with this pedal, at least. The stock 12AX7 tube will get you to heavy distortion town, but will breakup harshly with the gain at "1". There's no fix to that other than lower gain tubes.  Do yourself a favor when you buy this pedal: Add a few quality 12AT7 and 12AU7 tubes to your order as well.	1
I'm a harp player and while I have plenty of tube amps to get "the tone", I wanted to be able to tweak a transistor amp like a Pignose, or a Maxi Mouse. This puppy foots the bill. I removed the 12AX7 and put in a 12AU7. Lower gain, less feedback. With all the dial settings, I can up the mids and bass and turn the treble down to zilch and get a really fat tone on a transistor amp. Sucks you can't busk with it because you need AC power for the pedal, but for noodling around the house it's fun, or you can use it in the shop when you're building a mic. Behringer scored a homerun with this VT999 Classic Vacuum Tube Overdrive pedal. Worth the dough.	1
The VT999 Vintage Tube Monster has quite quickly become my go-to overdrive pedal, surpassing other OD pedals I've used, including the Digitech Bad Monkey, the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer, the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive, and remarkably, the Fulltone Fulldrive 2 MOSFET.  The VT999 has several things going for it --  - Tweakable EQ (High/Mid/Low) which allows you to run a full spectrum, from muddy, dirty low OD sounds, even from a single coil, to bright, screaming lead tones with high mids or highs. - Noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to "squeeze" the tone for some interesting effects - Wide range gain that gets dirty around 9 o'clock and full-on distortion when cranked  Now, for full disclosure sake, I did change out the tube to a JJ Tesla 12AX7, but most people who know tubes will tell you that really, tubes are often hit-or-miss, simply on account of them being analog, heater-based elements. That's part of the fun of tube-based OD. I have played a VT999 that had a great sounding overdrive, but mine didn't have that sound until I put in a new tube. Try it out with the stock tube, and go to a different tube if you don't like it. At least try a new tube before giving up.  There are two things that I don't like about the VT999, and I can tell you -- both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone. This pedal got it 100% right with tone after a tube switch. The 2 issues are:  - The housing is huge, and if you look inside, it seems like a waste of space. There's a lot of open space with nothing there, and while I can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat, it's a bit overboard. - Compared to the Fulldrive, the lack of a boost switch is really a miss. Especially given the large enclosure, it would make perfect sense to move the 5 knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side. That'd take little effort, and given the independent power of this pedal, would be a piece of cake to achieve. Heck, I could probably do it myself, but I don't want to ruin the good sound this produces.  Bottom line, I understand that on a pedalboard, real estate is everything. This takes up at least the space of 2 pedals. Is it worth it? To me, it is. I run 2 OD pedals on my 2-row board, and I can honestly say, in the last 10 gigs, I have never gone to the other OD. It's been the Vintage Tube Monster every time.	1
This is clearly the best distortion pedal I've ever owned, including mxr's, digitech, boss and others.  I too swapped out the Bugera 12ax7 -- which did sound good -- for a RCA long black plate 12au7, which sounds incredible.  The tube swap gave all 3 tone controls more range of tone and gave the gain itself less of a high end tinniness and a fuller sound.  I recommend this pedal to anyone who loves distortion that is pure without a lot of buzziness.  If I had paid 3 times as much for this pedal I would still be happy, it sounds that good.  It came with a power supply so no need to order one.  The pedal is large, almost 3 times larger that other pedals.  It also comes with a noise gate which, since I swapped the tube, I don't even need to use.  This pedal does not sound cheap, it indeed equals or in my opinion is better than it's competitors.	1
Hercules DS410B TravLite In-Bell Trumpet Stand  A trumpet player friend bought this stand and was so disappointed, he returned it.  The product is very light weight, but his Bach Stradivarius  trumpet with a #37 bell leaned several degrees when on this "Hercules" stand.  That  made it more likely to tip over with his trumpet on it.  There seems to be three reasons for this:  -  the yellow "bulb" that's supposed to hold the trumpet straight is too small to be snug in many trumpet bells; it didn't work for my Schilke S22 trumpet either.  - that bulb isn't sufficiently high to reach into a smaller diameter bell area.  - the stand is rather flimsy.  My advice is to get the 5-legged K&M stored-in-the-bell trumpet stand.  It's heavier than this one,  significantly stronger, will hold a trumpet vertically, and is much less likely to tip over  with you expensive instrument on it.	-1
Love this trumpet stand. I have the other Hercules multiple trumpet stand and sometimes if your not careful it will tip over. I would rather use a couple of these for multiple horn gigs.	1
Good stand, but the felt on the base left a black mark on my trumpet bell that I have yet to get removed.  I now use the bag to cover the base, and no additional marks are showing, but the damage is done to the silver finish.  Not good! Otherwise, great stand!	1
After 3 years of use the top of the vertical post that the seat spindle slides into split about 1" down the tube. Now the seat wobbles excessively while I'm gigging. Not good for the old back.	-1
This chair is worth it.. In some reviews i was wonderin on weight that it can handle..Well being 390lb it holds up veey well... No slip or bending...  If your big boy get it .....	1
Durable comfort.  I couldn't believe that my playing improved simply because of the proper support.	1
Perfect and at a great price!	1
Kind of lightweight cheap and squeaky.	-1
Heavy duty frame, comfy seat, drum key included, & great a brand. Can't beat this deal.	1
After using this throne for a few weeks, I can say I am more than satisfied with it. It is extremely durable, very comfortable, and exceptionally stable. An awesome value for the price. I'd recommend it to any drummer, from beginner to pro.	1
GREAT THRONE! BUY THIS!	1
This throne replaces a cheaper one I bought on Amazon that broke. If you're a bigger guy or have any passion to your drumming, get this.	1
Excellent shipping and after adjusting it to my desired height it was So So comfortable.  I LOVE the thickness of the seat.  Thanks a bunch......I recommend this seat to anyone.	1
I'm not a drummer- I use this throne for playing bass and it's nice- not too heavy, but well made and sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality throne with extra padding on the seat.	1
I am an adult drum player and weigh about 220 pounds.  I purchased this drum throne as my old one was in a state of disrepair.  So you know from where I write this review: I prefer a firm drum seat, but I do not care for bicycle/saddle type seats.  I use a round seat.  The 570A drum throne is my first Mapex purchase.  The seat is firm and thick, with 4" of cushion covered in black vinyl.  It is 14" in diameter. The vinyl is not shiny; it is a matte finish and soft to the touch.  The stand and legs have a chrome finish and there are large rubber shoes on the three legs.  The products ships in a Mapex box which includes: * 4" vinyl seat * Curved leg, double braced stand. * Steel tube and rod (rod has notched top to secure seat, and collar to secure into tube) * "Drum key" to tighten collar.  The seat is in plastic inside the box, while the stand parts are wrapped in brown "butcher's paper", and the drum key comes in little clear plastic carrying case.  There are no assembly instructions included, but assembly is very simple:  open the stand, insert the steel rod into the tube, and put on the seat.  There are 3 large, steel wing screws to adjust stand near the bottom, at the point where the rod inserts into the stand tube, and where the seat fits onto the notched top of the rod.  Once you adjust the stand to your preferred height (a range of about 16" to 24"), you tighten the collar on top of the middle wing screw to secure the seat.  I haven't had any issues with slippage or the stand working is way lower.  The rod is not threaded, so if that is something you demand, you might want to try the Mapex T750A.  I haven't tried it, but it looks like this model, except it has the threaded rod/tube.  Personally I've had more issues with undesired lowering on threaded rods.  A couple of "obvious" tips, but just in case: * Unless you are a new drummer, just put this seat next to your existing drum stool to figure out the height. * It is not clear from advertisements if this throne is intended to spin or not.  However, since the notch in the steel rod is of decent depth, you can tighten the top wing screw (just below the seat) enough so it secures the seat (as in you can't lift the seat off the stand), but also allows the seat to turn as the wing screw is not actually making contact with the metal on the stand.  As far as performance, the stand feels stable, the seat comfortable even after an hour or two of play, and there no seat wobble, although if you adjust the top wing screw so that the seat is not stationary but spins, you may have a little wobble until you adjust it "just right."  If you have the patience to tune drums, you can do this!  I am not saying this is the best stool of all time.  However for under $80 it is an exceptional value.  I would compare it easily with seats which sell for twice as much.  I had a Pork Pie which cost double this seat, and I returned it after a few days.  It just didn't feel great, especially for the price.  Plus, Mapex backs the throne with a 5 year warranty.  If I had to compare it to another seat in construction and feel, I would say it is like Ludwig's new Atlas seat.  While I like the look of the Ludwig seat, I couldn't justify twice as much money just for a nice looking logo that would be covered all the time anyway.  The Ludwig does have a threaded tube though, if that appeals to you.	1
Looking for my first drum chair I bought this based on reviews.  I found it to be too firm for my body type and went with a different brand with a softer cushioned seat and back attachment.	-1
What a saving grace for the derriere and back of anyone who has to sit through long rehearsals or gigs.  Other drum thrones I have used come nowhere near to having the support/padding of this one.  Also, it is a heavy-duty piece of equipment, for sure!  Highly recommended.	1
I have been playing pro and semi pro, almost daily for quite some years. My main heavy duty thrown was still holding up except for not being able to hold its height anymore - it was the worm screw post style. I searched out thrones that would fit my height needs and that would have the firm/ but still thick cushion seat with a good solid base and I wanted to stay away from the spiral post this time-just for the set it and forget it rule. At only 77 dollars Ithought that I would.take a shot at this. It is perfect-especially at the price. Thick padded seat,adjusts to about 28 inches to the top and seems pretty sturdy. you won't find a better throne in this price range-let alone that it was free shipping-this would compare up to about 120 dollar models and as much as I would have loved the Pork Pies especially since they are USa made I couldn't swing the double price this time (do NOTE-IF you CAN afford it Ny all means buy the American pproducts....and stay putt of Walmart).....but this is better than the rest if your.price rangeis under 120...	1
works well with my amp	1
Excellent Mic, buying another because I like this one so much.	1
This is an excellent value for the money. The mic looks great, works well and sounds fine. Inexpensive enough to get a few extras, especially with the xlr cable and mic mount included. We use these in a house of worship for announcements, and they last a few years if handled well. Cardiod pick up reduces feedback, and integrated switch is very useful, plus built in pop filter makes it almost pop resistant. Very nice mic.	1
I have some old Shures and a Behringer mic, but this mic seems to be the best one for my voice for my home recordings.  It comes with the clip ( to attach to a stand) and a cable, so you are ready to go if you have a stand.  I use it with a Tascam digital recorder.  I get my best results with this mic ( which is a dynamic type) for my voice and the internal mic on the Tascam recorder for my acoustic guitar.  This way I get some separation and keep the voice off the guitar track and the guitar off the voice track.	1
This unit is such drastic overhaul of its classic predecessor it's amazing.  The ability to store presets, a reverse echo, and the filter are great new additions.  So is the looper, but I still use my 16 Second Delay for that.	1
I'll be using this for a while.  This thing is awesome, it's like an instrument on its own, in that you have to take time to really get to know it and all that it does... which is a good thing.  It's pretty easy to use and clearly laid out as far as the controls go, it's pretty intuitive.  But that doesnt mean you 'll learn everything in one sitting.  I'll be exploring the possibilities for a long time now.  I look forward to more product from Electro Harmonix.	1
Although all the rest of my pedals are analog, I thought I would go for this little puppy for the following reasons: 1) I was looking for a delay with tap ability to create a nice shimmering sound that would complement the other guitarist in our band. This has tap functionality and up to 3 seconds of delay time. 2) It comes with the ability to modulate your sound to some extent, creating chorus and flange-like effects. 3) It has a boat load of other functions, like loops, reverse effects, etc. 4) It's programmable. 5) I like Electro Harmonix products in general. 6) It's relatively inexpensive for what it has. 7) It has stereo-ins and outs. 8) It doesn't suck tone and signal strength. 9) It looks great.  I guess you could see this as a list of the pedals "pros." Thus far I've tested in out for only 2 hours or so, but it's lived up to my expectations. It actually has way more functionality than I wanted, but I'm looking forward to exploring and creating new sounds. For about two hundred, this is a great deal.  There are a few "cons" and they are: (1) It takes a while to learn how to use. The manual is _essential_ here. Right off the bat it tells you how to get a simple delay. I demo'd it in the store (Guitar Center) and I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. It was creating all sorts of crazy loops and I couldn't even shut the loops off! It was totally going crazy! So, if you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't mess with this pedal. Fortunately, the manual looks very clear and although long (10 pages or more?) I think after I read through all of it I'll be clear on things. Actually, the fact that the pedal was going crazy when I demo'd it was cool, because now I know I can do all that crazy stuff (not that I'd really use that in a gig).  (2) It's only adaptor-powered, no possibility of battery use. (3) It's digital. If you absolutely must have an analog delay, then you might check out the new MXR Carbon Copy, which is a bit cheapter, is smaller and is analog. Everyone says it's a great pedal. However, it can't do any of the other cool jazz this baby can do, and doesn't have tap tempo. Or for more money -- about three hundred -- you can get the analog Memory Man which everyone raves about. Or a Maxon delay. But the sound on this is close enough for me, and the analog delays don't have the features this one has. (4) You can't switch presets with your foot. You have to bend down and turn the Hazarai (white) knob. You could raise the pedal to where you could reach it with your hand, but then you can't stomp on it (for the tap tempo). I'm not sure what to do with this conundrum just yet. Probably I'll only have 2-3 presets that I'll use in a gig and I'll just have to reach down and turn it when I have to?  In conclusion, I did a fair amount of research on delay pedals and demo'd a few in stores. For the money, I think this is a good pedal. It has 2 extra knobs more than a usual delay pedal (not counting the Hazarai knob) and that lets you adjust your sound to make it more analog-like or add some reverb-like effect, which is neat. It's functional, wacky if you want it to be, and it looks great!  * * * Edit: I have now owned this pedal for about three months. It is great, and has loads of possibilities. Only thing I miss about it, is that it lacks an easy way to switch presets (you have to bend down and turn the Hazarai knob and push it, which you can try to do with your feet, but it's pretty hard!). No regrets about buying it though.	1
I've had the Stereo Memory Man for a couple months now, and I'm still getting new and amazing tones out of it. I also have to admit, I'm still learning how to use it, as it's got so many options available. This is definitely a good thing though.	1
I love EH pedals.  They really do a good job of doing their own thing.  I don't care that this isn't an analog delay, it still sounds great, and it just has so many options.  As others have said, this is a bit more complicated than your standard delay pedal.  The tap tempo works great.  I also like all the funky sounds you can get by playing with the parameters in the various delay settings.  For example by setting the delay with modulation to a very short delay with no repeats you can almost get a steel drum sound.  Very cool.  I use the looper on this to jam by myself almost every day, and I've also used it live in a duo setting to create percussion and background music to solo over.  It works very well for that and it's easy to use.  No undo or other fancy looper functions, but it's still very useable and tons of fun.  This is my main delay pedal and I'm very happy with it.  There's so much to it I think you're best served checking out the EH website or in-depth online reviews just to get a feel for all the various functions.  Oh, and one more thing - I power mine with a Visual Sound One Spot on my pedalboard without any issues, and have done so for about 4 years.  I know EH says you have to use their power supply, but I guess that's not necessarily true.	1
No doubt a real winner & I agree with another reviewer who said there is a lot more to this pedal than even the manual indicates. I tried some of the settings that the manual said NOT to use & ended up with some great self-occilating type sounds that I immediately recorded for a spacemusic piece I'm working on. My only complaint is it can get a bit noisey at times especially when you start looping but this is to be expected. Just another great pedal from a company with a history of producing great pedals which is............well..........great!	1
Great sound. You can pretty much dial in any flanged/chorus sound you like from just a little to way too much....HA!  It is built very solidly so it doesn't feel like it will break any time soon. I've always owned BOSS pedals, which I really like, but decided to try something new when I needed a chorus. I like the idea of having a chorus and a flanger together in one pedal.  I wish the dimensions were listed better on the amazon site. It appears that the dimensions posted are of the box it comes in, not the product itself (at least when I ordered it - maybe that has changed???). I was pleasantly surprised when the pedal came and it was quite a bit smaller than what was listed on the site (so it fits nicely in my pedal board).  Haven't tried the stereo bit yet - I'm sure it will sound great.  The switch itself is awfully loud....it makes a very loud "CLICK" sound when engaging/disengaging the effect (minus one star for that). I sometimes play softer music and when I go to turn on the pedal it is really loud - that is pretty disappointing. In a live setting with drums/bass/guitars/vocals it probably wouldn't matter, but in quiet settings or during the quiet part of a song, switching on/off will be heard.	1
After a long investigation I chose this as my "chorus" because it is very customizable. I'm glad I got it. It's the only chorus I know that actually sounds pretty to my ear. True, it's actually a unique pedal on its own, but it covers the modulation thing well. It gives you a random kind of weirdness that I love. You would be mistaken not to try it out. And as a flanger it may not be completely versatile, but it does a very appealing version of that effect too.	1
Broke, unsurprisingly. I was in the market for a good multieffect and so I purchased this, partially because one could achieve almost ring mod zaniness at the higher settings. I used it several times and then it would not work anymore. Pedal was not that great when it worked and now it is a paperweight.	-1
Easy to use, great sounding, reasonably priced and well built. I've owned this pedal for a long time and have gotten MANY different sounds out of it throughout the years, both on stage and in the studio. A classic example of why EHX has been around for a while and will continue to do so.	1
I just received this pedal and have started to play with it. I'm loving the amazing tones I can get from it. You can go from subtle coloring, to extreme, synth-like, sounds. I always thought that chorus and flager don't go toghether well on the same mix, but I was wrong. I love the filter-matrix feature. You can get insane harmonics with this thing. The pedal's contruction seems pretty solid and I'm very satisfied with it so far.	1
I own over 30 stompboxes. By brand name, about a third are Electro Harmonix. By type, about a third are modulations (flanger, phaser, chorus, tremolo, etc.). In other words, I like stompboxes, Electro-Harmonix, and modulation effects. Electro-Harmonix advertises the Stereo Electric Mistress as a special flanger/chorus that can make the classic sounds of David Gilmour, Andy Summers, and so on. I am not convinced.  The first thing to know is that Electro-Harmonix currently makes three units with the "Electric Mistress" name on it:  (1) Deluxe Electric Mistress -- This is the analog flanger used by Gilmour, Summers, etc. Along with the A/DA and the MXR, it is one that gives classic flanger sounds. But these units are different! Compare by listening. For example, Van Halen used an MXR for "Unchained" vs. Deluxe Electric Mistress in "Message in a Bottle" or Heart's "Barracuda" for another flavor of the Mistress.) You get a set of classic sounds with each, but it is a large unit -- as most analog flangers are. (Look at the schematics and you will understand why analog flangers are so big.)  (2) Neo Mistress -- This is the smallest Mistress. I have only heard these on YouTube demos, so I cannot attest to their quality. I am pretty sure it is a digital pedal, and it does not have the same controls as the Deluxe.  (3) Stereo Electric Mistress -- This is a DIGITAL pedal (not analog) designed to make flanger and chorus effects in a medium-sized pedal.  HOW I TESTED IT: I have tried the Stereo Electric Mistress through two amps (1973 Silverface Fender Twin Reverb and Fender 22W Supersonic) with two guitars (1993 American Standard Strat w/lace sensor single coils & Blacktop HH Jaguar with Seymour Duncan SH-1 humbuckers). I have used YouTube demos made by Electro Harmonix as a guide to setting it, and I have about 20 of them written down. Plus I have experimented with my own settings.  RESULTS: When I first got the Stereo Electric Mistress, I removed two pedals to fit it on, including my beloved Electro Harmonix Neo-Clone chorus (because I thought the Stereo Electric Mistress would cover the chorus). After a week of working with it, I took it off and put the Neo Clone back on because the Stereo Electric Mistress's chorus does not sound as good. So that was a fail.  Recently, I have reorganized my pedalboard and opened up space so that I could have a chorus pedal in addition to the Stereo Electric Mistress. Because I am playing a lot of Police songs, I decided to give the Stereo Electric Mistress another chance. I am still not convinced.  To my ears, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a unique pedal -- and I have used it in spots for good effect. But If you are looking for the classic flanger sounds of the Deluxe Electric Mistress, you are not going to find it in the Stereo Electric Mistress. It is too dark and seems to suck tone as it cycles. If you want the classic Electric Mistress sounds, then you will need to get a Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. Since I want to be able to make sounds like Andy Summers did in the Police, I find this unit unacceptable. It simply does not work as advertised there, at least with the rigs I have tried. (To make Police sounds, I am using quality stompboxes: a Keeley compressor and a Line 6 DL4 delay, and the flanger is the only problem!)  If you are considering buying this unit, I recommend that you only do so if you can test it out (ideally with your rig -- at least bring your guitar and maybe a couple stompboxes like a distortion to the store and borrow an similar amp). Do not buy this based on descriptions or YouTube demos. The Stereo Electric Mistress is its own thing, and it may be what you are looking for. One place that it does excel is in the effects loop of an Electro-Harmonix Superego pedal, where it can really change the timbre and even enable pitch bends. But my complaint is that it does not do what the descriptions say it will.  BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a good modulation to make Police or Pink Floyd like sounds, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a fail and I recommend either an Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. I went with the Hartman because it takes up far less pedalboard real estate. If you have a SuperEgo, the Stereo Electric Mistress sounds great there.	-1
The addition of the chorus effect adds a new twist and makes for a much warmer flange sound. Has a nice wide sweep. Personally, I'm a big fan of the newer more condensed E-H effects - fits a lot better on a pedal board. They're still a touch expensive, but still much cheaper than the boutique stuff.	1
great	1
This is very good deal for the money.  Guitar produces pleasant sound. The tuner and shoulder strap are extra plus but you will probably never use them unless you are new to string instruments. Overall I am very satisfied with the quality of workmanship and playability.	1
I got this guitar to replace my Mitchell guitar based on reviews. The price was good. Also, it is the Yamaha brand name. The sound, I was told by my teacher, was very good and he said it was a good buy. The tuner is OK....better to buy a Korg tuner from Amazon. Haven't tried the DVD yet.  I have only two complaints: 1) The bag, as pointed out by another review, is very flimsy. It has no straps, no padding. It just has a carry handle. You would want to buy another gig bag  2) The worksmanship is lacking at certain points....e.g. where the neck extends on to the body of the guitar, you see glue that was squeezed out from under. I am a stickler for aesthetics. Some people are not bothered with such stuff.  OVERALL A VERY GOOD GUITAR  PS - You might want to check out the GigMaker Deluxe...similar guitar but has a solid spruce top and is only $10-$20 extra. I did not know about it otherwise would have bought that. However, as I came to know later, solid wood tops sound good but need to be kept in controlled humidity whereas the laminate tops don't care about humidity. If you want to control humidity, you can buy a little humidifier (no electricity needed) that drops into the sound hole of the guitar.	1
The Looks, the Feel, the Sound I Like	1
I bought this guitar after trying out a bunch of them out at a local music store. I tried out a few in my price range and then made the mistake of trying out an $800 Martin. I knew when I played it that the deep resonance and rich low-ends had ruined me on cheaper guitars. Then, I picked up this guitar. That clear bass against your chest is here in this guitar for a fraction of the price of the more expensive guitars. It's not equal, but it's incredible given the price difference. I highly recommend this for the ridiculous price:quality ratio.	1
I REALLY like the functions, plus the fact that it is so simple. All I have to do is throw a CD into this thing. Then I can change the pitch without changing temp. Ever tried to figure out old ACDC tunes? They're all + or - some fraction of a note, right? OK, this fixed it for me.  And of course I can slow the tempo down a lot and then A-B repeat the lead part so I have a chance at it.  The CD sound quality is really not bad. NO, it ain't Hi-Fi. But seriously, what do you expect. Yet for something this size and cost, I was surprised I could plug Line-out to the stereo and it wasn't bad. Just be sure you push your connector all the way in. For the longest time, the connector was not pushed in well, and it sounded crappy. not anymore.  The guitar effects are a bit like the cheesier 80's effects. Don't expect a lot there. But then again, I'm just using this to figure out licks, so that's not a big deal in my case. Most of the time I play the Tascam through stereo, and I play the guitar through a practice amp, so this is not even a problem for me.  Batteries won't last long if you're as slow at figuring out licks as I am. Get you the power transformer; I think it's one of those 5V types.  But again, for not having to convert tracks to some audio format and all that techno-stuff that goes with it, this is just what I was looking for. Just throw the CD in there and get to woodshedding.	1
I am learning Flamenco guitar and this little gadget rocks my world!  It allows me to take the CD's from my music books and re-queue parts and slow down solos so that I can hear them or play along.  There are many functions that I have not even touched yet out of the box but I knew that I could get it up and running for what I needed right off the bat--slowing parts down and really listening for those little innuendos that are so a part of Flamenco playing.  I imagine this trainer would work for any instrument.  It is amazing how it can keep key and slow the tempo.  Cool stuff.  I've relied on Tascam as a good name over the years for recording equipment that is reliable and lasts.  This little gadget is affordable and useful.  I am loving it and look forward to using more features as needed.  Battery life is not as long as a regular CD player (and the manual tells you that).  It is slightly disappointing that Tascam does not provide the A/C adapter with the unit (an extra $25 or so).  This may be a good option if you see a lot of use with the unit.  I'll be buying the adapter myself because 4 "AA" batteries will probably be eaten like popcorn by this trainer.  I still love it.	1
Not everyone has a need for this but if you do, it works very well.  It plays a CD well enough although if that's all you need then don't buy this.  What it does well is it can either speed or slow the tempo of what is on the CD without changing the pitch, or it can change the pitch of what is on the CD without changing the tempo. It also acts as a tuner.  And, it can remove center channel vocals if you want to just hear the music portion of what is on the CD.  Regarding the tempo and pitch change, it executes these tasks flawlessly.  Regarding the vocal elimination, it removes the vocals satisfactorily.  I don't think any machine can do a perfect job because there's too many hitches inherent in the recording, but this one does a good enough job so that the vocals are faint enough for someone to sing over and not compete with them.  Build quality is good - it is part of the Teac company and they make quality stuff. I bought a separate power transformer for this unit so I didn't have to worry about batteries, so I have no comments regarding how long the batteries last.  The controls and functions are neatly laid out on the panel and are easy to use.  The instruction book is easy to follow. This product does what I bought it for very well so I am happy with it.	1
Love my  tascam guitar CD trainer it's a must for all guitarists.	1
Wow! This really helps when you are trying to figure out the chords to songs!	1
nice and small	1
This things does so many cool things its hard to know where to start!  Really good for beginner - intermediate player trying to learn songs.  A lot has already been said about it but I like the fact that it is always set up in our "music room" ready to go whenever I want to sit down and loop through the song I intend to learn for the week.  No computer needed.  Just pop in the CD, find the song to loop and hit play.  This is just one of many cool features.  My guitar teacher thought it would cost about $500 but no, not even close.  Very Happy Guitar Player Now!  Get the powr adapter, Batteries (AA) last about 10 hours maximum.	1
Great tool for learning music.  Changes tempo and key.  Loop feature very handy.	1
This is a great product. I use it to learn guitar parts and practice with music, my wife uses it with her TC Voicelive Touch 2 Vocal Processor and TC Voice Solo FX 150 Monitor/Personal Amp. It works perfectly and I love the looping feature for learning specific parts. I found it to be very easy to operate. I purchased the Tascam PSP520 Power Adaptor from Amazon as well when I got this. Great features and easy to use. I also purchased the K&M Stands model 19740 Universal Tablet Holder-Clamp On, although it is designed for I-Pads or Tables, in my opinion, it works really well with this unit and you can clamp it to a mic stand and have it close for easy access.	1
good unit works for me	1
I make my own backing tracks with Band in a box and after I finish finalizing the CD, I simply put the CD in this unit and then make the adjustments necessary. You can change the key and tempo which I find very handy. You can also hook up a microphone to sing into and there is also a headphone jack to listen to yourself as well. I bought the CD version, I believe there is also an MP3 version as well. I am happy with this purchase, I have found this unit to be very helpful. The only negative is the power adapter is not included, (you have to buy it separately) so I just use 4 AA batteries, no big deal.	1
I had an older model. Love it. Broke it and had to replace it. I like the new model even more. Great improvements over the old model.	1
My original review was just one big bitch session about this machine, but I have grown to use it just about every day for practice. Even though it has to have a huge wall wart, and will not play MP3 files, and sometimes starts and stops like it is having convulsions, it is still a great tool to hear, slow down, and loop those songs or riffs you are trying to learn.	1
I am a DJ / music producer and have used quite a lot of headphones in the past and present.  These head phones are very stylish and sound good. They also seem solid. With that being said, they are quiet hefty. They are definitely not the most comfortable weight wise. I wish they were a little tighter on my head as well. I wouldn't recommend these for any recording applications and they are not tight against your head (unless you have a basketball sized head) and the sound will bleed out of these easily. I'd just use these for DJ applications.  I do have a problem closing them up sometimes, which never seemed to be a problem with other folding headphones I've used in the past. I wouldn't recommend forcing these if you are bending them in the wrong direction because they feel as though they may snap if you do. I am very careful with my equipment, but I could see this happening easily.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel the bass response could be a bit tighter. Also because of the comfort / fit issues. They seem like that were made for a much bigger sized head. I'm 6'1". I do not have a big head, but I'm not a smurf either.  I recommend these headphones for DJing, not so much for music production and definitely not for leisure. They are just to heavy to be comfortable for too long of a time period.	1
I bought these on a whim, I was gonna buy the Pioneer 2000's but I held off. Boy am I glad I did. These are amazing. They are complete on every frequency. I use these solely for DJing, and these capture the bass that I miss out on using other headphones. They are a little big, but I actually like my headphones a little bigger and with a little weight. I have other headphones, but these are by far my favorite for DJing. I don't recommend using them for production because it capture a little too much low end (which can be kind of a pain when considering playback), but these are by far the best headphones I have played out. You can find reviews all over the internet praising these as being the best budget end headphones that hold up to the very best the industry has to offer. So do your research, and if you get these you won't regret it. I fully recommend these.	1
These cans are worth some money.  My old Pioneer HDJ 1000's are total crap compared to these Allen & Heath Xone XD-53's, I put them up against my old set and the Xones are the win.  I hope for many more hours of enjoyment and I am hoping my new cans don't wear out like the last set. Still plastic down to the cans but they work for bigger heads memory foam on them make them squishy and comfortable.  People with small heads need not apply.  My head is pretty big and they can fall of my head.  The sound beats the Pioneers in my opinion 20 to 1.  I can hear alot of what I was missing I used Tangerine Dream's Legend soundtrack as a test and I can hear everything now.  The Pioneers are going to the scrapheap.  Get a pair you won't be sorry.	1
Reason Version 4.0 - Mac - Review 9-15-2008  In order to give a meaningful review of Reason 4.0 and the major improvements in this latest version of Propellerheads' music creation software package, I first need to state exactly what Reason is, and what it is not.  The most descriptive definition of Reason is that it is basically a "virtual rack mount studio", complete with a built in sequencer, faithfully simulated in a single software package.  For those who are familiar with rack mount studio units, Reason incorporates most (if not all) common hardware rack mount units you would find in a typical recording studio. This includes mixer boards, effects processors (such as reverb, distortion, chorus and flanger units, etc.), two very robust digital samplers which can use samples and wave files as instrumental components, a drum sequencer, a drum sequence sampler/playback tool, and several analog synthesizer units as well - and much, much more.  Each of these devices can be "cable patched" into one another within Reason in almost any conceivable combination, and all of the units look and act like their hardware counterparts would in an actual recording studio.  Also, you can "create" as many of these virtual hardware components as you need and the only limitation you have on how many you can effectively use is limited only by your computer's processor speed, RAM, and the sound card hardware in your computer.  Since Reason 4.0 uses software to simulate the functions of these virtual hardware units, having a high-end soundcard is NOT necessary to get the most out of the Reason package.  Any decent PC or Mac sound card or chip is capable of getting near perfect sound quality out of this package - even the basic sound hardware found in a standard off the shelf Mac laptop such as the MacBook Pro will do just fine.  As a digital music creation platform, Reason has been very good for years, with one noticeable feature missing:  The ability to record "live" instruments, such as guitars or vocals.  While this lack of live recording ability has always made Reason a questionably "complete" DAW  (Digital Audio Workstation) software package, what it lacks in recording capability it more than makes up for by what it does best:  Be a one-man-band/studio in a single box.  For those who are already using another software package such as CakeWalk Sonar Studio for live recording, Reason does have the ability to be "rewired" into other packages that support rewiring, such as Sonar.  As an add-on component to other DAW software packages, Reason adds a some huge capabilities to other programs and can more than stand on it's own for creation of any conceivable type of electronic music from hip hop to classical to jazz and far beyond.  If you are looking to do a lot of live instrument recording, you might want to look at another software package, but if you are doing something "instrumental", say composing a music piece for a television commercial, look no further.  Reason has you covered - in a very big way.  This basic description of Reason as a "one stop recording studio" was accurate for version 2.5.  While Reason Version 2.5 was very robust, there were several features that were noticeably missing:  - The ability to easily combine samplers or synths into "layered" instruments (more than one type of sound being controlled by a single sequencer track) - A coherent and robust piano roll / track view with typical visual components (e.g. as found in other DAW packages such as Sonar) - A mastering suite of tools for controlling final mix down of tracks into a final polished and well engineered song - The ability to change tempo within a music project by measure - A very robust and complex synthesizer capable of producing a huge range of different sounds  Starting with the last drawback first, Reason 2.5 and 3.0 contained 2 main synths:  The Subtractor Analog synth and the Malstrom Graintable synth.  Reason 4 also still contains these two instruments. While these two synths were plenty capable of producing a host of "vintage" style synths sounds, they lacked the kind of customization that can be found in other high-end digital music packages such as Apple's Logic audio software, making music such as "trance" or "techno-electronica" style music incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to do in Reason.  This has now changed in a radical way for the better.  More on that in a minute...  Reason 3.0 was a huge step in the right direction for Reason users.  There were two major advances in Reason 3.0:  - The addition of a FULL suite of recording and mastering tools including a parametric EQ unit and a compressor unit, (among others).  The mastering suite units were a huge leap forward for Reason because they allowed composers to control exactly how a finished song should sound - and even how individual instruments within the song should sound - and these units also greatly reduced the occurrences of audio-clipping which can ruin a digital recording.  As with all other Reason "hardware units" the user has the ability to create and use as many mastering units as needed for any given project, limited only by processor speed and the amount of RAM in the user's computer.  - The addition of a new rack unit called the "Combinator".  The Combinator was another giant improvement on the Reason package because it allowed users to "group" any other kinds of Reason units into 1 "package" or "group" and then assign the entire group to a single sequencer track.  This meant that a user could now throw a mixer, some effects units, and several instruments into 1 package and treat the entire package as a single instrument from within the sequencer.  Obviously, this stretched Reason's sound producing capabilities much further and allowed the user to create multi-layered polyphonic instruments with ease.  Reason 3.0 was a great leap forward, for sure, but there were still the problems of having a somewhat limited synthesizer capability (there were still only the 2 synth units, and Reason was still fairly limited in that respect), you still couldn't change tempos mid song (you were pretty much stuck with one time signature per song) and the sequencer still had several problems that made it difficult, frustrating and often time consuming when working within the sequencer itself.  With respect to the sequencer issues, there were several other problems, but rather than go into all the details of what was still wrong with Reason 3.0, let's just get to the new version of Reason: Reason Version 4.0 and go over how any and ALL drawbacks of Reason 3.0 are now completely eliminated in Reason version 4.  Reason 4.0 is probably the first version of Reason that has finally eliminated any and all potential weaknesses with this software package, and Reason 4.0 is truly a devastating creative tool for musicians looking for full-featured music creation, recording and engineering package for less than a thousand bucks.  This is especially true if you are looking to do any kind of techno, trance, or industrial music as the new "Thor" polyphonic synthesizer utterly SLAYS anything previous versions of Reason had in terms of synthesis of sound or synchronized sequences of sound.  Probably the biggest instrumental leap forward for Reason 4.0 is the addition of the "Thor" Polyphonic Analog Synthesizer as a new instrument found only in Reason version 4.0.  The Thor synth is an amazing piece of "virtual hardware" that allows the user to create literally thousands (if not millions) of possible combinations of sound generators, oscillators, filters, envelope controls, and even automated or hardware controlled sound parameters, which can handle almost any aspect of sound generation.  While Reason 4.0 ships with a fairly decent amount of Thor "instruments presets" pre-created, these prefabricated presets really only scratch the surface of what Thor is truly capable of.  When the sequencing hardware found within Thor is combined with various parameters of the Thor sound generators and controllers, Thor completely blows away any kind of synth found in previous versions of Reason, and now the Reason software package has the capability of producing the deep and complex types of sounds and sequence loops that are often only found in hardware synths costing nearly two thousand dollars or more. The sequencing generator in Thor can be used to create delays, arpeggios, small instrumental sub-sequences and all other manner of complex sound effects found in a lot of high-end keyboard synths, and this places Reason 4.0's synth sound generation and control squarely in Apple's "Logic" audio software territory as well as now putting Reason 4.0 on the same turf as higher end Korg and Roland keyboard workstations.  By using Thor in combination with Reason's Combinator and the already built-in digital samplers, the sky is no longer the limit for sound creation in Reason.  The Thor Polyphonic Synth is a HUGE addition to Reason version 4.0 and alone is well worth the price of admission by itself, but Reason version 4.0 doesn't stop there.  The second, and another very significant upgrade to Reason version 4.0 is that all of the previous drawbacks of the Reason 2.5/3.0 sequencer have been completely eliminated in version 4.0.  Like previous versions of Reason, you can color-code your track labels with a right click on the track header. You can now toggle between track view and sequence piano roll view with a single mouse click; each of the tracks can now be viewed with the sequence elements (such as note placement in the piano roll now visible in track view as well) as well as effects controllers and note properties fully visible with a mouse click or two.  If you are a person who uses the visual cues of your sequence elements to keep track of what is what in your song, Reason 4.0's sequencer is now on par with the robustness of other software packages such as Sonar Studio.  Also, you can now actually see the instrument (or Combinator unit) as a visual element of the left hand side of track view very clearly, and each track is now expandable individually, or as a whole.  Also, all of your automation tracks are now controlled by "automation lanes" contained inside the track header for quick and easy navigation of automation channels within each track.  Just these changes alone make working with Reason's sequencer fun, easy and very intuitive, and all of the sequencer controls now make sense from an ease of use and robustness standpoint.  You want to open up a sequence segment in piano roll?  Simply double click the sequence and Reason takes you right into piano roll, and places you exactly within the right measures - Reason even color codes and highlights the appropriate measures in question so no more hunting around for "those particular measures" you want to edit.  There is also one other consideration here:  You can now toggle piano roll in your main reason rack-mount view window - easily.  This is a huge feature enhancement for Reason 4.0 because now you can test your patch creations within the main rack mount window simply by playing the keys in Reason's piano roll, and you can switch between track and your Reason hardware units with a couple of mouse clicks without ever having to leave the main Reason window.  This almost totally eliminates the need to hook up an external MIDI controller keyboard to test out your new sound creations.  Of course, Reason has always included MIDI-capable hardware control via an external controller such as a MIDI keyboard, but now you don't need one to edit your sounds quickly and efficiently.  Another welcome addition to the Reason 4.0 suite of components is the brand new RPG-8 Arpeggiator which allows you to create custom arpeggios that can control various aspects of other Reason instruments.  This is another great tool for people looking to create techno-trance music or musical effects for instruments, and again extends Reason 4.0's capabilities further.  Having said all this, I haven't even touched on Reason 4.0's continuation of previous strengths such as the built in vo-coder, the robustness and flexibility of the NN-XT built in digital sampler unit, the Dr. Rex drum sequencer, the myriad of effects processors and the incredibly intuitive and visual design of the virtual hardware units in Reason.  What Reason has done extremely well with previous versions is now a whole lot better in version 4.0 while still retaining all of the elements that made previous versions of Reason great.  At $400, Reason 4.0 is an absolutely incredible value - being basically an entire recording studio in one box - and its previous weaknesses have been seen, faced, and dismissed outright.  If Reason 4.0 supported live recording and VSTi compatibility, it would basically do anything and everything you could possibly want, no matter what type of music you are looking to create.  Even with these two features missing, $400 is still a "steal deal" for this software package.  For $400 bucks you basically get a $2,000+ keyboard, oh, and that keyboard also happens to come with a complete recording studio.  Try and beat that, for the price?  You can't.  If all of this still isn't enough for you to get the job done, it is worth mentioning that there are literally hundreds of free downloads that you can get off the internet to "plug in" new pre-created instruments into Reason's various components and there are many commercial packages - both from Propellerheads and other companies - that can add whole new dimensions to Reason's sound capabilities that go far beyond the basic package you get from Reason "straight out of the box".  Not to mention the fact that Propellerheads also have several other software packages that expand Reason's capabilities even further - not that you would need any of them if you learn how to use Reason itself, but even a great program can get even better with add-ons.  If you are a beginner just getting into the hobby of digital music creation and recording on your PC or Mac, Reason 4.0's intuitive and visual interface can get you into music creation easily, and is a worthy product just based on that.  However, even a seasoned professional will find Reason to be a hugely flexible, robust and powerful application for professional quality sequencing, recording and engineering.  And, while Reason may not be able to record vocals or live instruments on its own, Reason's powerful re-wire capabilities and sampling units can easily integrate Reason's powerful features with your existing DAW software.  For example, you can create your instrumental tracks in Reason, then simply export the loop you created (or even the entire song) as a *.wav or *.aiff file for use in another application.  Conversely, you can record your "live music" audio files in another application, export them as *.wav files, then import them into Reason's NN-19 or NN-XT digital samplers and then engineer and mix down your entire song in Reason alone.  Bam!  Done.  When you are done with all of your hard work, you can export your entire song straight to a *.wav or *.aif file and go from there.  Sadly, Reason 4.0 still doesn't have a direct song to *.mp3 encoder, but that's not really a big deal since most computers these days have some easy (and often free) way to convert *.wav or *.aif files to *.mp3 format or to CD audio tracks.  Mac OS X, for example has a free *.mp3 converter as a feature of ITunes.  All of that aside, Reason 4.0 is still an awesome program and a significant upgrade from version 3.0, and Reason 4.0 probably gives you more bang for your buck than any other digital audio workstation package out there (minus the live recording and VSTi compatibility issues).  Reason is an amazingly powerful, robust, flexible and comprehensive music-making package worthy of addition to any home/PC-based recording studio.  The bottom line?  Believe the hype.  Buy it, and try it, learn it, love it.  Reason 4.0 aims to please, and you won't be disappointed.  One final note:  If the geniuses at Propellerheads give Reason 5.0 the power to include live instrument recording and native support for audio tracks it might be "game-over" for the competition.  Competitors take note...	1
If you check out what people were saying about&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PROPELLERHEAD-Reason-3-0-Windows-Macintosh/dp/B00093OLM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PROPELLERHEAD Reason 3.0 ( Windows/Macintosh )</a>, then you'll get an idea of what this software can do.  Reason 3 gave a lot of bang for the buck - if you're a first timer, you get Reason 4 for the same price, and that's a steal.  True, you still can't run VSTi plug ins or record live (miked) sound in Reason.  But the addition of the Thor synthesizer and RPG-8 Arpeggiator plus the significant enhancements to the already well laid-out sequencer make Reason 4 a tool/toy that will keep you out of trouble for a long time to come.  The new features add to the learning curve, but Reason's rack analogy still make it one of the most intuitive applications of its kind. For the most part, it's just like noodling with real hardware (watch your volume levels).  I would suggest that anyone running this program should have at least 1 gig of ram, preferably more, because Reason 4 has finally started moving the CPU meter on my 1Gb pc for some projects.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with this miracle of software design.	1
Rugged and sturdy.  Hard to beat!	1
What can you say about a shockmount. The podcaster mounts perfectly and it absorbs any movement nicely. It is SO much lighter than something like the shockmount for the Blue Yeti. It is exactly what I expect from a Rode product.	1
The shockmount is very well designed and fits not just the podcaster but other Rode microphones as well. In my opinion, a must-to-have accessory if you are using the Rode Podcaster.	1
Works just as expected. Assembles in a few seconds and isolates bumps and bangs, keyboard noise etc.  Couldn't be happier with it.	1
Excellent shockmount.  It definiately gives the Heil shockmount some competition.  And you can't beat the price!  Holds my Procaster microphone perfectly.	1
It works.  It is a little pricy, but it works.  No extra noise of someone whacking the table, or sliding something across.  It reduces that noise to nothing!  So super!	1
I ordered the RODE Podcaster and needed a shockmount that would work with it on the first try. I could have found a cheaper third party solution, but to be honest I wanted my Mic to have the products that were designed for it. That's why I went with the PSM1. It's got a perfect fit for the Podcaster and Procaster mic's. No real complaints from it thus far.  The shockmount is made from metal and seems very well constructed. The area that connects to the boom arm is plastic and it could strip if not careful, but so far it's been the right choice for the Podcaster.	1
I bought this to go with the Rode Podcaster USB Dynamic Microphone. The microphone and shockmount are very heavy, so you need a microphone stand that will be able to support the weight. Cheap plastic microphone stands will not do the job, so I recommend a metal stand.  The schockmount does the job, but the Rode Podcaster Microphone is terrible and had too many flaws. (I gave the Podcaster one star.)  I wouldn't recommend this product because it was made for the Podcaster.	1
Great product, takes the trembles and extra noise away: https://youtu.be/u2xtC2HIGzI	1
It's a great looking shock mount, well built. DOES NOT FIT WITH THE AT2020. Some people said it does in the Q/A. It doesn't. The at2020 is too large to fit into the hole. Plain and simple. Edit: I bought a metal filing kit and spent about 2 hours manually grinding down the rivets on this thing so my at2020 would fit into it, finally squeezed the at2020 in and it fit perfectly, didn't even need additional tethering (hot glue was the plan). So if you really want a black spider mount, you can grind this one down for the at2020.	1
A little light duty for the weight of the mic, but works fine at a good price. Handle with care.	1
Mated up to my Rode Procaster this a very nice unit.  If you have a Pod/ProCaster this is the unit you want.	1
I wish the tilled was more than just up and down. I still love the mic and the shockmount really helps from little bangs.	1
thank you ur a life saver .. i needed this for a long time & could not find it untill i saw ur add!!	1
I was setting this up with the Rode boom arm and the Rode Procaster.  This shock mount really isolates the bumps and jolts and transmits nothing to the microphone.  I've even moved the mic while recording and still heard nothing.  If you buy a Podcaster or Procaster you should buy this shock mount.	1
I played an upright Kay bass professionally and have standard Fender 4 string basses, etc.  and wanted to experiment with a 5 string setup without spending a ton of money.  This Dean bass is GREAT.  The body is sculpted at the tummy and right arm so the edges of the guitar doesn't cut into you.  The neck and fingerboard feels very good.  For most bass player support roles, this bass is good enough for any gig.  However if you are a bass soloist with complicated riffs and intonation needs, you will need a higher end bass with more pickups or hook this up to a Toneworks or equivalent to shape your sound.  Overall this is a very good solid basic 5 string bass for the beginner or advanced player....would make a good travel or gig situation where your equipment might get bumped around or dinged.  At this price point, this is the best bass around.	1
I've tried about three different brands of ukulele strings, including Aquila, and these are my favorite.  Compared to the Aquilas, these have a warmer, rounder tone, and that's what works for me.  You might want a different sound, and for that reason, I would still recommend trying other brands.  Ukulele strings are cheap enough that there's no reason not to try and figure out what works best for yourself.	1
These strings sound very nice, and feel soft on the fingertips.  In previous reviews, it sounds like the packaging was confusing, but my strings came in four clearly numbered envelopes (4 = G, 3 = C, 2 = E, 1 = A).	1
great starter guitar for beginners, very reasonable in price and shipped within the time limit. Highly recommend for starters. Also good quality, no complaints.	1
These are great for the money	1
I use this almost daily and it fits well. It sounds clear and has enough length to easily reach the belt-worn pack to which it attaches.	1
This was a replacement PG30-TOG headset to replace one htat just wore out under normal wear and tear. THe new one has the sweat "bead" on the boom which is an added aid. I still wish that the headset was adjustable, at least around the ear piece. For me it sits a bit too high. However, the product, along with all Shure products make up 100% of my "On the Road" mic equipment. Just glad I can get replacement parts. Mics and body-packs take a beating. Thanks!	1
Although advertised to work just fine on Windows Vista, that is misleading to say the least.  It comes with two sets of software that the publishers finally admitted will not work on Vista.  They do insist that the keyboard itself will work on Vista, so if you can find and buy some other programs that will run on Vista, it might work.  No, they didn't know which software to recommend.  And the instructions on how to use the keyboard were on the non-working software, so even if you do, you would have to figure out on your own how to use it on the new software. I returned it for a refund and am waiting for repayment.	-1
The stand is solid and looks great. I like the wooden top and the ease of adjusting both the stand and top. Very happy.	1
Quite sturdy and the tripod base is also surprisingly stable even on a carpeted floor.  I bought this used so I got it for about 1/2 the price!	1
I asked for a solid music stand last year to replace the metal frame one I had that that my kids used when they were in High School band. The thing was a piece of junk. One small bump and it would fall over or fall apart. My wife found this one and got it for me last year for Christmas. I can't say enough positive things about it. This baby is one solid like a rock stand. Easy to adjust and lock down. It can be used while sitting or standing. I have binders full of sheet music that are heavy and awkward and this stand handles them with ease. I've used it to hold my laptop while standing up to work and practice and it handles that no problem with no shaking or fear of falling over. That's one of the reasons I got the second one. So I can practice on my bar stool and access my laptop for recording. Works great and it's why I asked for and got my second one this year.  Now this might be overkill for some folks and not have a few of the cool items, like page holders that come with most stands made to hold music, but to me that's a small price to pay for what this one brings to the table. To be fair it's really a conductors stand not a music stand so some folks might miss this one, which is too bad. It's very well-made and worth every penny. I actually think it could have been priced higher based on what I have seen in the music stores.	1
I decided after reading about these guitars on the net, to try and build my own. (go to guitarattack for examples) Not the highest quality guitar but more than suitable as a starter build. The neck is in great shape, the frets are smooth and well seated. The body does have the worlds strongest sanding sealer on it. I sanded the sealer down so that it wasn't that thick. There were a few bubbles under the sealer that I had to fill after sanding it down. The body itself was three pieces of basswood glued together. I've read others claim 5 or 6 pieces on theirs but mine had 3. by the way don't be afraid of basswood, alot of $500 and $600 guitars use this wood. At the time of writing this I haven't fully built the guitar so I can't comment of sound and the electronics. I did a dry fit and all the holes lined up and the neck fit the pocket fine. You can find these cheaper elsewhere but I trust amazon and their partners more than ebay anyday. It did ship in a flimsy box but didn't have any damage.	1
I have built two of these guitars so far, the LP and the ST.  I modified the guitars by putting better pick ups in them and new potentiometers in them.  These guitars are pretty darn good for the money, and with doing modifications to them, you can get a guitar that sounds just as good as a 2000 dollar guitar.  Now here is the BUT...I think you must have fairly good knowledge of wood working AND electronics in order to build these guitars.  There are some steps that would be very difficult for a novice.  Also, problems do arise during construction, that you need to have knowledge on how to correct them AND the tools to do it.  For example, I had to route out pick up cavaties, and in one case I had to make a deeper neck slot.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is because of that.  The guitars aren't perfect out of the box but if you have the knowledge and equipment, and money to buy better pick ups, they are a lot of fun to build and fun to play once done!!	1
I have built two of the Saga ST10 kits and they are extemely simple to build. The only materials not furnished in the kit are paint, sandpaper, sanding blocks and a scroll saw. The guitars have nice balance and are very similar to my Fender strats in weight. The neck pocket is very tight and it helps to sand the sides of the the neck base to get a good fit. I would prefer solder connections to the push pin socket type, but there has been no problem with the connections so far. I painted mine with 1969 Corvette touchup paint and it looks like a strat from that era. The neck is actually nicer than some of my factory guitars.	1
I bought the Tele version from Saga. The G- and B-string tuner holes in the headstock were drilled too close together, making it impossible to fit the G tuner to the headstock and making it impossible to tune the G string accurately. Also, one wire was too short, so I had to supply my own. The distributor wouldn't correct the problem, told me to contact Saga. Saga never responded. The guitar is useless (wasting not only the money for the purchase but the cost of the paint, hours invested, etc). You don't want this product!	-1
The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far. This is a really easy tuner to use.  Highly suggest it.	1
Great little tuner that takes the guessing out of getting instrument in tune.  Battery seems to be holding up well, which means this little workhorse doesn't 'eat' batteries!	1
As the title says, this works pretty well for me in noisy environments.  However this only gets me close, I have to fine tune the strings by ear to get them acceptably in pitch.  There are other more precise tuners out there.  I keep this on my beater ukulele but bust out a different tuner if I need to do some work (restringing, setup, etc).	1
Works perfectly - plus the design is such that you need to clip to the uke neck. Works on vibrations through the neck - not through the "air" - as my guitar tuner does.  This is a great little deal and I would recommend - and some kind of tuner is needed for ukes - since they do not stay in tune worth a darn.  Might as well get this one.	1
This things works well and has switch between the two common tunings.  The only downside for me is I can't seem to adjust it to clip in an ideal position on the head of my uke where I can see it and it doesn't get in the way of the tuning knobs.	1
Was great, now does not pick up the sound of the string & is useless. New battery no help either. Another disposable product I guess. Trying the Snark next.	-1
I love this tuner.  Clips on so I don't have to balance it on my knee or on the face of the Uke.  Tunes by vibration so I don't have to have quiet around me (which I seldom do).  I wish I had one for my guitar.  It tunes quickly and it cost less than $15.  I am extremely pleased with it.	1
This product will only tune one of the strings. When I pluck the string it thinks each one is the 3rd C-string and tunes each one to C. I spent a lot of time tuning each string up and down trying to get the tuner to recognize it as a separate string, but no luck. It just keeps tuning everything to C.	-1
If you are playing in standard tuning either C or D this is a great tunner and I highly recommend it.  It is very easy and simple to use with only two switches.  Power and C/D scale.  The only down side to it is if you want to use a Low G string or like me have an 8 string ukulele it will not work.  It cannot tune the low G and high C strings.  If you are playing with the standards strings you need a tuner like this.	1
I'm never very sure of my abilities to tune a uke (or guitar for that matter) by ear, so I use electronic tuners extensively. I like this little guy because it is just that - little. It fits into my uke case without taking up too much room. It clips onto the headstock and detects tuning via vibrations. This is great if you are tuning in noisy areas. It has a switch to let you decide whether to chose 'C' or 'D' tuning -another handy feature. I have found it easy to use and despite the price, it feels like it is more durable than my previous tuner which broke on me after a handful of uses. It comes with instructions, but if you've ever used any other electronic tuners, its pretty intuitive out of the box.  I recommend it!	1
Plus side:  Good wood.  Appears to be some type of maple.  All connections are quick connects, so no soldering required (although we encountered a few cold solders) Neck pocket fit easily our Fender Squire (Indonesian) Tele neck. (Cosmetic shim on one side) Wood finishes nicely to natural with caveats (See cons). The guitar intonates and plays well.  Set up easily. The pickups are actually better than expected. Tone control is very strong, perhaps over the top.  I will check the K on that one now that I have played it to see what they used. Neck fit well into pocket.  Frets well placed and set. Neck is straight. We still intend on cutting the design in the headstock and interchanging them for fun.  Con side: The springs on the bridge buzz on the low E because they are floating on the spring. The pickguard holes were drilled improperly causing it to be crooked.  Currently not using pickguard.  May dowel and redrill. Had to repair electronics due to cold solders on the input and ground wire. If you wish a natural finish (Formby's Tung Oil high gloss) you will find the guitar body with a thick sanding coat of we guessed polyurethane.  Took a few hours to sand off. However the wood has nice flame almost white in color.  With a few coats of Tung Oil, it is very attractive.  All in all, with a few adaptations we ended up with a perfectly intonated playable instrument that has a single coil tone.  My son likes its tone, as do I. We will buy another one of these kits in the future and enjoy assembling it. For our first kit, we found this very well designed and documented.  A few minor issues, but no show-stoppers. We were able to assemble this kit in a couple days, less if you just painted the body and installed the electronics.  An additional comment...bought a tele bridge (Wilkinson) from Guitar Fetish and found that the routing doesn't match the kit.... Shortened the scale length and didn't fit the pickup routes.  Found one that fit... but had to dowel and re-drill the attachment points. Parts that didn't come with the kit may not fit, or will require some skill to fit.  No problem, but just don't expect it to be "telecaster aftermarket parts ready".  Replaced the pickups with 80s Japanese tele pickups.  Nice playing guitar.  Enjoyed the experience.	1
I bought the Tele version from Saga. The G- and B-string tuner holes in the headstock were drilled too close together, making it impossible to fit the G tuner to the headstock and making it impossible to tune the G string accurately. Also, one wire was too short, so I had to supply my own. The distributor wouldn't correct the problem, told me to contact Saga. Saga never responded. The guitar is useless (wasting not only the money for the purchase but the cost of the paint, hours invested, etc).	-1
The beauty of Leo F's original electric guitar design is that anyone could assemble it's components into a finished electric guitar using hand tools, and basic mechanical skills. That makes kits based on his designs a great idea.  The more time you want to spend learning how to adjust and set up your guitar, the better playing instrument you'll be rewarded with.  I've been playing electric guitar for 30 years, and I did not find anything actually defective in this kit. The pickgaurd was slightly malformed, but it does not affect the playability in the slightest. The pickgaurd and tuners were a little cheap, and I chose to replace them, but they were certainly playable.  The rest of the components were of very high quality, as good or better than anything coming from Fender's Mexico plant. The body has an extra tummy contour on the back, similar to an "S" style guitar, and the bridge is a top loader, instead of Leo's string-thru design.  One area that will require a little more than basic skill and hand tools is shaping the peghead. If you choose to skip this labor intensive, not-for-the-squeamish step, you will be playing your new guitar with a comically large paddle shaped peghead :D  Considering the value for the money, the fun and learning of do-it-yourself, and the quality of the parts, I really wanted to give 5 stars... but the cheap tuners and deformed pickgaurd made it 4 stars.  I never contacted the vendor or Saga for a replacement pickgaurd, so I have no idea what their response  might have been. I had already chosen to upgrade the pickgaurd in a different color.	1
First of all, this is not a Fender Telecaster.  It may look like one, but it's not one.  It is, though, a very workable kit, fun to build, and sounds and plays reasonably well. In fact, it does have the Telecaster twang to it.  In various reviews of Saga kits that you'll read on the Internet you'll read about cheap electronics and cheap strings.  I wasn't thrilled with the strings that came with the kit I built, but they're not terrible.  And, the potentiometers, wiring, and shielding may not be the greatest, but everything works, was pre-wired correctly, and the pickups are pretty strong and well balanced.  It's a little tricky feeding the wires from the pickups into the chamber where the potentiometers and pick-up switch are, but assembling the Saga kits is not rocket science.  This is about a half-a-step more difficult than the Saga PB-10 (electric bass) kit, but that's really only because of feeding wiring through channels and the fact that you need to be careful that you get the bolt-on neck put on squarely.  One thing to keep in mind, the body is treated with a sealer, so staining is not real practical, unless you sand the sealer off.  Painting, or even just a lacquer over the bare, sealed wood works well.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced electric guitar kit as a fun project, or to get more of an insider's knowledge of how electric guitars go together, these are worth considering.  One other thing to keep in mind, though, you have to be prepared to do your own set up of string heights, intonation, and so on, but that's part of the experience!  OK, so it's not a Telecaster, but you get to have some fun, just a little challenge, and it's way under $200!	1
I've been a guitar player for many years. This Saga kit is wonderful if you're a guitar player. If you're not a guitar player and you are considering building one for a friend or significant other you may want to have a guitar player help you with things like intonation and set up.  Pros Feels well made All the routing is done Instructions are mostly clear ( some kits don't even include instructions) I could keep going.  Cons Though you don't need a solder iron because they have these heat shrink connections you may want to have one handy. I am a klutz and broke the wires and had to re solder. But maybe you have a gentler touch. The strings are crap, but they are great to set up everything with and test.  Also you may want to get smart on how to finish guitars. It is a bit of a production. Belhen makes a wounderful kit that is on amazon with an instructional dvd that I found extremely useful for around 125 bucks.  Overall if this is your first attempt at building a guitar these offer enough hands-on building so that you can honestly point at the thing and say "I built that". More than just a quick assembly, but you don't need a wood shop to do build it.	1
tl;dr Solid kit, happy with result, be prepared to invest in hardware.  I got this kit and put it together. I took the pick guard, neck, and tuners and chucked those in the woods so the aardvarks could eat them (along with all the car radios that seemingly every young person removes and tosses in the woods before the ink even dried on the title). I purchased a Fender pick guard in black ($17 on Amazon). The pilot holes didn't quite line up. Drilled new ones, installed. The selector plate no longer lined up to the pilot holes, so drilled new ones for that, installed it, and it fits and works well. I picked up a cheap Chinese knockoff maple neck which had only tuner holes drilled. That was about $40 on Amazon. I had to buy new tuners from a local music store, nickel coated, $40. These are so much better than the cheap ones that come in the set. Because this is a mod and not part of the scope, I'll ignore the details there. Had I kept the kit pieces, it would be an easy install, so no issues there.  Wiring was easy (invest in an ice-pick for this project, or improvise with what you have. Don't thread the wires by hand!!). It is grounded on the bridge. Bridge install and selector plate install was also easy. The bridge looks cool, the selector and knobs feel solid. The strings go into the bridge but NOT rear guitar thru-body like proper Fenders. I see no reason why, if you had the skill and desire, you could not set it up that way, assuming you purchased more hardware.  The directions were clear enough, decently labeled. I had no problem with following the instruction after reviewing them 3 times before I did any work.  Once the guitar was assembled, with help from a guitar hobbyist friend, we set the neck, intonation, and action. Quite satisfied with the results. 12th fret is within a cent or two of being dead center tuned, it has low action, plays well, and in tune, no buzzing. The strap buttons hold my Ernie Ball strap snugly. It has a solid weight to it and sits well on your shoulder (unlike say an SG).  Sound wise, it has punchy rhythm and twangy lead. I'm very surprised by the pick ups. I play mainly punk rock and other rock styles. I expected to replace them but don't believe I will.  I haven't decided if I'm going to proceed in painting it. It looks slick as it is.  Now some bad: as cool as the bridge looks, the high e string doesn't sustain at all and looks to be because of the bridge. I'll have to replace the bridge which I plan on spending $20 or so to replace.  I contrasted the design of this guitar with a Mexican Fender Tele. The shape is slightly different (though I didn't notice until I did the comparison) and the body is maybe between 1/32nd to 1/16th of an inch thinner (guessing, didn't measure).  Overall, I love my guitar and I'll be getting more Saga kits in the future.	1
I recently purchased a tele kit from bargainmuscians.com. The kit arrived in six days from order date via Fedx. I bought this kit for two reasons. They offer a 14 day return and the neck is solid maple, no fretboard, frets are inlayed on the top of the neck. The body is basswood, but has a surprising amount of grain and the wood is darker than what I would expect from basswoood. The body is nicely finished and the neck is straight and no problem with the frets. The hardware seems to be of good quality and the kit came with instruction and booklet. Overall I am surprised with the quality of the kit.	1
NECK The nut was missing. I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....  BODY The shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.  PICKUPS and ELECTRONICS The electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.  STRING AND BRIDGE The bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.  PICKGUARD I didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.  FINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION At the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender.... So if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford: - new pickups and electronics, - new bridge, - new strings, - good finishing and lacquer technique  My suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts. It will cost you more but it will be your real Custom Guitar....	-1
pretty much this is a great case for the price but i would like more padding because i like my guitars to be safe but if you want a better case for protection invest in a hard case. i cant give it a bad review for not enough padding because this guitar has about the same amount of padding as most soft cases. this is also a pretty handsome looking case,if thats what you care about.	1
nice bag ,padding it good ,i just wish the hooks weren't plastic ,, not shore how long they will last,,	1
Despite an overwhelming petroleum smell coming out of the box, this is a high-quality gig bag with plenty of storage space. Fits either a Tele or Strat. I don't typically keep my guitars in their cases, but bags like this one come in handy for gigs, short trips, moves, etc. Nice styling touches, too. The bag has removable back-straps for carrying ease.	1
Excellent quality! It really protects and you can transport it in 3 ways; by side, as backpack and upper side.	1
I bought it to store away an old guitar, it does the job.	1
Hard to put the Strat away but it seems to like this gig bag.	1
A little thin for great protection, but generally OK for light use. Great price, though.	1
Recommended!	1
I use this all the time the strap hurts your shoulder. Other than that it hold perfectly. Even has a poet for your accessories.	1
Great price	1
Excellent	1
protects the guitar from dust and nicks and scratches in my closet!!	1
i will be sending this to my grandaughter and i know this will look great with the beginers kit i purchased	1
I"ll give it 5 Stars because it does what I need. It's cheap, fits well, and provides sufficient protection for my not-so-valuable guitar. The storage pocket will fit a strap, cable, and extra strings, but not much else. Again--all I need. If you are going to include stomp boxes and/or a 6-pack and a sandwich-- get a gig bag with more pockets. If you are going to put your $10K vintage Strat in it and hand it off to your roadies or airline baggage porters.invest in something bullet proof. I do a reasonable amount of gigging and have a few of these, but I carry my own stuff and they do the job.	1
Good product. Fast shipping.	1
Nice bag, fits the Tele or Strat perfectly and can be carried on its side or like a backpack...I only wish it had more pocket space, there's room for strap, strings, pick etc, but nothing too bulky.	1
Great bag to take care of my sons guitar.	1
the bag is cheap. It provides no protection for the guitar. The only pocket on the case is a joke	-1
This bag is simple yet it's really thick so it makes you feel like your guitar is safe, I have seen many gig bags rip, tear or seen the straps rip off them but not with this baby, its sturdy and cool, with its design and pick designed zipper, I didn't expect to be that cool	1
Great fit for the Starcaster or Stratocaster. Thin, nicely padded & easily loaded. I got this for my spouse to transit back and forth to lessons.	1
Well, it's a case and it holds a guitar. Not much I can write about it. I got it so that my Fender Starcaster collects less dust when standing on a stand. It's a nice tight fit. Check other reviews if you are interested about how it performs when used to actually carry a guitar.	1
My guitars largely stay at home, so they don't require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case.  Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more, and also take up about twice as much room, which is problematic for storing multiple instruments.  In most cases, a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs, and costs about 1/4 of the price of a hard case.  I bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag, and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles, which is a cool touch.  The case fits my Fender/Squier Strat guitars (or other guitars of a similar size) snugly.  There is not a ton of padding, but more than you might think from the pictures, especially on top.  The pocket is fine, and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps.  I can't say that the zippers will withstand years of use, but for most uses, they should do just fine.  Glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars.	1
Purchased for my Epiphone electric guitar... perfect... has a separate area for my sheet music, picks and capo. Nice bag... I REALLY like it!!!!!!!	1
EDIT: I just used the bag for carrying my stratocaster (in my house, just trying the bag) and the joints from one of the straps broke. thankfully I was using both straps, otherwise my brand new guitar would have felt in the ground... thankfully I think I can fix it (sew it up). -down grading from 5 to 3 stars-  My original review, 20 min ago: "It's a nice bag, looks nice, feels right, you can carry it as a back pack... I bought it for 25, the only thing that could make it better is a cheper price XD"  ---------------------- EDIT 2: It looks nice, but after travelling with it (wich implies I was carrying it as a backpack) BOTH straps started to get un-sewn from BOTH ends, so for avoiding and ugly accident to my strat I carry it with the side handle  -downgrading to 2 stars-  The padding is EXCELLENT though I'm keeping it, but please if you're buying it, be sure to look at the straps joints so your beautiful axe doesnt get hurt if they broke	-1
I was looking for a cheap gig bag for my squier vintage mod. and found this Fender bag. I do not travel with it a lot so I really didn't need a big fancy 60.00 bag. This bag provides adequate protection if not more than other bags at this cost. It had slightly thicker padding in the specs than other bags in this price range. The pocket is big enough to place whatever I need in it for accessories. A big plus for me what that it had the Fender name which matched my Squier guitar by Fender of course. I really do not have anything negative to say about it. It is what it says in the description and any time I get exactly what was stated...then I'm pretty happy.	1
Everything I would want in a gig bag! A quality bag for a quality instrument. What you see is what you get.	1
I use this daily with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Korg-CA-40-Chromatic-Tuner/dp/B000EE8YPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Korg CA-40 Chromatic Tuner</a>. The cord is longer than the Matrix one, at about 5 feet, and the clip is better,  opens wider and can hold on more surfaces. Works fine on the scroll of my viola (I'm a professional classical musician). I've used it for years without a single problem.	1
Good product. Recommended!	1
good price	1
great	1
I used it to hook a Korg tuner to an upright bass bridge.  I did not need what felt like a 150 ft cord.  I've gone through 2 of these and they've broken.  I use a clip on tuner now.	-1
wonderful	1
I love the Korg tuners and the one I got with my lever harp is a real whiz at getting the harp tuned to concert pitch. The only problem is that if you use the built in microphone, high back ground noise levels can really make tuning a problem. To get around this, I bought one of the old style cords that was basically a small microphone shrink tubed onto an alligator clip. On the harp, this meant that I had to clip onto one of the bridge pins to tune the harp without marring a $3,000 instrument.  These new clips are just as accurate, have a wider opening range and are plastic. Unlike my old cord they will not mar the wood or polished surfaces on a harp, guitar, violin, sax, clarinet, etc. I am using my old cord, with the alligator clip, on a dreadnought guitar by clipping the pickup to the high E bridge pin. It fits easily inside the groove on the head of the pin and does no noticeable marring to the instrument. I have never had a bridge pin fail on me, but I have lost a few so I keep a few spares around in my cases. If one gets to chewed up by the old clip, no big loss. I have also found that tuning from the bridge gives the most accurate tuning, although, attaching to the sound hole or neck head seems to work pretty darned good as well.  When teamed up with the KORG CA-40 tuners, one of the best bangs for the buck in chromatic tuners going right now.  This is a big step up from the old cords, and having a tuner with each of my guitars and my harp. I have compared the variation, using the same tuner and all three cords and all three tuners and not found much, if any deviation between cords and tuners. Not the best you can get, but you will have to spend a LOT more money to get anything that's marginally better.	1
Works great	1
Would recommend picking this up if you often play with groups.	1
Amazing transducer, it works incredibly well for its price. I get asked all the time where I found this little gem. 10/10 would recommend	1
aok	1
This is sold as a separate companion accessory for the Korg OT-120 Orchestral Tuner, though I imagine it would work with most electronic tuners that have a 1/4" phone mic input.  For my application it works great.  I wanted a mike that I could put in direct contact with my instrument, so that I could tune in an otherwise noisy environment without having stray sounds confuse the tuner.  This clip-on mike has a softly-padded jaw that opens wide enough to attach to the headstock of every instrument I've tried it on, from charango, to banjo, to guitar, to bass.  It picks up vibrations directly from the instrument, and pretty much ignores room noise, and I've successfully used it to tune even when other loud music was playing around me.  My only caveat is that it's high-end response tends to fall off little sooner than I'd like.  The mike easily picks up everything from the low B on my 5-string acoustic bass guitar, to the high E on my mandolin, but by the time you get to that high E you have to pick a little harder for the mike to catch the sound.  With hualyacho, which has some strings a fifth higher than the mandolin, I had to hold the mike against the body of the instrument to pick up the highest strings, which was awkward, but it worked.  However, for most standard stringed instruments, this a great mike to use with the Korg tuners, when you have to tune in  the midst of chaos.	1
Works very well with the tuner.  Just clip it on the bridge of your violin and get the accurate sound you are looking for as a beginner.	1
I use it with a Korg tuner. 4!stars because I get better results using a third party contact mike not available through Amazon.	1
Good	1
The Korg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tuners is a great product.  I would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument.  My instructor, who has been playing a violin for about 40 years, brought one to my private lesson recently.  Because it did not pick up extraneous room noises, it made tuning my violin for the lesson so much faster and easier.	1
Juist what I wanted good price and good quality. I would buy this again when I need another one Highly recommed,	1
My old tuner clip was at least 10 years old and beat. This is a great replacement and has been in daily use since I purchased it.	1
I bought this product 4 years ago and it still works flawlessly: it's simply a device that you connect through its 1/4 jack to another device (a tuner, most of the times) and you clip the other end to your instrument. I've never had any problem with it and it works perfectly to tune my guitars, cello and violin (I have not tried other instruments). I even connected my acoustic guitar to my amplifier with this device and it surely DIDN'T sound pretty but you could clearly hear every sound and every pitch played in my instrument and I just had a little fun doing it.  It is fragile thou, so you better not use it to tie your pet with it.	1
I have only used this with the Korg tuner and on flute so I can only speak for those applications, though I would expect it to be just fine with other tuners using the 1/4" phone jack input format.  The clip is very firm but also well padded so will not damage a fine instrument.  Highly recommended and superb value for money.	1
make tuning my son viola so much easier than the standard method no need to worry about the others around him drowning out his instrument.	1
It attaches nicely to my Violin,  It doesn't pickup so much outside noise this way.  I can also use it for my other equipment..	1
I have a Korg tuner but found that I needed this so it would not pick up sounds in the room and interfere while I was tuning my Dulcimer. Now I just plug this into the tuner and then  clip it onto the headstock of my Dulcimer. Now I can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise.	1
When tuning a piano or any instrument ,This clip microphone . makes tuning so precision .Wind instruments plus all string instruments . This is a must for me as old age tuners need all the help they can get	1
I got this, and I wasn't expecting a ton, but now that I have used it, and heard what it can do, I am really happy that I got it.	1
You need this speeds the reading of the tune, avoid interference coming from another instrument, and enable the sound back to work.	1
I purchased this just to test it out as a pickup for acoustic (nylon) guitar amplification for when I perform guitar at receptions. The sound quality is decent if you EQ the crap out of it, but I would never recommend it for amplification. I hold on to it regularly just as a backup if my other amplifier tweaks out.  As far as tuning purposes, it works just fine. And I've seen some contemporary music concerts where they amplify other miscellaneous sounds using similar microphones. For the price, it's worth purchasing as a fun experiment thing.  The quality is pretty decent - it doesn't seem ultra durable and sturdy, but it's not terribly cheap quality either. If you use it regularly, I would imagine it would last a while before it wears out, but it isn't going to last you forever.	1
I teach guitar classes at a community college and spend my days in a room full of twangin' 'n strummin' guitars. Human ears and tuners with external mics, including iPhone app tuners, have trouble in such an environment. Why? The cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines.  So I bring an extra beefy&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Seiko-Sat800-Durable-Style-Chromatic-Tuner/dp/B001E3BSKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Seiko Sat800 Durable Style Chromatic Tuner</a>&nbsp;and Korg CM-100L mic to class for students to use. And it works great: clip to the headstock and it isolates their guitar from the din and delivers a clean signal to the Seiko.  The Seiko tuner has hit the deck many times and still looks like new after a couple years. Unfortunately the CM-100L is not nearly as durable: wires are thin, delicate and prone to breaking. If I was the only one using the CM-100L, it would probably last for many years. But students are rough and can't stop themselves from tightly wrapping the wire around the tuner after they're finished (although I ask them not to). The wire gets stressed at the mic clip and/or plug and shorts out. I burn through one or two CM-100L per semester. I found a big gob of silicon sealant on stress points helps extend the life of the wire (electrical tape is useless).  Great product: easy to use and makes tuning in a room full of guitars a snap. Wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables...	1
It worked with my Korg tuner just fine.  I was hesitent at first, but it worked just as I wanted.	1
A must for any Hammered Dulcimer owner.  Clips easily to a bridge and plugs into my Korg tuner.  Works well and I use it to easily tune my instrument.	1
Bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer. The clip is a bit larger than I expected, but it just fits on to the bridges under the strings. If I had paid more attention to the picture on the site I would have known how large the clip is in relation to the 1/4" plug.  It does it's job, picking up vibrations from the instrument rather than noise from the room. Works well while other things are going on around you. It seems to track 'truer' with this clip than with the internal microphone, meaning it doesn't bob up and down as much. If that holds true for other instruments, I may start using this clip on everything.  I saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled Korg. The one I got is labeled, both on the package and on the clip.	1
I bought this to use as a mic for my cello, i plug it into a tuner and then a series of effects pedals.  It works great, minimal outside noise since its a contact mic, tone is good enough for me.  Very happy, was using a sm57 in my ambient drone outfit, and the sax kept getting picked up, not anymore!  This picks up the scratches and bumps that i make percussively which is a plus for me.  i'd recommend this!	1
I tune my guitars, ukuleles, cavaquinhos, and piano with various tuners, like the Korg GA-40 or Korg CA-40 or Korg TM-40, and I pair this Korg CM-100 Tuner Clip and the difference is huge.  You no longer have to worry about background noise  I clip it on the headstock of my guitar/uke/cava and it tunes them quite well.  On the piano, I can clip it on any part and it picks up on the tuner.  It works as well as most/all of the clip-on tuners you see on various guitars and ukuleles nowadays, but if you have one of the chromatic tuners that don't directly clip on (like the Intelli IMT series), then this will make it work 100x better (okay, slightly exaggerated) because the ambient noise is not picked up by the tuner's microphone.  I give this accessory high marks, and I highly recommend it.	1
Even though the product says clip on for tuners it works great for a pick up on my Dulcimer connected to a Pignose amp. I am very satisfied with the results.	1
I play for a few groups. At church, in a big band, and for a community band. This is great for those noisy environments where there is a lot of things that can interfere with the tuner. I recommend getting a contact mic. They aren't that expensive and are worth the investment. This one is built solid and feels like it will last a long time.	1
Very low price, this item works as designed.  I play in several groups including a symphony.  Now while everyone else is tuning up I can enjoy the accuracy of my Korg without other instruments affecting my tuning.  That plus the other trombones were impresed.	1
The clip on tuner mic works great.  It very useful for tuning around other people playing or warming up to be sure you are tuning your instrument, especially for beginners.  It can also be used to monitor your own playing within an ensemble to be sure you are maintaining your intonation under normal playing conditions.  I would recommend this as a spot check only, particularly if you are getting feedback about your intonation from other players or the conductor.  You can also use it in practice to verify the minor tuning adjustments unique to your instrument.  That said, you must develop your ear and learn to hear what is and is not in tune, and to hear yourself amongst an ensemble.  It does you no good to play a perfectly piched note, if the ensemble you are in is not perfectly in tune.  Tuning individually is absolute, but in an ensemble, it is relative.	1
This is a great accessory for my Korg CA-40 Large Display Auto Chromatic Tuner.  Just clip on the pegs of my violin and it really isolates the sounds of my violin from all outside noise.	1
I am so glad to have found this product here at the best price possible.  Better yet, I got it in two days without any s/h cost.  My boy loves it, and he's telling his band friends to get them here. Thank you, Amazon.	1
I really didn't need this, as even during ensemble, keeping the tuner on my stand will hear my tuba over the rest of the group so i can monitor during playing. But the mike is better with a full concert band. As i said, it works. Can't ask for more than that.	1
I bought this contact microphone for recording, not tuning, and it has been great.  I'm interested in ambient recording for experimental music. One of the first things I tried out was recording my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Timex-Expedition/dp/B000B545DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Timex Expedition</a>&nbsp;watch. I needed a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter to plug the microphone into my Sony&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/M10-Recorder/dp/B002R56C4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">M10 Recorder</a>. Then I cranked the gain on the Sony up to 10, and could hear the Timex ticking very clearly.	1
This is the second one I purchased in one year. The contact mic works well with my Krog tuner. Responses quick enough to be use during slow playing. The problem is its wire. I regularly roll up the wire onto the tuner for easy storing and carrying. After less than a year, the wire broke at both ends.	1
i play flute & sax...... this is indispensable.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Korg-CM-100L-Clip-On-Contact-Microphone-For-Tuners/dp/B000WGJ71U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Korg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tuners</a>	1
I recomment this contact microphone for use with your electronic tuner.  It works well with fretted instruments as well as horns.  I have used this on pianos also, but I find a regular mic works a little easier on a piano.  This items was inexpensive when compared to music stores, and it was delivered quickly.	1
The Korg tuner clip is absolutely perfect for tuning my violin...I attach it to the bridge and can set the violin into perfect pitch...THANKS	1
I bought this to see if it helped in noisy environments without needing a breakout box or other DI box with effects/tuner output.  It works extremely well, is quite compact, and gets my highest recommendation.  Inexpensive improvement in tuner ease.	1
Bought this for our grandson. He said it works fine.he wears the key around his neck. Chrome plating seems to be good quality for the very low price and shipping was free, good deal.	1
It's a drum key, it fits drums, it was cheap and doesn't look like it will fall apart any time soon. What more to say...	1
Ok.....absolutely THE best. Hands down.  I've tried many cheaper alternatives and should have just bitten the bullet and done it in the beginning.  Oh, well, you live and learn.  There is no other alternative to the original Roland Space Echo than this.  If you are trying to find that Classic tape delay sound, look no further, here it is.  Unbelieveable, you have to use it to believe it.  Overall construction is pretty much bullet proof.  Trust me, you get what you pay for on this!	1
I'm a delay pedals freak, I've owned and tried almost everything you can think of. The commons, not so commons, the weird ones, the overpriced ones, the "only forum ppl knows" ones, even the real RE-201.. and now I'm back to the regular industry standard delay pedals.. cos they are more predictable and great. Nothing can beat the simplicity and the versatility of this pedal. The EQ alone is worth the consideration, why? Cos you can set it up as an darker analog sounding delay (crank the bass and lower the treble), to thinning tape delay sound (opposite setting), or something inbetween.  I repeat, IT'S A GREAT PEDAL! While the uncommon delay pedals are great for experimenting especially in a bedroom, but these "standard" ones works better for me in a band & live situations. I coupled the RE-20 with the Vox Delaylab for my presets needs (another awesome delay pedal btw) on my pedalboard and all my echo needs are covered, in chocolate made from a holy tree in heaven :-)	1
I bought this pedal to get long and spacious delays for my reggae band but think it is absolutely awesome for many music types.  Preserve a nice analog sound that sounds great with any amp.  Long lush delays and a tap tempo make it a winner.	1
Nice digital re-creation of the classic Tape Echo 201. Easier to use and sounds fantastic. Great that Stray Cat Brian Setzer sound. I replaced a Boss and a Digitech Digital Delay with this pedal.  This pedal also has a nice Reverb. I recommend getting a power supply for this.	1
First, let me say that this pedal is an emulation of a tape echo, not a modern digital echo pedal.  As a previous user of a tape echo, the tape echo has a warm analog sound full of tape saturation and a very slight warble due to the deterioration of endless tape loop. This is quite different than the super clean sound of the average modern echo pedal.  So, in short, this pedal nails the sound of a real tape echo, but if you are looking for a pristine echo effect, keep looking.  OK, so the mode control has 12 settings. 3 of these settings are straight delay with no reverb, if you want that sound. The rest of the settings are slight variations of each other. The real control comes from manipulating the echo-intensity and the echo-volume controls. There is also a 'twist' effect that is activated by holding down the TAP pedal. This is a really intense effect, and won't be useful for most things, but it is pretty awesome.  Oh yeah, there is a tap pedal for setting the echo delay frequency.  So, in conclusion, this item is an awesome emulation of a tape echo, which is what I wanted.	1
I've been playing one of these since 2009 so I have a fairly well developed opinion of this device. Overall, the delay effect is the best on the market right now. It's a cinch to use, and having a tap tempo built right into the pedal is AWESOME. As a user (and abuser) of delay in my effects, I can tell you, tap tempo is KEY. The delay on this guy is warm and fuzzy sounding, for lack of a better word, and this has a lot to do with the analog simulation. Definitely a plus. The multiple tape head position simulation settings add a neat dynamic to the delay effect you cannot get with most other delays, which is also nice.  The reverb leaves something to be desired. I find to to be just passable - nothing special. This is coming from someone who is used to spring-mechanical fender reverbs, so my tastes may be coloring my opinion somewhat, but I find the reverb here to be a little dead sounding.  One thing that I definitely don't get is why there isn't a separate on/off pedal for the reverb, or at least a port on the back to hook up a switching pedal to do the job - that would've been quite handy. My sound is such that I frequently have a need to turn delay on & off, but I leave my reverb going throughout - there is no way to accomplish this if you are using this pedal as your primary delay/reverb box. This severely limits the usefulness of the reverb effect in my opinion.  With the exception of the aforementioned lack of a switching mechanism for the reverb, the selection of ports on this device are pretty good - stereo/mono in/outs, switchable direct out, a jack for an expansion pedal for controlling things like intensity, etc, make it a pretty flexible device.  My biggest complaint is that 3 years after buying my first unit, it developed a strange side effect - when the device is in bypass mode, the whole signal is cut out - this is NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR, in this respect the Space Echo should work like every other pedal in the market, passing the clean signal through when the effect is disengaged. Despite this I bought a second one, because I need that Space Echo sweetness for my rig, and anyway I am of the opinion that this is just a random fluke and not endemic in the line. I've had tons of BOSS pedals over the years and this is the first time -I've- had any problems with one, although it should be noted that a friend of mine bought a tuner not too long ago and it was bad out of the box. It makes me wonder about Roland's quality control as of late...  Anyway 4 stars: Pros:  - Awesome delay: the best on the market in a pedal.  - Excellent array of ins/outs.  - BUILT IN TAP TEMPO  Cons:  - Price: expensive for a single purpose guitar pedal. Arguably worth it.  - Reliability:  First one only lasted 3 years before developing a weird quirk.  - Lack of a switchable way to engage/disengage the reverb seems like an oversight.	1
Works as designed	1
Great Key! Great Seller!	1
Great, cheap, readily available drum key.  What's not to like? If I had to nitpick, I'd say: It's got a spot for a key chain, but it's so thick there, most people would break their fingernails trying to get it on a key ring.	1
On time and good value.	1
Awesome product!!!	1
Works perfectly. Only problem is I had to buy additional things to get it. Worth it.	1
WHAT MORE ??? GOOD FOR THE PRICE........OK PRODUCT.	1
It's a drum key, it tunes drums, it's built to last, it works, and it's cheap. Cannot go wrong. What else to say?	1
works	1
I own a lot of drum keys, mainly because I am forever losing them. I have a few of these laying around, but only because keys with holes for attaching to key rings and chains are not a feature I use.  These have a nice, slip-proof grip on the ears and the key portion fits the tension rod holes in my shaped wood hoops on a kit I have with those on toms and snare drum. Some of the fancier keys will not fit, so these are perfect for that kit.  If you tune with high tension these keys are probably not your best bet because of the short ears, which do not give sufficient leverage. I tune relatively high using so called 'bop' tuning, and these work well for that. It's the limit of the capability of these keys though.  The main reason I rated them so highly - aside from the reasons cited - is they are fairly inexpensive and you can purchase them in bulk if you are prone to lose keys. My main 'generic' key is the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CODA-DH-001-Drum-Key/dp/B000F9J5GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CODA DH-001 Drum Key</a>, which is even cheaper, but if you need a way to place your key on a string or key chain this model is perfect.	1
Excelent.	1
It's a drum key.  It fits.  It even has a hole for a lanyard or whatever.  Buy it if you need it.  Real deal.	1
works great.  solid metal	1
Cheap and easy, just like your mom.	1
These drum keys have been around for ages and they work just fine. It has a hole so you can put them on your keys if you please. Not as fancy as the pearl one, but works just fine.	1
excelente producto. 100% recomendado	1
Nice feel...	1
Need a spare key. Get it!	1
Thanks	1
Its a drum key, and does what drum keys are supposed to do. This is better than any 10 dollar drum key.	1
There is not much to say... It is a good quality drum key made from a very reputable company... Gibralter.  Does what it is supposed to do.  I would definitely recommend.	1
Not much to say.  I am not sure what you can say about a drum key. The key works and it was cheap.	1
I love this thing! Several of the choir musicians bought these and they are sturdy and work very very well and I love the extra width!  You just can't beat the quality.	1
Wider than I thought it would be, so it has some inherit question about longevity if people press down on the ends. So instead of using as a teaching stand, I took the plastic stand off of the Keyboard and now use this one there. So far it has worked as advertised. For stability, I should have bought the double legged one, and I might in the future acquire it. Manhasset stands have a great reputation, and other then they have gone to nylon/plastic (not sure) for the main swivel mounting joint for the holder part, quality still is there.	1
Easily holds 4 pages the foot is more compact than my other stands. Serves the purpose of design well.	1
I have several Manhasset stands, but this one is the best ever.  It's wider; it holds four sheets side by side!  Like other Manhasset stands, it's sturdy and beautifully made.  It will last well past your grandchildren's life.  This is the music stand that you want!  You should buy it now.	1
Finally! I can clip the music out of the book, tape them together 4-5 pages long and not constantly fight to keep them on my music stand! It's exactly what I needed but just a heads up this guy is huge! Assembly was a piece of cake & this thing is a built like a tank.	1
Excellent stand. I highly recommend it	1
This will not hold a book with weight. I sinks right down on it's own.	-1
great	1
Overall still a good stand even if some of the parts are now plastic; they are strong plastic and last well (this is also the brand used at my kids' school). And still made in the USA. I like the wider stand for learning to play and sing guitar with music scores more than 2 pages and have found it sturdy, etc. It can be raised fairly high so I can easily stand, play and sing without having to look way down.	1
It's still as good as ever as expected, this, the standard in music stands, tough, classic, and totally necessary for me where I'm reading four and six page scores composed and arranged by my husband, most of the music tough and flying fast with no chance for a page turn.  Packaging is excellent, so it comes without a scratch. Easy to assemble. Unlike others, I've had no problem with the stand sinking.	1
Just got this a week ago and I am generally delighted with it.  One caveat.  I read some of the other reviews and several people remarked that the shaft attached to the desktop would not remain extended if too much music or other weighty items were placed on it.  Based on that analysis, I ordered the recommended Manhasset ShaftLock Model 2400.  When it arrived, I attempted to install it, but it became very obvious that the design of the shaft lock is incompatible with the M51 music stand.  There is a tiny slotted screw on the shaft lock which is supposed to be tightened to the extent that the shaft lock will bind to the black tube below.  You can then turn the twist sleeve on the shaft lock left or right to raise/lower on the one hand or lock the chrome tube in place.  Sadly, since the shaft lock does not bind to the lower black tube, the whole concept fails.  It was annoying enough that the shaft lock had to be separately ordered and arrived several days later.  It was even more annoying to waste the time trying to get it work.  I called the Best Service Store phone number (the people who shipped the shaft lock), but they did not answer the phone or respond to a voice mail message.  I then called Amazon and they quickly sent me a shipping label to return the item and I will receive a credit after it arrives.  As I nearly always play sitting down, it is not too disappointing that I cannot raise the desktop with any significant amount of weight on it.  For that reason, I chose to give the unit 5 stars.  It is a really a pleasure to use, having used a smaller stand for years.  Someone who plays on their feet may well feel differently about the rating the product deserves...	1
it can hold three sheet....... thanks.	1
This music stand is awesome! I have wanted a Manhasset stand for a long time, because I was pretty sick of the rickety wire contraption I bought when I first started playing.  This is such an improvement!  Plus, having a stand that fits four pages is awesome, because then you don't have to deal with as many page turns.  Overall, this is a great product, and I would definitely recommend to a friend/buy again :)	1
good for those extras long big band charts!	1
At first I was skeptical that this would be weak because it only has one middle pole for the very wide stand, but after assembling it, it is as sturdy as any of the other Manhasset stands.  I highly recommend this for any directors, as it is much easier to use than the normal size.  Solid quality, and exactly what you should expect from Manhasset.	1
Title pretty much says it all. I don't like having to go search through my shelves or carefully take one book out and put another one back every time I want to switch what I'm working on - especially the stuff I'm using most of the time. This lets me leave a Real book out, a binder with songs I'm working on, along with some handwritten practice schedules and things I've clipped directly to the stand.  It also does hold four sheets, though you have to either overlap them a bit or leave them hanging over the edges. No big deal for me either way - loads better than my 'normal' stand, which I've moved to next to my desk where it just holds a copy of The Real Book for when I'm doing online chats and I know that's the book that's probably going to be used at some point.  I've got a 'cup holder thing, that I can't imagine using to hold a drink (you'd need to raise the stand super high to get it in and out easily) but it has two other square 'boxes' that hold my metronome, tuner, timer, some pencils, my nail clippers, capo, and all my picks as well as some other bits and bobs (string changing stuff - that goes in the 'cup holder' part).  That and a chair and I'm pretty much good to go for a full practice session without needing to keep moving to the bookcase to swap things in and out every fifteen minutes. If you've got your shelf somewhere near the stand, then you're golden.	1
This is a very nice and sturdy music stand. I had see these stands and the college and they seem very nice. So when I desided to get myself a good music stand it was a no brainer.	1
In addition to allowing a full four pages of music to be displayed, this stand is perfect for a book opened to two open pages, another closed book or single sheet,  and a 10 inch tablet in landscape orientation. Tablets in particular are becoming ubiquitous because of the plethora of sheet music management apps and other functions they serve on stage and in the studio.  Out of the box the stand will not more than ten pounds before the inner shaft starts to slide down from a 'locked' position because of the weight of binders, tablets and whatnot. Fortunately this is an easy fix with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Manhasset-2400-Shaft-Lock/dp/B000P63QHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Manhasset 2400 Shaft Lock</a>, which will allow you to put up to seventy-five pounds of weight on the stand.  Even with a tablet, a Real Book and a full binder the base of the stand is rock solid. For outdoors use, though, the desk portion of the stand has a little too much 'sail area and can be toppled in a rising breeze. I wish Manhasset offered a perforated desk as an option.  Small quibbles aside this is practically the only stand I have found that will fully support thirty-two inches of paper - four open sheets - at a time. That reason alone earns it five stars as far as I am concerned. I do with the shaft lock was included as an integral component instead of as an add-on, but at least it's available. I highly recommend including one in your purchase because it is needed if you plan to place anything heavier than a binder on the stand.	1
Great Transaction / great communication from seller and very fast shipping.  This music stand is solid and will hold heavy scores without tipping all over the place.  The larger size is wonderful, because you can spread out sheet music if necessary, and it makes the task of just turning pages in a heavy score, markedly easier.  I teach private voice, and all my students have remarked on how much they LOVE this music stand.  It was a wonderful investment from a very good seller.  THANK YOU!!	1
This is a beast!  No more dropped pages.  Why every stand is not this size is silly.  Have a music partner, you need this stand.  Play an instrument with 2 hands?  Who doesn't.  Why turn so many pages?	1
Wasn't able to find any other stands that is this wide, apart from attachments to 2-score stands that extend the width.  The tripod stand isn't too stable on a carpeted floor, and the telescoping post uses friction to keep it in place, so if you put something heavy on the stand, it might slip down.  I solved that problem by getting a rubberized clamp over the base of the telescoping part to keep it from slipping down.  It could have been designed better, but there aren't any other choices out there for 4 score wide stands.	1
I am a beginning pedal steel guitar player and have been searching for the best tuner for this instrument. I believe I hae found it with this seiko tuner. It is very easy to read and sits on my music desk more securely than I thought it would. Although it is somewhat delicate, I imagine I will get a lot of use out of this tuner if I take extra care while handling it. A bit high in price, but I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it, especially for pedal steel players who need the fine tuning increments.	1
The Seiko SAT1100 Chromatic Tuner is an accurate and very fine tuner. Even though I am thoroughly satisfied with it, however, I do believe it is overpriced. I have a twenty year old Sabine ST1000 Chromatic Tuner and DT-1 Korg tuner. The display dial on the Seiko is the main feature that appeals to me over the other two, but the price differential is substantial.	1
excelent	1
I love the amount of light you get from these for the price. The built in microphone works well, you just have to have the music up load or the speaker really close. I actually prefer this old halogen technology to the new LEDs because they put out a lot more light for a lot less money. This is a good way to fill up a large area with a cool effect light.	1
Lots of fun. Lights dance to music and the steps of our fashion models. Takes quite a bit of volume to make it work though. Crank up the sound and have fun. It is BIG and heavy. we just set it on the floor and it is very efective.	1
Nice clamp for the price.	1
I use these for all of my lights and they work perfect! They allow for quick mounting and dismounting. No complaints at all!	1
If you are looking for great light stand with loads of mounting options and a solid build, look no further - this is the stand to buy!  PROS: great build, lightweight, flexible options for mounting, 10' height extension  CONS: no carrying bag, tubes may not withstand traditional C-clamps too well  I have 4 Chauvet LX5 (also from Amazon), a strobe and an 8" mirror ball.  This stand is perfect for mounting all of these lights and is very stable, even when extended to 10'.  All the connectors are plastic, but are a softer compound PVC, so they aren't brittle.  I tightened all of the hex screws down tight and they hold up really well.  The multiple arms definitely gives you enough flexibility to mount your lights in various configs.  I actually had two ADJ Vertigos mounted inboard with two Chauvet LX5s mounted outboard and the stand was solid.  The legs provide a wide enough base that it provided tons of stability.  The adjustment knobs and safety pins are built well.  I can see this stand lasting long.  My only gripe is that it didn't come with it's own carrying case.  Yeah, you don't really need one since it all collapses neatly, but if you are like me and you want your equipment to last longer, go buy a carrying bag for it.  It makes a difference when you travel.  Overall I am very pleased with this light stand.  I highly recommend it for any gig!	1
stand was WAY bigger than expected, it holds all my lights without a problem even the lights that weight 12 pounds are held securely by this stand. i will hold up to 8 PAR 36 cans on the top t-bar (with some extra clamps). in will hold 2 small lights on the arms or one big light. if you purchase this it make take some time to assemble as the manufacturer expects you to know how to put it together (no instructions in box)	1
Very sturdy.  I admit, it wasn't the easiest to assemble (this is my beginning to my light show).  Once I got it up and going, I was able to hang my lights with very little effort.	1
I don't normally write reviews but this thing is garbage!  This is my second set of these two different brands and I'll never buy this  style again!  Plastic into metal? I had to screw some bolts for extra support because the ends kept slipping out, really annoying.  Spend the extra money on a better quality stand, trust me.	-1
This is a great light stand I rated it to stars because there were parts missing when I received it I had to do a lot of running around to find part because I needed the light stand for a big gig the next day	-1
Good quality build but no instructions. If you take a look at the pictures and experiment a little You can figure it Out. Mine came quick in great,condition and had all the hardware.	1
Amazing quality for the money.  Interesting, though, that the shipping comments of a year or two ago still apply.  The boxes were damaged upon arrival, one unit was scratched slightly.  All parts and pieces were there, though, so no action was required.	1
Very sturdy , easy to set up and take down . If you need a light stand and price is an issue, I would recommend this product.	1
I'm a mobile DJ and trust me when I say that using this lighting set up puts you in a whole other catorgory from your typical weekend laptop DJ.  Once fully set up, this thing is huge and commands respect.  I use it with my lights permanently attached and this make the setup and tear down much easier.	1
strong	1
good product	1
Excellent product. Fast shipping. 100% guaranteed. Easy to install and gives certainly a mounted see the lights. I like this product. Although it should be noted that should come with the appropriate tools for the special screws and pass work to get it.	1
Bought this for my church.  Not much to say except that it is easy to use and works well.  We installed this unit in our sound mixer system and record our service every Sunday.  Have been using the CD-RW900SL for over a half a year now.  Records every time with very good results.  I would buy it again!	1
A very high quality product which will produce professional results.	1
Bought this item years ago to record church services live. Previously the services where recorder onto tape. The quality is amazing and the church loves how we can create tracks on the fly. Each speaker is placed on their on track so it is easier to listen to a specific part later if you wanted to replay a certain speaker only. Amazing unit for the price. Place an audio compressor in front of this unit though or somewhere in your signal path if you are new to digital recording.	1
works great, very logically layed out and simple to use...definitely recommend this unit...my only wish is that it had an output volume...but that's not a problem at all...great unit!	1
Was busy with a CD recording project with a hard deadline and my last CD recorder stopped working.  There was no time for a repair and I needed a replacement fast, but I didn't want to get another of the same one that had already failed me.  I went for the TASCAM CD-RW900SL and I don't regret it one bit.  It arrived two days later, still in time and exceeded all of my expectations.  It has become my new workhorse for CD mastering.	1
This is a great product made by a great company  I love it I highly recommend it to everyone yes	1
Love the performance so far. I do not know if the tracks can be set to changed auto when recording.  Right now I am pushing the record button when I need to record to keep the track time down 10 minutes..	1
It took a couple tries to get the sequence down, but it performs well and finalizes the CD much faster that the other recorder we had. the CD recorder has a lot of features that I have not tried yet, just basic recording of live sound. I like the front load system compared to the tray system which sometimes would not open.	1
We use this for recording sermons at our church. I love that it is rack mountable. We installed it and it has worked perfect for us.	1
Listen for less than $40, including shipping, this lighting stand is worth the money.  It feels sturdy and the easy quick change lighting bar makes this a must have for the mobile Dj.  I would say that it would be a waste of money for a club Dj that can mount their lights in a more permanent fashion, but for those of you that need to be flexible and mobile, this stand is a must have.    If this is not the stand for you then good hunting.  Thanks, Dj Izzy	1
good stand. it has a well built t-bar shape and its very light. it holds up to 4 lights and it folds really small. its very sturdy and easy to set up. but this or go with the truss system which takes 4x longer to set up and is abnoxiously big.	1
First I received it broken but I fixed it because i needed it . And when i put my lights on it , it broke in 2 different places. It is made really cheap and it is really thin. It is not a durable or dependent stand.	-1
Sturdy.  I have 2 strobes and par light and a fog machine 9 ft up and its pretty stable. Once I get the rest of my lighting I plan on getting a second one.	1
Product was not as advertised. When I received it and opened the stand it was clear that it was used. Had many wear and tear and chips on the paint. My only regret was not having opened this package sooner so I could return it. Do not recommend this stand.	-1
Received Open & Damaged Item.   I want to return this Item.	-1
Structure is a little lite, but works.	1
Surprisingly this is a good stand for the price. Lightweight, easy to adjust and has a square bar. Some of the plastic pieces might not hold up to serious abuse, but could be replaced with something stronger. For my purpose (in the practice space or occasional acoustic gig), this stand holds 4 led par cans without too much fear of being knocked over. Granted I'm under 7' to clear the ceiling. At full height, it does start to  bend. This isn't a deal breaker in my case as I needed something under 7'.	1
Light stamd good for my band	1
Light weight. Easy to use and very portable. Holds 4 lights. Easy to put together. very sturdy	1
awesome!	1
Replaces the original from American DJ. I needed a lightweight stand that is durable and easy to set up. Seems to be built a little better than original, with a stronger tree. Most of these stands require no overtwisting  the knobs for tightness, or it will strip out.	1
Are too thin to load lights and not steady. I have 2 Speaker Stands and you will see the difference on the pictures. I had to return immediately. Are not safe. Package arrive with damage also.	-1
Great at mounting black lights or stage lighting... worth the money and high quality.	1
don't expect to much for the price Note the top bar its a square tube way smaller than the 2 1/2 inch thick tube of other ones, so o clamps won't fit, be aware	1
Pretty strong for the money. Wish legs opened wider for more stability with unequal weight.	1
good job and I love this item.	1
They are good quality but not very heavy duty and should not be loaded with heavy lights.	1
Very lightweight but also durable!! I love this stand and wouldn't hesitate to buy another especially at the very low price tag!!	1
Pretty solid stand, I have 4 lights on it and it feels like stand can take a lot more weight then my lights at 30 lbs.  Also, this stand comes with bolt/studs,washers, nuts, and fly nuts for all 4 holes (yes hardware included to hang light-no clamps needed).	1
I like the quality. Made up of really good metal and very stable. The price is really affordable for the quality.	1
perfect for the cash! SOLID up to 7ft then only a bit wobbly. Small room acoustic show is what I use it for.	1
Nice stand for the money.	1
I am enjoying this stand. I use it all th time. It is a must for every DJ with lights.	1
Strong. Tall. Good.	1
Very Strong lighting stand, i love it	1
Cheap and broke easily.	-1
This is not a professional (normal/ standard size) light stand. the poles are thinner, smaller. It has little crank handles, little non traditional parts that would easily get lost if you had to use this for any reoccurring or professional use. something you would expect to buy at Spencer gifts or a novelty shop.... if there was something advertized by Ronco like: "Band in a box: for $499.99 you get a drum set, a guitar, a bass, a microphone, AND A LIGHT STAND" all included... This would be the light stand you would expect to get. nothing wrong with it, (it did work) but its more or less a toy.	-1

Great stand	1
Very happy with this item. It's very sturdy. I have 4 par lights on it with 2 dj moving lights and a small fig machine and it held with no issues. Packaging was good as well. Was delivered fast on time .	1
As soon as I opened the box and saw it I knew it was cheaply made and not sturdy at all. Ended up buying the Odyssey brand instead.	-1
Very good product for the price and fits all my needs as a DJ.	1
Great corner stand	1
Nice light stands	1
Great Product	1
Good product love it	1
Not bad for entry-level. Cheap knobs may not last too long depending on your application.	1
So far this works like a champ. If you're going to try and attempt to put more than 4 lights or really heavy lights I wouldnt. I have an American DJ laser, Chavet Flower Light and 2 RGB LED Lights on it and it holds just fine. Just don't put too much on it.	1
now I can mount all my lights on this stage light very good to have	1
awesome stand for mobile DJ!!! Will be buying another one soon	1
For the price you can't beat it!	1
excellet	1
I like this stand, I don't recommend mounting anything too heavy.  The knobs are plastic, so, don't tighten them too much, because the nuts can pull out of the bracket (that's what happened too me). Not a bad stand, the legs are adjustable for stability. I've had mine extended as high as 8' tall.	1
perfect loved it! worth every penny	1
I have worked in lighting design for years and I find these stands great for the lights I hang on them. These stands are not ment to hold source 4s or other heavy lights.	1
Perfect light stand.	1
Held the two lights we purchased without any problems. Haven't tested it with more weight than that, but it did exactly what we needed it to and was easy to set up/take down.	1
worked great have even repurposed it for sound effects.	1
For the price it is great. Easy set up great for be so cheap I would bye more  if needed	1
For the price I probably should give it 5 stars, but will stick with 4. The weight limit seems right on, if not a little high. I put about 23 pounds of lights (all LED). Once all the cables are on I think it is pretty much at it's max. I feel nervous getting it to it's highest height, but like I said in the title for the price I shouldn't complain. I am no pro so these are a great start stand. One thing to point out is that the T-bar is not round. Not that that is a big deal, but I didn't realize it. Since it comes with the bolts to hang the lights it didn't matter for me. I actually like the bolts so I didn't need to buy a hanger for all of my lights. The other thing to point out is that at each end there are actually 2 bolts about 3 inches away from each other for a total of 6 bolts on the top. I had planned to use 4 lights on it and had to take these bolts off so the lights could fit. I consider these extra bolts so no big deal. If you just need a basic starter stand these are great. If you really need to hang 30 lbs or more I would say spend more money and get better stands.	1
I use two of these for my cover band.  Would expect to pay more for anything better, I'm very satisfied with it so far.  I attached 4 Par LED, and hang a mini KANTA underneath and the stand is stable.  We position next to the speaker stands facing the band and it works well.  Fits nicely in the On Stage SSB6500 carry bag with LED lights attached.	1
This is what I needed and it works great thank you! From Adam's DJ Music Entertainment you guys rock! Thank you so much!	1
The picture does not show that there are actually wing nuts for up to 7 lights.  4 below, 3 up top (if you used the mount wing nut).  It stands about 8ft high.  The t-bar is actually stronger because of the square design (unlike someone's bogus comment about it).  My only concern is when I have one of these suckers loaded with 4 PAR38s, a DMX dimmer pack, and 3 effects LEDs on top, it is heavy.  Once I start loosening the sections, they like to come down with a crash if I'm not paying attention.  No problems so far, but I think I'm ready for a real light truss....KA-CHING $$$.	1
Rugged and easy to set up. Easily holds my American DJ scanners and additional lights. Wide base so it won't tip over and 3 telescoping levels to bring it to any desired height	1
This item is just right for start-up lighting use. The price is very affordable and the quality is excellent. I recommend this  item to any sound company or DJ that need an inexpensive light pole that is of good quality.	1
I had to spend 25 dollars to modify this to fit the equipment I bought it for. The stand tubes were too narrow and when I received mine, it was broke. I was able to make it work after modification, but who likes to "modify" something they just bought when they believed it would work in the first place. Wish the stand was taller as well.	-1
These stand need to be made a little thicker because they bend when they are put up to the top of the limit. From the second tear down they seem to be OK but after that they bend.  The poles need to bigger in diameter.	-1
I work as a DJ and lighting technician in a small club. We're not a huge operation, so our lighting is what we like to call minimal but effective.  In any case, its few enough fixtures that everything fits on here. On any given night I may be running an asteroid, a moon beam, a laser, a pair of LED bar chasers, a strobe and some pinspots.  I usually don't mount the pinspots, as they're typically used as uplighting on the DJ booth, but everything else may find itself on here.  The key to a safe lighting package is balance- The two LED chasers are identical, so I usually put them on either far end.  The moon beam and asteroid aren't quite the same size, but when you use the inner two mounts, its not as important.  In any case, my laser unit is fairly small, enough to just about make up the difference, so I mount it on the same bolt, on the opposite side of the cross bar as the lighter of the two. The heaviest item, my fog machine, when I want it up high (sometimes we run it from down low, where its easier to refill for really long nights) I put right in the center, on top of the cross bar, using the same nut/bolt that holds the cross bar to the vertical bar.  You can mount two items on the same bolt like that- one on either side of the cross bar, so as long as you keep everything balanced and stay below the maximum weight for the unit (we don't want any accidents) you could possibly mount as many as 13 items on here (the picture shows four hanging points, the crossbar actually has two more mounting holes not shown, plus one item on top in the center)  Again, just make sure to keep the total weight reasonable.	1
I went to Guitar Center to get a light stand for a small house party (20-30 people) I was having and the only products they had was an $90 stand that looked just like this one or a $200+ Truss system. I am not a professional DJ and I certainly didn't want to pay more for the hanger than I was paying for all of my lights combined, so I looked on here and saw this product. I was hesitant to order because of the negative build quality reviews, but went with it any way because I didn't want my lights sitting on the floor.  The product arrived, I assembled it in under five minutes, and mounted my lights and a power strip (with twist ties) in another 15. Nothing was broken and the stand supported my lights just fine. Only one of my lights, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Chauvet-LX-5-Moonflower-LED-Light/dp/B0012T6FSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Chauvet LX-5 Moonflower LED Light</a>&nbsp;fit into the screw holes provided, but really that was the only "professional" size light I had. I used two wire coat hangers to hang my mini strobe and my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mini-Sound-Activation-Starry-Effects-Laser-Star-Projector/dp/B005EPN79C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mini Sound Activation Starry Effects Laser Star Projector</a>&nbsp;on the other side of the hanger. It looked a little bit "ghetto" as some of my guests would put it, but that was the fault of my low-quality lights and not the stand itself.  The stand allowed me to raise the lights higher than I needed and still felt was not at all wobbly. It was even light enough for me to pick up and move with the lights still screwed on half-way through the night. My LX-5 and mini strobe have been hanging on this stand ever since the party (two weeks ago) and they haven't fallen off yet, and neither has the hanger itself broken or come loose.  Unfortunately the one thing keeping me from giving this a five-star review is that my LX-5 did cause the top bar to droop considerably, forcing me to put the other two lighter lights on the other side to counter-balance it. Again, it hasn't snapped or anything but if a 5-pound light causes the entire bar to dip down, then I wouldn't in good faith want to put up 3 more $400 lasers or scanners on the other screws, since they would probably weigh 8-12 pounds each.  tl;dr If you have cheap, light equipment this is perfect for you. If you have very expensive and heavy equipment, spring for a truss.	1
Researched lighting stands and ended up buying this. Not sure how they can sell it so cheap as it is a heavy duty stand. Quality build and simple take down so I can move it easily. No need for accessory clamps to hold your lighting. It has pre drilled holes in the crossbar with heavy duty hardware to mount whatever you want.	1
Typical high quality from K&M.  This speaker tilter is very well made and includes an anti-rotation device to keep the speaker from turning as it is tilted and the center of gravity shifts.	1
Ortofon hits the nail right on the head with this little guy.  I opted to replace my headshell off of my new Music Hall USB-1 phono right away, because it just looked cheap and had standard connections.  I did a little homework and came across this little gem.  It costs around 30 bucks so was just a little more expensive than the other headshells, I was looking at. Ultimately what impressed me the most was the fact that the company used an all metal design, and a longer finger lift, I have big fingers.  This little tweak made it a lot easier for me to lift the tone arm.  All of the connections are gold for better connectivity, even the four posts in the back connecting the headshell to the tone arm are gold.  Nice detail there.  Ok does it sound better? I just happened to have an extra Audio-Technica AT3600L moving-magnet phono cartridge, that is what comes with the record player.  I cued up Led-Zeppelin's No Quarter and the Ortofon version was not only clearer it was louder. So in the end there is an audible difference in this upgrade.  I would recomend replacing your standard or old headshell with this model you will be happy.  I also recommend changing your cartridge at the same time<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Grado-Prestige-Red-Standard-Mount-Turntable-Cartridge/dp/B000G3LCP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Grado Prestige Red Standard Mount Turntable Cartridge</a>.  If you have an old worn out, or cheap cartridge, your change in sound quality will not be as great or maybe none at all.  Garbage in still equals garbage out.  The Ortofon SH-4 can't do miracles but it sure can add to a pleasurable experience.	1
very nice. 4 wires, gold tips, hot looks and the finger rest is actually longer than normal. function is great, worth every penny and makes my turntable look more modern and sorta hot-rodded. my stock headshell was silver like my turntable, this gives it a pop of color and flavor. real happy.	1
Perfect for my ortophon red stylus, the sounds are excellent. Definitely recommend this purchase/seller	1
A well made basic headshell. Keep in mind that the azimuth is fixed, and so adjustments of that type are not possible as the contact bushing is well fixed to the cartridge mounting frame. The finger lift is large and generous. You may find that extra weights will be needed as this headshell is quite light	1
Works great and looks great.  Fits my Orofon blue cartridge with ease.  There is no angle to this cartridge shell if you have a strait-arm.	1
Does what a headshell should do. No problems.	1
Purchased this as a companion to the Ortofon - 2M Red MM Phono Cartridge I purchased to upgrade my old cartridge after digging in to my old vinyl collection. Of course it fits the cartridge perfectly and was easy to mount bob the cartridge and system to my Sony PS-X50 turntable. Very satisfied.	1
works great for my 2m red	1
Very nice build quality as you would expect from Ortofon.  Nice matte aluminum finish and well designed lift handle	1
I opted to purchase to 2m Red over the Shure M97, for my Technics 1210MK2. The sound from the Ortofon 2M Red was well above my expectations. The performance was startling. The dynamic range, the detail, and groove accuracy is almost breathtaking. It's hard to believe the upgraded 2m's can sound any better. BTW, the 2m Red is installed on the Ortofon S4 headshell. Perfect match. Highly recommend.	1
This cartridge looks good but has the same spects as there dj line which all sound good . The out put v is a little higher , all in all if you a ortofon fan you'll enjoy the red ,  to hear a big differance you'll have to go 2black ...good fun...	1
Not much can say about this. Product does what its suppose to do.	1
great sturdy headshell	1
Noticeable improvement in tracking quality, replaced an old vintage headshell.  Comes with hardware for short and tall carts.  Looks gorgeous, has quality gold interconnects.  10/10	1
Great Headshell Here is a youtube video about this Headshell and a few others. I hope you enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-S7w_U4rAl-opflriOLPQ Thank you and have a wonderful day! Joey K	1
Preforms as expected. Good product. Fair price.	1
Not using it right now but will....great product	1
Awesome head shell, when paired with the 2M series. The extended finger lift makes it easier to manually cue the cartridge exactly where you want on the vinyl. Highly recommend.	1
I wanted a quality headshell for my Shure M44-7 and this definitely does the job.	1
Love this headshell! I just wish they made a purple or red colourway.	1
Love this headshell! I just wish they made a purple or red colourway.	1
I mounted a DL-301R cartridge on this Head shell. The tone arm is SME and turntable Soto Sapphire it was easy install and the alignment process was fairly easy also I did not use there cartridge lead wires cheaply made  I upgraded to silver coated wires makes a difference.  overall this head shell is nicely made and feels solid	1
Perfect with an AT-440ml allowing Baerwald Alignment with the Technics for Audiophile playback.  Easy alignment and nice long lift handle.  Probably best used for audiophile playback -vs- DJ'ing.	1
Very nice headshell.  Copper leads with gold plated connectors.  The pins are also gold plated.  It has a nice solid feel.  Excellent construction.  I did not think it would improve the sound but I noticed a slight improvement over my original headshell.  If you were using a Technics 1200 headshell or anything similar in shape, you will have to adjust your VTA (decrease) for best performance.	1
These are really great sounding Phono cartridges. Reasonably priced and easy to install.	1
Very well constructed and the extra long arm makes it easy to pick up from the spin. Works very well with the OM series.	1
Works great, easy install.  Quality product with great value.  You will no be disappointed by this cartridge.  Go order this now.	1
There is not really much to say about this headshell. It does what it is supposed to, without problems, and seems to be made of high quality materials. With it bearing the Ortofon name, that's what I was expecting and that's what I got. I would buy another one if the need ever arose.	1
Replaced the cartridge on my vintage Sony turntable and it sounds great.	1
Perfect for a new "vinyl junkie" sounds awesome,  seller A+ definitely recommend	1
Got an Orofon Red with my new Debut turntable.  After some 40 hours of break in, it still gets overwhelmed by the highs in Jeff Buckley's "Grace".  It also has this odd tendency to increase the noise floor in between tunes.  If your system is low fi you won't notice, but through a sub and 5 speakers you will.  Truthfully, it's substantially better than an entry level MM.  But still an entry level MM nonetheless If you're looking for audiophile quality out of the box, you need to spend another $100 and get an MC cartridge so you can get all the detail and richness you would otherwise miss from listening to a cd.  Make sure you change your platter to vinyl if you're going to do that because MC cartridges won't work with a metal platter.	-1
this is a great price/value cartridge, Five stars in it's price range.	1
Upgraded from a ortofon om5e on my trusty no bells and whistles Project Essential II (with acrylic platter and yaqin tube preamp) to a 2m red, although the om5e was ok not terrible (better than at95e imo) the 2m red was a huge difference in sound more treble, smoothness and balance at 99$ it's priced right not to mention the cartridge is pretty big and solid, easy to install And looks cool too, highly recommend!	1
As many have stated, this has to be the best value in a $100 cartridge out there. A Shure M97xe would be 2nd in my book. Pretty easy to set up, the compliance makes it work with a plethora of modern and vintage turntables, and it is upgradable by swapping the red stylus for a blue down the road...what's not to like?	1
While rediscovering my extensive vinyl record collection I decided to replace and upgrade my phono cartridge. I will not go in to all the great specs with this cartridge, there are much more knowledgable people out there for that, but suffice it to say, this is an outstanding replacement/upgrade especially for the money. I expected to and was prepared to spend more but after reading the reviews for this cartridge I decided that I didn't need to do so. I am absolutely pleased with this purchase and wholeheartedly recommend it to others looking to improve the sound of their old vinyl. With this cartridge, it is entirely worth the extra effort to sent up and play the vinyl record instead of reaching or the easier CD.	1
love the sound its really a great value	1
Very good sound for $100.00.  I like it a lot.	1
WOW!!!! What a drastic change over the shure blue lable which is a great sounding cart like night and day the sound stage is wide and crisp and its only been one album on it so far can not wait till it is broken in omg	1
I have been using high output moving coils for about 10 years. I decided to buy this for the basement system, and I like it! I have an older Ortofon OM20 and I like this cartridge a little bit better. Maybe because it's new.... The detail may not all be there compared to moving coils, but it is a very easy to listen to cartridge. I even moved it up to my main system in the living room. Great for rock!	1
This cartridge really makes a difference in the sound that i was getting with an Ortofon FF 15 XE MK II cartridge from the 70's. I was really wowed at the first few records i played with this cart. Comes with the needle already installed. Only thing is you have to buy the headstock for it. Assembly is not hard at all when you have another fully assembled cartridge to look at and figure out how it all goes together. The headstock i bought for this cart is Ortofon SH-Black Head shell. Well worth your hard earned money in my opinon. This cartridge will bring your vinyl records to life!	1
I received this cartridge for my 2014 Christmas present from my kids. ( I did tell them what I wanted ). Let me say that it took a good 10 hours to break in.  All of a sudden, the bass began to appear and tighten.  The highs began to settle in, and the stereo stage began to widen. It sounded better and better the more albums I played.  At Around 50 hours, it began to really hit its stride.  This cartridge can really sing!  I have been playing predominately Jazz music with it and I find that some times I can't wait to hear my next LP.  I highly recommend this cartridge to someone who wants a taste of High Fidelity without paying a very high price. NOTE: my previous cartridge was a Shure M97xE, while many others found it to be an outstanding cartridge, I found it to be a little to layed back. I understand that many say adding a JICO SAS replacement stylus makes it a killer cart but when it comes time to replace the stylus on the 2 m red, I may be leaning towards the 2 m blue. Just my 2 cents.	1
Its going on my Thorens	1
great pedal case , lots of room	1
very portable! I have a 6 switch looper, wah, 8 pedals, power supply & rotovibe packed in mine!	1
PROs: I used this for some effects that I have. I put a vox wah/volume, a electro-harmonix delay, a tuner, a boss ds-1 a boss flanger, a behringer delay, and a compressor pedal in this case. it was the perfect size and it's made of quality materials. For this price you're not going to find a better deal. It would cost me more to try and make a case like this.  Cons: There wasn't enough padding in the case to protect the pedals during transport. Luckily I had some egg sheel foam around the house that I added for protection. The Velcro tape that came with this box didn't hold. It didn't stick to the pedals at all and it didn't hold to the lining of the case. Easy fix they sell quality Velcro at Lowe's and it's not that expensive.	1
Installed this a couple hours ago, now my MIM Precision Bass looks great! Came with the screws also. I do agree with everyone else about it being thinner than it should. Thought it might be a problem, but it screwed on well. Tested how much tension it can hold by pushing the neck away from the body, and I gotta say it holds on tight. I might consider using a shim to match the thickness of the stock plate. Lets just see how long it holds.	1
I put this plate on my MIM Precision Bass and when tightened down the entire plate warped and cracked the finish around all four mounting holes. Honestly feel as if Fender should pay for the paint touch-up since the plate came with no warning that actually installing it would ruin your guitar's finish. Really Fender? Really?	-1
I was upgrading all the chrome on a MIM and put this on.  Looks better than the plain one.  Includes the screws.	1
Like it solid plate doesn't bend screws are stainless and will fit perfect	1
Perfectly fit my Mex Tele looks awesome	1
It brings quality to my Telecaster and guarantees original strength and sound of it.	1
Nobody else sees it - but, the player knows it is there! The Fender Standard (MIM) Stratocaster's neck plate is plain chrome. It doesn't look bad - but this plate makes it look a LOT better! I love it. My wife said, "Nobody can see it", and I responded with a simple, "Yes, but I know it is there" and that knowing makes me love my Strat even more! Privately very classy.	1
Love it. Makes my MIM Sunburst HSS Strat look even nicer.	1
Perfect aftermarket neckplate for one of my MIM Fender Stratocasters. As others have mentioned, it is not as thick as the original neckplate, however, I don't see an issue with this. It did not affect the tone or play-ability of my guitar and I would order another one.	1
Fit my 2007 MIUSA Strat which I purchased gutted and I'm slowly getting parts for. I just got the switch and machine heads and I still need the Pick-Ups. Since it's an 07 I felt that I could hot rod with out getting ostracized for it. I'm also going to do a hand carved inlay on the body. The guitar is being built for a give away to commemorate 19 years serving Indie Music. The image is a 1977 Fender MusicMaster MIUSA, the part I got is the same going on a Fender Strat	1
Looks great. Thanks.	1
It's REAL Fender with the correct fully threaded screws. If your Fender uses this style Neckplate then buy it. It will fit perfectly and look exactly as it should. Took care of the 'buckle rash' mine had and restored an otherwise near perfect guitar. Mine was a Telecaster but I checked on a Stratocaster with the same neckplate and it would fit that too as well as a Music Master I also have. I have no doubts that IF you have a Fender with the "F" style neckplate this will fit. I have no idea about this 'F' style replacing other Fender neckplate styles as I only have the 3 Fenders with this style.	1
like others mentioned, this plate is thinner than stock.  I tightend it down & slightly bent the corner(s).  Just tighten slowly & til tight flush & you should be good to go.	1
Really puts that finishing touch on the guitar.  Good quality overall.	1
Nice, but the bolts were to long for the squire neck, so i just reused the old ones! No problem....	1
Good quality and good finish.	1
Bad quality,	-1
cool.....	1
nice plate. I'm happy with it, thick and strong.	1
Arrived in a timely manner. Pretty backplate and fits my strat perfectly.	1
A perfect fit to my 2009 MIM Standard Strat, and also my 2018 Standard Jazz Bass.  Looks MUCH nicer than the blank OEM neckplate with decals bearing mystery numbers and a picture of a trash can, which must be some kind of international symbol instructing you to toss this stock plate and replace it with the Fender F neck plate.	1
Decent, but not as think as it could be.	1
I thoroughly believe that buying this part will not only make you a better bass player but will also lower your credit score and probably get you a girlfriend.	1
Fit my 1995 MIM Strat perfectly!	1
came as advertised	1
as described ...	1
Fit perfectly on my Squier telecaster that I am piece by piece turning into a Fender Telecaster	1
love it!	1
the real thing, seemingly	1
As far as I can tell, this is OEM.  Looks great on my J-bass.  I'm very satisfied!	1
Fender fit and quality.	1
Didn't care for the screws.  But the plate is cool.  Nice upgrade for my Squire.	1
Nice plates - nice cost!	1
perfect	1
not as thick as my 1966, neither is my hair. It works fine, if your neck is the correct fit. It WON'T solve sloppy neck pocket issues, NOTHING will.	1
Sweet upgrade to my Stratocaster. My mexican strat came with a blank chrome plate and went ahead and gave it this little upgrade. Gave it a nice touch.. Highly recommend it	1
fit great on my fender strat looks great too	1
Looks great but measure your current plate first, will not fit all Squires etc	1
Great quality. Good weight. Perfect fit.	1
no scratches. all good. great product	1
name brand Fender quality.	1
Thanks.	1
It's a genuine Fender part and it fits perfectly.  Nuff said.	1
Don't waste your money. It's too thin and the holes are not countersunk. The hole pattern doesn't line up to any Squier if that's what you're considering.	-1
Came just as advertised. Mounted perfectly for a Fender Precision Bass and I imagine other Fender guitars as well.	1
A great way, to dress up your guitar, easily and inexpensively...	1
If you are looking for added flair on any fender/squier instrument.this is a great place to start. The 70's F logo is one of my favorites and is my go to neckplate. At 10$ its a cheap way to give the back of your guitar or bass that extra kick in the looks department. Holds up well to tarnish and rust spots as well.	1
Perfect.  Just what I needed.	1
works great. looks great. good price.	1
Product came quickly, securely packaged and was up to Fender's quality standards. I am very pleased.	1
Works for me	1
What can you say?  It's a genuine Fender neckplate, well made, and a great price.	1
PERFECT!	1
does the job	1
Very nice for topping off my guitar/Tele Restoration!! All good	1
Replaced my old scratched up plate..	1
F yeah	1
Nice touch.	1
Does exactly what it's supposed to. Fits perfectly. Great quality.	1
Nice, new in package.	1
Looks great but kinda thin. Was hoping to get a plastic finish protecter but I guess $12 doesn't cover that? Oh well.	1
neckplates and mounting screws, bringing bolt on neck and guitar bodies together since Leo smiled upon it and said it was good.  As it was and shall be.  Ramen.	1
Worked fine, no issues.	1
Good product  !!!	1
Bolts right in  ..  good swap when the chrome on the Mex Strat plates start to flake or rust out	1
Love my new plate.	1
nice!	1
Perfect neckplate!	1
Prefect fit, worked on an old fender p bass I'm restoring.	1
Great look on my "Tele" copy fit perfectly !	1
Authentic Fender. Looks great.	1
Good plating.  Very good quality	1
very nice	-1
Nice !! AAA+++	1
Fits guitar as expected	1
they look nice and came in fast	1
Perfect fit for a 2004 MIM strat.  Came right on time Looks great & was exactly as expected.	1
replaced the general blank plate on my mij fender jaguar.  looks classy.  fits perfectly.	1
nice	1
Just what I needed to finish my custom Stratocaster!	1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT!	1
Screw holes are in the right spots, and it looks nice.  I'm not sure what else I could want from a neck plate, so 5 stars it is!	1
This is the fourth one I've bought. I've installed them on American Strat's, Mexican Strat's, Mexican Tele's. Perfect fit, every time. I 100% recommended this.	1
It's a bit thin but works perfect. Used with Fender Telecaster 998006705 Body and Fender Telecaster 995102921 Neck	1
The plate is thin, much thinner than the original, the screw holes do not have counter sinks so the ship screws with smaller heads tho give the impression of a counter sunk screws. it's a replacement of a MIM Strat, not USA Strats, the original is far thicker with counter sink screw holes but its plane. cosmetically the F logo looks good, functionally? not sure.	-1
Should add a nice touch to my strat project guitar.	1
Yup very quick from nv to wa state has a big f on it cool ,,,price is high but got here quick looks great drop price about 8 bucks i give 5 star,,big cost but works great	1
A perfect replacement for a four bolt neck.  I didn't want the 'F' but, its there and I wasn't being choosy.  The plate is not reversible as the holes are tapered.	1
Didn't need it, looks good when playing upside down. Just get it	1
great buy for fender stratocaster	1
Fits on my Standard Strat without problem. Ever so slightly thinner than the original neck plate, but it went on fine, holds the neck on without problem. Chrome finish looks nice. A small touch to make your guitar that much better.	1
Is what it is, drop in replacement for fender neckplates.  Looks great.	1
Drop in fit for my MIM Strat, and really classes up the guitar.	1
Installed this on my '98 Mexican Standard Tele for a bit of bling along w/ a phenolic cushion from Allparts and everything went together without issue.  No functional difference that I can tell from the stock neckplate it came w/ but was a nice cosmetic upgrade IMO.	1
goood fit	1
Not much to say about this...... Perfect to ad a special touch to your MIM or reissue strat or tele.	1
Perfect	1
Nice upgrade for my Mexican Stratocaster standard. Mostly eye candy that is only seen by me.	1
Needed this style plate to complete my project. Perfect!  Nice and thick, heavy duty, great chrome plating, fits perfectly. Thanks!	1
looks and fits great on my start, nothing more I can ask for! my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before I replaced it with this one	1
I got exactly what I ordered. Looks Great. It's made by Fender so what more do I need to say.	1
I needed a neckplate for a Telecaster I pieced together with a USA neck and MIM body. I had a blank neckplate I intended to use, but thought I'd add this since it was, afterall ,a Fender guitar.	1
VERY GOOD QUALITY CHROME ON THIS PIECE. I WAS ALSO HAPPY IT CAME WITH THE PROPER HARDWARE NEED TO INSTALL IT.	1
The plate is ok for me. I know others have said it is light metal but I don't think it really matters.  The neck plate to me is more for protecting the guitar body then it is for anything else. The screws are what is securing the neck to the body not the neck plate.	1
worked good on my fender telecaster, prise was very good. A all my freindes say there going to get theres soon.	1
Never really had to mess much with this item. Its a quality piece of metal with the nice F logo on it. Mounted my cheap Amazon start neck just fine.	1
This is a very nice looking back plate and for the price its cheep the holes are in the right place for the screws .	1
Decided to get this cheap cosmetic add-on to go with my conversion of my old black Squier Strat to its reborn David Gilmour signature state.  I took off the old plate and neck, put new neck on, screwed in, no problems, looks great.	1
It is a Fender product, so it is well made. Reasonably priced. It will make any Strat or Tele build shine.	1
There was nothing wrong with my original neckplate, but I was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra.  IT was a direct replacement for the original.	1
I looked for quite a while too find the best deal out there and true fender product, I highly recommend...	1
Used this on my made in Mexico Stratocaster and it did a great job of replacing the plain factory one.  Don't forget to loosen the strings and take the tension off as the kneck will come loose during the change over.	1
This is a Fender brand Plate and was perfect for my build. It was as thin as some of the imports and the finish looked really good.	1
I built a vintage Strat with chrome hardware. I had all the parts but the neck plate, so I had my son pick me up one locally. No screws! I went online for screws and found this plate with screws for 2 bucks less than I paid for the plain plate. Bolted right on and I couldn't be happier. PS. I did order a pack of 10 neck screws from another dealer at the same time. (Im still waiting)	1
It looks nice on our Fender Blacktop Bass plus the locks, it completely changed the look of the bass, details	1
I just slapped one of these on my reliced '94 MIM Fender Strat. It looks very slick!. Only issue is that it got scratched already after having it for less than a month.	1
A must have for a Replacement neck. Got to Love the real chrome Fender stuff! quick delivery,nice to know that i can obtain real parts for a real Fender!	1
Purely cosmetic upgrade to my MIM Fender, actually both my Precision and my Jazz Basses.  Cool to have the Fender Logo, easy to switch out.  looks cool	1
It looks fine but as other reviewers have pointed out is thinner than the OEM plate that came on the guitar. Some people mentioned putting shims behind it but a better idea might be to cut the ends of the neck screws down by an 1/8th of an inch so that you don't screw the neck screws in too far.  The plate was delivered on time and as promised by Amazon.	1
Not much to say about a chrome neckplate - it's largely a cosmetic item.  But my old one (with the serial number) was corroding pretty bad, and I liked the look of the new one.  A few people have mentioned that it's thinner, but assuming you also have the "pad" underneath (which you should) that was not a problem for me at all.  Anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws.  Installation took all of 5 minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before.  Looks great!	1
Nice F logo upgrade on my squier deluxe strat. Installed easy and the screws and everything were correct. I would recommend this :)	1
I put this on my Fender Jazz Bass after I bought a new neck for it. This plate work the exact same as the stock plate, but it dresses the bass up a bit. This is not a mod that people will see (like pickup covers), but I like the way it looks when I pick it up to play.	1
A must have for a Replacement neck. Got to Love the real chrome Ffender stuff! quick delivery,nice to know that i can obtain real parts for a real Fender!	1
Used this to replace a MIM neckplate on my 2006 Strat.  It is a little bit thinner than the stock neckplate, but I mean a very little bit.  It did not bend or flex when I installed it and I snugged it down nice and tight.  I'm not sure how hard you would have to torqe the screws to cause it to bend, but tighter than needed probably.  It is simple and classy and looks much better then the plan old MIM stock which also had a few light scratches on it.	1
Like most of us, bought this for a MIM strat, since they only come with the ''Dont Dump in Trash Bin'' and CE stickers.  The plate comes in a Fender Parts bag, Made in USA.  Once you open it, you will find the plate itself, which indeed is a little thinner (not much) and 4 screws, these 4 were also a little bit thinner than the stock ones, I used the stock ones.  Personally, I installed the plate this way:  - Loosen your strings to the point they hold little tension - Put some Masking Tape on the fretboard so that they won't come off. - Removed all 4 screws in an ''X'' pattern and then both the plate and neck will come off. - You can check your Fenders serials and manufacturing dates on the inside of the guitar body that touches the neck on the highest frets, just be careful. - Installed the new plate with the old screws, again in a ''X'' pattern.  The whole process is best done on a flat table, once the neck is loose, it tends to go away from the guitar.  I am really satisfied and this is exactly what I wanted.	1
I used this on my partsocaster and it rocks. Looks clean and i like the Fender F logo, clean.  I ended up using my own screws as these were slightly larger than my neck. Not their fault though	1
Looks great! Replaced the stock neck plate on my Squier standard telecaster.	1
This is a nice little custom addition to my Tele. Although, as earlier reviews that I have read stated. It is thinner than the stock neck plate. I used my cordless screwdriver with the clutch low and it still made some small indentations around the screw holes. So, you just need to be very careful not to over tighten the screws. It should at least be as thick as the stock neck plate. That is why I gave it four stars.	1
Actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great. Had issues before with company but they resolved all issues. I would do business with them again. Thanks for taking care of me. Pleasure doing business with you	1
great product	1
works well with my Yamaha keyboard,	1
Works great.	1
You need this, the keys suck down the batterys quick!!	1
Works as expected.	1
Works as advertised. Don't settle for knockoffs and risk your gear.	1
I bought it for my Yamaha Silent Guitar, and it works perfectly. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, so I give it five stars.	1
EXCELLENT	1
Christmas present! Can't wait to plug it in to listen to our daughter play!	1
Works perfectly with my PSRE253 keyboard.	1
Purchased as an accessory (which frankly should have shipped with the keyboard, but doesn't...) to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yamaha-PSRE253-61-Key-Portable-Keyboard/dp/B00UN8O5VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yamaha PSRE253 61-Key Portable Keyboard</a>.  It worked as expected out of the box to power the keyboard and I've had no issues with it such as overheating. Would definitely recommend this accessory for everyday use of your keyboard vs batteries.	1
works as advertised for my VL70-m tone generator.  thanks for the fast shipping, needed it!	1
Works perfect no issue.	1
This adapter works perfectly with my Yamaha 61 Key Keyboard. I am very happy with this purchase.	1
I like it and please so far	1
great to have if you don't feel like putting batteries in your yamaha or don't have any	1
Nothing beats original. Has stood up to life on the road expertly and hasn't failed me yet.	1
Works perfectly!	1
good quality!	1
Work very well for yamaha keybord	1
Does the job, that's all I care about.	1
Horribly disappointed that this is optional.	-1
It's insulting that their keyboards don't come with these.	-1
The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yamaha-PA150MM-Keyboard-AC-Power-Adapter/dp/B000WS3GRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yamaha PA150MM Keyboard AC Power Adapter</a>&nbsp;sold by Amazon (as opposed to a vendor partner) is not a Yamaha part at all.  The transformer is the one pictured, but there is no picture of the label that would make clear that this is a generic product.  Having noted this, I must admit that the transformer apparently works with my keyboard.  However, the cord on the adapter is no longer than two feet.  It is so short that the adapter cannot lie flat on the floor from a keyboard stand at seated height!  Fortunately, I have an outlet near the keyboard close enough for the adapter to reach, and since the keyboard is stationary against the wall, I am not concerned.  This is one of the first times that I have been disappointed with the misrepresentation of an Amazon-storefront product.	-1
The strap hole is way too small for any of my instruments, and the strap itself is very small. Also the color depicted for my version is a dark red, but it's more a bright Clifford the big red dog red. The strands are small enough to go under a classical head stock, which is appreciated. However, I'll need to buy another strap. This one is not dependable.	-1
Definitely good for the price, but the material seems a bit cheap. Mine also came a bit dirty with the "leather" part frayed. Does really affect the usage and it definitely a good strap for 5 dollars  Bit of an update, I've had to stop using the strap because it causes strain on my shoulder and back, really don't recommend this to anyone planning of regular using the strap, or with heavier guitars	-1
Piece of junk not even big enough for an acoustic, also texture is hard plastic.	-1
With no dimensions in the listing you are at risk on how it will fit your keyboard.  Much too big for most 61-76 key keyboards.	-1
What is the inside dimensions???? What is the inside dimensions???? What is the inside dimensions???? What is the inside dimensions???? We are tying to buy something based on size and fitting...	-1
I persevered with this keyboard for a couple of weeks but have decided that it is more trouble than it is worth and cannot be trusted for live use. Why?  1) It defaults to playing a piano sample. I know that this will be a disaster on stage at some point and I don't want to take that risk.  2) The 'piano' volume knob is hardwired to adjust all volume knobs in Apple Logic. I cannot figure out how to disable this and am not willing to invest the effort.  I had to read the entire manual to figure out how to disable the piano sample from playing. Only in the addendum did I find something related to disabling 'local' by hitting the edit key followed by the A# middle key. How ridiculous it is that:  a) the piano sample is on by default and b) there isn't a simple switch to enable/disable it c) every time you power cycle the damn piano comes back  The headphone jacks behaved very oddly and weren't anywhere near loud enough to be useful. My lead singer could not record vocals because the max output level was way too low compared to his singing voice.  It doesn't have phantom power for the XLR input.  The keys aren't full size and feel spongy.  I needs to have at least some assignable pads / sliders / rotary knobs.  If you even slightly knock the 'piano volume' knob it will set every single channel strip volume in Logic. Apparently it is programmable but the manual doesn't explain how and this is nigh-impossible to figure out in Apple's Logic.  Coupled with that damn piano sample is just too dangerous for live play and very frustrating. The piano volume knob was the last straw so I'm returning it for a refund and will look for something else.	-1
Not impressed. You need to talk really close to the microphone to be heard. Save your money on this cheap one and get a better quality one. I'll be looking for new microphones for our karoake machine.	-1
bad solder joints inside.  poor frequency response on this microphone.	-1
bad solder joints inside.  poor frequency response on this microphone.	-1
Nothing but static... Won't pick up sound.  Waste of money.	-1
too bulky , not quite what i expected.	-1
Buy this mic if you hate your voice and do not want anyone to hear it, otherwise move on to a better mic	-1
The product basically fell apart in the first 5 minutes, we are returning it.	-1
cheaply built.  what can you expect for a microphone this cheap?  I still buy them because people cant take care of things so why buy something more expensive people will break anyways?	-1
The sound of this microphone is poor at best. Spend a few extra dollars and buy a real microphone even if it is a Behringer, Samson, or Pyle it will blow this piece of junk right into the trash. If you really want a good sound and a mic that will last you a lifetime buy a Shure SM58.	-1
I bought this to replace the Karaoke mic that came with my daughter's karaoke machine - and it stopped working just days after she got it.	-1
Please do not buy these.  Even though the batteries are still strong they stop working after a few uses.  I start drumming and 1 minute into the song one stick stops lighting up.  Then before the song is done the other just flashes with each tap and does not emit light for the few seconds it initially did.  I have purchased 2 sets of blue thinking it was a faulty set but I get the same results.  I also purchased red and green initially. They too suck.  One of the red ones just does not work at all.	-1
The light on these sticks don't last long.  After a few uses they just flash briefly.  The batteries are still good but the light is just brief.  The light on one stick might be visible for a few seconds after tapping but the other is just a flash.  Just save your money.	-1
Don't buy.  The lights on these are not consistent.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  Most of the time the light is only briefly visible, like a flash.	-1
Horrile broke within an hour couldnet find the baterrie or screw to return it.	-1
One of the sticks stopped working after 20 min.	-1
I bought the purple ones as well, which were fine. One of these came damaged...it was much less sensitive than the other. And then one day later, it completely failed.	-1
absolute garbage do not buy. Worked for about 30 seconds.	-1
These are a cute gimmick which will provide about 10 minutes of entertainment.  They weigh a ton and flex like crazy.	-1
I have owned a few different pairs of these sticks in the past.  I thought I would change it up by using the red ones.  The red light is so dim you can barely see the glow.  I am going to stick to the BLUE ones!!	-1
They hardly light up. Either batteries are dead or they are just terrible. They need to test them before they send them out.  I'm sending them back.	-1
Well my wife bought these for me for Xmas... At first I thought they were real drum sticks. They are NOT! They are the shape of sticks but, as others have put it they flex, vibrate really, really bad, you cannot just turn them on and off. But..... the worst is the sound. Cymbals sound awful and there is no noise from drum hits themselves. Great for kids to mess with in the dark. I don't really know what to do with them, give them to a kid I suppose. I do play tomorrow night for a New Years party. We do a slow song I think I will use them on it and maybe throw them into the crowd?  I think the manufacturer should say, toy sticks or something....  Mike	-1
From all the great reviews I expected this to be more solid and secure. I'm a longtime pro player, & I've used an off-brand metal stand on my gigs for over 30 years, and it's still just as solid and reliable today. This one however, doesn't want to hold my tenor very securely, as it feels loose, and can twist around in it's place. Also, when I reach to take it out, & pull towards me, often the entire sax part of it comes with, it rocks from front to back, which is really not good, and something I'd never seen in any other stand I've owned. Finally, when I've got my tenor, flute & soprano in it, it's very difficult taking my tenor out or placing it back in, without it knocking into my flute! Also, something I'd never seen before in a stand. It's nice that it folds up, but I only use it as a spare, it's too risky using it on a gig, as I don't trust it....	-1
Cheap toy from China. Flimsy twisted plastic hangar, handle that came was plastic tipped stick, not like the one shown. Dull tone. Rusts over time.	-1
It's a good quality strap but the metal clips destroyed the finish on my banjo rim. I didn't notice it until it was too late. I took it to the shop and they said I need to get a good rim job to fix my wood	-1
Yes, they do look good, but they do slip, and can be wild and slippery unless tamed: Poke a tiny hole through the underside of the loop and strap. Feed a twist-tie (or similar) through the holes, and secure. I 'fixed' three of these when I bought them several years ago. I have since switched to the non-adjustable type straps with several holes for the end-pin in lieu of a sliding adjustment.	-1
If getting this strap for a 5yr old then go for it, other wise it is way too small for 8yrs on up	-1
This strap is well-made and potentially comfortable, but at its longest length, shorter than many other straps I own. Disappointing but not worth returning.	-1
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people.  The strap is about 6" too short for my Seagull S6 guitar.  I will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short.  I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap.  I just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.  2/22/2013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and "short" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extendo for this strap. I don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place.  here's a link to the extendo option   LEVY'S LEATHERS MMGXL-2.5-BRN STRAP EXTENDER http://www.amazon.com/LEVYS-LEATHERS-MMGXL-2-5-BRN-STRAP-EXTENDER/dp/B00BH5N91E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1361565768&sr=8-2&keywords=MMGXL-2.5  the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.  This is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider. I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap. It's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other.  I will keep this strap but sure feel like I've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind.	-1
I thought I was would love this strap due to me having a swamp ash bass and reading many reviews on it. The thickness bought an extreme discomfort within sec. It came this morning and I'll be shipping back out for the 2.5"	-1
I've been using this strap for about two weeks and so far it is not the miracle some reviews would lead you to believe.  The basic problem is that there is simply no free ride with physics: your body/shoulder is going to be supporting the full weight of the instrument no matter what. All that the gel and elastic in the shoulder pad is going to get you is a slightly better spread on the load. That effect with this strap is marginal; it did not provide any great relief for me.  And there are other issues.  As many have mentioned the smallest size strap (Large) is WAY too long. Add in another $10 to the cost to take the strap to a shoe repair shop to have them take a good chunk of length out of the strap and restitch it. Even if you somehow needed all that length, since the shoulder pad is fixed, all that length only feeds out to the back end of your guitar, so the guitar will approach a vertical orientation. A superior strap design has adjustable straps on both ends. Not so with this one.  Another problem is the crazy hard thick leather on the front end attachment point/hole. It's damn near impossible to get it onto a strap button. Oddly, the rear strap end is a softer leather and doesn't have this issue :/  The front end of the strap also has a very hard, thick leather piece that has quite a bit of bulk to it. Probably not an issue with a typical guitar but on my SG, which has the front strap button on the back of the guitar near the neck, the twist due to the attachment point forces that hard bulky pad into my body which is annoying and uncomfortable (attaching the strap end the opposite way as is common with an SG doesn't help much). There is seemingly zero added functionality to this piece and it only serves as a place to attach a brand logo and/or to make it look more expensive(?).  So this strap just isn't working for me. It only affords a modicum of increased comfort and there are too many other issues that simply have not been thought through.  The search for a more comfortable and better designed strap continues :(	-1
This strap was a disappointment.  It's padded nice but it's bouncy.  It's elastic so it stretches from the weight of your guitar and will bungee up and down.	-1
Too Short!  I had to rob another strap with a longer tailpiece strip.  I am a large Man, but c'mon.  Would 3" of skinny leather cost that much?	-1
I would caution any buyer of a Levy's strap to beware of this "con" on the part of Levy's.  Their straps are way to short for most people and if you connect it to the neck of the guitar.  They could eliminate this with the strap that comes with the origianl in a lenth that could be cut by the purchaser.  I too am plenty ticked bout the fact that the extendo deal does not match my guitar strap and makes it look very cheesy. I simply will not buy another Levy's Guitar Strap unless I have it in hand to examine before buying it.	-1
If getting this strap for a 5yr old then go for it, other wise it is way too small for 8yrs on up	-1
Levy's leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material, especially on the edges.  It cuts into your neck horribly, even thru a shirt. Yukko.  The fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap.	-1
STIFF as a board !!!  Not only is stiff, it digs sharply into my neck. Yes, there are things I could do to modify it, but for this price it should be good to go. I gave mine away.	-1
The leather is too stiff to fit over the strap buttons. I had to unscrew the strap button to put the awful thing on. Also, the nylon strap material is so stiff that it barely flexes, so it digs into your neck and shoulder. Very uncomfortable. I have replaced this with a strap by a different manufacturer.	-1
I have had a Levi's strap for many years and love it. This one is MUCH shorter and was returned.	-1
We own other Levy straps and they are good. This one looks and feels cheaply made with low quality materials.  The picture shown is not the actual product recieved. Levy logos not printed on underside of strap and the ends are made of a stretch polyester that feels like it would scratch instrument as well as stretch to not stay on. Very disappointed after such a long wait for it to ship. Sending back within 5 min of opening package.  This looks like a poor reproduction of there usual quality.	-1
Was hoping to not need my mixer for my one condenser mic to provide phantom power. It provides enough juice for the mic, but the hum is unbearable. It's being returned.	-1
Didn't want to spend much money for just one project so bought the NADY. Big mistake. Loaded with 60 hz hum. The wall wart was the problem. Found an 18VAC power supply for the unit and that got it fixed. Too late, but it got it fixed.	-1
Just got this yesterday. It worked OK until today then then started flashing Err on the screen. I presume this is an error code. So I'm sending it back. Just as well. This thing is a piece of junk. All plastic, and cheap plastic at that. The sounds are OK, but not a lot of flexibility when trying to edit the effects. I would have returned it anyway even if it hadn't failed.	-1
These picks are terrible.  The sand paper that is glued on rubs off easily.  The shark also isn't centered on the picks very well so the tail is right where you pick the string.  Stay away from this garbage.	-1
I tried Legere for a bit.  Not long.  I found two big problems with them: 1.  The Legere is a lot stiffer than the cane of the same size.  They may have fixed this since I last played on them, but I used to play on Mitchell Laurie 4 (sometimes 4.5) cane reeds and I couldn't get a single peep from a Legere 4 because it was too stiff.  I had to drop to a Legere 3. 2.  This is solid plastic so it does not vibrate as well as the cane reeds.  This means that I have to blow harder to get the same volume level.  It also means that the notes can sound somewhat muddled or stifled... particularly after 45 minutes of playing when there is quite a bit of spit clinging to the reed.  These reeds are meant to be played WHILE TOTALLY DRY.  As soon as any moisture (like spit) hits it, the sound quality goes down.  I will say that I like Legere slightly better than the Plasticover reeds; those are just normal cane reeds with a plastic coating so they have even more problems than regular cane reeds in my opinion.  However, if you want a really great reed that will last a long time, give you awesome musical quality, and has a sound similar to (but crisper than) regular cane, try Fibracell instead of Legere.	-1
won't stay on the metal rest, and always falls off right in the middle of a piece of music, it's distracting to me	-1
I don't understand how this is supposed to "save" your thumb. It's more uncomfortable than the bare thumb pad! Definitely a waste of money.	-1
I wanted to like this.  The value was right and it seemed like a great solution for my tenor, alto, soprano practice room.  BUT, unfortunately it hasn't worked out. There are 2 problems with this:  1 - The stand does not work on any surface except a hard surface and even on a hard surface, I'm worried.  On any carpet, this is very unstable.  The problem are the two little feet that you can see next to the soprano pegs.  They are simply too short to be stable.  Turns out much of the weight of a sax is on those two little feet.  So on a carpet especially, the feet are pushed downward and the balance tips the saxes back and over.  Exactly what you don't want to happen.  2 - The cushioned areas on the stand for the alto/tenor spots don't work well for tenor.  The bottom of the bell hits the metal at the bottom of the brace.  Might be correctable if you made the lower cushion (not the top "Y" cushion but the second smaller cushion extended out a little.  Basically the whole tenor sax is flush against that metal rail and the bottom knocks on the sax.  So lay it on there very slowly because it will touch metal to metal.  Over time, I'm sure this will wear off the lacquer at the minimum.  Overall, like I said, I wanted to like this stand but it didn't happen.  For all you other sax players out there, move on and try something else.	-1
I used this product recently on a theater gig.  It is incredibly awkward.  It does not fold well for travel, and the straight design (and long t shaped bar) made it too big to fit comfortably anywhere around my chair.  I kept smacking my instruments either on the chair or stand...even against each other as I tried to pick up the saxes.  The worst part of the stand though is that it tips over!  With all 4 instruments on it, it would start tipping forward at the slightest jostle.  I ended up keeping my foot on the stand the entire performance.  If you have enough room (and really good eyesight) to have it in front of you as you play, with plenty of clearance for the music stand, that seems the best spot for it. I'd still keep a foot on it though.	-1
Purchased for a cellist -- it slides across the floor and is useless in concerts on a hard floor.	-1
I guess I have the wrong type of floors or something, but this didn't work for me.  The cello still slid on my floor.  I have laminate flooring but it does not have a smooth surface.  Maybe that was the problem?  Don't know.  Returned it.	-1
I really tried to like this, as my original chinrest was not as confortable as I think it is necessary for one hour practice. I really enjoyed the confort it provides and it sticks well on the chinrest (despite being a little smaller than my chinrest).  My major complaynt, that became a real dealbreaker, is the strong rubber smell this piece produces. It is installed on a spot too near of my nose for it to make me lose my concentration some times. I used it for 15 days, waiting for the smell to fade out but it didn't.  At the end I removed it and bought a wittner center chinrest.	-1
This thing won't stay on the violin, no matter how much you fiddle with it.	-1
Hate this product...keeps collapsing on its side.	-1
UPDATE OCT 20, 2016: The zipper finally completely broke and no longer zips after only 4-5 months of use.  VERY disappointed.  For a bag that was made specifically for a gigging musician using a Privia, they really shortchanged the zipper design and there's not enough cushion/padding IMHO.... The bag fits perfect, and the two accessory compartments are great, but the zippers are very cheaply made.  I perform nightly, and if you do too, this may NOT be the gig bag you want to use for your Privia keyboard.  After only a couple months the zipper pull broke...  the actually zipper pull broke in half simply from my pulling it it closed one night... cheap metal... See Attached Photo... and the zipper teeth also pulled apart from both sides a few times and I had reconnect by pulling all the way closed, realigning teeth and reclosing...... furthermore, there is only ONE zipper pull, instead of two which would make it easy if they can meet in the middle and maybe would help the teeth from coming apart on both sides of pull.  I recently purchased another accessory gig bag, this one is from Phitz, now THIS is what all bags should be made of... really touch design.  Zipper pulls are huge, heavy duty and have a rubber sheath around large metal zipper... heavier duty teeth design too and great padding... (see photo) unfortunately they do not make a keyboard back that would fit my 88-key Privia... not yet anyway.	-1
Returned, chorus on my Fender modeling amp worked better.	-1
Maybe my expectations were too high... as soon as I plugged it in I smelled something burning. Pulled the plug and just use a battery...and yes, it was the proper fitting cord. It works, but now I'm hesitant to try any other Behringer product.	-1
Save your money. This chorus is very weak. Ive tried it in different positions in my chain of effects I cant tell its there. Disappointed.	-1
Not good at all	-1
The one I received was defective in that there was hardly any modulation range. But the controls that worked and the overall build quality earned two stars.	-1
This thing will make you sound muddier. It is a poorly designed effect.	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price.	-1
With any peaks, or even just mildly loud guitar input, there is a 'buzzy' kind of distortion noticeable, which ruins the otherwise decent effect. I ended up with the Boss, as this distortion is just unacceptable on clean acoustic or electric guitar. Too bad, because I've had good results with other Behringer equipment.	-1
This thing gives your amp a ton of noise in the background, even when the pedal is off. Not recommended...	-1
First Behringer pedal I have returned. Almost no effect provided by pedal. I have returned the unit. Not worth it. Lousy pedal.	-1
I thought I would give this pedal a try, because it was inexpensive, but as usual, you do get what you pay for. Try to hold out and get a better quality pedal, you will be happier, I'm sure.	-1
I bought this item to use with my Tascam Portistudio and was dissappointed.  There is a constant whirring noise and a massive static attack of white noise when it is plugged in to the system.  It is a good delay pedal other than that.  If you're looking to use this pedal live or just jam out with it then it's for you.  But if you want to record and have a clear sound...I suggest Boss or Digitech.  More expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for.	-1
Stopped working after only 2 1/2 months.  Still has power (bought the power adapter), but suddenly last week the line in/out stopped working.  Tested all cables so it is somewhere inside of the unit.  Kills the signal whether it's active or bypassed, output A or direct output.  Just poor quality.	-1
Pos. Crapped out after one use.	-1
SUCKS , BROKE IN ONE DAY	-1
I have a multiverb that I love, but it is big. It's rack mounted. I was hoping for something cheap but worth the money. I play a lot and I can tell you this is not what I need. I can't tweak it to where it needs to be. Tone is terrible in some positions. Maybe for players in different genre of music may be fine or to just play with. I should have known better. However, it is made very well though. I have no problem with the hard plastic structure.	-1
I bought 3 Behringer pedals in Nov 2010 and all were very poor quality. I returned the DOA volume pedal right away and bought an Earnie Ball. I tolerated the Behringer delay pedal's awful tone for 6 months--then the off-on foot switch stuck ON. The chorus still sorta works, but the effect randomly cuts in and out (very annoying).  Don't waste your time and money on Behringer pedals. The price seems too good to be true, and it is.  Based on these three bad experiences, I cannot recommend Behringer products for anything other than service as a paperweight. Meanwhile, the BOSS pedals I've owned for years, and the ones I recently purchased, all are excellent products.	-1
I liked this a lot at first, but carrying it by the shoulder strap pulls at some of the corner seams and they started coming apart. It's getting really bad now, two years from purchase.  The worst part is that Pedaltrain has reneged on their warranty. I purchased this largely because it came with a lifetime warranty on all parts. Since the time of my purchase, they've changed their policy to only cover the board itselfcases are now covered by a 1-year warranty. That's fine, they can do that for new purchases, but they decided that the new policy applies retroactively. So the fact that I purchased a board with a lifetime warranty means nothing. They're refusing to honor my warranty.	-1
I bought mine a few years back from guitar center and the zipper broke asap.  I repaired the zipper at a shop for ten bucks rather than shipping back and having to put new velcro on a new board.  Otherwise a good concept and good design.  My issue to give it so low a rating is due to break, and frankly and subjectively that its too big for my apartment.  It just has a big footprint.  I don't recommend it unless you are a gigging musician with a studio etc to need such a big piece.  Just sold it at a lost on clist and will either buy a smaller version like the 2, or check out some other custom boards on ebay.  good luck.  also wanted to copy and paste the following review from another user and say I AGREE!  I did one or two gigs, and all the pedals had completely come off the board, total bs.  If you're anything other than the very occasional musician, you'd be better off buying the version of this product with the hard case. I'm gigging 3-4 times a month and find that the soft case allows pedals to shift so much during transit that they come loose from the board. The padded flight case would hold pedals down more securely.  But there's more to the problem. First, the Velcro isn't anywhere near strong enough to hold down heavier pedals (e.g. a Digitech Whammy, even a Cry-Baby), which come loose even when picking the board up to put it in its case. I've ended up using cable ties wrapped around the crossbars to augment the Velcro. Second, the glue on the back of the supplied Velcro isn't strong enough to stay attached to many pedals. I've ended up using Gorilla glue to get the stuff to stick.  I'm not sure there is any solution to these problems, since any pedal-board would have the same issues.  Having said that, it's a good solid pedal-board, probably the best available.	-1
This capo's spring mechanism is too weak to be of any use for most guitars.  To me, it is worthless.  I cannot recommend anyone buy it.	-1
Failed early on.  Spring which is the key to its operation flew out of it across the room after a couple months.  Despite putting it back in place it no longer generates enough strength to keep the strings down.  Quite disappointed as it is a sleek looking capo compared to many.  It was a warrantee for replacement but sending to the UK costs far more than replacing it with a better capo. It was fine before it broke and I do have other model G7th capos that I like.  This one didn't pan out.	-1
I'm giving two stars simply because the capo does what it's intended to do to an extent. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. Yes, it holds down the strings so you can play in a higher key. However, the design on this capo is awful and I can't recommend it.  First of all, it is not adjustable, and out of the box, the spring tension is way tighter than it needs to be to get the job done. You need a fairly strong grip to spread it wide enough to install it. Once you do, the tension is so tight, it pulls the strings slightly, causing some tuning issues. The tension is so tight, if you have a chunky neck, you're going to have issues placing it higher than around the fifth fret.  Secondly, when installed, the darned thing is an eye hazard. I don't like how the two prongs stick up.  Thirdly, the bar that comes in contact with the strings is very narrow and tapers even more narrow toward the high E string. My guess is that from a design standpoint, their thought was that the skinnier strings need less surface area to hold them down. I'm not sure that I agree. The fact that I experienced string pulling/tuning issues leads me to believe they were wrong.  You can get a better capo for the same or less money.	-1
This is the second one of these that arrived 10 cents sharp (or more).  If you want to play by yourself, it's fine, it's in tune with itself (for the most part), but if you want to play with others, or record with it, it is totally unacceptable.  It's WAY sharp, and won't do at all.	-1
Okay, not sure if I got a "bad one" or if tuning is just not a concern for most Melodica / Pianica players, but the one I got is badly out of tune. The sound is wonderful, much nicer than the Hohner Piano 36 I used to own. However, the Pianica is not in tune with itself. My old Hohner Melodica was, at least when I first got it. I'd say most of the octave notes are in tune, but some of them are so out of tune that you would not ever want to play those two notes together and this is something I want to do. I've noticed that the tuning of many free reed instruments these days seems to be a real issue. I guess with Yamaha's reputation and the good reviews here I thought I would be avoiding this problem. Maybe I should have paid double for the 36 note Suzuki Melodian? Perhaps it would have the same issue? Not sure if I can return this item or not but if accurate tuning is an issue for you then buyer beware. If you are a beginner or hobbyist then perhaps you don't care. But if you are a professional or semi-professional musician then I think the tuning is unacceptable for a brand new out of the box instrument. Again, superior tone and quality of construction, but the tuning is just too much. Such a shame.	-1
Headphone sound is very personal, so I'm willing to concede that these may sound just fine for some listeners... They just didn't work well for me. I'm finding that I'm partial to the sound signature of Sennheisers, and I have some mid-priced ($80-$120) Sennheisers that (IMHO) blow these away.  If the price is right, and you don't mind returning them (Amazon is AWESOME, BTW) if you don't like them, they're worth a shot.	-1
Don't waste your time with this, or other sub-20 dollar plastic ocarinas in its class. It's not tuned properly, it's not meant to be a musical instrument. Find a plastic ocarina made by Focalink, Noble, or TNG (STL Ocarina). I most highly recommend the Night by Noble plastic 12-hole ocarina. It sounds so nice that it could pass as a more expensive clay ocarina.	-1
This is a toy replica and not to be confused with a real ocarina.  While the price seems very reasonable, an actual musical instrument can be had for less money . For instance, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Focalink-12-Hole-Plastic-Sweet-Potato-Ocarina-in-Soprano-C-Blue/dp/B004CTVVY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Focalink 12 Hole Plastic Sweet Potato Ocarina in Soprano C Blue</a>&nbsp;actually costs less and it plays its entire range : A5-F7 and is fully chromatic.  Even if it were well tuned, the highest notes barely make a note and are more of an airy sound.  Nothing can be done to overcome this.  This makes the playable range much less and for parents, you end up listening to the wheezy airy sound more than actual notes.  I can't explain why this product is so highly rated, but I implore you to keep searching for another ocarina.  Google OcarinaDiva and watch her ocarina overviews.  This will help you learn what questions to ask.  Also search for TheOcarinaNetwork and ask them for help.  No one has to start on such a horrible instrument.  There is a huge community of helpful people that want to let the world know that the ocarina is MUCH MORE than cheap plastic toys.  Take some time to research a bit more outside of amazon.  I'm sure the reviewers here mean well, but they are ill-informed and ignorant of the diverse high quality market that is out there.	-1
I was hoping to have fun with this expecting it to be a toy. I was very disapointed that even at that one couldnot get any tone modulation. I was not going to record the entire Zelda album cover but to make even toy music would have been nice.	-1
A very little guitar. Dificult to afinate. Disappointed.	-1
The strings it comes with are bad quality and aren't strung properly. They fall severely out of tune within seconds and eventually pull right out. It is nice in appearance, but is 100% unplayable, even as a backpacking/trunk guitar.	-1
I went thru 3 of these - they all worked great on batteries.  But with AC adapter (standard 9v pedalboard power supply) after 5 minutes they started humming/distorting/robot-like stuff.  UNTIL i got the latest revision of the XDS95 which had a new frequency label pasted over the original label on both units.  THIS ONE WORKED GREAT with or without power supply.  I was disappointed that LINE 6 realized they had a problem but made no effort to have the vendors recall or offer a free fix.	-1
Unstretched size is about 10" x 10".  When stretching, one corner pops off when stretching (we're talking a BIG stretch guys) over adjacent or opposite corner.  a 2 - person job putting it on!	-1
This doesn't stay on my Soundcraft mixer.  I mean, it'll stretch out and go over the edges, but it's SO stretchy it usually finds a way to pop off.  It's a cheap, nasty nylon or something; I doubt it'll wear like a good canvas--like my old one.  Notice in the picture that they don't shot anything plugged into the mixer.  That's great: if you never plug anything into yours, this will probably do fine.  But with cords hanging off it, you'll be annoyed with this thing coming half off.  Sorta like in the picture!  Keep looking.  Great idea, poorly executed.	-1
Way too bulky.	-1
Died after running for 5 hours at 9v. Device only used 600ma. Very disappointed.	-1
The Hosa Cable ACD477 Universal AC Power Supply has multiple voltage settings and tips to work with almost anything that takes a wall wart. The tips are simple to change or flip polarity, and voltage configuration with the well-marked dial is easy. Unfortunately, the ACD477 falls short in actual use: cheap lightweight build, really thin and delicate power cable and runs hot. Mine makes a hissing sound after powering a small LED light for 30 minutes, so no good for video or audio sessions. I don't have any way of measuring if the rated 1200mA output is true, but my old Radio Shack 500mA wall wart is twice as heavy, runs cool and powers devices silently. Perhaps the ACD477 is okay for light duty use but I wouldnt trust it in any mission critical assignments such as paying gigs, recording or data protection.	-1
I ordered the CBI Gold Rush guitar cable, 15 foot length...Right out of the box it did not work.  Used my sons working cord to verify that it was the cord.  I sent it back for a refund, bought another brand.	-1
I bought two of these and they are supposedly identical but they were actually two different cable weave patterns, similar but different. The packaging was identical though. Makes one wonder about actual sourcing. I found them more prone to noise from electrical fields than most cables so they are set aside for emergency backup. I'd pass on buying any more.	-1
IT'S NOT A DURABLE PRODUCT!  I say this simply because I am so incredibly cautious with my instruments, take great attention to detail and just about three months into using it, the cap snapped off one of the ends and the string fell through the entire seams and now the cover is basically worthless.  there's gotta be better designs.  It's not well made.  I would not recommend this at all!	-1
Unless you need something that's a perfect fit, all of these spandex covers do deteriorate after a while. Anybody who uses them knows this. If your piano is a homebody like mine, do what I did and simply find a microfiber sheet--here in NYC you can buy a flat sheet for a few bucks--in a neutral color and toss it over your whole keyboard. Doesn't look all professional, but sheds zero. It's microfiber!	-1
so so	-1
This didn't work at all.  Unfortunatly I didn't need the plug right away and didn't know it was faulty, so I missed the return window. Just make sure if you buy it to test it right away.  It is a nice design.	-1
am using it, but it fabric, so dust does accumulate on the exterior like furniture would.  have placed bubble wrap under it to protect piano	-1
This product lasted on the order of minutes- I bought it for an IP camera. The power supply seems to be made of cheap electronics, and after about 15 minutes, I noticed it was no longer supplying power to my IP Camera. Upon investigating, there is no way to fix the circuit inside- try another universal AC power supply, this one isn't worth buying.	-1
I bought one of these before, but this time, I got a lemon. I opened up the box, and it looked like it had been stepped on or dropped, once I put it on my keyboard, it worked great up until I used the drawstring to sinch it up. The draw string had broken, and just pulled out completely.  If you're looking for feedback on my previous keyboard dust cover, it was great, I've been using the 88 and 61 key versions for the last year, going to gigs and back with no trouble.	-1
Needed to power a USB hub which did not include an AC adapter so I bought this. Never worked...AT ALL. What a big disappointment. It shall now be labeled with the appropriate acronym of POS.	-1
It is nothing but a thin piece of cloth. And even gets dust quick.  Please do not waste your money.  3 to 4 dollar is a good price for this.	-1
This is a near formless black cover that i could replace with a nice piece of cloth. Not worth 16 bucks. U G L Y I found the tightner cord. I tried to snug up the cover to the keybord, and the end came off in my hand. I fine garbage quality rag.  I have no idea what folks are talking about when they speak of how well this thing fits. It is a formless rectangular rag.	-1
when the product doesn't work.  I plugged this in to my bass and amp.  Turn on my amp and the loudest hum I've heard rolled thru my house.  (my bad for not having the volume down but jeez)  I thought I blew my speakers.  The cable I received is complete garbage.  Is there no quality control at this "made in the USA" facility?  I have a hard time believing someone plugged this in and checked it before shipping.  Back to Planet Waves.	-1
I purchased  this cable for use in a non - stress position, connecting a stage keyboard to a direct box.  The cable bore no weight and did not hang, rather was very careful run as art of a defined setup that was never changed from stage to stage.  The cable was noisy, and did not feel like quality.  After three consecutive dates using the cable, I removed it from service,, replaced it with a spectra flex cable.  Noise was eliminated - no him, no crackle.  I felt like I was using some old radio shack cable from the 80s where I had to make sure not to move it or I'd run the risk of static in the PA.  guess you get what you pay for, in this case, I've been using the spectra flex for nine months - three days a week, with no trouble - and removed the remaining CBI cables from the stage.  Not worth the risk.	-1
Horrible, the keys are fake and cheap. The drum pads...for lack of a better word...SUCK HUMONGOUS DOG POOP. The macros are cheap and plastic, I paid 100 for a semi-weighted m-audio MIDI and had a better experience with that. I even took it apart and tried fixing the pads. HORRIBLE UNIT FOR THE HIGH PRICE. DO NOT BUY	-1
If I could give these tuners ZERO stars I would. These deserve a minus rating category. Poor workmanship, binding and a 12:1 ratio render these basically unusable to anyone seeking to have their guitar play in tune.  Tune a string which is 2 cents flat (on a Peterson strobe) and move the tuning key the slightest and now you have 2 cents sharp.just starting to put pressure on the key and you can see it change pitch. This is most likely due to the crummy machine work on the gears which cause them to bind. Honestly, these are the absolute worst tuners I have EVER used.  Contacting Sperzel gets a send them back to be repaired. They are new! When asking about buying another set, I asked if they were as bad, could I send them back for a refund. Their reply,"No!" They stated I could only return them for replacement or repair as well.  A 12:1 ratio, in my opinion, isn't a good ratio. The replacement tuners I ordered from Hipshot are 18:1, meaning you can fine tune your guitar. Steer clear of Sperzel, they honestly don't seem to care. How anyone can say anything positive about these, or rate them 5 stars, is beyond me. Total junk.	-1
Used only about 4 times without any problems. Then while setting up at a gig it powered on but no inputs worked.  When it still worked sound quality was acceptable but had an electronic, metallic sound for vocals and acoustic electric guitar and made electric guitars sound thin and tin-like. Playing DJ music through an iPad or iPhone lacked fullness and warmth. For larger gigs I use an Allen & Heath 16:2 MixWizard so the sound quality of this mixer is awful compared to that. I liken this Yamaha's sound to that of an old Mackie.  Having no mute buttons meant needing to memorize levels and turning channels down to zero. Not a deal breaker for the convenience. I really like how this mixer mounts onto a microphone stand using the BMS 10A Mic Stand Adaptor. But now I feel the entire rig was a wasteful purchase. Even though I have only owned this mixer for a few months Amazon says it is past their return policy and the seller J-Tech Digital Inc claims they have no record of the Amazon order number and is offering no technical support. Yamaha has not responded at all. Looks like I am out nearly $250. Totally unacceptable.	-1
Too cheap feeling for pro use, in my opinion.  Spend the extra dough and get a Mackie.  Feels like it would break with a bump.  Effects were not very good...	-1
I've owned 3 of these. It does not sound natural. I would not use it for studio recording and I'd be cautious for stage use. SM58 is better. This mic is loaded with features but fails at what matters which is natural sound capturing. Trust me I researched the hell out of this mic and used a lot of mcis the past few years. Just get a SM58 and EQ it until you get the sound you want from it. It'll be a lot better. This mic also is more plosive than the sm58. Only mic I like from Electro-Voice is their RE20.	-1
Not working right need to get a new 1 not happy	-1
After reading all the great reviews and having good luck with Yamaha products, I ordered one of these, and it appeared to work fine at first (I say appeared because of what happened seems to have plagued this unit from the outset). And wanted to use this to simplify my P.A. Set up (tired of lugging around my 60 lb Yorkville) .  The first gig sounded pretty good, except one of my speakers sounded weak...after tweaking it..there was a slight improvement..until the next gig, when it went nearly dead....  During the time I brought them in...the Yamaha simply make a slight pop sound when I turned it on..and went silent...then the repair shop called and said they could not find anything wrong with the speakers..and sure enough, when I plugged them into the Yorkville, everything sounded as it should. So obviously the "weak" speaker was in actuality, an issue with the mixer.  i plan to send this back to Yamaha and find out what is/was wrong with it. I was hoping for a good Little P.A. Mixer, but so far,no go....	-1
Fri 12/30/2011 3:45 pm. The Yamaha MG102c is a lovely mixer, but it has a defect -- for my purposes -- which is shares with *numerous* other units: the "monitor/phones" output level is controlled by the master level; in this case, by the Stereo level. ... I took the trouble before purchase of downloading Yamaha's manual mg82cx_en_om.pdf, which says "The PHONES jack outputs the same signal as the MONITOR OUT jacks" which "output the signals adjusted by the MONITOR/PHONES control" and "MONITOR/PHONES Control: Controls the level of the signal output to the PHONES jack and the MONITOR jacks; STEREO Master Control: Adjusts the signal level sent to the STEREO OUT jacks."  I obviously don't know how to read these things, but I can't see anything in there about the "Stereo Master Control also controls the headphone level".  Many of the mixers are like this, although not absolutely all; I have no idea why. It was probably cheaper once, but I doubt that's an issue now, and it seems obviously advantageous to have independent control of the two levels, instead of one depending on the other. It would at any rate be advantageous to *me*. So I'm returning it.	-1
I Highly prefer the more natural sound of the RE20. I don't feel this mic is worth the money. I'd rather use a re20 or SM58 over this mic depending on the situation. This mic has horrible sound quality.	-1

They used to be great from what I have heard but something happened and whatever it is, it isn't good.	-1
They are stiff and not nearly as smooth as the 3 other sets of Sperzels that I own. They are going to require some work. I may just return them.	-1
I own a couple of these, and a couple N/D767s, and have purchased & use many EV speakers, over the years. I've always liked EV products, but the 967, & EV, have disappointed me greatly. I did get about five years of occasional use, but I have much older mics that just keep working.  I take excellent care of all my equipment, and this is the first mic I've owned that just stopped working. It may have fallen to the floor one time, not from the stand, but from a table a few feet off a carpeted stage, but I guess that was all it took. Cause I went to use it the next night, and nothing, no sound at all.  A friend who does some electronic work opened it up but said the problem must be deeper into it than he wanted to go. I tried contacting EV, on two separate occasions to see how much it might cost if they repaired it, but they never even responded... I'm used to companies standing behind their products, so this was unexpected, and quite disappointing.  I'll probably have to just toss it, as a repair place would probably charge nearly what's it's worth, just to fix it; and who knows how much longer it would last, anyway? Therefore, I can't really recommend this mic, as I won't be buying another from EV...	-1
Don't buy this if you want to perform with it.  It is interesting to play with, but no true musical skill is involved(in my opinion) and it does not save any programed melodies once turned off.	-1
My first impression after opening was a mixed bag. I really liked how it looked, but, it felt very light and toyish in my hand. First noodlings on this were impressive when hooked up to speakers, the sound quality this thing generates are very clean and good. Controls are intuitive but would take some time to really tweak to your own personal flavor but the 150 presets are fun. I played with this for about 5 hours making dance songs and some cool ambient tracks and the batteries were almost dead. Now the reason I purchased was really to be able to record other devices like my microkorg and guitar and loop all together while overdubbing little tidbits from this. For me personally it failed. The microphone feature is cool but it takes two people to use effectively and the sound quality was sub-par. The loop banks need to be held down to record ( basically loosing a hand ) and once you overdub a loop bank its forever. Meaning, if you lay a drum track then a bass line on loop one then decide to throw in a synth lead over them but don't like how the synth lead turned out you cant simply just delete the synth part, you have to delete the whole loop and start over. Now anyone who has played on Korg X-Y pads know that it is a crap shoot when it comes to playing the exact thing twice, it takes a lot of practice so this really turns out to be what I had expected, a really cool music toy. There are a lot of features on this that make it appealing and I am no Kaossilator expert but for the money they are asking and the cons that I talked about earlier it lasted one day and I returned it. Remember this is my opinion and I really wanted to like it but I couldn't justify keeping it when music gear is so expensive and I could spend my money on something else that would work better for me.	-1
It sounds pretty good and it is a lot of fun to be able to walk around your house while playing electric guitar. However, they are VERY fragile. While playing and walking around my living room I accidentally stepped on the earphone plug cord, and it pulled the ear plug jack partially out of the amp. I cursed, but then noticed nothing hadn't cracked the amp or anything visible, so just pushed the plug back into the amp. No go....the thing won't work anymore. Now obviously this was my fault, but it really is fragile, which is why I can only give it a 2 star. My advice is to get a very short earphone wire so it won't dangle anywhere near your feet while walking around. Just baby it and it might last awhile. The concept is very cool....I just wish they used a metal casing and not cheap plastic. Still...it was fun while it lasted. Enjoy!	-1
Poor dynamics - I hate playing through it with distortion on. Does the job for having a line in, and for a clean sound. I still use it when I play late night when everyone is asleep, but overall the amp could be better...I would not recommend this. Better to go through your amp, witha direct out to your headphones if you can. The portability of this thing is cool, but again, just if you're playing thru the clean channel, with or without a line in...	-1
I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. Generously, I'll give it 2stars. Something like this really should last at least a year or more. Cheap parts/manufacturing?  50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature.	-1
As an amateur musician, I'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such.  I thought this gadget would do the trick, but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn't meet my expectations.	-1
If you are desperate to have a quiet guitar and can't afford a 1 watt amp, this is a good substitute.  It sounds about the same through cheap or expensive headphones, which is to say it sort of sounds like a guitar.  The highest headphone volume isn't all that loud, so you won't lose any hearing with this unit, although I still like my music loud, even through headphones.....so it's sort of a disappointment.  The knobs are small and hard to read, so memorize what does what.  It isn't difficult as there are only three of them you need to bother with, but they are small and virtually impossible to see while playing.  I usually plug in an MP3 player with some backing tracks on it, and play over them. The battery is easy to change but doesn't last all that long.  These little units have their place, just don't expect too much. I paid about $30 for mine so I guess I shouldn't expect too much.  Waddie	-1
Sound is not so good. Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything.	-1
I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these. Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.  For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same). Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans..	-1
I bought this unit to use with a ZT Lunchbox amp. The idea was to have a giggable rig that weighs under 10lbs. At the time, the ZT Acoustic LB Amp wasn't yet out.  So far, in hours of trying, I haven't been able to get a really good sound with this combination.  If I use a Boss ME50 instead of the Korg unit, I get a better sound. These aren't comparable products, but I mention this to point out that the problem is not entirely the Lunchbox amp.  What I am looking for is EQ and Reverb. I really don't need the other features, except for the tuner. I can't quite get a reverb sound I really like. The EQ depends on the amp model. I can get it dialed in, but then, for some reason, I'll find myself fiddling with it over and over. Part of the problem may be the Lunchbox amp -- but I don't need the Korg's small size, EQ or reverb if I'm toting a larger amp anyway.  On the positive side, when used as a practice amp with headphones, it sounds great. I don't really understand why I can't get it to sound good through the amp.	-1
I'm an amateur hip hop artist and a good mic is paramount for me. Long story short, I'm still looking for one. Next on my list is the Rode NTK1 as I hear good things about it. I found this A-T mic model number on a blog where someone said it was a good mic and I decided to purchase it. First off, it's WAY overpriced. I think its worth about $160-180 dollars max. Its an extremely flat response mic, not dynamic at all. I'm sure it would work well for some type of plays or film works where a depressing, flat sound is best. I think they made it that way to reduce background noise, but regardless this mic does not sound great at all. It is accurate though, I'll give it that. But its just a boring mic. I don't really know how else to explain it. My vocals were a lot quieter than I would have liked, and they just sounded kind of dry and minimized before I threw on any special effects.	-1
It did not work at all. Now I am stuck with a useless piece of  cheaply made plastic.	-1
This thing is all right for what it does, but either way I wouldn't buy it again. If you are REALLY dead set on using headphones, then just buy an eighth inch to quarter inch cord adapter. It's cheaper and not as bulky. Personally, I hate headphones when playing - I like to hear myself rock out. They make a lot of great, inexpensive products similar in size to this one that actually emit sound and act like a mini, portable amp. Get one of those!  Bottom line: not worth it. Either get a standard eighth inch to quarter inch adapter for headphones, or even better get a portable mini amp that emits sound that doesn't require headphones.	-1
This toy headphone amp sounds okay, and may sound a little bit like an AC-30, but it's junk. It is made of cheap plastic and will not be around for long before it breaks. A reasonable price for this might be ten bucks.  Please don't waste your money on this.	-1
The Amp itself is weak at best.  But it is useful and I guess the concept is a good one.  It warbles and you have to find the right 'sweet spot' to get a decent sound.  Echo is acceptable but distortion is well, distorted - but not in the good way.  I think it's good enough for what it is/does and probably worth in the $20 range.  Now for the warning.  See the Bundle picture, it shows the Vox Lead amPlug Amp,  the Vox Speaker unit and an unnamed Headset.  Then in the other pictures they show each item individually?  See those?  You don't get those.  At least *I* didn't get those.  I got the Vox Lead amPlug, some batteries and a patch cable.  After several emails and a couple of phone calls, I still haven't received the VOX Speaker box or the unnamed headsets in their so called *bundle*  When I saw the bundle image and the individual pictures of each item from the 'bundle' I figured the individual Vox Lead amPlug was $43'ish all over Amazon and other outlets so $5 more for the Vox speaker was a great deal as that item goes for $23 and the headsets are a take or leave bonus throwaway item.  Forget it.  You get the Vox Lead amPlug Amp and $2 worth of 'extras' in this *bundle*  Bottom line.  See the pictures?  You don't get those, you get the Vox amPlug Amp. For that you may as well order just the Vox Lead amPlug.  Keep that in mind if you go to order this.	-1
These were recommended as softer strings for easier action by a friend.  Not so.  Equal or worse than original Aquilas and sound is not as sweet.  Brighter sound and lower price but not as mellow.	-1
I purchased the amPlug AC30 to use with my Speedster Traveler Guitar, and I was excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately, it never worked.  The quarter inch male plug is slightly too short to engage the female socket on my guitar. No matter how I turned it or how hard I pushed, it would never "snap" into place.  I checked to see if the guitar would make any sound through the amPlug.  The amp made the usual hissing sound when I turned the gain all the way up, but I never got even a single guitar tone from the device.  It's back in the package and will be returned tomorrow.  Nice idea.  Bad implementation.	-1
When this thing arrived the head was cracked in two places. All it would do is buzz when plugged in. I gave it to a friend to fix and he replaced the pickup and counter sunk some screws to hold the head together. The body seems to be particle board. As someone said you get what you pay for.	-1
I've noticed that most of these reviews are on recently purchased units.  I repair and build guitars, and one of these arrived at my shop for repair which was about a year old. In my opinion, there are some inherent problems with this unit that make it low quality. When intonating, the saddles on the bridge cannot move enough to keep it intonated correctly at the 12th and 24th position. It always goes sharp. So you have to adjust the whole bridge back with the little screws they provide for this purpose until the saddles come into range. That's why the bridge has the long slots. Once you begin to move the bridge back,(with strings loose, of course), the bridge posts are riding out further in the bridge slots, which puts the bridge behind the posts. The adjustment screws are terribly undersized, I believe only 2.5MM.  When you tighten the strings, the bridge will begin to slant up, putting undue stress on the posts, since now only the bridge wings are holding the whole setup to the posts. The one that I received had bent posts from tilting bridge stress, and the threaded inserts had started to loosen in the low quality wood used in this unit. The bridge wings had started to move apart.  I was forced to rebuild the insert holes, replace both the inserts and the posts, and reassemble. Upon doing this, I found that one of the tuners had suffered a tooth skip, making it unusable for tuning. Also, the handles on the keys of the tuners come loose constantly, making it seem like there is a lot of play. Possibly putting Locktite on the key screws would help. I'd look for something a little more well built, if you consider yourself a lapsteel player who is concerned for correct tone across the entire board.  UPDATE, June 2012: Just got another one of these in, a shop owner told me I could buy it for $25, case and all.  Perfect condition, not a scratch, save the bridge is again doing the same thing.  The posts are down in the wood and the bridge is coming up.  Will make repairs in my shop so it is proper and sell it at a small profit.  I'd stay away from these, just junk.	-1
If it were made better, it would be a great case.  The backpack straps are comfortable, having lots of pockets is awesome.  The foam body probably won't protect well if the guitar is stepped on, etc.  But if the guitar takes a fall, the foam will probably take the shock better than a true hardshell case.  But the build quality seems to be problematic.  First, as others have noted, the zipper catches.  You have to work it a little to get the case open.  And the case is top heavy, and tends to fall over when you open it.  Be very careful, or your guitar will get dumped and scratched.  Those two problems were annoying, but not enough to turn me off of the case.  Then after one week of light use, the strap that keeps the top from opening all the way popped out.  Apparently it's held on by a single staple into foam!  I almost set my guitar right onto the staple before I noticed the problem!  I wasn't too bummed about that bc then I could open the case all the way, so it didn't topple over.  But then, after a couple of months, the hinges broke loose, and their screws were projecting into the case.  When I returned the case to the store where I bought it, they said that this was unusual.  But, fearing that the poorly attached strap would break again, causing the hinges to fail again, I decided to trade in for a different case.	-1
Ordered 427R, which looked gold/yellow, and got skin/translucent picks??? It looks like ALL Ultex picks are translucent skin, or black color, and the translucent skin picks are VERY HARD TO SEE. If I dropped the skin pick on stage, I  would NEVER be able to find it! As stated, Dunlop makes a black version of this pick, so introducing a pigment into the Ultex mix does not look like a problem. Pick is small (jazz), Very stiff, and slippery; I like it. Since this is one of  the smallest picks you can buy, it makes me wonder what Dunlop was thinking by also making it close to impossible to see.	-1
There is a slight hum from my Digitech vocalizer 4.  This amplified it.  May be an electrical thing this won't handle so I won't criticize other than to say it didn't do what I expected and needed it to do.	-1
It didn't work for me. I still heard/have the hum at one of my gigs. I will try it a few more time in different scenarios. Will switch XLR cables. For the most part, this is a dud. Stay tuned.	-1
It was very FRUSTRATING to excitedly unpack the product only to realize that the power input socket is misaligned with the metal case, making it IMPOSSIBLE to properly insert the power adapter cord. Without power, the unit is useless. I am sending it back, and have ordered a replacement. I did notice that others have also discovered problems with quality control on this item, so we'll see if the replacement unit has the same issue as the first.  For now, I can only give the Rolls PM351 ONE STAR.	-1
I really tried to like the product, inexpensive but not ideal.  A little bit of static in headphones from device.  The worst part was the little tiny opening that you have to use a needle-nose pliers to remove a tiny little connector to switch from mono to stereo.  Just that alone was worth a 1 star but I thought I'd be nice and give it 2.  Rolls, change that one thing and I could handle the little static because I'm sure that is fixable, but that tiny connector and opening...yeesshh!  That is/was a PAIN!!  I returned this and spent a little more money on the Behringer P16.	-1
NOT good for line level signals.  Tried to combine two synthesizer keyboards into one stereo input on my digital mixer.  The volume was attenuated so much, it was unusable; the signal seemed to lose crispness, though perhaps that's just because so much of it was lost in the noise floor.	-1
Mine was dead on arrival. It shafted me twice the first two times when I tried to use it and it didn't work.  It's a simple passive device, what could go wrong? I popped it open and took a look for myself. General build quality is cheap, one notch above junk. I examined the solder joints with a hand held microscope and the joint quality was pretty bad. Cold solder joints all over the place. You could see where the solder was not adhering to the leads of the transformer and the connectors. Even worse one of the solder pads for one of the transformer leads was broken from the pc board trace leading to it, a nearly invisible defect that was hard to find. After fixing that I did an A/B test to listen to how transparent it wounded. I have 50 year old drummers ears and even to me, it was easy to hear that this unit smeared the sound, not horribly, but certainly noticeably. I really wanted to like this, but I can't. This is the second Rolls device I've purchased. Both were DOA.	-1
I bought this, the 2nd input produces no sound which renders that input useless. The fact that the full intent of this device is to provide 4 outputs, yet fails to do so.  Means the quality control is obviously not there. So if u want 3 outputs for the price of 4, go ahead and buy this.	-1
I own several Rolls products and am satisfied with all of them, except this one.  The workmanship was terrible.  It feels solid in your hand, but the potentiometers cut out left or right channels intermittently.  Additionally, the unit adds severe distortion to the signal long before it's maxed out.  in fact, the distortion is grotesque and unbearable beyond the 5 setting on any channel, with input volumes at any audible level (for my uses, I'm at line level).  I'm confused as to how other reviews are so kind.  Perhaps my unit was defective?  I'm not going to chance another 80 bucks on another defective unit.  Amazon was fantastic in the return process, though, so if you are going to take the risk, Amazon is certainly the route to go.	-1
wasted money	-1
The mic stand arrived broken.  Not a very good quality stand anyway.  Neither is the mic cable.  The mic?  It's a SM58.  Can't really go wrong there. That's the only reason this gets two stars.  Otherwise, it'd be one star.  I'm sending it ALL back because of the stand.  I will just buy the components separate and get a better quality boom stand.	-1
I thought these picks would be interesting to try out, but the raised portion is way too thick, and I did not get a very good strumming experience from using them.  Can't recommend them.	-1
I don't care how much I choke up on these.  I still can't get the level of stiffness that is available in a Dunlop Tortex green.  I was very exited to try these, but after trying them extensively on both acoustic and electric guitars, I can say that these just don't work for me.  If you already use and enjoy thin picks, then I would recommend giving them a go.  Otherwise, don't waste your time and money.	-1
HOSA CABLE DMX 500, 20 FOOT. LIKE THE REVIEWS SAID, ONLY 3 PINS WORK OUT OF 5. PIECE OF CRAP!	-1
These would be perfect, except for the play or space between the cable coming out of the connector and the connector itself. They should've put the heat shrink tubing on the outside of the metal to make it more robust. I've come to prefer the solid molded patch cables for connections on my pedal board. They take up less space, their more compact which if your using a Stereo pedal means you can connect the second output cable without too much interference from the primary (mono) output.  STSI, the 3rd party vendor went above and beyond the call of duty when it came to Cust. Svc. - 5 Stars*****	-1
Not the best. Failed after 2 weeks. Would not buy again.	-1
Works but the cable is very thin and looks cheap. This is hard to see in the picture. I would at least go for the pig hog cables for patch cables, bought a couple of them at Sam ash and ordered them on amazon. They were all well made with much heavier gauge cable.	-1
Total crap and worthless	-1
The silver bolt's has internal threading to attach onto a smaller black bolt that is affixed to the clamp.  The issue is that the threading goes the same way - so when unscrewing the silver part comes off and you have to get pliers to get it out of your mic mount.  This makes it a hassle to deal with on the road or if you ever have to move your mic.	-1
Has no Yamaha logo. Legs are not ideally straight, the one I received had one of the legs slightly twisted. Makes whistling sound when one sits due to air escaping through the featured air vent.	-1
RETURNED THIS DUE TO FACT THE ELECTRONICS  FOR THE KEYBOARD THIS CAME WITH WAS OLD SCHOOL , HAVE TO NAVIGATE TOO MUCH  TO CHOOSE SELETION  OF  TONE  HARMONY  AND RYTHM	-1
It arrived broken at the neck, so have to return. I may try again and post an update...	-1
This has been a great gift for my daughter; but the instrument will not stay tuned.  The pegs keep slipping. Emailed customer service and they indicated that it could be a result of temperature change.  It's in the same room and the pegs keep slipping. - The cello arrived and I took to local shop to have tuned.  The bridge had a gap and had to be fixed (cost $35). - Wish someone could tell me how to get the pegs to stop slipping?	-1
It's a toy.  Don't do it.  Rent or buy from a local music store.	-1
Wtf I was going to put a speaker on this but I can't reach 8' and I need my monitor next to my ear. This pole is like 5' long no way you can use this with out cutting it	-1
This On-Stage bag doesn't fit their own stands!  The bases fit, but the poles do not.  We have the On-Stage Quick Release Round Base Mic Stands, model MS7201QRB, paired with the Top Mount Euro-Style Tele Boom, model MSA-7040 TB.  The pole sleeve is too narrow to accommodate the bottom washer on the pole.  You have to remove it to put the pole in the sleeve, meaning the washer is easily lost.  The pole sleeve is also too narrow to accommodate the quick release mechanism at the top of the pole.  The pole sleeve could be cut away so that the rest of the pole fits in the sleeve, but that still won't fix the problem.  When using the quick release bottom paired with the Tele Boom top, the pole assembly is too long to fit in the bag, no matter if the pole is in the sleeve or not.  So, to use this bag, the pole must be removed from the base, the bottom washer removed and stored somewhere else, and the top mount boom assembly must be removed and left loose in the bag.  That is really dumb.  The bag itself has reasonable construction, so it might be useful for other mic stand brands, but it won't fit their own On-Stage mic stands.  NOT RECOMMENDED.	-1
Doesn't clear a Casio PX-560 keyboard. Needs to be an inch or so taller if you bought it to mount a small monitor.	-1
I bought two of these and on both samples, the threads of the screw did not turn smoothly. There was binding at several spots. One was pretty bad and the other not so much but still, poor quality and/or quality control.  Also be aware that this item will extend upwards only 6" from where it screws into the keyboard stand. This is fine for mounting a mic, but if you're thinking of putting a laptop tray on it, it may not clear the top of the keyboard (misses on mine by an inch or so). So for that application you may end up needing some extension tubes.  Haven't tried it yet with a mic, but for all the people saying it picks up lots of low frequency, the way around that is to filter it out with low cut filters. Shouldn't interfere with vocal frequencies.	-1
This did not work out for me because there is no way to cut a whole into the stand of the keyboard---the handle is solid steel or has a and end cap that is impossible to chip out. I ruined a whole keyboard stand trying. Make sure your keyboard has a tube  available in one of the arms after removing end-cap. It is definitely not universal because  your keyboard design may be different from their  install method. Disappointed with design and install requirement.	-1
The vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone. It now rest at bottom of a box.	-1
Has some Hiss in it, which is unacceptable to me. Will be returning for some of Elite Cores Snakes which seem to be cheaper & higher quality. I'm using these as drop snakes not main snakes, however if they introduce issues, it provides me no benefit over running mic cables direct to the main snake head.  For a small bad/church etc it would probably work fine.	-1
Don't drop this thing on your toe!  This is a seriously heavy hunk of metal that secures very poorly to a microphone boom via a single, small threaded screw, capped by a flimsy plastic hand twist.  Easily falls off the boom during attachment, and when it hits the floor, the plastic hand twist immediately breaks off (mine broke off during my first attachment).  It's just as well, however, as a pliers or a socket wrench is absolutely required to tighten the screw hard enough to keep the weight from moving about and/or falling off.  This boom weight is a good idea....but an extremely poor design with no attention whatsoever given to weight symmetry within its own shape.  Most importantly,  a much more substantial bolt is needed to keep this monster weight from falling off and killing one of your pets!  And don't even think about repositioning it once it's finally bolted into place.  The position of everything on your boom has to be carefully aligned AFTER the weight is completely secured, or the entire top boom will rotate to the weights asymmetrical balance point, no matter how much you tighter the boom's securing bolt.  On a positive note, however, you could probably hang off the other end of the boom without tilting the rig.    One final caution.......the final total weight on the top boon may be so heavy with this weight plus mics, iPads, cables etc., that the mic stand's center securing nut may not be strong enough to prevent slow collapse of the entire upper rig into the bottom pole (especially with a flimsy mic stand).  To stop that dogged tendency of the upper pole to collapse,I had to tighten mine so much that I stripped my stand's metal secure nut, and wound up having to purchase an entirely new (and stronger) stand.  Just carrying my keyboard IPad stand is now an aerobic exercise at every gig....but that baby don't fall over no more!!	-1
Had a tune-o-matic with one saddle that was cut too deep - thought I'd give these a try since I've had good results with TUSQ and synthetic nuts . . .ordered correct, specific parts and still needed filing to fit (ok with that so far). . .then one cracks! Save yourself the trouble, go buy a brass saddle or other metal.	-1
I bought this amp twice in one week - first one I purchased was dented and the fans didn't run, only channel A put out sound.  Returned it to amazon, bought a replacement, opened this one... same problem, dented case, "void if opened" sticker was half peeled off and channel B was the only one to work this time..... from the looks of the reviews on this site, I am not the first, and probably won't be the last to be ripped off on "re-packaged" broken amps that obviously the manufacturer is trying to offload on the unsuspecting.... boo Pyle!!!!!	-1
OK - 1st unit arrived dead in water apart from the power light. Connected a know, good mic and to our working speaker. Unit was replaced quickly but the replacement also failed to work. I looked for a supplier to see if there was some unseen trick to getting this running to no avail. Therefore I am forced to give up on this make/model and look elsewhere. So far it has put my theatre project back a week	-1
weak amp...don't bother	-1
The amp doesn't work on channel a if i new it was broken i would have never bought it Im not happy at all	-1
I purchased 3 of these for our church.  Now only one channel works on 2 of them.  I hope the seller would contact me or be able to replace them.  [...]	-1
Returned same week. Power may be seriously overestimated. My 200W Sansui Stereo receiver sounds better	-1
Used it for two shows, pushing (2) 400 watt (PYLE) passive speakers at approx half volume - and the right channel blew.  It took too long between getting the product and working a few shows for me to still return it.  Pyle is an awesome brand for getting sound equipment on an Amazon budget....but the stuff is reallllllllly unreliable.  Buy three if you only need one, that's your insurance policy and it's still cheaper than the next level up!  :)	-1
Don't even think about this.	-1
Was broken as soon as I got it. Not happy !! But the 3100 Pyle pro is great works good and is durable thus far.	-1
Amp has no power to drive speakers.plus you have to turn it all the way up to get sound.and it cut, s out	-1
Stationed in Australia, so we shipped DPO. first off it will cost more and be a bigger hassle to return from here. Secondly in spite of cautious reviews I thought the law of averages meant more people would complain than praise, so hopefully numbers were skewed, I was mistaken. Pyle evidently has no quality control at all? one channel cuts in and out on our first practice? yes I replaced cables, checked board, this thing fails right outta the box. So disapointed they can sell broken poor quality junk like this? I am just trying to give a few people far from families and home, a little joy and play some music with everyone...? You know we are not getting rich over here, but I can right this off I guess, as I should have known better. I though Amazon would not sell broken poor quality cheap junk as if it is decent working affordable gear... buyer beware, my bad?	-1
CHANNEL A WOULDN'T WORK AND BRIDGE MODE SOUNDED HORRIBLE I CAN SAY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE PERIOD	-1
The only two things I have positive to say about this amp is that its cheap, and very light weight. The negatives, the fan is super loud, it is no where near 1000 watts, it redlights very quickly, very poor sound quality. If you need something cheap to play soft music through some 50-100 watt speakers, just buy a boom box. The fan produces more sound than the amp itself. Dont you it for a PA because people talking or singing into mics  peaks it out really quickly.	-1
I Bought this Item in OCT 2012 I Have only used it twice and the output port is bad on it it sounded pretty good when it did work but the craftsmanship of the item sucks. I learned my lesson only by good quality products where the manufacturer stands behind their items	-1
This is my second one.  The first one I got, I wasn't sure if it was the cables I am using so I bought new cables (twice).  The sound is muffled and low.  Finally confirmed that the receiver is defective so I sent it back to Amazon for replacement.  The replacement came in today.  Alas.  There is sound coming out when I plugged on Channel B!.  Ok.!  Moving along, I tested the bridge setting.  It's working.  So far so good.  Plugged it in Channel A on bridge.  NO SOUND!  Switched back to stereo.  Sound came out on one side.  The Bridge doesn't work when plugged in to Channel.  Conclusion.  Similar to other reviews.  Piece of junk.  Too bad.  The exterior is well built and sturdy.  I was going to buy a pair of 500 Watt Pyle speakers but not anymore.  Spend your money on other brands.	-1
THIS IS AN ADDENDUM TO AN EARLIER REVIEW.........SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING BUT A PYLE POWER AMP....TODAY ON MY 6TH GIG WITH LESS THAN 20 HOURS (AT ABOUT 2-3 HOURS AT A TIME) IT DIED!!!!!!I DJ ON THE SIDE AS A HOBBY AND THIS AMP MADE ME LOOK BAD......NEVER AGAIN..BUY A PEAVEY, CROWN, QSC OR ANYTHING BUT A PYLE.	-1
IVE HAD THIS A TOTAL OF THREE MONTHS AND TODAY IT STARED FADING IN AND OUT WHEN I WAS PLAYING MY KARAOKE MUSIC.  THANK GOD I WAS NOT AT A GIG.  MY ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO GO WITH THE INVESTMENT AND BUY A MARSHALL AMPLIFIER HEAD AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME HEADACHE WITH THIS GARBAGE.  GOOD LUCK WITH ANYTHING THESE DAYS MADE IN CHINA.  I GO THROUGH A NEW AMP EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS BECAUSE IM A PROFESSIONAL SINGER AND IM REALLY GETTING TIRED OF THE GARBAGE THEY SELL TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I bought this little amp because I didn't want to blow out the speaker system hooked up to my computer, and also to have something light enough to carry around without hurting my back when performing outside my home. I had read many of the reviews on this site and decided this Behringer would definitely fit the bill.  Oh, well. It's light, all right - but unfortunately that's the only plus I can come up with. Although I used high-quality cables to hook it up to my Yamaha keyboard, and although I adjusted the low, middle, and high range, and although I set the volume so it was pleasant and not buzzy - none of that really helped with the fair (at best) quality sound that came out of its speaker. As another reviewer wrote, I guess I expected too much of something that's just unable to produce what I need it to.  The speaker system I have hooked up to my computer is a Logitech Z623, and the vibrance and flat response across the board are wonderful indeed. People who hear them are wowed by their fantastic output. Unfortunately, when you compare the sound to the Behringer, it's not even comparable.  Guess I'll stick to my Logitechs for awhile. Lesson learned.	-1
Ive been playing guitar & bass for over 25 years & I also like to D.J. I bought this with intentions to use it bridged to drive a Dayton 15" sub. I never made it there. Testing it I'm running it -2-chanels. side-1 to a pair of full range (5.25" bookshelf speakers)total 4ohm load. & the other channel crossed over to a JBL 10" sub. Both are run through a compressor / limiter. I cant believe how weak this amp is! I can actually push it to start CLIPPING before the cheap 5.25" speakers give out . I also have a CARVIN 1000 watt poweramp that I play bass through & believe me that the PYLE is just a pile. The carvin will push a Eminence 15 with -1- channel & push it to it's max. The voice coil will start to smell & thsts when I turn it down. The Pyle is clipping with no problem & a true 1000 watt amp would melt those 5" speakers within seconds. Save the money & spend it on a quality poweramp About $300 will get you in the REAL 1000watt range.	-1
Not working at all!	-1
I usually don't like giving things a 1-start rating, but I have no option. I got this thing and plugged it in, for nothing to happen. It was pretty much completely dead. It did get it to turn on once, but when i turned it off to move it by my sound equipment, it never turned on again. I could not take the change when I need something that will work every gig. I sent it back for the Behringer EPQ 12000. I have never had a single problem since.	-1
I ordered a wireless PA system from Pyle Pro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. The unit itself worked fine but the antenna for the belt transmitters are poorly mounted and pulled out on both units supplied. I understand that things like this happen but here is the big problem. Customer service is non-existent with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts department that NEVER gets returned. Out of pure frustration I went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. Finally I got a guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me the next Monday. No call came. Again I called and got nasty this time and finally got my order placed through a rude man. I guess that serves me right because I was rude right back out of pure frustration. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. Well second worse, Sears appliance repair takes the top spot on this.	-1
THE AMP CAME DAMAGE WITH A LARGE DENT IN THE TOP AFTER 3 months of play IT STOPED PLAYING STEROE THRU CHANNEL A so I use channel A as mono	-1
The price grabs your attention with this item but I would not recommend this amp. I have already gone through two of these amps.  You get what you pay for with this item.  The first one I had, one of the channels died after about 4 months.  When I got the replacement that one worked for not even a month.  I was at a gig when it died and had to go to my local music store to purchase an amp.  This product is NOT dependable.  Especially if you are DJing weddings or parties.  Spend the money on a GOOD amp.	-1
I got  mine  yesterday and  plugged in, went out and got adapters so I could plug it to my comp and..... nothing. I try different  adapters but I had the right ones the first time. When I turn it on I have to  turn the volume all the way up and it sounds like the speaker wires are crossed. I tried several different ways to get it working  right but it just  don't. Today I'm returning them for a new amp and  hopefully the next works right. Now I know  Pyle isn't the best  brand  out there but I don't have  $500 to get a GOOD amp after I lost my Sony Muteki in pawn, over 1k in that unit, pawned twice + 2 yr insurance on that unit.	-1
As I've heard with the Pyle Pro amps, I received mine today, and it was defective. Only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. The packaging was very good though, so I'm  thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. Already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday...	-1
This PA head has all the "features" you would want. Reverb, delay, 4 channels, etc. However, to get the effects to work to the point where they actually sound like effects requires turning all the control knobs up all the way. Another quirk is if you want only delay, you can't get it unless you turn up the reverb control. What? Anyway I finally got it setup for my practice room with my piano and it sounds good. But this head would never work in a band or rehearsal setting since it's underpowered and the effects are quirky to manage and set. Best bet is to go buy a straight PA head with no effects and then buy a mixer with built in effects. It will cost more but you get what you pay for. BnB Beatles Depot	-1
I am sure the amp head is amazing but didn't get it yet, tracking still says the same thing and pyle trusted Amazon to ship it. So I must blame them both and I am such a loyal customer to both company's . I may just find another supplier	-1
It says "Tapered design allows greater fit to a variety of guitars" and has no mention of hole measurements in the description as of writing this, yet it didn't fit my Palmer guitar's hole, the hole is quite smaller. Now that I go back to the product page I can see some other people have had the same issue. If it's not good for all guitar holes they should at least specify in the description the range of hole sizes for which it will fit.  Also, as others have mentioned, it came with TWO HOLES punched through it to pass the twist tie they used for packaging. Seriously Planet Waves?!? You couldn't find a way to package your product without intentionally damaging it in the process?!? Wow. (If you're wondering about this, look at the review photos, someone else already took a photo of the holes it comes with)	-1
Cheaply made.	-1
ehhh	-1
DEFINITELY does NOT fit a Martin Orchestra size (OOO, or OM) model sound hole which is 3 7/8". Wood made cracking noises trying to get it in pushing in the sides of the rubber with a plastic tool. Yikes!!! The product may work great - couldn't tell you. It also would not fit in my Epiphone DR-212 Dreadnaught. Both common size guitars. Just too big. Obviously so when you look at it.	-1
too hard to fit in the sound hole, seems to be oversized and interfered with my preamp	-1
I work in a music studio. No need to explain why the company that makes these should know better than to shoot two huge holes in this item as a packaging method. A plastic bag would be fine as this hard foam wouldn't be damaged in the shipping process. Also this product is not "ONE SIZE FITS ALL" by a long shot. Measure your guitar hole before ordering and fill the holes with rubber cement.	-1
This is useless to me.	-1
NOT happy at all with this item, doesn't fit any of my guitars. It is extremely larger that any full size hole.	-1
Doesn't reduce sound worth a darn.  I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things.  Muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in dB.	-1
This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar.  I measured the whole at 3 7/8", but this cover does not even come close to fitting!  It measures 4 1/6" in diameter, so check your guitar closely!	-1
firstly, the package arrived on time...thanks for that! secondly, when i opened the package, i did not like how it was presented...why? the product was punctured on two areas for a string to pass through it and be attached at the ad paper/card board that went with it...why does it has to be like that? they should have just placed them on the ad paper and not drill a hole in it...thirdly, the diameter does not fit good on my guitar...it is kinda big...and lastly, when i forced it in placed even though it was not positioned properly in the hole, the sound quality of my guitar was changed...i was completely dissatisfied with the product...sorry! i would not recommend this item to anybody...	-1
I used this thing for one live show and I look down to find black scuff mark all over my guitar!!!!  I guess from where my pick was making contact with it......  I will never use it again	-1
Cumbersome to use.	-1
I really didn't like this case humidifier.  It doesn't hold enough water and didn't last a year before I had to replace it.  I went back to the sound hole sponge type which, despite having to move the strings, does a better job and doesn't need refilling anywhere near as much.  This one also started leaking, which is another problem I don't have with the sponge type.	-1
I bought 4 of these humidifiers, 2 each for my tenor size and soprano size ukulele hard cases. I live in Sedona Arizona where the humidity in the house regularly gets below 20%. Even with 2 oasis humidifiers for each uke, the humidity in the hard case goes down to 30%. Just recently I noticed  I could start to feel the fret wires stick out on the tenor, this is a sure sign of wood shrinkage. So I put 2 pieces of damp sponge (each piece about 1"x2") in the case by the neck and that got the humidity up to 80%. After a day, the neck started to swell again and the wires felt more normal. The point is: 2 oasis humidifiers for 1 uke could not bring up the humidity to normal range, 35% to 55%! Absolutely useless, could not even come close to the effectiveness of an ordinary household sponge! Give me a break Oasis, you charge $20 each for this junk? A ripoff as far as I'm concerned.	-1
I've used various humidifiers in all my cases over the years, mainly in fall and winter when the indoor humidity drops. This one caught my attention last year so I thought I'd get a couple to put in the cases of my old Les Pauls, just to see if they are any better. They both have worked fine until recently when one has decided to leak. The outer fabric is soaked. NO! Not in the case with one of my babies! There is no way to verify what the problem is but I'm sure the bladder has split. Of course, this made the plush lining wet in the case where it sat. Luckily I still had my Planet Waves case humidifier to put back in this ones place. None of them have ever leaked. Unfortunately, those seem to be disappearing from the market place, unless you by one with the humdity sensor which boosts the price way up. I'm sadly disappointed with the Oasis due to the leaking. And since they go for nearly $20 a pop, I won't be buying another.	-1
This review is for the 185 lav when used with the "presenter" receiver which it is normally packed with. Bought this 185 and plugged it into the mixer and it seemed to work so I left for the night. The next day the seminar speaker used it. He stood 20 feet away from the receiver. When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a pillar) it dropped. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, "You ruined the event." I took full responsibility but no, I didn't. Sure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feel like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. The worst part is, for $100 more I could have got the nice RE2 from EV which has awesome ratings and lasts for 10+ years. What the heck was I thinking? I'll never ever buy another sure product as long as I live and neither should you. Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store Chinese junk. What a horrible terrible product experience. Sure, you used to be such an amazing company with a rich audio history, why did you sell your soul to the devil? You ruined my reputation because I banked on you. I won't make that mistake again.	-1
This is a cool pedal. It works as they say, tracking all the way. I'm just old school. Sounds ok. Way too expensive!	-1
Not a good unit had trouble with the output..	-1
GOT ONE AND IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT, DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT AND RETURNED ITEM. got my other one and did my first gig with it and it failed. got hot and quit .  i am returning it and getting a peavey..	-1
Quality 's kind of below standard, even for speech, I'm not gonna even touch on  singing with this thing.  Not loud enough at all even with the volume cranked to the max.  Returned this thing as fast as I could	-1
already explain to the seller that everything was ok, ecepct the guitar input is not loud enought no matter how high you try to raise the volume. mic. 1 & 2 inputs are ok.	-1
It worked all of 2wks then I got another one but with so-called 800 watts, and was pretty much the same junk. I sent it back as well.	-1
OK, Amazon was great, and it arrived in 2 days! However, the previous reviews are right - the wireless mic SUCKS - POS! The sound quality was very poor, it was made of cheap plastic, and it cut out when I got more than a few feet away. So I plugged in my Sennheiser - you need XLR-to-phono cables - and the sound sucked as well. There is no EQ control, and that is a deal breaker for vocals. However, the guitar input was much louder, and my guitar sounded great. I read a review that said they used this on an airfield - whatever! There is no way this puts out much sound beyond filling a small room. I wouldn't even use it for karaoke. I was expecting something bigger and louder. I sent it back.	-1
I never planned to use this for anything heavy and have yet to do so. However, I have used the truss a few times just to hold up a backdrop with my name on it and it sags terribly. The backdrop can't weigh more than 5 pounds and is 10 feet wide, so I know I'm not overloading it. The light stands I have used quite a few times to stick up some par cans and dimmers and they work fine for that.	-1
I'd really like to give this product a better rating because it looks like it is made from decent materials, but I can't because I'm about to return it for the SECOND TIME.  :(  The box that the product is shipped in does not protect the product. The tripods, truss, light bars, and hardware are in plastic and loosely placed in the low quality cardboard box. There is no styrofoam or hardboard to protect the pieces.  Each time I received the package the box looked ripped, re-taped and damaged. Upon opening the first shipment I found that one of the tripod legs had been dented - as if the box had been dropped on it so i returned it.  With the second shipment the pieces had rubbed together during shipping and scratched each other.  I know that I'm going to beat it up using it, but I'd like to start with something that's new and not messed up.	-1
(Very poor quality. You can not really tune it alright. The frets are un-precise. After tuning with strobe tuner each fret is off. I probably give it away for free because it is useless.) 02-22-2014 Sorry for the confusion, this comment was meant for the article "Dean Playmate Mini Acoustic Guitar, 1/2-Size" I was reading all your replies. Very funny! I deserve it :-)  This bag is actually of OK quality . Can't find anything wrong with it. would give it now 4 stars.	-1
The description on this says that it comes strung for right-handed players but can be easily converted for left handed players.  I am right handed.  When I opened this up i saw the it's strung upside down.  The sixth string is at the bottom and then progressively gets thinner.  That's upside down so this is strung for left-handed players bc if you flipped it over it would be correct for a left handed player.  This is stupid.  Why would you write in the description that it's strung for right handed players if it comes strung for left handed players.  I obviously bought this because I don't have a lot of time to practice on my actual guitar, so when I have a break at work or I'm commuting on the subway or train, I can squeeze in some practicing so I obviously don't have the time to screw around with redoing the strings on this to switch them so that they're in the correct order for a right handed player.  This is a waste of time and I'm extremely disappointed for the 50 bucks I paid for this that it's been this much hassle.  This seller obviously doesn't bother to check their products before they go out the door so I won't be purchasing from them again.	-1
Much better success  with the dadario finger exercise piece. Very awkward to hold. Hard to practice with	-1
Being beginner I thought that I can use it while on trips, but not as useful and as a matter of fact I think it ruins my ability to play chords.	-1
The one I received was not threaded, so I could not attach it to my mic stand and use it. Great idea...maybe it was just a fluke. But, just in case, I went with a K&M Quick Release Adapter 23910 instead. It is similar, works great and is unobtrusive. You barely know it's there.	-1
As magnificent as this product is receiving support or having your product authorized again when you upgrade your studio's computer or operating system is non existent. The only way you can receive any kind of help is through a third party yahoo group that you have to join or some random music bulletin board that's so obscure I can't even remember the name of it. There is no support forum on the company website at all in 2011 the time of this review. If you email them for help you will never get a response, PERIOD! You have to call them long distance and leave a message and sometime within the next 2 weeks they either call back or blow you off. I've had my software in a commercial studio down as long as 6 weeks with several voice mails left on the support line (no one has ever answered).  I've asked the owner a man named Eric Persing who is nothing short of a complete genius at NAMM and in the Yahoo group publicly (as many others have) about the support and the technologies they are using. The people around him become outright hostile at the inquiry this online, ask him at NAMM face to face and boy watch out! It's like having a lawn gnome threaten you with a whooping. It's the Emperor's new clothes I've never seen anything like it. A software company without support in this day and age on the company website? They're a software company!  Spectrasonics Makes some of the most cutting edge products in the industry but without proper technical support how can the software with any longevity be of any use? I hold a BSc CIS and have 20 years experience in information systems pertaining to digital media, Multi Media and am both Logic and Pro Tools certified. I've never seen anything like it. If your name isn't Quincy Jones or Baby Face Edmonds you're wasting your money, these people could care less about you.  I want this review to be completely honest and is respect to spectrasonics defense they have done some really nice things for their customers. They have taken their $500 sample library and offered it to customers for $100. My opinion is that at the price they weren't selling a lot of them and the sounds should have been included in the software at purchase but still that's a very nice thing to do. They have also given upgrades for RMX for free for several years. One so significant it should have been a paid upgrade. Their Trilogy Bass emulator software is nothing short of genius and their Omnisphere Synth blows everything out of the water in the industry hands down.  But again I say what good is it if you can't receive tech support for software you've paid for if it doesn't work?  Bottom line as a studio owner RMX has cost me money in canceled sessions because they refuse to answer email and won't return phone calls if any for weeks. What are you supposed to tell a video game company or a movie studio when you can't make your deadline? Uhhh we're waiting for spectrasonics to authorize our software?  I say it again the Emperor's new clothes, it's ludicrous. I cannot in good conscious recommend Spectrasonics software to anyone.	-1
The description here describes two different units.  The DP-02 and the DP-02 CF (compact flash) The DP-02 is the more expensive unit with a 40gb hard drive.  The unit being sold here is the DP-02CF .  Not the one with the 40gb hard drive.	-1
Theses are extremely lacking in range and fail to capture the full range of sound, this is most noticeable in the higher frequencies. They are also very quiet even for speakers of this small size. The lack of volume makes them unsuitable for most purposes.	-1
I purchased these monitors and used them a few times to test out - they sounded good enough for their size.  But, after not using them for 4 months I finally installed them in a vocal booth and after just 1 day of moderate use the power supply blew out.  No power, no blue light, nothing.  There is still some spark visible when I plug the cord into socket so there is some power going into the box, but nothing works.  This is apparently a known issue with Alesis and I've read other reports of similar problems which is a design flaw in the power supply board.  Don't waste your time or money.	-1
I hemmed and hawed about buying a pair of self-powered monitors versus a Dayton T-amp with a pair of Dayton bookshelf speakers (both very well reviewed on various audiophile discussion boards), which would have come in at just around a hundred bucks, but finally decided against it due to the sheer size of the speakers, plus the additional tangle of cords/cables that would entail.  Then I started to read up on the M-Audio AV30s and AV40s, but kept hearing persistent complaints about poor reliability...so when I finally stumbled upon these, I was totally stoked by the price and the form factor---these are somewhere in the middle in terms of size between 6.5" bookshelf speakers like the Daytons, and your typically tiny and tinny-sounding 2" computer speakers.  These M1s have 3" woofers, so of course you're not going to get thumping bass---since I despise techno and most forms of rap/house anyway (mostly listen to jazz, classical, and vocal/guitar-dominated rock and folk), this was not an issue.  Though I have to agree with the other reviewers that what bass they do put out is quick, tight and accurate.  But the real magic is in the tweeters: they are full 1" silk domes, which is exactly what you want for stunning detail and clarity and imaging.  I have no idea why the Amazon listing for this product neglects to mention this outstanding fact.  Even the Dayton full-size bookshelf speaker has only a 3/4" tweeter, and what few 2.0 computer speakers that have tweeters, usually have only 1/2 to 3/4" tweeters---this often produces a smeared and veiled quality to the upper mids and highs.  You usually have to pay $300 and up to get a 1" tweeter in a pair of decent bookshelf speakers.  Just like the run of the mill Logitechs and Altec Lansings, Bose's computer speakers have 2" single drivers as do their home theater "jewel cubes"---hence the common ditty, "No highs, no lows, it must be Bose."  The Alesis tweeter is also remarkable for its non-fatiguing smoothness...I can listen to these speakers for hours and hours without the notorious "listener fatigue" that results from overly bright tweeters and their over-the-top treble.  There is a bass boost switch you can turn on, but like all "bass boost" settings, this simply exaggerates the mid-bass and creates a very unnatural sound---which, sadly enough, is what too many consumers are used to these days.  So if you like a smiley-shaped EQ curve (bass and treble maxed out), these are probably not the speakers for you...get a Klipsch or Logitech or Altec Lansing 2.1 system instead.  The other standout feature on these speakers that sealed the deal for me was the USB connection. Most computer speakers connect with the 1/8" headphone jack...which means that they are using your computer's built-in soundcard, which usually are mediocre at best, and on many lower-end laptops can be absolutely horrible (hissy and shrill).  With a USB connection, you are sidestepping the internal sound card and having the speakers' convert the signal directly, which yields by far the purest, noise-free sound output possible.  Standalone USB DACs (Digital Audio Converters) which do the same thing can go anywhere from $30 for the cheapest to several hundred bucks...so to have this already included in the system is really a HUGE treat!  Now, to put this into perspective: these are NOT party speakers!  If you are dumb enough to try to use them in that capacity, you deserve to be bummed out.  They are also not home theater speakers, so while their voice reproduction is top-notch, you are not going to get deep rumbles and wall-shaking explosions (you really need a sub for that, in any case).  They are designed for nearfield listening at low to moderate volumes (about 70db tops).  They are not quite audiophile grade, but definitely mid-fi, which means several notches above the typical $50-200 computer speakers you are going to find at Best Buy if a balanced, accurate sound is what you are looking for...for eighty three bucks they are an absolute STEAL!  UPDATE 10/19/12: I received the first Alesis speakers on October 9th, at which point I wrote the above review...LOVED them.  Less than a week later, the right speaker suddenly died for no apparent reason...I was using it only lightly, and with the volume only at the 9 to 10 o'clock position.  So, I figured this was just the luck of a draw, everyone gets a lemon once in a while.  So I shipped it back to Amazon, they had a new on my doorstep by 10/18...and guess what?  This time, the right speaker was DEAD ON ARRIVAL!!!  ARRRRRRRGH!!!  I am wondering if I should go through the process one more time, or try something else.  Really really annoying because I otherwise love the sound quality!  Nothing else in this ballpark comes even close...but why oh why was the QA on this product so horrible???  0 for 2...I'm sorry Alesis, I'm looking elsewhere now.  Downgraded rating from 5 to 2 stars.	-1
The sound was pretty good, while they lasted..  After three days, the volume control began to scratch and fade. Within a week the right speaker stopped working, yet headphones work fine (through the front panel jack) so I know its not an audio source or input issue.  As another reviewer mentioned, I too was instructed by Alesis to ship the speakers (at my expense) to an "authorized" repair facility in another state. Because these speakers were cheap, the cost to ship the item doesnt justify getting them repaired.  Bottom line, these speakers are junk, and Alesis tech support is useless. I will NEVER buy another Alesis product.	-1
Even with a proper mouth piece, this instrument fails to create anything close to a proper bugle sound. Just as others have said, it's for decoration.	-1
I was pretty disappointed with the sound quality out of this mic. The directional pattern mostly works but it's really short and almost any mic in my apartment (including built in mic on my iPhone) has better sound quality and reproduction.	-1
I ordered this thinking what do i have to loose. This is not worth the box it came in. It creates huge amounts of frequencies. There is no such thing as clear sound with this piece of junk.	-1
I bought this capo because it was advertised for "curved" necks. However, this capo has a flat edge and does not work on a curved fretboard. My 1968 Rickenbacker 360 has a curved fretboard which prevented my trusty Shubb capo from working properly. This capo will not work any better. This capo otherwise works OK, but I prefer the compact and fast-acting Shubb design.  Don't buy this if you have a curved fretboard.	-1
Horrible.  Wasted my money on this CHEAP thing.	-1
This thing is all sharp edges and cheap feel, and the "rubber" piece is more like plastic. Combine that with the overly-flat radius, and it's kind of a pain to make it work well. I'll stick with Shubb and Keyser.	-1
PROS: It is a triangle shape. It comes with a beater.  CONS: It sounds terrible. What I wanted was a crisp, high, single tone. This is more like the sound in cartoons when characters' heads get hit with a hammer.	-1
This kind of tuning fork is not durable, and over a short period of time it went flat by fifteen cents. I could not use it to tune pianos.	-1
This is supposed to be a 440 hz tuning fork. It's not. It's around 447 hz. Other than that...it's got okay sustain, I guess. We'll see how re-tuning it with a file goes.	-1
Don't waste your time and money with these very poor quality wind screens. You get what you pay for. The foam on these is extremely thin and brittle. The foam tore apart as I very carefully attempted to place these screens on my standard size ball mics. I returned them for a refund. Ironically, the product name is "tour grade." Not even close!	-1
The product was offered at a very reasonable price.  Unlike my other foam windscreens, this one arrived incredibly brittle. It tore as soon as I put it on the microphone.  The color washed out and closer to teal than pea pod green.  Considering how similar in pricing many windscreens are (low), you may want to spend another buck and get some that don't tear apart so easily.	-1
This is really a toy. It is hard to get sound out of it for beginners.	-1
In the product description, it is labeled as Grover, but the packaging says it is a Trophy Toy brand. The sound is less than the snoopy toy harp. The volume is great if you don't want to annoy someone that is sitting in the same room as you can hardly hear it.  After reading the product reviews, I even opted for one day shipping since the price was so good.  Save yourself the time and disappointment, and spend the extra $20 for a real one.  I suggest googling for a good brand (they can be bought in any key for $25)	-1
This thing could not make much sound.  It was frustratingly quiet.	-1
the flange is to soft and bends to easy interfering with the vibration.  Very hard to play, but if you can do it, it sounds good	-1
week sounding.	-1
The end of this is sharp and I cut my finger and in the process also cut my lip. I don't care for the sound quality and last of all the reed is almost heavy paper thin. With the sharp edge and flimsy reed it's almost dangerous to me. I have many mouth harps and I would place this on the bottom of playable harps.	-1
I got this as part of a birthday gift for my husband. He liked it until he started to use it. He says you could hear a metal piece hitting where it shouldn't. I couldn't hear what he was talking about but he's had them before and I haven't so I'll just have to believe him.	-1
I sent back TWO of these lights after the Blue LED's just died in the middle of a show, followed by uncontrollable Blinking. Still have NOT received any credit or Replacement from Amazon...do NOT waste your time.	-1
It's cheap. And not amazing.	-1
The illustrations for this in the ad make it seem like the pattern covers a wide expanse; unless you're hanging it from 12 or 15 feet, it really doesn't, and quite honestly, comes off as quite hokey. I thought you could control the patterns, such that if you found one you liked, you could freeze it and leave it be. Not so. There are two modes; manual, which automatically changes the pattern, and audio, which changes the pattern per beat from music. There is a sensitivity knob, but that really just controls how fast the patterns change. And speaking of the patterns, I like the full on dots mode, but after that, it circulates through a bunch of straight line patterns, that for me were frankly boring.  Sadly, I'm returning my unit. As some reviewers said, it might be good for a fun party at home, a faux disco night event or something, I have no qualms about that and don't mean to disparage Chauvet at all, but forget about it for a DJ show with more than a couple dozen people, or band performance, you'd get laughed at...	-1

This 14" bag fits very tight and the inside lining seam came apart, most likely because it was sewn improperly. Disappointed to say the least. Had used the bag 3 times.	-1
I Bought These, I Have a Ludwig CS ELITE Siver Sparkle Kit according to the sizes it should fit but my kit won't fit in these cases.	-1
yes. this mixer was great until it just suddenly stops working for maybe after a year or two! I am so devastated with this. I do music vocal recoridngs and this one just stops working, it means i need ot buy another expensive pre amp? huh	-1

There is one low note that it did not work, I don't know when people returned the items , Amazon used those item to send the defective ones to the new buyer	-1
I should have known better. I have been playing diatonics for over 50 years. I have owned mostly Hohners, from the cheap, childhood instruments I learned on to Special 20s, and a Hohner Blues Harp that I have had for decades and still plays dependably, probably because it was my "car harp" and only got played at the occasional traffic light.  After retirement, I decided I could be a bit extravagant. I purchased the Suzuki SCX-64C because of the reviews, the reputation, and the comments in several reviews on the mouthpiece.  Mechanically, it has been great, but musically, it has been horrible. All low notes respond at their preferred pressure, and each seems to require its own particular pressure; the upper notes require increasing pressure, with the highest requiring extreme pressure. Worse, many of the low reeds fail with the least attempt at volume, while others seem fully responsive over a wide dynamic range.  In brief, it is an inexcusably uneven instrument with numerous defective reeds that I foolishly tolerated trusting that it was my ineptness rather than the instrument. After numerous attempts to get this thing to play, I'm convinced it is the instrument.  Not sure what I'm going to do with this overpriced piece of junk, if I can't find an instrument repair shop that can even it out a bit.  My recommendation would be to skip Amazon and buy locally. Had I done so, I could have established a trail of complaints and likely gotten some resolution long ago.  Physical configuration notwithstanding, if I try another chromatic, it will be a Hohner.	-1
Once the air temperature drops to about 70 F, the reeds are slow to respond.  Also, the first two draw holes were flat upon arrival (FUA) :)  Sent it back.  Still a big Amazon fan.	-1
I was disappointed with this harmonica.  I expected really high quality.  I am new to harmonicas, but I do have a sense of when something is wrong.  The second hole sounds more like a dull buzz.  The noise is not crisp at all.  And the fourth or fifth hole changes pitch when I blow into it.  The instrument does not sound bad if I blow into several holes at once to produce a chord.  But if I am going to play melodies--which is what is typically done with a chromatic--I am out of luck.  I mistakenly thought there were no reviews, but that must have been another product.  I am now seeing there are good reviews.  I do not know what went wrong.  I must have gotten unlucky.  I am returning this harmonica.  I am going to try a Swan chromatic with good reviews.  I hope I get a good one.	-1
Didn't like these strings.	-1
Totally subjective opinion; I just didn't like these.  I am a fan of GHS strings, I use GHS boomers quite a lot.  These say GHS boomers on the front, but they are not like regular GHS boomers.  Maybe I got a bum package that was stale or something??  Half price of regular boomers so I thought I was getting a deal, but I think I got bait and switched!	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price.	-1
I ordered this distortion pedal as a cheap alternative to the costly Boss foot pedals.  When it arrived and the Behringer 9 volt adaptor I also ordered wouldn't plug in all the way, rendering both items useless, I realized that you really do get what you pay for.  I'd advise everyone to save themselves a headache by steering clear of Behringer pedals and stick with the tried and true pedals made by Boss.	-1
I was in need of a distortion pedal for my guitar seeing as how the one I've used for years broke. However, I've been low on cash lately so to save some money I bought this after reading some glorious reviews. So I ordered this thinking it would do at least a decent job, but upon using it, first I'd like to stress how confusing it was to install the battery. It's not like most pedals, and there were no clear instructions on how to do it. I went through three of my friends and my dad before we finally figured out how to install the battery. And our work was put to shame, because while this would probably be a good product for a beginner or practicing guitarist, it had very mediocre sound, and there was far too much feedback for it's own good. Adjustments to it's settings did not seem to make much of a difference. So while this might be a good idea if your low on money or are just a beginning guitarist, I would not recommend it for anyone experienced or planning to record or perform.	-1
We compared this pedal with a Metal Zone by Boss using the same power supply (9v Dunlop) and this one was pretty noisy and had a lot of feadback in any position (regarding the position of the guitar and the amplifier). Maybe it would not produce undesire noise using batteries... It doesn't sound that great, but the price is unbeatable!!	-1
Good	-1
If you're after a true jazz sound (I'm not talking about smooth jazz or fusion, but a real straight-ahead bebop, warm and rich jazz tone, using a clean, undistorted amp) do NOT buy these strings.  Even with the treble on the amp at only 25% and only a neck pickup, they made my 17" hollow body archtop sound like a banjo: Overly bright and twangy, with all kinds of annoying finger noise.  I always had used flats before this, but I thought I'd try "pure nickel" because the price was right, the reviews looked good, and I'm adventurous!  But never again. They have no business calling these "jazz" strings. Going back to Thomastik-Infeld George Benson flat wound GB114's (14-55 gauge).  They're flat, fat and silky smooth and give that nice mellow and rich jazz sound. They're also a lot more money, but they last forever, and actually sound better after they've been on your guitar for a few years!  I keep going back to those after experimenting with other types.  Don't cheap out:  They're expensive for a reason: QUALITY!	-1
The product description says "Spandex Material" but you should know this is not made of what I would call "typical" Spandex used for clothing that would be of much higher weight/thread-count and as another reviewer stated, if it were to get snagged on anything it appears it will likely leave a hole.  In fact, if you wore clothing made out of this in public you'd likely get arrested!  You can easily see right through the material.  I'd say either buy a cheap bath towel at 1/4 the price or look for a vinyl cover if you can find one.  The only advantages I see are 1) that it has adjustable (via a pull string) elastic around the edges to keep it in place; and 2) it comes with an attached built in pouch to stuff the entire cover back into if you were to travel with your keyboard; however, given the pouch is all of 5" x 6" that should tell you how thin the actual cover's material is (another reviewer said it was 3"x3"x4" but it's a bit larger than that and only expands due to the Spandex, otherwise it's flat).	-1
I was expecting a durable cover, but this thing is made of delicate material that looks like it would snag easily. If it gets caught on a corner or my cat decides to play with it, a hole will definitely appear. It succeeds in keeping dust off the keyboard, but that is about it.	-1
The instructions were fairly easy to follow (if you are familiar with doing this kind of thing) and the components are high quality. It takes 2 or 3 hours to do this mod if you check the pedal after changing every 3 or 4 components to make sure you are not messing it up. The distortion side of the pedal is almost useable after modding. You lose the harshness you get when you turn the tone up, which is good, because you need to run it with a good bit more treble on the tone than before. So far, I'm not impressed and somewhat disappointed.  I was VERY disappointed with what it did to the overdrive side. If you turn the mix to the OD side, it sucks the gain out and you end up with less than 25% of the gain you had before. You also have to dime the tone to get anything out of it. When you turn the mix to about 25% up, it begins highly favoring the distortion side. That's good, because this side of the pedal is worthless now.  If you prefer the overdrive side of this stock pedal, run away, because this mod will ruin your pedal. If you prefer the distortion side of the this stock pedal, still, run away. If you just want to mod a pedal for the experience and have no standards for what it sounds like afterward, then maybe you should give it a try.  7/20/2015 UPDATE: I all but stopped using this pedal after I modded it, partially because the mod neutered it and partly because I bought a Tech21 DD3X Mod pedal, which is far superior in every imaginable aspect. So last night (2.5 years after modding), I pulled my pedal apart and returned it to near stock condition. I say "near stock" because I left a cap in that was the same value and left the diodes in because they affect the sound in no manner whatsoever. The info that comes with this kit does not help if you want to restore your pedal to a useful state, so you will need to do your homework if you don't like this mod (I can't imagine you would) and want to undo it. I found a schematic online that had a couple of mistakes, but I was able to use it.  After listening to the pedal back in it's stock form again, I had to lower my review from 2 to 1 star and revise comments that were far too kind. The pedal is once again useable as more than a paperweight. It's not the greatest dirt pedal now, but I'll maybe use it occasionally now.  Now that I know much more about pedal modding and pedal building, I would never buy a Fromel kit again. Many of the changes you make with this kit make no sense. Some of them are not even in the signal path. Some suck the gain out. Others suck the tone out. Sure, the components are a little better quality than stock, but the tiny difference those parts make are undetectable in a distortion pedal without seeing them on an oscilloscope. I don't know about you, but I use my pedals for what they do to the sound, not to see a little different jagged line on a screen.	-1
Nothing like their older units from the 80's and early 90's. I have an old beat up one I bought new back in 88 and it is a smoother and warmer with a natural tube breakup and push. These new ones sound smothered and artificial. Sorry but the new one is back in the box and on a shelf.	-1
I went with Boss because of their rugged construction but, so far, I have had nothing but trouble. This pedal is noisy. I've had to reconfigure the order of my pedals, had to deal with all kinds of hum and high pitched beeping. I've had this pedal several weeks and have yet to even successfully play with it.	-1
This is the 1st new production Mullard I bought to use in V3 of a Peavey Classic 50 combo, phase invertor. Seemed to be a low gain or output problem in this application. I got it for it's "clean" reputation but I guess it is a bit too clean.	-1
Returned. After looking closely at the soldering connections I decided to go with a new higher end tube.	-1
I bought this by mistake ,tried it out . Amp works good again but it sounds flat , no rich harmonics . Like the description says for hi fi .	-1
ok	-1
Cheap construction.  The tripod tightening bolt at the bottom stripped on two of the three units I purchased.  I sent the units back for a full credit.	-1
I ordered 2 of these stands.  The first one didn't stay up when I tightened it.  I tried the 2nd stand and it seemed to work OK but they are very cheaply made so I sent them both back for a refund.	-1
One light burnt out within a week of owning it.	-1
I hate to give anything a bad review. Everything that had a small buzz, still has a buzz. Cords all tested. Multiple plug ins and the lights are nice...	-1
The lights get super hot. The bulbs burn out fast. I will try to replace them with LED if not, they're just power strips.	-1
I bought this instead of the Rogue RA-090 by accident. This was a horrible guitar and I sent it back immediately. The action was way too high, and the intonation was terrible up the entire neck. It has no adjustable truss rod like the RA-090, so there was nothing I could do. If you're in the market for a cheap guitar, spend $10 more and go for the RA-090.	-1
The guitar I received was unplayable.  The action was so high that merely fretting a chord pulled the instrument out of tune.  The intonation on the lower strings was way off.  I returned it.	-1
High string action. Intonation is ok for a smaller size guitar. It is not a 3/4 size guitar which is fine. The bridge does not use pins to hold in the strings but ball end type strings are used and they slip through the slot on the bridge. I bought this for my son but he does not like it because the strings are too high on the neck. I plan to return this beautiful guitar and get him something else that, hopefully will be easier for him to play.--For me I give it only 2 stars due to playability. The guitar is not a toy but it is difficult for a beginner to play.  UPDATE: Not very pleased with seller's approach to handling customer service and unhappy customers. I got a return authorization. I have to pay the shipping back to seller. UPS wanted about $27 to ship to seller. Too high. I paid about $50 for the guitar. Took the guitar to the US post office and shipped for about $16. Plus, with the RA from seller they will debit from my refund about $7 for the initial shipment to me. I lost money on this deal and got nothing for it other than a bad taste in my mouth for the seller---WOODWIND AND BRASSWIND--which I will give ONE STAR ONLY and will avoid at all cost for any future purchases here on Amazon...I'll stick with Music123 when possible for they are responsive and offer and honor their coupons.	-1
These speakers worked great for 14 months. Last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again.	-1
On the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing.  They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.  They don't sound horrible.  I mean, they are not computer speakers or anything.  The sound is very forward, I would say harsh.  That's not uncommon among studio monitors.  There is definitely a lot of clarity here.  Not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size.  There's a few schools of thought on studio monitors.  Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker.  These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first.  I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this.  Any flaws would be quite noticeable.  I previously used KRK RP8's so I can compare these to them.  Granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors.  I liked them better than these.  They were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.  I was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if I could improve the situation...BUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on.  The buzz increases in volume over time.  I tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power).  Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.  Maybe Behringer 3031a's or something.  I think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor.	-1
Sound nice, but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.  I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.  2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.  I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.  I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on, and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.  I am back to using my 20-20's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.  M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over!	-1
It really look's great, But to much air is leaking between alu.comb and reed plate, I took a little flashlite put in 1-10 holes and 4-8 I saw lite out back side, NOT SATISFIED with this Harp	-1
I would not recommend this  Suzuki Harmonica to anyone. I went to use this harmonica and no sound came out. Nothing but air came out, no sound. I returned this immediately to Amazon.	-1
Something about this harp I don't like, I think because it seems narrow.  The sound is good but not great in my opinion.	-1
I've been trying out lots of different harmonicas recently, which has given me a great opportunity to compare and contrast.  The Promaster just strikes me as a mediocre harmonica, despite it's high-end name and price.  It certainly looks great (aluminum comb!) and has a nice looking case.  And the notes that play, play well, and have a very distinctive sound to them, almost smokey.  But like the Suzuki Bluesmaster, I find that some notes just don't play, irrespective of technique or tweaking the reeds.  Overall, I don't regard that as any better than the Bluesmaster, just nicer looking.	-1
Too bad the reeds go out in a few weeks just like ever other G Harmonica regardless of price range or quality.	-1
Very underwhelming, sound and quality.  Looks nice, though.  Frets were all about 1/8" too long and were razor sharp.  There are cheap guitars and then there are cheap guitars.  This one is the latter.  Returned.  Will not be buying a Dean Vendetta again.  Cheers.  P.S.  Check out the Squire Tele Affinity guitar.  It's selling on Amazon for about $180 and sounds and looks great.  I would buy it again any day.  Also, the Epiphone Les Paul Special II and 100 guitars.  I have both and they are good low end guitars ($170 and $270, respectively).  BTW, I've spend 100 hours looking at guitar prices in stores and online, and Amazon's prices are either the same or lower on every guitar which I've compared prices.  Good luck	-1
this product works great for about 2 months and then suddenly stopped working. i tried replacing the batteries and i also checked to see if the batteries corroded inside the product, no corrosion was present. i am very disappointed with this product and  am also sad that i am unable to have this product replaced or refunded.	-1
since it cheap I wanted to tried it out as if last about couple months, but unfortunately I didn't even get to use it and had to return ( which didn't work at all). I really hope my comment will help stop someone from spending $$$ unless you don't mind spend just $12 for nothing. NOTICE, THEY WILL CHARGE U THE RETURNING MAIL Fee.	-1
Received this unit at 2pm on a Saturday  after hours, four hours later and still unable to get it to work.  Registered unit then downloaded the software when clicking run it locked up and stopped.   I knew then I was going to be wasting a lot of time trying to get it to run again. Since you only have one download  license you can't download it again, it's  dead in the water.  .  Went back and read the license again and maybe it will allow you to download on two Computers with up to four downloads.  Getting desperate and not knowing how this download program look at my computer to determine if it's installed,  I deleted the download from the download folder thinking that a new  download would not see a copy already on my computer and indicate I already had a copy and would not install .  Half hour later I noticed  Presonus sent me an email indicating I could activate it by clicking on the link.  I don't want to activate it  since it's deleted.  Tried in vain to download the program again and refused to do so  since it has already downloaded.  If you're having issues with Presonus the web site is a joke. As last got a download that is missing dill's  still won't run. Customer email  support three days and still waiting after creating two tickets. THEY DON'T CARE.	-1
didnt work had to return it	-1
I don't want to totally kill this thing, it looks good and is set up nicely. However... ...it was completely INcompatible with our MacBook Air + El Capitan (probably because the USB3s don't recognize this USB2-based unit - although the USBs are supposed to be designed to be backwards compatible, I found retrospectively several warnings about this issue on techboards).  Presonus tech support also replied to our questions by informing us that they considered the 'Air' to be a portable laptop and therefore 'not suitable for serious recording projects, and thus it is not supported'. Not an explicit answer, but sometimes you have to read between the lines. We just wanted Mac Air users to be aware of this.	-1
Do Not Buy! I got this as a starter interface. It really makes it difficult to actually do any kind of recording with this as the mic pre's are so sensitive that even a low output guitar will clip the input with the gain turned all the way down. It has the same issue with Any line input, Di, etc. As some other reviewer stated, it doesn't work well with the SM57/SM58......which are only two of the most common mics EVER!!! Chances are if you are buying a starter interface, you are picking up one of those mics to go with it. I purchased mine at Guitar Center for a little over $100 several years ago. I recently found two Shure variable pads which actually make this device halfway usable. Those cost me $35 each... so had I known, I would have just bought a decent $200 dollar interface and been done with it. I understand the concept of use what you have and don't spend too much time researching and buying gear because you can just invest the time in making and recording music and learning how to do that well, but please, read all of the one star reviews and don't buy this. I tried and tried and tried and tried to make stuff work with this... I'm an engineer that builds satellite uplink facilities, mind you...... and this thing is just not worth using. Other issues are the poor quality of the headphone amplifier and it not supporting certain impedances of real headphones. I have found crosstalk issues on the input monitoring/playback blend. I would far rather just monitor my input through software. I could go on and on, but I'll just give you some suggestions that worked for me to replace this. I picked up an Apogee Jam for a guitar interface and an Apogee Mic 96k for a condenser mic. Both USB powered and are small and compact and easy to travel with. get a decent pair of headphones or IEM's for a bit of isolation and you can do a lot with these two things. When I go on longer trips, I even pack my Fender Greta tube amp and actually mic it with the Apogee Mic. It's wonderful and sounds excellent. I picked up a pop filter for doing vocals on it. I've recorded drums with it too and it even came out sounding better and clearer than the 5 drum mics run into a mixer which had its outputs run into.....yep. you guessed it. The AudioBox. If I were to start over from scratch and was looking for something portable and inexpensive, I would get an Apogee ONE. It's basically a Jam and Apogee Mic in one box. Even has an XLR in and you can use the mic and guitar in at the same time. If you need two mic pre's, I would go for a Duet. A bit more expensive, but well worth it for the extra I/O. If you want a really solid desktop interface, pick up a Universal Audio Apollo Twin Duo Thunderbolt. You won't be disappointed, nor will you have to replace it. You can even add more I/O via ADAT. Whatever you decide to get, just don't get this AudioBox.	-1
I bought this item by the recommendation of a sales person at a guitar store.  I can't tell you if it is a good product or not because I can't get the driver to load into my Windows 10 PC with 64 bit operating system.  Here are 2 recommendations the tech support person told me: 3. Visit your computer manufacturer's page and check for updates to the following ~USB controllers ~Chipset/motherboard ~BIOS  4. If all else fails then you will want to either do a system restore as far back as possible or reinstall your OS. We have seen a number of install failures on HP computers and the only 100% fix is this.  Did you see that..."reinstall your OS"  You got to be kidding!  I reviewed their forums regarding the error message I received and saw that I was not the only one who has had this problem.  As far as I could tell, no one was able to find a satisfactory solution.  This problem has been around for months, if not years and still hasn't been resolved by driver/software updates.  I think this company caters to Apple compatible products primarily, and secondarily to PC compatible products.  So, if you have a PC, you might do better to find something else manufactured by a company who makes products with PC compatibility at the forefront of their attentions.	-1
After very little use, my input 1 stopped working. Besides, I get A LOT of Radio Interference. Unfortunately, I can't recommend. It work only as a door step.	-1
As other reviewers have stated, the instrument inputs on this box are SO hot that with the Audiobox instrument input controls set at 0 (literally 0), my guitar STILL clips, giving unwanted distortion to clean settings (forget trying to get sparkling clean tones outta this box entirely). I can even hear a distinctly unpleasant "fizziness" on highly distorted settings (again, with the Audiobox instrument inputs controls set at 0). I don't know what more needs to be said. :P  The guys at GC tried really hard to get me to buy the Scarlett for only $50 more (they said it TOTALLY blew away the Audiobox)...but it was one of those occasions when I literally ONLY had $100 to spend...and it was only for a temporary (hopefully) fix of my system.  I have since resuscitated my Rig Kontrol (Windows 8.1 driver issues...headdesk...headdesk...headdesk) and am lovin' the clean tones and lack of fizziness!  Bottom Line: AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!	-1
I got this product a few years back and could never get it to work right, and I work with computers all the time. I kept getting noise going through it, all the time. I deadened my mic on my PC, I turn volumes all the way down. Finally after about a year and a half of it being a paper weight  I noticed this little mixer knob in the middle. If you turn it one way it's Monitoring, and you turn it the other it's Mixing. Little did I know, if you put it in the middle you could do both. It was a real pain in my crack, but once I got that figured out, it was usable. The other thing is recording direct guitar can be a nightmare, the signal was always to hot. I found out that I have to back off the volume on my guitar, and turn down the Main channel volume on the Interface, to make the signal work. I record direct, so I like to use Amplitude for my effects, and even with a good PC, and the setting set to low latancy, I still have some while using distortion and luckily I haven't had anything that I needed real precise, or it wouldn't happen. I'd love to record with my guitar turned up, because I love to back off for various tones, but it's hard with my volume down so far. I seem to get pretty good sounds with Ampltude 3 and it has an Economy settle to put less stress on my pc, which helps. Hope my insight and misery will help someone else.	-1
I recently bought the Audiobox USB. The salesman at Sam Ash Music said it had served him well, and when comparing similar products by competitors that were around the same price range, he said this is the one.  I think he meant well. I do not think he deliberately deceived me. i think he probably only used it on an OS no newer than Windows 7, or he may have used it on a MAC.  Yes, I had the perennial "unknown device" issue when I tried to install. What is interesting is that I normally just tear open the wrapper, decimate the box, take it out, plug it in and get to work, but not this time. This time for some unknown reason, I took the time to read the installation instructions. I downloaded software and driver updates and then proceeded to install the unit. I got the "unknown device".  After a few uninstall/reinstall attempts over a night, morning and early afternoon, even following the multiphase procedure on the support page, i submitted a service request ticket.  Here is where I decided that Presonus is not my idea of a good product provider. I see a lot of discussion about this problem. So, it is obvious that Presonus is aware of the problem. Yet, there is no one available over the weekend to help customers through the issue. What if it is a procedure to follow or a file to download or even an issue that can be resolved via remote access? All of these would be fine. Then if there is no resolution the customer at least feels like Presonus cares about their customers enough to at least try. I am then not opposed to buying other Presonus product.  I am not unrealistic. I know, sometimes even expect, products to fail prematurely or even to not work at all. However, what i do not expect is the company leaving their niche customer community without help from 5:00 p.m. Friday to 9:00 a.m. Monday morning (Central Time). maybe this is not an issue to some, but this is far below the "fails to meet the standard" grade in customer service for me. Does Presonus realize that there are competitors, very strong competitors, in the market? Does Presonus realize that once a customer has paid for the Presonus product, the $50 or so difference in price between theirs and a competitor's more expensive offering is not so great a chasm anymore?  When I train sales professionals, I always tell them that mishaps and errors are almost inevitable. However, these are not what break business relationships. It is the lack or poor execution of a plan to address them. Presonus has made it into my "what would be your response as a customer, if... ?" lessons.  I think it is obvious what my response was. I uninstalled all of the software, and once the replacement process is complete, I will de-register everything and delete my Presonus account.  I am not angry. I am disappointed.	-1
NOTE: I originally bought an AudioBox USB as part of an audio package but needed to re-order a separate AudioBox and wanted to warn other potential buyers.  Here's why:  Upon setup, the PreSonus AudioBox USB wasn't being recognized by my MacAir (supposed to be plug/play).  I am comfortable with tech equipment but still thought it could have been my mistake.  I called the PreSonus tech line and was on hold for 35 minutes until closing time and then got a cheerful recording that they were closed and I should call back during business hours.  Okay, I'm still stuck so I called back the next day and waited about 40 minutes this time -- I don't blame the techs, they are understaffed.  When I finally got a tech he did a quick diagnostic and announced "Yes, your AudioBox has a problem and we are aware of it.  We've had a problem with some units recently."  Great.  (BTW, how many is "some" units?  A hundred?  A thousand?)  He then told me to "call Amazon" about the return.  What?  Your company made the defective equipment and I wasn't going to re-pack the mic, cables, pop-filter, stand, headphones (from the full audio package I originally bought) just to return the AudioBox.  When I called back and spoke with a supervisor to get a phantom Return Authorization I was told the same thing.  The best he could do was "send me a form" so they would consider repairing it but he wouldn't even commit to a matter of weeks for turnaround.  Super.  They even wanted me to provide them with the unit's serial number so they could "track the problem".  Apparently track but ignore.  (If they are defective, recall them or do the right thing and replace without hassle.)  Finally, because I was stuck with everything else, I ordered a new AudioBox (on its own, a separate order from Amazon) and then returned the old one in its place.  (I would have ordered a different brand but then I couldn't have returned the first AudioBox.)  Thankfully, the second AudioBox was not a lemon, too.  Amazon handled the solo return perfectly and amazingly fast.  The refund was in my account the day after an easy UPS pick-up.  Really happy with Amazon but don't count on PreSonus.  Even their beloved software set-up was needlessly annoying -- do you really need a 28-digit key code???  This isn't a nuclear launch.  Also, the "Studio One Artist 2" software was overly convoluted (just the name hints at that -- call it "1" or "2" but not both).  Crappy manual as well.  I ended up using their hardware but with Mac's GarageBand which was so much easier to deal with and learn.  Bottom line, order if you must, but beware.  Don't count on PreSonus corporate office for anything.  Consider other audio interfaces.  Zero stars for AudioBox USB, 4 stars for rest of equipment (in the original package -- see other review).  Headphones are a bit cheap but great mic.	-1
They may work, but will take some time to get used to	-1
The rubber grip extend s to far down the pic and mutes the string that it hits.	-1
I thought these would have a better grip than a standard guitar pick but they don't.  I feel like it might be a gimmick.  I would go with a regular fender pick from now on.	-1
Lately, all I have been buying are DAVA picks, but not this crap.  What I thought would be a good idea turns out to be a miscarriage. Let me tell you that I used to tend to throw half a dozen picks across the stage/room about every night I play.  Even Gorilla Snot didn't keep the darn things from going airborne. Don't get me wrong, DAVA makes some other picks I really like.  The one I use most is the red(delrin)-tipped, black model 1303 pick.  But I cannot use these stupid "grip" picks for an entire night without the soft rubber coming loose from the hard plastic and turning the thing to junk.  The problem is, the soft rubber is needed in the center area of the pick, where the center of your grip is.  All that soft garbage around the edges is useless, unless it is for DAVA to sell a damn lot more of them than necessary.  The soft crap tears away from the hard plastic and then the whole thing comes apart.	-1
tried, didn't like, the pad actually hits and catches on the strings when playing fast licks. OK for beginner player	-1
Good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. Probably good for strumming, but not good for lead.	-1
In an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, I decided to dive in and give these a go.  They are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick.  I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just can't compete.  Not only were they too flimsy, but when I played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands.  This was a huge disappointment.	-1
For me....you know everyone has a different type they have to use...these are easy to grip and thats a great idea but I need a more flexible, light gage pick...I love the grip though that part is brilliant...they need to branch out with light gage models...the idea that you can make them more flexible by holding them differntly is all advertising amd bogus.	-1
I have some mixed feelings on these picks, but overall I can't recommend them to most guitar players. I completely stopped using them after less than a month.  I'll start with the rubber surface, since that's the main selling point. The rubber gives your hand a really firm grip and does what its designed to do. Almost no slippage at all, even after an extended practice session. However, I noticed that when I really started laying into the strings and playing heavily, I had a tendency to catch the rubber on the side of the pick with my treble strings. Not a huge deal, and mostly that was due to my playing style. I got around it with a little practice, but I didn't like having to change my style for the sake of a pick.  The longevity of the plastic leaves something to be desired. These picks wear out a lot more quickly than tortex, ultex or even the gel picks I have. With my acoustic guitars, you could see signs of wear after the first use (I use .13-gauge steel strings). That wouldn't be a problem if they were priced like normal picks, but as you can see here they're significantly higher (and for just a 6-pack instead of 12).  Lastly, I couldn't get over how flexible these picks are. It's awful for me. If your fingers are higher on the pick, closer to the base (leaving more room), it feels like about .50 mm thickness. If you move your fingers closer to the pointed end of the pick (leaving less room), it becomes a little more sturdy, but nothing like what I'd get from a .88 or above (I usually use 1.0 to 1.14mm, so it was a big difference). Chords were OK, but individual notes don't have that nice crisp sound I'm used to.  In the end, for me, I ended up with a pick that was too flexible and wore out too quickly -- but at least I could hold onto it really, really well. Good idea, but the execution leaves room for improvement.  If you're a guitar player who plays softly on light strings (or nylon), and you have plenty of budget for picks, you'll probably have a lot better luck than I did.	-1
Not stiff enough for most guitar players. These do give good grip, as I tend to hold a pick rather loosely. However, as you can see on the picture, the rubber comes way to close to the tip of the pick. It easily makes contact with the strings and drags. This makes an unpleasant effect when strumming. I tried to trim it back, but it is stuck on the plastic pick  pretty tight.  Stiffin up the pick a bit and move the rubber grip about 1//4" from the tip and these would be five star.	-1
The sound quality on this mic's too thin. The Rode video mic pro sounds much fuller in my opinion and rejects noise much better from behind, i.e. the noise of the camera man... spend the extra money and get the Rode.	-1
Like another reviewer mentioned, this case is only worth $50.  Nothing more.  My case had seal openings around the the case where the metal meets.  One of the locks doesn't fasten properly.  The inner liner isn't glued to the case firmly enough -- there's lots of play and when you push the liner down, you can hear the crappy glue trying to grab the liner.  The fact that SKB charges $150 for a Made in China super-shoddily made case shows how far this company has fallen.  IF you think that Chinese products are a FAIL, then this product should be a posterboy of that universal sentiment.  Seriously folks, this is a piece of crap case.  If you can forgive all that I mentioned above (which others have addressed as well) then you're really forgiving or a total SKB fanboy.  As for me, I saw the Epiphone case in a store and it was day and night better.  None of these cases are flight worthy, but at least you get a case with the Epiphone that won't let water leak through as you're running through the rain like this piece of crap.	-1
First off, SKB is great about warranty claims. If your case blows up, they will send new parts without a hassle. Also, the cases are sturdy, and they pamper your guitars.  Now, to the problem. The handles explode. I don't mean they crack. They shatter instantly, in several pieces, and the guitar hits the ground before you know what's happening.  I have two SKB cases with molded handles. One blew up a few years back, and the other blew up a few days ago.  If you contact them, they send you a new handle. You have to install it. To do that, you have to damage the lining a little.  The obvious question: will the new handles explode like the old ones? SKB needs to confront the issue publicly. I'm afraid to buy new SKB cases.	-1
I deal alot in musical instruments and gear and can tell you I've tried various RMS products. RMS is a very entry-level, bottom of the line product. (Think of the very, very, very cheapest car stereo you could get at your local discount store and that's basically the quality level here.) If price is your only concern or you are a straight beginner, then RMS may suit you well. Or if you only need a practice amp in your house & aren't going to crank it, you'll probably be okay.  Any serious musician that needs an amp for gigs is not going to be happy with this amp.  On this particular model, the effects are very noisy, especially the chorus. This amp may as well not even have chorus because its not usable its so noisy. Its possible I got a bad one, but I doubt it because I've used RMS stuff before and am familiar with the quality. The reverb ain't so hot, either. Be prepared to turn the amp up pretty loud on the dial to get a reasonable volume.  LASTLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - there is no way this amp is truly 40 watts. It may be rated as such, but not in reality. Compare this to a 30W Roland and I guarantee the Roland is twice as loud, and clean. This RMS amp is no more than 15W continuous output(i.e. RMS!). It's very generously rated at 40W and its highly misleading.  If you have a good amp for gigs, this might serve ok as an emergency one-time backup if you don't need really loud volumes or you plan to mic it. Other than that, leave it at home. I donated mine because I found it unusable for my purposes.	-1
Seems like a nice unit and there is a big buzz about how great it is but I disagree. It is nice to add some punch to bass drum, but I was unable to accomplish that without trigger also on vocals- which sounds terrible. If you used it on a channel insert for just bass drum, then it would be OK, but it should be able to stop triggering on vocals which have a higher pitch. I do like the fact that is has a subwoofer crossover at 80 or 120. I have a competing unit that can be set to not trigger on vocals, however the crossover is fixed at 70hz which is too low for my system.	-1
The strap seems sturdy and connects well to the sax. But my son (9) doesn't like it. He doesn't have any specifics but it just sits in the case.  I am a longtime member of Amazon and myself rely heavily on reviews provided by others when making a decision as to whether or not to purchase an item--whether that purchase be one that I am making through Amazon or another source (such as a local store); therefore, I am very aware of the value of user feedback and do my best to assist others in making a quality decision by providing quality feedback.  Was this review helpful to you? If so, I would very much appreciate it if you would rate this review accordingly. Many thanks!	-1
This mic simply doesnt work on a mac.  I tried to get both my mac mini and macbook to recognize it - and it won't work.  My PC can recognize it just fine.  Sorry, but that won't cut it.  Wish I never bought it.  Most frustrating thing ever!	-1
Not sure what the issues were.  Mic installed just fine; system recognized it. Playback from mic was poor. Had to turn mic gain all the way up to have an acceptable volume on playback, but that produced echo and distortion.  Went to a couple of forums about known issues with this mic and Win7. The instructions for the mic talk only about installing it on Win XP. Uh...let's see. Win7 has been out how long? and Win 8? And it's produced long-standing, known issues with Win7.  I should have read the critical reviews more carefully.  I purchased the Audio-Technica AT2020 USB+ mic as a replacement, and it works perfectly--terrific sound, no-hassle setup. It just works.	-1
This mixer weighs about 2 pounds regardless of what the actual weight says on the box. My DDM 4000 was broke when I opened the box. I could hear parts rattling around when I picked it up. The DDM4000 is a cheap knock off of the pioneer DJM800 because of the midi connection and the similar features. The quality is absolutely horrible and I would not recumbent this mixer to anyone weather an beginner or pro dj. This is by far the worst dj product that I have ever bought. This product is straight weak and we should ship all of these mixers back to Germany and cut their products off until they can create a product with at least the quality of a numark product. Do not buy this mixer. Own 7 mixers from all different brands and I love them all. I know features and I know quality. It is very rare that a company will create a product that has both and this mixer is a perfect example of that. Get a Rane, pioneer, or high end Numark. Save your money with this crap.	-1
Not for professional use. Harmonica arrived, took it to gig only to discover it's way sharp and out of tune. I'm about ready to give up on harmonicas all together. Have been playing professionally for 35 years and have yet to find a harmonica worth the money. None of them last for more than a few months. Cheap ones, expensive ones, they're all garbage.	-1
Takes a lot of effort to get descent sound. You get what you pay for.	-1
Hard Blow, Low Resonance, Tight Tone....appears to be tuned, ordered 2 to try 1, the D, had the lowest reed dead... I will give these to a child and guess you get what you pay for for a 7x discount price.	-1
As soon as I figure iyt what this thing does.	-1
I am not a big fan of the sloped design.  I  keep it in the back of my board and I need a riser to get the button high enough.  It still sits lower than I would like.  This tuner seems slow to register the notes.  When tuner is turned off the pedal creates a lot of noise.  During live use I had to tune down to a D - The tuner registered a D before I got down to the note.. I do not see any benefit of the Poly technology. I returned the pedal.  Purchased the Pitchblack Chromatic.  This pedal is totally quiet and so far registers notes quicker and accurately.	-1
I've had this tuner for three years.  The tuner function works fine.  It is supposed to supply up to 200 mA of DC power to other pedals, but that almost never works.  Well it worked once or twice, but hasn't work since.  It wouldn't even power a pedal with a 7 mA draw.  Everything else about the pedal is nice.  I've seen others posting about the same problem, so the poor design earns them a one star.  Maybe some real world testing before releasing it into the wild would have helped.	-1
Had this less than a year. Sound engineer often complains about lack of output from my instruments and pulling this unit solves the problem. Just not reliable enough for stage use. Also, it's not smart enough to recognize when I want to take the E (6th) down to D - it just sits there blankly.	-1
BZZZZZZZ...pause....BZZZZZ. This is my second Pitchblack Poly, and both have had serious noise issues. Engage the tuning mode, and it's whisper quiet...until the guitar feeds a signal into it, and then BZZZZZZZZ.  Really annoying.  I guess I have to go buy a new tuner.	-1
This tuner didn't hold up over time.  Quit working after 1 year.  Also, it gets interference from loud audio sounds. I would recommend just going with the boss tu-2 tuner. There's a reason you see everyone using it.	-1
Its Kr@p ---- thats the simplest /quickest/EZ review you need or want wit this joke,toy,trinket .... i hate to admit it but to save other Bass Katz wasted time and humiliation ---- this is one road you cant travel on the Cheap!!! that said the only solution for really good synth (limiter/filter/pass fx) is to probably spend minimum 150$ --- you will never be happy with this garbage that companies throw out to the frugal searcher of  bass "slappy-funky-fuzzy-synth" sound  it will make you very angry though!! --- what it is : these WILL work well with  Guitars (reason: they almost everyone work on a freq level that is "high") thats why they sound so krappy on a BASS .....so ---- if yer wanting to use it for guitar (it's ok/tolerable/) but for bass/low freqs its a total POS	-1
I didn't have the control over the effect that I wanted so I returned it and may get something else.	-1
Pros: Great Delay Great Reverb  Cons: Horrible Compressor Horrible Chorus (you end up tweaking the detune for chorus fx) Unusable overdrive Unuasable distortion Can't use the 4 cable method Harmonist is full of artifacts tuner is NOT chromatic impossible patch bank lay out eq/noise gate is not useable Not stereo in! expression pedal settings won't save no overall volume control via pedal DREDFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE  I have owned this unit for several months.  It now collects dust in my studio.  I purchased the Line6 M13 and have never looked back. There is a reason the Nova System sales have died...Nobody cares about the new "Limited" red units either.  100% Yawn.  Have a nice day.	-1
The sounds are good but the unit I got made a loud hiss. Even when plugged into power conditioner with new cables - very bad hiss. I sent it back. The effects themselves I was very happy with - much better than the digital multi boxes I've tried. The pedal function is really limited and some of the parameters difficult to find and set - I couldn't figure out boost, eq or gate at all but I only kept it a few days. If it didn't hiss I'd keep it.	-1
I thought I'd try a set of Thomastiks on a Tacoma Thunderschief acoustic bass, and I found them to be unplayable on the fretted instrument. The problem is the strings roll under my fingers when I try to bend notes or apply vibrato. I beliieve it is because of the nylon core, which Thomastik uses on many of their acoustic instrument strings. I suppose the string would be great on a fretless where vibrato is accomplished by rolling the finger over the string rather than by stretching and relaxing it, but for me, I could not take advantage of any tone enhancement that these strings might provide. I put on my trusted D'Addario's again and I'm a happy camper once more. $65 wasted...	-1
I didn't expect it to sound good, and it doesn't - but - it does what it's supposed to and amplify the guitar and give it a little drive with a few gawd awful effects that are best left unused... my problem with it is my first iGTR unit died after about a week and the replacement unit lasted exactly one day. Not a great user experience for me... Good luck and caution	-1
I put these on an Ovation Celebrity cc057 guitar and did not quite get all the strings tensioned up to standard pitch before the high E (,012") broke at the ball end.  These have the distinction of being the only strings I ever had break before I could play on them.  I notice these are now MADE IN MEXICO--not sure if that cost saving move on Martin's part resulted in a loss of quality control but this company used to be rated very high among acoustic guitar fans.  The Ovation Celebrity does use a classical style bridge that puts more force on the ball end of the strings than a guitar with bridge pegs so these might do ok on an acoustic guitar with bridge pegs.  I don't think I'd buy these again for an Ovation guitar.	-1
Lost the stand adapter and contacted Akg US parts center to get a replacement. I was told the stand adapter cost $30.  Which is insane. Piece of plastic piece is 41% of a new mic which includes the adapter.  AKG take note.  Update: Turns out AKG Does not offer the same stand adapter, instead they offer an accessory stand adapter which costs $30.	-1
If the tuning pegs were tuneable it would be a fun one for laying around the house for spontaneous bursts of play , as the tone is surprisingly good for the price range . If you enjoy off beat tuneing and weird chords , this one is for you !	-1
Very cheaply made tuners and one knob was missing	-1
After reading many reviews of this and other inexpensive Ukes I settled on this one and even bought Aquila strings as another reviewer suggested.  The tone is tinny sounding even with the better strings.  It has been over a month and the darn Uke will not keep the strings in tune.  It has been played and tuned just about daily and it still will not hold it's tuning.	-1
I wish I could give it no stars at all. This is a toy, not a musical instrument. Piece of crap. Goes out of tune with one strum. Don't waste your money.	-1
Too bad, Maholo brands have gone way down in quality. Bought 20 to resell to preschool teachers at a conference and sent them all back after tuning and playing 5 of them. I have bought these in the past and thought they were fine for a started uke. These are not up to my standards so am trying another entry level uke company.	-1
Even though it said economy in the listing, we were not expecting something quite this cheaply made. Probably fine for a younger child as a toy, but not a good musical instrument for someone who really wants to use a ukulele.	-1
This ukulele lasted about 1 hour and then the neck broke. If your kids are even slightly hard on toys, don't buy	-1
Had it for 10 days, allowed strings time to stretch but Will not stay in tune- constantly needs retune. Bad intonation as I play higher on fretboard. Weak output volume and poor tone. I'm a guitarist of 30+ years and know quiet a bit about string instruments. There's a youtube video of 10 great ukuleles for under $200. Believe I'll find one on amazon for about $100 and re-order. Yes, you get what you pay for.	-1
It won't stay tuned and it dyes my hands. I thought I had a defect product first but I found all the products are of this quality so I got it returned.	-1
The following review is not intended to offend or negatively portray the seller of this product. It is simply based on my own experience with this product.  At first, I loved this ukulele, because of the price and because of the smile on my daughter's face. After playing with it for a couple of weeks, however, she was cleaning up her room and moved a pile of blankets and pillows out of the way. She is 8, small and does not lift weights. After she was done cleaning up, she picked up the ukulele bag which had been in the pile of blankets and pillows. When she opened the bag with the ukulele inside of it, she found out that the neck had come completely off.  She was in tears, and I looked at it. The neck was stapled onto the body with two staples. Stapling it back on would be impossible, since they must have done it when the back of the ukulele had not been attached yet. Superglue-ing does not seem like a good idea, simply because the material is so thin and I can't tell whether it's some kind of hard paper of thin wood shavings.  PRO: Can actually be tuned and stays in tune. CON: If you just want a ukulele as a wall decoration or some similar purpose, this is a good investment.	-1
Cheap sound.	-1
The sound quality is ok, but requires a lot of post production work. Too much ambient noise for a camera mounted mic. The coiled cable gets in the way. I will probable donate it to Good Will .	-1
It's a phaser pedal it's pretty cool but not a pedal that gets a whole lot of use in my experience. Fun to mess around with once in a while but for me not a fixture on my board. Everybody always mentions EVH when speaking of this effect and quite honestly this pedal is more hype because of this. Remember that you must have many other elements in play to get a sound you are seeking. Not saying don't buy it , just saying if you think your gonna buy this and have that EVH famous "Brown" sound out of the box...think again. It's a cool pedal it just isn't versatile enough for me to mount permanent on "MY" pedalboard. Space is precious and there are many other pedals for me that need to take up my precious real estate on my board. You may think it's the greatest pedal ever and that's great ! I just don't get much use out of mine and it sits in a drawer in the box most of the time. Built tough, works fine, just bores me way too easily.	-1
Even at minimum setting the effect dominates your sound, not enhances it.  Maybe if you are a EVH fan you might be better able to appreciate what this box does.	-1
Not the same as the 74 reissue script phase 90. Not as subtle, as the 74, I don't get it.	-1
pretty little wooden egg but you can barely hear it even when you are in an absolutely silent room..you'd never hear it with any kind of other noise like singing or other instruments..don't waste your money	-1
I have yet to figure what this works on.	-1
did not work at all. very dissappointing. tried every conceivable configuration to no avail. be very careful.had to send back.	-1
I gave this one a shot based on good luck with some other Behringer pedals. This Chorus pedal creates (to my ears) a cheap, toy-like effect that didn't do much to the synth signals I ran through it. The buttons on the device offer a few differences in sound, but they don't offer any versatility of dialing in a tone. I'd recommend saving your $30 and applying to something more substantial for a chorus effect.	-1
If you do enough research you will realize Beheringer clones with very poor components various BOSS pedals.  When you buy one, you are gambling whether or not it will work properly.  This one didn't, but a replacement did and still works. The LED is obnoxiously bright though. Not good when you can't see your other pedals in the dark.  So, despite morality and questionable build quality, I am satisfied with it's analog delay capabilities (BOSS DM-3 Clone). If you can get one that works, it's worth the price. Or go to e-Bay and shell out $155 for the real deal.	-1
I really didn't like the sound of this pedal.  I wasn't paying attention when I bought it and thought it was a digital delay, which it isn't.  If you're looking for a kind of 50's sci fi sound, this is it.  But beyond that I didn't find it too useful.  Actually I returned it.	-1
It's a cheap pedal, and you get what you pay for.	-1
No. 1, It is in a plastic casing. A stomp box made with cheap plastic. Give me a break! No. 2, Put a nine volt battery in it and tried it out. Hmm... no sound whatsoever. Bottom line: It did not work either. Sent it back for a refund. Guess I'll pay the extra and get a Boss pedal. I know those are durable.	-1
The unit sounds good but started falling apart after first month in operation. The input opening ring came out when I removed the cord tip...	-1
seems to sound really nice but i have to press down on one of the pots to get the delay to kick in. im pretty sure its a defect and amazon is sending a replacement. ill update next week when i have a working model.	-1
Guys the LED light in this pedal doesn't work! I received 2 pedals that have problems. What can I do?	-1
I was extremely disappointed by this product. Not only is it of cheap build and construction, it makes residual noises when I turn the knobs to touch the foot pedal to engage/disengage the effect, making it in effective in serving it's purpose in creating delay tones. It's cheap, and you can tell it is cheap when using it. I would really considering saving up the extra money and buying something of a little more quality.	-1
I bought it expecting it to function like any delay pedal of this style to function, and it does not do that.  The Pro's first. -Thankfully the Bypass works great  - The construction. It's the typical Behringer construction and I have no issues with. It's plastic yes, but as long as you're not waffle stomping the pedals.throwing them around, or other such intentional damage, it's going to last just fine. No issues there. I have a Boss BCB-60 (Enclosed board with a lid) that I take places multiple times a week and there's no damage to any of my pedals including a Behringer that I've had for 9 months now.  The Con's - The Repeat Rate function: I have 3 other delays from different companies and for the "rate or time" function they're all the same. The further to the right you turn the more time or space you have between repeats. That's not the case here, and the worst part is that when you have it on the longest delay time, it's still really quick and when you have the rate at 12 o'clock or further to the right, all you get is hissing feedback. The rate alone makes this pedal non-usable. I also wish it was labeled as "time" instead of rate. It's really really bad.  - The Echo function. It does as it should but I wish it was labeled "level" instead of echo. I had to watch a few different tutorials to find out what the controls actually did.  - The Intensity function is actually the "rate" function or how many times it repeats. I wish it was labeled as "Rate" instead of intensity. Intensity makes me think it's the "level" function when it's not.  - FEED BACK and HISSING. When the pedal was on in my chain that's the most noticeable thing about it was that there was a really bad high pitched hissing when the controls were turned up to around half way, thankfully the bypass works. The hiss grew in intensity and I never had that going for more than a couple seconds before turning the pedal off. If you don't turn it off quickly, you could easily blow a speaker, or your ear drums.  Conclusion: Pass thing by. I cannot say that or emphasize that enough. PASS THIS THING UP! It's not that it's a Behringer and Behringer is bad or anything like that, I have couple other Behringer's that are just fantastic. The problem comes with the confusing labeling. The time, or rate being way to fast on its slowest settings and it's hissing and feedback issues. I bought this pedal to replace a really cheap delay that's a pile of garbage because it doesn't really delay, but now all I can say is that the pile of garbage is on the board and this one is going to be going into the garbage.	-1
not what I wanted at all	-1
Junk, avoid buying	-1
Delay timer is too quick for my taste, I did not realize how quick it would be even though it explains in the information. Also the sound is scratchy when played at loud volumes. I'd spend the extra 20-30 and buy a better one.	-1
The slowest rate is still waaaay too fast. Worthless for ballads. Maybe I just got a bad one? I'll either have a friend mod it or put it in storage for back up. That's what I get for not testing it out somewhere first.	-1
Horrible.	-1
Delay is pretty bad, sounds more like reverb it's so fast, even trying in the loop and at other points on the chain.  Joyo makes a much better delay for the price.	-1
Didn't care for it, was very hokey in operation and didn't do what I expected in a delay, returned without any issues. It does take a battery, but the manual wouldn't let you know that, had to find out in reviews here. Just take something to press in the 'hinge' points on the pedal, it'll come off easy, just don't lose the spring that makes the pedal return to it's upright position.	-1
junk	-1
Wasn't very happy with it at all. Other delay's I have used since are far bette and, easier to regulate. Would not buy it again or recommend to anyone to buy.	-1
Junk	-1
This thing is made of the cheapest plastic I have ever seen! I would not want to step on it to turn it on or off. I think it would break! Changing the battery is a "real" pain. You must remove the top plastic part to change/install the battery and I thought It was going to break. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! The repeat rate knob works "BACKWARDS" You turn it in the opposite direction of what you should to get the desired effect you want. It is not suppose to work that way so it is defective. It was not worth paying to send it back. It works, just not correctly! The delay is fair to poor but it was a cheap pedal. I don't turn it on and off. I set it and just leave it on.  My advice; If you are going to be "Stomping" this pedal on and Off I suggest you buy a better, more robust pedal.	-1
This delay is not what I had in mind when I whipped out the credit card .terriblefeedback overload so I just turned it off ,it's going back to Amazon	-1
Thing worked fine the first few times I used it now the thing will not stay in the on position once you release the pedal its off.	-1
its a fun toy to mess around with, but thats about it. Sucks tone and is very cheaply made. Doesnt harmonize well.	-1
You can see my original review below. But after playing with this thing some more, its downright awful and can't do what it claims to do. I was having issues with the sound and tone of the harmony function so I set the pedal to only output the modified signal. I played a few notes from the Key of E, which is setting 5 and set it for the 6th interval (level +3 which is confusing as annoying as hell already). The following is a video I made. I played a few open notes and an open E chord. [...] According to Behringer Tech Support, they claimed something was wrong with the processor. I got a replacement. IT SOUNDED THE EXACT SAME! Terrible. Don't bother with this purchase. Total crap.  original. I just got it last night and I played with it for a bit. It has a lot of functionality for a small, $45 pedal. It does what it says it does, however, I'm just left saddened that the effects sound as synthetic as they do. The directions aren't as helpful as they could be. It explains the dialing of the harmony and pitch but its still a bit confusing. I look forward to playing with it some more. Looking to get that 3rd or 5th harmony on the stuff I play. I won't have much use for the Whammy Bar and Flutter options unless I play a hard-tail. One thing I don't like is you need to physically change the knobs to use all the options. For example, if you're playing live or recording, there's no way you can use a Flutter or Divebomb option and also use the harmony or pitch shifter.	-1
I bought this so that I could try a few additional tunings for some new songs I'm working on. My band does everything in either Drop C/D Standard, or on a Standard 7 string (B Standard/Drop A). Among other reasons, some riffs/melodies I have in my head just sound better with a Low F# or G at the bottom, so I wanted to try this pedal as an option to get there without needing a third guitar live.  The sound quality is mostly fine. Obviously, as you step more then 4 semitones away from the original signal, it starts to sound fake, but that is true of all pitch shifter pedals and plug-ins. There are some odd sounds in the mid-range of my guitar's scale, but that's not why I'm returning this pedal.  I'm returning it because: The "Detune" function literally just makes your guitar slightly flat or slightly sharp. According to the manual, the adjustment is between -30 CENTS and +30 CENTS (not semtones; cents!). By the way, none of these numbers actually appear on the pedal itself, so if you're trying to set it to, say, 10 cents down, good luck with that. If this is something you can put to use, more power to you. It would be nice if they labeled the knob that controls it, so that you actually know what setting you're on!  The "Pitch Shift" function (what I bought it for) has seemingly arbitrary preset intervals that it can use, and you can't choose any other intervals. The options are -24, -12, -7, -5, -2, -1, +3, +4, +5, +7, +12, and +24 semitones. And once again, these numbers are nowehere to be found on the pedal itself, so you either have to memorize that ridiculous sequence, or carry the manual around with you at all times.  Actually, after checking the manual again, there is literally NOTHING that this pedal does, that actually corresponds to the numbers on the "Pitch" knob! So why are the numbers even there? +6 and -6? Why are you two even printed on this pedal? The only "6" anywhere in the manual is in the "Harmonist" mode, and the "-6" and "+6" on the pedal don't even correspond to the 6th interval; you set the knob on "-6" or "+6" to get an OCTAVE interval. *facepalm*  So, basically, you can go DOWN 1 semitone, but you can't go UP 1. You can go UP 3 semitones, but you can't go DOWN 3. If you're in standard tuning, and you want to try Pantera's D-flat tuning, or (old) In Flames's C Standard tuning, well, you can't! If you're in Drop D, and want to play some Five Finger Death Punch (Drop B) or new In Flames (Drop B-flat)...you can't! If you prefer to tune to E-flat, but want to get back to standard quickly...you can't! If you play a lot of music in Drop C/D Standard, but want to jam with someone who plays in standard...you can't! It makes no sense! But I guess Behringer knows best which intervals you should be using as a guitarist. So drop your guitar by two octaves and shut up!  And yes, I know I can just re-tune the guitar myself to get the tuning I want. I'd like to remind you that, if I were going to do that, then why did I bother buying a pitch shifter pedal? So I can re-tune to D Standard, THEN drop down 2 semitones with the pedal? Seriously, think about that for a second.  Looking forward to trying a different pedal with more flexibility in pitch shifting options (ie, a pedal that HAS flexibility in pitch shifting options).	-1
Yikes- don't waste your time..	-1
Did not perform as expected...wimpy quality of sound	-1
I so wanted this thing to be everything claimed.  I'm not sure what the 5-star reviewers are thinking.  The harmonizing is OK (tracking is so-so), the whammy feature, especially going up is really cool for doing Tom Morello stuff, the detuning is a nice liquid sounding effect. The problem with this pedal is that it is unacceptably NOISY!  There is a constant hiss coming from this thing, even when the pedal is turned off - which means no true-bypass.  On strictly clean sounds, the hiss is barely noticeable, but if you apply any gain at all, the hiss is horrible.  When I take this pedal out of the mix, my amp is dead-silent on clean settings and almost silent on high-gain settings.  Put this back in the middle (with no other pedals), and hiss-city.  The instructions say that "on rare occasions, interference from OTHER sources may cause noise" and to get rid of this, you unplug from the input, wait a minute and then plug back in.  Nope - didn't work.  I would never use this live or in recording - the noise is absolutely ridiculous.  And I was using a 9-volt battery, not a power supply.  I have no explanation other than this is a piece of crap. It does some cool things, but there is absolutely no excuse for this much noise.  Too bad - I was really excited to get this at such a low price; now I know why the price is so low.  I do not recommend this pedal.  P.S. I could live with the hiss if it only happened while using the effect - but to have the constant noise when not engaged was a deal-breaker.	-1
Not what I was expecting. Quite a bit of lag between the original notes and the notes produced by the pedal. Sending it back, saving for something with a better harmonizing engine. Worth $50? no. Worth 20$? maybe.	-1
Some of the effects on here work all right, like the detune.  Others, like the tremolo and flutter really require an expression pedal to get useful sounds.  However, the real signature effects--the harmonist and the pitch shifter--don't work at all.  Tracking is poor, and it sounds like an ill animal.  The bypass is also pretty rotten, squashing your tone badly.	-1
This is an affordable copy of the Boss Harmonist pedal. I bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. But was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.  Anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. And on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. Also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. I would have given the Behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad.	-1
I bought this pedal for my bass so I could play one string but give it the tone of a power chord.  Does it do that? Yes. Very well in fact.  But is this thing great all around? Probably not.  When you use the pitch shifter feature, it has a very noticable delay in when you play a string and when if comes out of your amp. The Harmonist feature is a joke; it sounds like complete garbage if you let one note ring into another.  Honestly, if you're looking a for a pitch shifter so you don't have to hire a rhythm guitarist to back you up (or he quit one you), this is a good enough tool to emulate two guitars (or double up on bass), but the rest of the features are pretty useless or poorly created on this pedal.	-1
If I was a hip hop artist, or played other kinds of music that required a lot of sample triggering, then I might feel differently.  But I bought this because I thought it would be a better, more tactile and fun way of playing sampled drum software like my awesome Addictive Drums.  Nope.  as others have mentioned, the pads are not sensitive.  I bought the pad inserts (the kind that look like electrical tape without the sticky), and all they did was make it easier to reach full velocity.  Hits are typically either full velocity or very low.  It's very difficult to achieve anything in the middle.  I guess I'll try the "corx" inserts next, although I won't be holding my breath for much more improvement.  It usually annoys me when someone reviews something in an application it was not intended for.  But I'll bet there are a lot of people like me who are looking at an Akai MIDI player to trigger multi-layered drum samples.  Don't do it.	-1
AKG has been offering this model of headphone now for years, yet the reviews largely remain the same - piss poor! I made the mistake of buying several pair of K271's without first evaluating them, and I paid the price for it, because without exception, all three pairs suffered from the same three faults:  1) The rubber coating on their cords peeled or split 2) The connector on the end of the cord shorted-out 3) The vinyl/leather ear cups cracked, and 4) The RIDICULOUS built-in "auto-mute" switch killed the signal at unwanted times with even the slightest of motion - an absolutely TERRIBLE feature!  The bottom line is this . . . these headphones (the K271's) should have been greatly improved by AKG or discontinued as a model long-ago, but as long as they remain on the market, they should sell for FAR less than current pricing.	-1
Not happy, returned. Hurt ears like crazy after a few minutes and sounded ok, but with poor isolation. Plastic everywhere, and not a quality plastic feel either.	-1
For 30 years I have been used to top quality AKG Headphones. Now that everything is made in China things have obviously changed. Sorry to say but the sound quality of this thing is faaaar from acceptable. How anyone could still consider this a studio headphone is beyond me. Made cheaply to be a low level consumer headset. It has no place in the professional music/sound world. Can we please stop outsourcing all the good stuff to China and maintain a quality product. After KRK now this. You should be a shame AKG.	-1
This tape leaves a sticky residue as a couple of others have noted. Don't buy this tape!	-1
I put them on my instrument and the color quickly faded off of the strips. They stay in place, but the metallic stuff comes off to leave them ALL looking silver. This only took 4 months of low to moderate playing, which is much shorter than you NEED them to last for! I recommend getting the classic colored tape rather than this. (Positive note: I do like the fuzzy squares for finger positions though. They stay put and don't wear out.)	-1
This strap was gifted to me by a lady who had others she preferred more. Now I can see why.  I don't know why Martin put their name on this. The strap is an embarrassment. It is thinner, less supple, and more poorly finished than any belt I have owned. The back may or may not need felt, but it certainly looks and feels cheap. In fact, the entire strap looks and feels cheap. The only thing that Martin got right is the color.  I expect that I will be putting this one quietly away and buying one of the bestselling Planet Waves straps. They look like they take their guitar accessories seriously. But releasing this strap to the market is a major lapse in judgment for Martin. Sorry for the bad news.	-1
Edit: Bought one more- they've redesigned the "finger" at the front of the neck yoke, apparently. It is now much more difficult to remove the instrument without the stand tipping over. There's an added chunk of rubber on each side - presumably intended to prevent a smaller headstock or neck rotating in the yoke, which just gets in the way.  With my basses- especially the 5 strings, it makes a very narrow gap between which to remove the neck, and requires the neck to be carefully aligned between the sides to clear them. More often then not, the neck hits the rubber block pulling the stand forward with the bass. It's bad enough that I may end up sending yet another back. The first one of these I ordered with its smooth fingers is the only one of three that has worked for me (the second was fully defective with a leg that was too short and not secured by the pivot rivet causing the whole thing to just collapse the first time I tried to set an instrument on it). The new one I just received is very hard to adjust for height- it appears the top tube might be slightly bent, but it could just be the clamp is very snug even when open. There's another thing, and isn't a functional issue, but the emblem is missing off of it. Given that I've ordered three and only one was truly defect free, that little detail causes me to really questioning K&M's quality control. The redesign of the yoke is also seriously questionable. One of my favorite features of the original one I bought WAS how easy it is to grab and remove the instrument one handed. Add to all of this the fact that K&M never responded to a customer service email I sent over a month ago, and I can't recommend this product and am reducing my star rating to two.  Long review below with a several updates- short version: Loved the first one I bought so I bought another. Second one defective, thought it was a design flaw (update 1 below), but after some investigation appears just have been a manufacturing whoops where one leg didn't get cut / assembled correctly (update 2 below). My rating went from Five to Two and back to Four stars. Then down to ONE. Had another part fail preparing to pack the second one to send back (update 3). Back up to 4 stars, see update 4- bought another brand stand and realize I still like quite a bit about the K&M despite its short comings. A bit of a roller coaster love affair with this thing, I know. The updates are in reverse-chron order, newest first. My original glowing review is at the bottom.  Final bottom line: elegantly designed, lightweight, folds very compact, but fragile. Ideal for those who need a hanging stand to take to gigs that folds small, and adds little weight to the load in/out. Hanging stands are necessary for offset and odd shaped bodies such as explorers, jazz basses, etc. They are ideal for one hand grabs without having cords, straps, etc snag on the stand. I still feel the K&M could be a little more durable (inner extension stop and adjustment clamp once tubes are separated appear to be the weak links), but as long as you understand the tradeoffs, this is a very good stand. If you'll mostly leave it setup, the Hercules are really quite good, and the added weight makes it more stable when unloaded (perhaps look at the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hamilton-Hanging-Guitar-Stand-Black/dp/B001L8IJDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hamilton Hanging Guitar Stand, Black</a>&nbsp;too).  Update 4: Just bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hercules-GS414B-A-G-Guitar-Stand/dp/B000EEHKVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hercules GS414B A/G Guitar Stand</a>, which very close in price to this one. It's heavier and bulkier (and not being the folding yoke model, doesn't fold up very small). It works well and is pretty simple, but comparing it to the K&M it made me realize I still like the K&M quite a bit despite my frustration detailed below. Both work very well. The Hercules is likely more tolerant of abuse -though I have concerns about the complex "locking" fingers on the yoke. I'm not convinced they're necessary either. Comparing the two, the K&M seems like the better design- the arms actually rotate inward to grab the neck tighter as weight is applied whereas the Hercules just have rotating fingers which block the instrument neck from doing what seems very unlikely in the first place. Given the back angle, the force required for a neck to fall off the front of the yoke would certainly tip the whole stand over, instrument and all. A heavy enough instrument leaning against the padded legs really can't twist enough - again without so much force as to knock the whole thing over anyhow. I believe they are there for piece of mind, mostly - perhaps a small light instrument which doesn't rest against the legs could twist and fall off, but a bass or heavy electric guitar really couldn't. Basically, the instrument would have to be lighter than the 4.06lb stand (2.7lb K&M).  Update 3: Just had another failure. I picked up the folded stand by the yoke and the upper section clamp wasn't latched, so the bottom half extended downward and the whole thing just fell apart. The clamp doesn't latch now, and the top half just pulls all the way out. Tipping the bottom half upside down and a couple parts fall out. I can't make sense of them or put it back together. This happened on the stand I'm already sending back (defective leg, now two defects) but I guess I'm done with this stand altogether. I absolutely cannot recommend it as I do not trust it one bit now. Exceptionally fragile. I really wanted to like it and this just makes me sad. Scratch sad, angry. I just  can't accept two unrelated defects on a product with so few parts. This suggests bigger QC issues. And throw in that the defective leg cost me a ding in my wall and a couple dings on a bass as it fell over. Scratch angry, hopping mad. Ignore everything nice I had to say about the product below.  Update 2: Revised stars again- back up to four... I've investigated this further and my confidence is somewhat restored pending confirmation from K&M (I emailed them with my concerns). I decided to measure the depth of the leg socket to see how deep the leg fit in the hinge. A little over an inch to the hinge rivet- but it appears as if this leg only fits in about 3/4". I could not believe that not only did the hinge rivet not mount through the leg tube, but that 3/4" was deemed sufficient... then I noticed that this leg appeared shorter than the other. Yes. Hmmm. Perhaps the other legs DO extend past the pivot so the rivet goes through the leg too... So I stacked up some strong neo magnets and decided to check out the other legs on both stands. With this crude method, it appears as if the the tubes DO extend past the hinge pivot- on all but the defective leg. So there we have it (I think). I'll sleep on it and decide if I'm keeping the first one.  Updated Bottom line: My initial review below stands - mostly. Defects happen. If I wasn't so cheap, I'd just buy one each of the competing stands (Hercules, Ultimate, Hamilton) and make a truly informed decision. I may replace the second with the Hercules just for comparison. My sense is this one still has the edge for weight, ease of use and brilliantly simple design. The leg issue on the second one shook my conviction about it a bit, but it is pretty clear to me that it was just a pure defect and not a design issue. Nothing about that one defect appears to besmirch the whole product- really just a fluke that would easily pass visual QC inspection. I still love much about the first stand- especially packing it up and taking it with me. How many products are as fun to fold up and put away as they are to use?!  Update 1: I liked the first so much (rated 5 stars), I ordered a second. The second one arrived defective- one leg pops out with any pressure on it. This means the stand just collapses with my precious instrument on it (eek). The leg hinges, adjusting clamps and top portion while mostly reinforced plastic, seemed very well engineered.  However it appears the joint between the leg and the hinge is just a force fit. On the defective one, the hinge is distorted such that the leg tube fit is not tight. It wasn't apparent on the first one, but this looks like a real durability problem. Worse, it wasn't apparent the first time I tried to hang an instrument on it. It was very apparent when my bass crashed into the wall as the stand collapsed under its weight. I had assumed the leg went into the hinge far enough that the steel pivot rivet went through the hinge AND the leg tube, but it does not (edit: on this one defective leg, apparently). This is a potential deal breaker for me, as this will be a high stress part of the stand.  I understand that manufacturing defects do occur, however this seems to me to be a critical design flaw, so I've reduced my rating to two stars. I simply cannot recommend it as it is (edit: see below). In light of this, I may send both back and try the heavier Hercules or Hamilton stands. If you have this stand, make sure you inspect that the legs fit tight!  Anyone concerned that their legs may be so afflicted - it is unlikely, but you could also try the magnet test to try to determine where the leg tube ends. With a strong enough magnet, it is very apparent where the leg ends. On a properly assembled leg, you can feel the pull of the magnet towards the leg all the way up to just above the hinge pin. ON the defective leg, it stops well short of the hinge pin.  My original review follows: I just received it. What a brilliant design. So simple, yet so effective. When loaded with an instrument, this simple light stand is rock steady with a low center of gravity. It folds up so small and light compared to the others in this class, and with such a brilliantly simple pair of latching cam clamps. The hanging yoke folds back over itself flat with the main tube. The yoke has an automatic grip which does effectively the same thing as the Hercules, but appears to be a much simpler - and perhaps much more elegant design, with way fewer moving parts. I don't have any personal experience with the Hercules stands, and they certainly have a strong following. But I suspect a that they apparently outsell K&M on Amazon has at least a little to do with how widely they are distributed and marketed in the U.S. vs. K&M. The most competitive product from Hercules looks to be the GS415B, which weighs 4.4lbs, has a 12.2" base radius and folds up to 28.8 x 4.5". This K&M stand weighs 2.7lbs, roughly the same base radius and folds up to 21 x 3". That makes it small and light enough to tuck in the outer pocket of my gig bag (Protec Contego, fits in about 3/4 of the way). At present, this stand is also about $10 cheaper than the Hercules. Those not familiar with K&M should know they have a very solid reputation for their orchestral stand products as  well as their mic stands. They are generally more expensive than the competitive products, but generally worth every cent. This stand certainly lives up to that reputation in all but the price.  An observation about the weight. This light weight might have a downside- when it is unloaded, it is not as stable as when loaded. That may seem like a rather stupid thing to point out, I mean duh, it's lighter when it doesn't have a big heavy thing hanging from it. But that's the point- the very clever design relies on the mass provided by the instrument to provide the low center of gravity which makes it so stable. But the downside is when you pick the instrument up - especially on a padded carpeted floor, it tends to bounce a bit and want to fall backward. I could see that being a bit troublesome on stage when trying to swap instruments one handed, however most of the stages I see are not covered in plush shag with an inch of pad, so perhaps it won't be an issue. I guess my only real concern with this stand is the quality of the plastic parts and how well they will hold up. Only time will tell, but based on what I have seen from K&M in the past and reviews of this stand elsewhere, that shouldn't be an issue either.  Bottom line? Highly recommended as a lighter, simpler alternative to the Hercules. Definitely recommend over the Ultimate GS 1000, which is very similar in design and close in price, but in my biased estimation is a likely to be somewhat of an inferior knock off of this one- actually that's generally my  jaded opinion of most of what Ultimate sells- cheaper imitations of the superior K&M products, but more heavily marketed and more broadly distributed. K&M seems to put their business investment into thorough engineering and design, quality materials and stringent quality control.  Ultimate seems to invest in clever packaging of slick looking products backed by strong marketing broad distribution. I should disclose that I recently had a bad experience with an Ultimate double hanging guitar stand. I spent about 5 minutes with it before boxing it back up and requesting a return- it was REALLY cheaply made and completely unstable with just one instrument on it, but will admit it is targeted at a lower price point and not a competitor to this. Edit: I did buy Ultimate GS 100 which confirmed my assumptions. The height adjustment was also defective, so it went back. It was overall very flimsy, and the yoke shape didn't work well with 5 string bass- it sort of wedged onto the neck making the bass hard to remove. Ultimate support was VERY responsive to an email I sent about the defect though, which is more than I can say for K&M- I never got a reply to an email I sent over two months ago.	-1
Not a good item it make a terrible hissing noise - go back to the drawing board Behringer	-1
The pedal does not pass your signal through it very well (no true bypass).  What this means is that whether or not you have the pedal on or off, your guitar will not sound the same.  The sound is quieter and with much less frequency range, in other words it just doesn't sound good.  I was not able to have my tone affected as such so I threw it away after about 5 minutes.  When removing the battery I did manage to destroy the little plastic clip that holds the lid on, also rendering the pedal useless.  As inexpensive as this item is, I feel it's still overpriced, it's worth about half it's current cost.  Spend a little more and get a pedal from the established makers DOD/Digitech/Ibanez etc.	-1
Not what I was hoping for from line 6. Have had multiple problems wit this amp. Not particularly happy with my purchase.	-1
Well at first I didn't care for it much bit the more I use it the better I like it. Has a big amp sound. If u use batteries get the good ones. It will last quite a while on batts. UpDATE!!! Get a vox mini5 rythym. This thing eats c batts. Hard to find rechargable ones. Speaker fuzzez. I should have sent it back a long time ago. Piece of CRAP!!!!!!!!!!#!#	-1
Although a good pedal, mine was defective. One of the controls/knobs was defective. I have another one now and it works good. It's just this one was bad.	-1
I really like this pedal, but mine died after less than one year of moderate use.  Many people have reported the same issue.  It's dead, Jim.	-1
They sound flat.  Especially the b string, hated the way they sounded on my ovation tx elite, gave them away and switched back to elixirs.	-1
I bought these strings back in May, 2015 and it came with three sets.  They were ok but didn't last long at all.  I was getting ready to put on my last set of strings and they were rusted. the other two sets were not rusted.  I stored them in my room in a cool dry place.  not sure what caused it or if they came that way.  All that to say, if you order these check all the strings BEFORE your return date expires like mine did.  This is my first time ordering strings from Amazon and probably my last time.  Never ran into this problem before with Martin strings in the 30 years of playing Guitar.	-1
One light was out when it arrived--DOA. I get concerned when for 90 dollars a company can't make a plate of steel with two lamps. Or, another way to look at it is that the unfortunate Chinese worker who assembled it never took the time to simply plug it in to see if it worked. I returned it.	-1
The instrument looks well made, but the sound isn't as good as I had expected.	-1
As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. This Ukulele can't hold it's tuning for 30 seconds. On the plus side, you will be a master a tuning the instrument!!!!	-1
This ukelele is cheaply made and doesn't sound anything like a ukelele should. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. I HIGHLY suggest you spend about $5 on a Kala KA-15S if you're looking for an affordable Soprano ukelele.  I immediately sent back my Makala MK-S right after I opened the box. It looks cheap, it plays cheap. Go for the KALA!  The strings are incredibly cheap and the sound of this ukelele isn't nearly as "pure" as it should be.	-1
Tried one of these in a store and liked the color, tone and intonation was alright. However, the edge of the fretboard was sharp the whole way down on both sides--very uncomfortable. Tuners felt rough and uneven. There were also a few glue spots visible. Decided to get the Kala KA-TG next to it for a few dollars more--better projection of sound, immensely better finished, no glue spots, no sharp edges, better tuners.	-1
As soon as I got the uke I was so excited to play it. Obviously it took some time to stretch but when I finally got it there, i had a problem. Every single string had a horrible buzz on the first fret. Unplayably horrible. I emailed the company to see what could be done because I wanted this uke so much. A week later and absolutely no response.  Broken, garbage product. Awful, unresponsive company. I will NEVER be so stupid as to buy from this company again. Even now I wish the uke worked. But to doesn't and the company doesn't care of their products arrive BROKEN. So I'm returning it. Thank you for absolutely nothing, Kala.	-1
When I first received this ukulele, the strings were VERY loose. I had to tighten it up, then tune it. However, no matter how hard I tried, it would not tune properly. The sound that comes from this instrument is absolutely horrible. It sounds nothing like a ukulele. What an awful waste of money! No matter what song is played, they're all completely unrecognizable.	-1
the product only lasted about a week before it started giving problems and within a month it was useless . i wish i could put 0 stars, but alas, only 1 is accepted. truly a waste of time and money.	-1
I hate Digitech they make Me look stupid. I do Not care what Anyone says this Guitar processor lacks too many features after all why buy are Guitar processor If It lacks too many major features? This Is Not a step up from the RP355 this has less features than the RP355 The Delta Lab Guitar processor has a many features and Sounds just as good and Is easier and faster to program and cost much less and Behringer makes good stuff too at a more reasonable price. And of course I had to buy a used one because I can Not afford a new one. My first Digitech was a GSP 2101 which I gave around $750.00 In around 1995 that was before all the false government bail outs when manufactures had to sell something of a good value to make money. The GSP 2101 did Not have a Drum machine or an Acoustic simulator and did Not have enough memory to used Giga Verb with other than a few effects, but was a monster awesome Sounding that Is got Me hooked on Digitech. Then Digitech for No reason discontinued the GSP and also because of a lack of money I did Not get the foot controller with the GSP 2101. In 2005 Some People wanted to get a band started so I bought a GNX3000 which has a Drum machine and Acoustic simulator but lacked Ducking or Shimmer reverb which I was already using In My Songs but Behriger RV600 gave Me back the Sound I was looking for. I compare this RP500 with the GNX3000 but this RP500 lacks a Drum machine and after I bought It I read the specifications there Is No listing for an Acoustic simulator but just like the GNX3000 It has a very nice Sounding Acoustic simulator but the Wah Wah Sounds terrible It Sounds like a busted speaker the GNX3000 Sounded better In fact I heard a $20.00 Wah Wah that Sounded better, I want to try Behringer Wah Wah, and I have Not found the Ducking or Shimmer reverb and of course It has No Drum machine where the RP355 has a Drum machine and Acoustic simulator and Ducking or Shimmer reverb when I bout the RP500 I thought It had all the features of the RP355 but No but what the RP500 has that the RP355 does Not have Is the Marshall JCM 2000 simulator which I think Sounds less dull than Marshall JCM 800 but a $15.00 Danelectro D-1 Sounds good too. The programming Is good once You figure It out. Good or bad Is a question here You can change to any 5 settings with one push of a switch but to get more settings You must push the up button then before It has a chance to change back push another button and If You mess up during a live performance that may be a problem. I Also used a ART tube pre amp In front. If You are looking for a more affordable Guitar processor Delta Labs makes one that has many good features Including a Drum machine and Sounds good too. I Am still trying to figure out what to do about the Drum machine Linux ArtistX has a Drum machine called Hydrogen which can be had for under $10.00 but I can Not get It to work the Operating System Itself works great. I should mention unlike the cheaper brands Digitech made of metal and are very durable. If I had to do It again I would just gave up on Marshall JCM 2000 simulator and have got the RP355	-1
This pedal kept shorting in and out as I was soloing- I switched to a different reverb- and the same thing happened! Not Good! Also, this pedal really diminishes your tone a lot. The reverbs all sounded the same except Space and Echo. In closing,the reverbs sounded okay though.	-1
I am extremely easy on pedals. This pedal worked for 2 weeks, then would cause strange pings, etc to emit from amp. It had a lot of good sound options . Shame it was was junk. I own other pedals by this brand.. Guess a lot of people were right about this brand however...	-1
Not that great	-1
At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. These pedals feel what they are, very cheap. Adds noise to your signal and not worth the mediocre sounds.	-1
A TOY	-1
Dead on arrival.	-1
I was hoping this would function as well as the Echo Park, but this pedal is unusable. I have bought many cheap pedals in the past, so I usually know what I'm getting but none have been as disappointing as this one. The effects seemed to work, but it causes huuuugggeee tone suck as well as adds plenty of hum to your mix! Also, this was my first Behringer pedal but if they are all made with this cheap of a case I don't see myself buying another.	-1
This pedal along with the echo machine, digital reverb/delay, and compressor/sustainer pedals by Behringer all worked great for the first two day I had them. The second night while using them they all one by one started malfunctioning. They would cut on and off and produce unpleasant sounds. I replaced the batteries thinking although the batteries should last longer than two days perhaps that was the issue (which it was not). I realized I got what I paid for, cheap poor quality pedals. I almost gave these products 2 starts b/c while they were working they sounded fantastic, how ever there is no point in guitar pedals that can't maintain working order after such short time. I didn't handle these pedals roughly nor expose them to any harsh environments that could warrant defective behavior. Simply had them on my carpet floor in front of my amp. These pedals were practically undistinguishable in sound from the higher end pedals they are based on and it was truly a tease to have thought I found a cheaper alternative to them. I will NEVER purchase any products from Behringer after this experience.	-1
Feels very flimsy.  Doesn't feel like it will stand up to heavy use.	-1
Some things are great values, others are cheap. The Behringer is cheap. The clips are cheap. The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change. The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. IF you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. It's also a noisy pedal. Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined. Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. If you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.  All of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features. The 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. It also has a worth-the-price-alone "space" feature. Also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). Paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.  The RV600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. If you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option.	-1
Defective. Typical Behringer quality.	-1

i FOUND THIS ITEM 30,00 CHEAPER ON ANOTHER WEBSITE THE ITEM IS GOOD IF YOU USE IT IN YOUR RESTROOM THAT IS ABOUT HOW MUCH AREA IT COVERS	-1
I brought this for my 49 Key Keyboard but this bag is made for a board that is much bigger. There is just to much space in this bag.	-1
Pretty but very small and doesn't "sing" .	-1
I returned this as it didn't "sing".  It was very flat.  Next time I will purchase in person to try it out first.	-1
this product did not come packaged as shown, (which is sketchy). Out of the bag it came in the product did not work! I have tried two different MIDI devices (AKAI MK25,and an AKAI XR20). Only one light comes on niether of my programs recognized the connection. Tried flipping the ins and outs and two different PC's one running WIN10 and the laptop running WIN7. Dumped all USB drivers and re-installed them, still no luck....Either I am missing something or this cable is garbage!!!!	-1
Setting up a midi is not as simple as many instructions say.  This cable did not work for me.	-1
Not sure how well this works with other rigs, but my keyboard did not hook up to this at all. I don't even remember if my computer recognized the midi signal or not. Either way, there is equipment out there that this will simply not work with.	-1
Does not work with any of my gear. Buyer beware, it is almost luck of the draw if it will work with your gear. I have Korg Electribe Sampler 2 and Korg Volca FM, does not work with either. You can't return it either.	-1
Simply put, it did not work no matter how hard I tried.  The cable seems to garble midi signals.	-1
Bought this to transfer and save settings on my Strymon TimeLine guitar pedal from my computer but did not work.  It won't recognize the pedal on the computer at all.	-1
Cheap	-1
This product does not work.	-1
ok	-1
Stupid- doesn't work	-1
Trash, don't buy this! I bought this twice, can't get it to work.  It's better to buy a soundcard with Midi	-1
Get something better. In my experience it only works for note on/off. That's about it. It can't do the fast throughput and patch dumps to keyboards. It will not even recognize some of my older modellers/effects units. Tried 2 different ones..same cheap type. Neither would work. I purchased one years ago that works fine. Something changed.	-1
I bought this to hook up my PC to my Keyboard but have yet to be able to get it to work.  I'm not the most technologically advanced person but it's advertised as plug in and go...not so for me.	-1
sometimes doesn't seem to work	-1
Did not work with my line 6 M13.  For the record, it never claimed to, but it is a standard device that should be capable of such data transferring.  Lesson learned folks.  Don't skimp on price when it comes to midi-cable converters.  Save your self the frustration and get a tried and true cable.	-1
didn't work.	-1
Pretty much does nothing but lights up. I guess it would be a nice ornament on a Christmas tree	-1
