It's good	1
Signal from MIDI device to computer has a little more latency than I'd like. I wouldn't recommend it for live performances or something that hinges too much on tempo consistency. I just use it for notation and transcribing with a digital keyboard and Finale software, and it works perfect for that.	1
It works for most uses, but sometimes certain MIDI signals didn't seem to go through. Not sure if this was a cable problem or a device problem. The materials seem kinda flimsy, but it has broken over 2 years of light use.  Great because its super cheap.	1
I've waited TWO MONTHS for this to come in. You know what I got when it came? JUNK, I tried this on 3 different MIDI keyboards and they all had problems. I do not recommend this. Sorry for such a short review, but is there much else to say?!	-1
Terrible. It didn't sync with my keyboard that I had at the time. Make sure you do your research and don't always go for the cheap one. Lesson learned.	-1
These work just fine. There is no latency between the push of a key, and my computer receiving the signal.	1
This midi cable works great. I have a Macbook running OS X Mountain Lion and my computer recognized the cable immediately. It is compatible with GarageBand and works great!	1
This worked as expected, I had no problems with functionality or latency.  It's a bargain too. Takes a while to ship	1
Works Perfectly (after I figured out exactly how to hook it up) and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. :D	1
It works. It's cheap.  What more can you ask?  Other USB interfaces cost a lot more and functionally are no different.	1
Worked great with my Line 6 Flextone III amp. Was pretty much plug n play and then make or download sounds.	1
You get what you pay for. Based on user reviews, I knew I was rolling the dice with this purchase. It's an inexpensive product, so cheap manufacturing is expected.  Some work. Mine didn't.	-1
Works well using my synth as a midi controller in logic, long cable too so it's perfect. Will buy more soon.	1
I do hobbyist recording and was seeing all these great VST's (Virtual instruments.) for free! I really wanted to get that synth sound but didn't have the money for a top end keyboard...then my friend who teaches piano told me that almost every cheapo keyboard has a midi out now. just standard. So I looked and sure enough it was true! So for the price of this cable and 30 bucks for a used casio keyboard off of craigslist, I'm in synth haven!!! Just choose what you want, plug this puppy in and you're jamming!  Works with piano learning software and midi recording/editing software as well.	1
My title says it all.  I bought this cable to transfer instrumental backing tracks from the computer to my Fender G-DEC30 guitar amplifier.  The selling price was very reasonable, and the cable works as intended.  'Nuff said!	1
Didn't work at all. Tried on all my equipment and a replacement of some other direct USB/Midi that was working. used on another persons set up and had no luck.	-1
This item is a great midi device connector. It seems to work just fine for what it is intended... Midi Converter!	1
Not exactly the kind of thing available at your local hardware store. I wanted a midi adapter for an old Casio HT700 keyboard that was cheap, decent quality and worked without any configuration. This passed the test the minute I plugged it in. Was immediately recognized by LMMS 0.4.13 and has worked flawlessly since. I might get a few more as spares. I highly recommend.	1
To anyone who may be concerned that pricing determines actual *performance* quality in MIDI cables, let me assure you now that it doesn't. They either work, or they don't. Simple as that. (Also, "wrong notes" mean that they don't work. But that's most likely the controller glitching. There are ways to fix controller glitches which I do not feel I need to explain here.)  The only differences between lower and higher end cables is the amount of external abuse/interference they can withstand/prevent. In terms of latency, even USB 2.0's data transfer rate is beyond overkill for transferring MIDI data. Purchasing expensive MIDI cables is highly unnecessary unless you're considering ludicrous lengths such as 20 feet or longer (Edit: Or in such an environment in which you EXPECT them to sustain physical abuse. Of course, if you're doing that, an extra $70 probably isn't that big of a deal.) If you claim to feel "Lag" from a cable of this short product's short length, don't complain about it here. That's YOUR computer's fault, not the cable. On that note, you generally have three (2 hardware, 1 software) solutions for these latency issues/audio glitches: 1: Upgrade to a processor with more threads (Possibly expensive) 2: Get a better audio card and/or an external audio interface (Definitely expensive) 3: Reduce your sample buffer rate. (Note that this only fixes audio glitches. It CREATES a lag time between key input - response by allowing your computer more time to process the audio correctly.)  Edit: I didn't feel this was necessary to mention at first, but perhaps it will help anyone who is starting out with MIDI. If you haven't already, I recommend downloading the ASIO4ALL driver. This is more of a requirement than a suggestion. If you haven't done so, are working with whatever default driver is on your computer, and experience lag/inconsistent rhythm, this is most likely the fix for you.  The sample rate option's latency issue is resolved by option 1 (Processor upgrade). It should also be noted that the aforementioned audio "glitch" does not occur during the MIDI data transfer. It happens after it. Simply hearing any form of audio from your computer means the cable successfully sent it, regardless of quality.  To sum it up--once again--MIDI cables either work or don't. There is no real difference in "performance". You're transferring concrete digital data. This isn't actual audio. If you intend to spend more money on wiring, they should go towards good quality audio cables, not MIDI.  Are these cables worth buying? You get what you pay for. These cables don't have fancy plating/shielding for more accurate data transfer. They don't claim to reduce external electrical/radio interference. They're not a major name brand. Also, if you've been paying attention, none of that actually matters. Catch my drift?  Please excuse the long explanation, but I felt it was necessary based on some of the reviews I saw when first looking at this product. I pray this information comforts every potential buyer who reads this and saves you a good chunk of cash.	1
I like these cables. They worked good. I just only needed them for a little while, so I didn't put them through a lot of work out.	1
I am new to midi, but got this to run my Yamaha PSR-240 keyboard into my PC as a controller for VST (virtual) instruments and it works fine so far. As others mentioned, I think they are labeled wrong, but they work on mine with the "IN" going into the "IN" on my keyboard, and "OUT" to "OUT". Confusing, yes, but keyboard "OUT" should be "IN" to this device...but who cares, it works.	1
This cable didi not work at all. My keyboard is probably old (about 8 yrs). The light blinked but my computer had not received anything. Returned.	-1
This cable converter is a great addition for connecting to the computer. I was able to see my keyboard on Garage band on my Mac	1
This works perfectly. It is much longer in length than I had expected which was fine by me. The LED indicator is bright and compliments my mixer perfectly.	1
I picked this up to use it with an inexpensive 3rd party camera connection kit with my iPad 2, and it works well.  Plug and play!	1
It took me a minute to figure it out and set it up, but after that it did exactly what I needed it to. I have an older electronic drum set that uses the MIDI hookups and not the modern USB connection, so this was perfect.	1
This product is complete garbage do not buy this if you are serious about music and using it for midi keyboards or drum machines..  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Thank you very much.  Received it in a record time and it works wonderfully.	1
This was exactly what I needed to update the firmware on my POD 2.0, and to download tones from customtone and sync them with Line 6 Monkey from my PC.  Works as easy as plugging it in.	1
Great price, quick shipping, and it works great! Plugged in...driver loaded right from the cable and Voila...connected. PLEASE NOTE: All of these cables are made in China these days(shame on us in the USA.....we can't compete....so it's China, or nothing for most items). The totally opposing reviews on this cable and many, many others that I've experienced is due to poor, or no quality control in China. If you get a good one, great, but the problem is that 1 out of 4 can be bad.....I've purchased many cables recently and that is the sad reality. We need the cable, we take a chance....75% are happy, 25% are not. Really lousy odds but that's the state of things today. I'm a musician and still have various cords that I've used over and over, under rough conditions, and they were never defective....you guessed it....they were all made in USA, back in the 60's, 70's, etc....and they still perform today. I hope we can rectify this soon and find our way back to producing goods here. Until then....we are stuck with a big gamble....a loss of time and faith when you have to return 25% of your purchases......it's not the seller, it's the manufacturer! Amazon stands behind products sold through them, so it takes much of the risk out of the equation.....Amazon Rocks and they sell just about everything!! They are much like the old Sears catalog. Yeah, I'm that old.....they used to sell everything(all Made in USA) and back up 100%. Today it's Amazon! Tomorrow...who knows...?	1
I have a 5 year old Yamaha keyboard and has been mentioned, Yamaha wanted something like $80 for this cable when I bought my keyboard. I didn't bite. This cheap cable has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me to compose electronic music. You can use MuLab Free for a midi/digital interface, but be sure you download the free ASIO software driver, so you won't have latency (delay) issues.  It's quite possible some people got a bad cable or a cable that didn't work with their keyboard, but for me this thing was gold.	1
I recently viewed this movie in blue-ray format, and still enjoyed it. This film won numerous academy awards in 1959, and it becomes apparent as to why after viewing it. I feel that this film is a must for video collectors. The blue-ray format is really effective in this movie, particularly with all the outdoor action scenes. JTB	1
I have Windows 7 installed in my computer. I have tried different keyboards but still can't get it to work. I have this device correctly plugged in but my computer keeps making the sound you get when you plug or unplug a USB devices. I think I got a defected one.	-1
Cable arrived today, was super easy to set up. Just plugged it in and the computer recognized the device immediately (Win 7). Was playing the piano and recording it on my computer immediately with just some free piano recording software. Remember to plug the cable marked 'Out' into the Midi 'In' port on the piano and the 'In' cable to the 'Out' port on the piano. Seems backwards but makes sense when you think of the cable coming out of the computer rather then the piano.	1
Did not install on Windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit or on Vista 32 bit or Windows XP. The instructions said the operating system will automatically detect and install the drivers. But on all these operating systems I got a message that a driver could not be found.  Returned it and ordered the EMU XMIDI 1X1 USB MIDI Interface, which was considerably more expensive. The difference was that it worked right out of the box. To my mind that's a rather critical difference :-)	-1
This is a terrible product.  You get what you pay for.  It failed to work with my keyboard on two different computers (one Windows XP and the other Windows 7).  I tried installing all sorts of patches and drivers and programs to get this cheap thing to work.  Spent 10 hours to no avail.  Save yourself the time.  I'm getting another one.	-1
UPDATE: Below is my original review and I thought I should leave in intact. Since my review I contacted HDE about this matter and their customer support was excellent and are shipping me a replacement to determine if the unit I purchased was defective. My experience with HDE support was PERFECT ! I will update this review upon  receiving the new unit.  ----------------------------  I ordered one of these because my brother had just ordered one that worked great! So I ordered one this week. What I received was not exactly the same. It looks like the same design and same parts but the graphic is different. The graphic does not halve the treble clef it just says USB Midi with a line around it. I thought "big deal, its the same". It's not the same. My MAC didn't read it the same as the one pictured in the ad did when I plugged my brother's in. The driver is freezing my midi control panel up. Furthermore it does not transmit or receive.  Again, my brother received the item with the graphic of the clef and staff, with the word "midi" to the left and the word "usb" to the right, AS PICTURED IN THIS AD. What I received was not this product. It looks similar but fails to function.  A huge waste of time and money on expedited shipping only to be let down.  I'm sure if the company had sent me the item pictured this would be a positive review of a working product. But that is not what happened.  IF YOU ORDER MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHICH VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT YOU ARE GETTING. I am in the middle of the return process now... How Fun !! Instead of tracking tonight, or this week at all, with my new midi interface I will instead be hating the company, hating the product and wishing I never ordered through Amazon or through HDE.  I should add that I have been working on Macs and PCs for years doing audio engineering and midi processing. I have many years experience in this area so this is not "confusion" or an amateur mistake on my part.	-1
Okay, I bought this item to hook up my keyboard with garageband, and at first, when I set it up, it didn't work at all, but then I realized what was wrong.  The cables are marked MIDI OUT and MIDI IN.  The one marked MIDI OUT goes into the IN, and MIDI IN goes into the OUT.  SADLY THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM, it does work, but when I use the pedal for the keyboard, it registers it as another note, so I can't use the pedal.  So if you are just using the keyboard, this should work, but if you like to use the pedal like I do, you'll have to pay more for a better one.  hope this helps.	-1
Well, it didn't claim to work on Windows 7 so I guess that's my bad. I took a chance on this cable because the one in our local music store cost $60. I wanted to connect a Micro Korg to my Windows 7 laptop. The $60 cable did the trick...unfortunately.	-1
I used this with an old Kawai K5000W and a new Akai Miniak on a new Windows 7 PC and a 3 year old Win-X workstation.  Worked without a hitch with stand alone virtual instruments and through Cubase.  Latency was low enough to be unnoticeable.  I think any keyboard made today should have a USB MIDI port but for those that don't (like the Akai) or for older synths (like my ancient Kawai) this works great and costs less than a single normal MIDI cable.	1
I recently purchased the cable from Amazon and received it on September the 6th.  I immediately ran to my closest MIDI compatible keyboard and plugged it into pro tools to see if there were going to be any problems with the vendor that was selected.  To my surprise, not only did the interface-to-USB work, but the response was fantastic.  I did this with a keyboard that's roughly 6-8 years old and will be trying it out on one that is about 10 years old very soon (EDIT:  It worked great on the 10-year old keyboard).  I strongly suggest giving this product a try if you have a keyboard laying around and need a midi controller 'for cheap' b/c there really isn't much to lose.  You have to keep in mind that unless you have octave up and down selections on your keyboard, though, your range will be limited by the rage of the keyboard you hook up to, although that can always be edited in the piano roll.  EDIT:  I am happy to report that after over a year of use, the cable is still working as intended with no noticeable problems.  I am running Mac OSX 10.6.8, and my DAW selections include Pro Tools HD, Garage Band (yuk), Finale 2009, 2011, and 2012 (and it works for all of them), Logic Pro, and even Digital Performer 7.  Remember, sometimes you have to select your keyboard in the preferences.  So far, this has been one of my best investments for music production.  Overall, I recommend this product to people with a budget who need to hook a midi controller to a computer via USB and there are only MIDI IN and OUT ports on the back.  All you do is hook the 'out' to the IN and the 'in' to the OUT and load your library; the rest is rudimentary from there.  Keep in mind, though, that there are programs that require you to set the controller in the preferences, but that shouldn't take any more time than a few clicks or a google search for instructions.  I will keep products like these in mind for the future.  Considering the money I saved this time, it certainly seems worth the research	1
I was worried that this cable would not work to upgrade the firmware on my Line 6 M9 based on previous reviews.  I am happy to report that I just flashed my M9 to the latest firmware via this cable under OS X 10.6.8.  I just plugged the cables in, launched Line 6 Monkey and chose the USB MIDI device.  One small thing is that I had to plug the jack labeled "In" into the port labeled "Out" on the M9 and "Out" into "In" for the other jack.  I don't know if that's normal for MIDI devices but it threw me off the first time.	1
It works great. Super easy. Just make sure you plug the "midi out" cable into the "midi in" on your keyboard. And midi in to the midi out.  That's all I had to do. Then just fire up your software synth and start playing.	1
I bought this specifically to use with Apple's Camera Connection Kit and the iPad. It works perfectly. One of the best five dollar purchases I've ever made. Works as a USB to MIDI cable between my iMac and my Alesis Micron synth. Also works as a USB MIDI device for my iPad (certain apps on the ipad will output midi, others input midi, some do both.) Works perfectly. Class Compliant USB to MIDI device. No brainer purchase.	1
I am extremely pleased with this product. I needed an easy solution to link my midi equipment to my iPad 2. This product worked like a charm and I have had no issues interfacing a variety of musical equipment directly to my iPad without need for a powered hub. The construction of the unit is pleasantly rugged for the low price. I highly recommend this for any iPad midi controlled music enthusiast.	1
Well, I purchased this little cable more than a year ago thinking I could hook my Yamaha keyboard up to my computer to use some synth software I own. I sets up fine, and the cable gets recognized by the software, but the MIDI IN function won't work. MIDI OUT is ok, so I can play computer-generated music on my keyboard, but I can't get any input to the computer from the cable. I've been trying all sorts of stuff -different software, different OS- but it's no use. The thing's a piece of junk. At least it was cheap though!	-1
Great, came as described and on time.	1
When I first attached this adapter, the PC recognized it and installed drivers, but as soon as I attempted to send any MIDI data through it (tried 3 different controllers) the PC would drop the connection and then give me the 'unrecognized device' message.  After a bit of online research, I found a driver that corrected the problem and I was able to use it for about a half-hour.  When I went to connect it again however, I first got the 'unrecognized device' and then NOTHING.  I attempted connecting to 3 other PCs (XP & Win7) and none of them even see that a device is attached (though the power led is lit).  At less then six dollars, it's not even worth my effort to send this hunk of garbage back (FYI, it's not eligible for exchange).  Instead, I will be avoiding this seller in my future Amazon orders.	-1
UPDATE 3/19/2013: Just wanted to mention, I now use a laptop with Windows 7, and I used this cable again the other night to send a new bank of sounds to my 'KAWAI K3' synthesizer, works great even after all these years! Save $40 and buy one of these over the overpriced big brands, you will be thrilled!   If you are looking for a way to connect your MIDI Synthesizer to a computer for downloading new sound banks from the internet or you want to try sequencing with a computer, this will work perfectly fine. The cable features a metallic twine coated in clear plastic (durable stuff). There are little LED lights that blink on and off to tell you that the MIDI connection between the keyboard and the computer is set up correctly (another nice feature). I have owned this very model for nearly 2 years and I have experienced absolutely no errors. I use this to transfer new sounds to my old Kawai synthesizer from the late 80's(the Kawai K1m), and it works perfect for that. I have also used this with a Ensoniq SQ-80, and a Yamaha TX7 and it works perfect for those synthesizers as well. If you want to use a computer-based MIDI sequencer like the wonderful (and free) "Seq24", this is ideal!  I would like to point out that although Yamaha sells their own model for $50, and M-Audio has theirs for a little under $40, this generic model does the EXACT same thing. Your computer will not know the difference, only your wallet and ego will. With this cheaper USB/MIDI interface, you can save your money for more necessary music expenses (better FX units, more cables, better mics, etc).  A final note about compatibility, I'm sure 95% of the 1-star reviews are because of this, so please take note: Windows Vista has trouble recognizing USB-MIDI interfaces, it has no idea what they are or what to do with them. This is a Windows problem and NOT the fault of this device. You can either use Windows XP, Windows 7, an older mac, or if you insist on using Vista, you can go and download the newest driver software for free. This is an easy fix, but it may take a little work on your part. Search 'google' and you should be able to find everything you need. There are also a hand full of older synthesizers that have problems receiving new banks of sounds through MIDI (Roland Super JX, Roland D-50, etc.) this is also not the fault of this device, but of the badly programed operating system that is inside of the Synthesizer (Roland's from the 80's are unfortunately notorious for this).  This has been the most useful $5 I have spent on my music hobby and the internet provides endless free sound banks for most Synthesizers, I highly recommend this wonderful device!	1
I was borrowing a friends Yamaha UX16 to interface my Alesis HR16 drum machine with my vista computer. I need to return that back to him so I bought this to see if it would work, at the price it was worth trying it out... and it worked great. I have since give it to my son so he could plug his new Micro Korg into his lap top, which worked perfectly and bought 2 more. The second one to hook up my Roland guitar synth to the computer. Using Reaper DAW and everything is working fine. Thanks	1
I'm frustrated with this product. It holds the latest MIDI message until the next MIDI event, ie the first note doesn't sound until you release it, and doesn't stop until you push a new note. Viewcon (the maker) offers no driver updates or anything, so there is no way to fix it. I thought I was getting a deal and got burned. It seems to work for some, but not for me and my casio keyboard. It was "plug and play" for Ubuntu but this BIG problem showed up in linux and windows 7 as well. It might be ok for MIDI in but not midi out.	-1
I've often heard, that you get what you pay for. But I figured for $5.00 I'd try this cable. I tried this cable on 3 different Laptops each with different operating systems (Windows 2000, XP, and Vista). This cable didn't work with either of them. I already had the MIDI software (Voyetra and Score Writer 4). I even tried the suggested free down load software (Anvil) that didn't work either. I finally went out and spent $40.00 for a M-Audio MIDI cable. Don't waste your money on this.	-1
I tried this on an HP laptop with a processor two years old and 3gb of memory.  It worked fine for us. The Computer picked up the piano with no problems, and using a couple of different software programs, it really didn't miss a beat. I admit, I'm not talking concert-quality recording, but as far as plugging in the device and hooking it up - it worked fine.  Now when I plugged my daughter's MacBook Air into it, I was disappointed. We kept getting compatibility errors and errors about delays not allowing it to sync up.  Short answer - Windows 7 with an older laptop = No Problem. MacBook Air = Not happening.  That's our experience anyway. Well worth the [...] bucks to try it out.	1
I bought the cable in order to connect my Fender Starcaster TT-1 to my computer with Windows XP. The plug and play installation was ok and the computer software (EZDRUMMER) recognized the connection like an Audio USB. I'm very happy with the product. Remember, The "In" must be connected in "Out" and viceversa. In order to obtain best results always connect the cable in the same USB port. I recommend this product.	1
Yeah, great value and works like a charm between my DP, Yamaha 161 and Mac laptop.  I couldn't ask for more!  Must have to run the Piano and Keyboard, learn to play piano program	1
Unlike another reviewer, I actually did notice the fine print that says "32-bit". But I mistakenly thought it referred to supporting only 32-bit applications running on a 64-bit O/S. For those of us who've never heard of a "32-bit cable" before, that description could use a little enhancement. ("32-bit O/S" would do it)  Two stars for working like a charm on my 8 year old Toshiba laptop running XP SP3 connecting my ancient Casio CZ-1000. If you've got a 32-bit O/S, it's worth the price.  Unfortunately I bought it to use with a new Win 7 64-bit box and all I get is a solid red LED. Windows sees the device but no I/O possible.  Oh well.	-1
I have a Yamaha PSR 330.  I bought it in 1999 so it's pretty old.  Wasn't sure if it would work with it but it worked perfectly at first. I put up a review saying so when I bought it.  But I didn't use the wire for about a year and then I plugged it in and this time it didn't work.  I tried everything but the "IN" light keeps blinking yellow now and the keyboard won't play into the program or through the speakers like before.  It's plugged in correctly. I spent hours googling the matter with no result that was helpful. Mystery.	-1
Apparently, these cheap USB midi adapters just don't work for some people.  This *may* be due to some defect or poor quality control, but a lot of it is probably the fault of the user not being able to set up their software or keyboard properly, and so on.  Anyway, it worked fine for me.  As soon as I plugged it into the USB port, Windows 7 x64 recognized it and installed the drivers, and within seconds it was ready.  I opened up Cubase, as well as some stand-alone virtual instruments, and all recognized the device and it worked great.  I could use my keyboard as a MIDI instrument with my computer - objective accomplished, and for $30 less than what Emu or M-Audio wants to charge me.  Sounds perfect, right?  Well, almost...read on.  I have only two issues with this adapter.  First: one end of the device is the USB cable, then there's the box with some LED indicators on it, then it forks into two MIDI cables labeled "In" and "Out."  The MIDI cables on the adapter are MALE.  Meaning, they're not meant to accept a cable coming from your keyboard, as I assumed - they're meant to be plugged directly into your keyboard.  The entire device is only about 8 feet in length, which is not as long as I'd like.  So, I had to buy a MIDI coupler, which was about $5.  This let me run my own cable from my keyboard, which I could then plug into the adapter with the coupler.  Second: when the device is plugged into the USB port, a red LED lights up indicating that it's "on."  So far, so good.  But if the "In" cable is connected to a device, then a yellow LED starts flashing.  It's fairly bright, and flashes steadily about 3 times per second, no matter what's happening.  If it's anywhere in your line of sight, this is quite annoying.  If the adapter is tucked away under a desk or something you probably won't notice or care, but otherwise be prepared to put some tape over the LED.  So that's it.  It appears to work fine for me, I just needed to spend $5 at the local music shop for a MIDI cable coupler.  Still a lot cheaper than M-Audio!	1
I have used this cable for around a year now, and I have had very good success with it. No lag or latency issues. I am amazed how well it works with USB. Great product.	1
Works as advertised. Plug & play with both Windows XP & Windows 7. No need to load any drivers.  I bought this to stream MIDI files to my Fender G-DEC Jr. guitar amplifier. No problems whatsoever.  Made by Viewcon: [...]  Amazon does not allow links in reviews, but if you search for the manufacture name (Viewcon) or the model# (VW060--USB MIDI Cable) you can find more info on this item.	1
Worked flawlessly with Windows 7 and Mac Os X Leopard. If you've ever used a midi cable before you should not have any problems. At this price, you might as well have a couple of them around.	1
Could not run on three diffent PC's "USB overload" spend a little more and buy a better one.  Too cheap to ship back for a replacement.  I don't see the the replacement being any better.	-1
I had no a problem at all. Except according to instruction I had to plug the cable plug marked "In" to MIDI port marked "Out" and it did not work that way. So I plugged cable's "Out" to MIDI's "Out" and it worked perfectly. Actually it is not a big deal for me as long as it works. It worked with Casio CTK-481 and eMedia MIDI keyboard. No additional drivers was necessary. I just plugged and played. Operation system Windows XP Pro, Music editor: "Kinetic" CakeWalk product. I set in "Audio options" "Latency" as 20 mS. And I did not have any delay AT ALL! HALLELUJAH ! I had (since 2004) USB - MIDI cable made by "M AUDIO" and that one had a big latency until somehow it stopped work (died like old horse or so). But this USB MIDI Cable (unfortunately I do not know the brand name) is work flawlessly. Earlier I had MIDI/Game-port to Five-pin DIN connector cable. So I had to find and install any controller (sound card or modem) which had a MIDI port because new motherboard mostly do not have one and because it was only the way to avoid big latency or distortion when you trying to find the balance between them. Finally I can play through USB without any delay. My guess is only that it probably does not work with some music software such as A73 Piano station even if it recognized in MIDI options or Energy XT 2.5 at least for demo versions. But It does work with CakeWalk "Kinetic" and Acoustica  Mixcraft 4. I highly recommend this cable!	1
I have used this successfully on my Win7 machine wonderfully.  Low latency, consistant work.  My original review (when I couldn't get it to work) follows:  This simple, generic device was connected to:  Mac PPC (Power PC) running Mac OS X (10.4.11) and Acer laptop running XP PRO  I was using Garage Band for the Mac and tried a few things on the PC.  This device would show up in the list of devices for the Mac.  It was completely invisible to the PC.  I am no stranger to working with computers and music applications, this was a tough one.  When I have problems with a USB device, I cull its ID number from the USB identifier and search for drivers, the source company, etc...  The ID number on this device belongs to two other products (humm, that's strange) and they are very different functions but appear to be from the same Chinese manufacturer.	1
I received this cable today, when I first plugged it in, Vista said it found the driver but it couldn't install it because it wasn't found (uh, ya).  After searching on the web, I found a HotFix for Vista on Microsoft's site from Feb. of '08 that dealt with USB Audio devices.  I downloaded the HotFix, installed it, rebooted and after I did the driver for the cable installed successfully.  I put a 4 star down because I don't know if it was the drivers fault or Vista's fault.  Bottom line is though, the cable now works.  Here's a link to the HotFix for anyone interested (I just installed it on Vista SP1 and I was fully patched before this):  [...]  Also in regards to the two midi cables that come out of this, there was an insert in the package that explained exactly which ones to use, it was pretty straight forward.  For $8, this cable is fine.	1
If you have a fast computer that is capable of handling midi instruments, then this cable is perfect. It has easy USB connection to your computer and midi in and out to your keyboard. Great product, does what it supposed to do.	1
The USB - midi conversion worked as advertised - plug and play with Vista 64 !!  The vendor was very good as well since I received it in the mail less than 3 days from placing my order. So overall excellent value and service.	1
i plug it into my keyboard (a cheesey casio with midi plugs) and then into my computer and its a perfect connection for use with garage band.  the "in" and "out" seem like they are backwards because it only works when i plug in to out and out to in, but i don't really care about that.  its a far cry from the old clunky boxes that you used to have to plug into the wall and to the keyboard and to the computer.  now its just straight from the keyboard to the usb and you're done.  it also saves you a lot of money because almost ALL keyboards have a midi in/out plug- so you can use this simple wire instead of buying a usb ready keyboard/controller.	1
I ordered this item with fingers crossed that I could get into computer-based music recording without spending a fortune.  I have an older Korg SP-100 keyboard and used this cable to connect it to my computer which runs Tracktion 3 recording software.  Having installed the software and some VST plugins for instrument sounds, and having connected my keyboard via this usb/midi cable and done a few rounds of simple recording to test the setup, I am happy to report that everything seems to be working well.  I can't really comment on the quality or longevity of the cable since I've only had it a short while, but at less than $10 my expectations won't be hard to exceed.  If you need a simple & cheap way to use a midi controller with your computer, this seems like a great way to go.  And for the record, my computer runs Vista Home Premium and there have been no compatibility or driver issues.	1
Works WITHOUT having to install a thing. I've used other cables - some work on Mac but fail on my PC - drivers won't remedy it. Just remember to put the cable's IN into the midi device's OUT and VV. Nice simple no name solution.	1
Great product!  Product does as advertised and is useful.  And the price cannot be beaten.  Will buy this product again!	1
This is a well-made bag with adequate padding for all but the most expensive baritone ukuleles.  Large outside zippered pocket holds music, picks, capo, etc.  Recommended for its overall quality and its price.	1
It holds the instrument, nothing else.  Almost no padding.  Has a front pocket at least.  Went to a hard case.	-1
Perfect fit for Kala KA-BE Mahogany Baritone Ukulele with EQ.  Great for travel and storage. Fair quality for cost of bag.	1
This is a great gig bag, well padded and fits the ukulele perfectly.  A good protector as well as a nice sized outer pocket	1
This is a well made hard case for my precious uke! I previously had a gig bag but this provided very little protection for hard bumps. This hard case took care of that problem, highly recommended.	1
Its great. It holds my uke. It also holds my music.  works just like it's supposed too.  I recommend it.	1
I like this case. I've got a Kala KA-C, and it fits, but needs a towel to keep it from sliding up and down (along uke's neck axis) in the case. I guess it's not a huge deal if you aren't banging the case around, but I figure that having a towel in there to help keep it steady helps and the towel can be used to wipe down the uke after playing anyway. It's almost impossible to make a "one size fits perfectly" case, so that's no big deal.  The case has a nice strap to keep your uke in place that goes around the neck, and it has an interior compartment below the uke neck that fits the spare strap, my Snark Tuner, and a pack of strings pretty easily. The outer pocket doesn't seem to hold much - it can stretch and hold a tuner and strings and such, but I wouldn't expect to fit large books in there. I do keep some folded papers and songs in there though, so that's useful.  I've traveled with this case, but it hasn't been checked yet. If it is ever checked on a flight I'll try to provide an update on how it performs. So far, with rude people not caring, it has survived being crushed and hit hard when people put their bags on top of it in the overhead bin. By the way, for US customers, this will fit straight into a Southwest Airlines overhead bin. The dimensions exceed their quoted limits, but it has several inches to spare. I'll try it out on other airlines and see what happens.  I think this is a good case for the money, and if I'm ever unlucky enough to have to check my uke, I'm pretty sure it'll survive. I'd recommend this case to a friend.	1
This case is for a Luna concert ukulele, which is a very light instrument; this light case complements it well. At first I was concerned about it not providing enough protection, but after using it for a few month I am quite happy with that. I would not let children stand on it, but apart from that it is good. I am not concerned about bangs and knocks.  Compartments are useful. There is a velcro strap for holding the instrument securely in place.  There are straps so one can carry it as a backpack, if one were, say, 10 years old.	1
Not the best bag I own but does a good job of protecting my Koa wood tenor at home. Would want something sturdier for travel.	1
It does what it is supposed to.  Protected it on a 5 week holiday in my Highlander.	1
Very good!	1
Very good quality	1
If this Kala UB-T Tenor Ukulele gig bag was in the $10-$12 price range, then I would have given it 5 - 4 stars.  But at over eighteen dollars for this thin bag makes it an ugly lopsided deal.  The padding--if you call it that is almost nonexistent.  I can't recommend this bag.  I believe the Chromacast one would be a much better choice and less expensive too.  Two nice thing I can say about it are--First, my Tenor ukulele fit inside it without any problems.  In fact it seemed to have a lot of space.  Second, there is no ugly branding or labeling on the outside of this case; unlike the Chromacast one.  To sum it up  this is a super thin black "Plain Jane Brown Bag Utilitarian" gig bag.  Maybe this is why the manufacturer doesn't to display their name on it.  If the pressing timeline wasn't an issue, then I would have returned these and re-ordered gig bags---selecting  Gator, Kace or Hola Heavy Duty bags.  I needed 13 of them at the last minute when our local music shop dropped the ball and failed to get the bags we really wanted for the start of our ukulele building workshop.  This was the only vendor that I could find that had 13 gig bags in stock.  My Hola Heavy Duty Tenor Bag set the standard for an around $18.00 - $19.00 gig bag and I was expecting the same quality and features from Kala UB-T, but was terribly mistaken and disappointed.  I wanted to go with the "Hola! Heavy Duty TENOR (up to 27 Inch) Ukulele Gig Bag with 15mm Padding"  as they are a fantastic baq and are price right around $18.00.  Avoid Kala, unless you can get them for $10-12 and knowing that they will be super thin.	-1
Nice gig bag for the price.  Not very well padded but it's better than nothing. It fits my $70 Kala MK-T Makala Tenor Ukulele perfectly, that's all I need for now.	1
Had I known what I was getting I would never have ordered it.  There are gig bags and there are gig bags.  I've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags.  I expected more. This one offers almost no protection.  The only reason I have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund, but may end up returning it anyway.  It *did* fit my Kala KA-TG with room to spare.	-1
This bag does the job.  Since it is soft, it won't protect your uke from real hard bangs, but I knew that going in.  The one thing I miss is not having a little ring on the back of the bag, so I can hang it on a wall hook.  I'll have to modify it, so I can.	1
I wasn't sure if I my uke would fit in this bag but I ordered it anyway.  My Kala KA-T tenor fits in it just fine.  It was just what I was looking for.	1
This bag is just what I needed.  Simple and light.  I like the shoulder strap for carrying around.  I make ukulele as a hobby and Im always looking for a case for the ukulele when Im done.  This gig bag is perfect for that at a great price.	1
The construction, fabric, color and padding are all A-1. This is a super bag! My precious uku will always be protected and look good too.	1
Pros: Good thick padding Well constructed seams and zippers Good fit for LU-21 Tenor Cheap Front pocket has space for lots of stuff  Cons: Honestly none.	1
I am impressed with the quality of this bag that matches my Kala Uke! I would highly recommend this protective bag over the expensive case!	1
This is my second Makala gig bag. The first was a smaller size for my MK-C concert uke, the second was the one above that I purchased for my Oscar Schmidt Tenor OU6.  My OU6 actually came with an O.S. logo'd gig bag included, but while I love the uke the bag was PA-thetic. Single layer of fabric providing no protection. After comparing that bag to the one for my Makala uke, I came straight to this page and ordered another Makala bag.  Why do I like this bag better? Its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside.  You can carry it around, set it down, let it roll around the back seat of your car (a little) without blemish to your instrument.  As good as a hard case?  Of course not. But very good for a bag.  I also like the fact that there's no logo on the outside. I can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke I want inside. That was a disappointment for another reviewer, for me it's a plus.  What don't I like?  The dorky pad around the handle.  Both my concert & tenor bags had the handle pad and the first project for both was to remove it.  It's not as if the uke inside weighs so much you need a special pad for the handle!  And it just looks better without it.	1
I like this bag, though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured.  It's a bit too big for my tenor uke, it's most probably made for a baritone uke. All in all a good value for the money!	1
good.  fits with my kala concert uke	1
Great protective bag for minor bumps and dings.	1
Perfect, Thanks!!!	1
This is just what i wanted for my Ukulele!	1
great bag- valued manufacturer	1
It's an OK bag for  ukelele.	1
nice light-weight case	1
I knew for this price it wouldn't be a hard case or a soft one with really thick padding. It protects my Makala concert uke well enough from scratches and exposure and I can strap it to my back. Decent quality. All I really will ever need, if you have a very expensive ukulele maybe you need a hard case. PS: just bought an antique Armenian mandolin for next to nothin' at a pawn shop, put on new strings and it's awesome and.... it also fits perfectly in this bag so I hafta get another one (also from the same place I got a regular size mandolin, it doesn't fit).	1
Well made bag that fits my concert uke fine with tuner attached and a large cloth.  I like that it can also be worn like a backpack.  I wish it was padded a bit more but it was reasonably priced.  Depending on your needs you may want to get a heavier gig bag but this one is fine for a careful ukulele owner.	1
Good fit and protection for Kohala Concert Uke.	1
Could use a little more padding, but the pocket is nice.	1
My concert ukelele fits perfectly in this carrying back. However, the case I came with had a rip in the miscellaneous pocket on the front, so I'm afraid that putting smaller items in that pocket might cause them to fall out. I assume that this isn't the norm. My only wish is that the case offered a bit more padding all around, since it is a soft case, and my ukelele might not survive a great fall like Humpty Dumpty did.	1
Not the most protective case but does the job at a reasonable price. I would recommend this to anybody who is starting out playing ukulele and doesnt want to spend alot right off the bat.	1
Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for a better one.  It's basically just a cover and doesn't offer much protection.	-1
This case is quality from square one. Light weight, really strong, cradles the instrument like a baby. Low price is the icing on the cake. Highly recommended!	1
Fits right.  Sturdy & protective.	1
I recently bought 2 Tenor Ukuleles, and picked up one of these cases to check it out.  My Luna Tenor Tattoo Series fits perfectly in the case.  My Makala MK-T is too large, and does NOT fit into the case.  The case is built well; I'm quite confident it could take some light abuse, such as on an airplane, and keep my uke protected.  I'd certainly recommend this to anyone, though I'd suggest doing some measuring to ensure your Uke will fit first, perhaps even pay a visit to a local music store to test it out.	1
I purchased this case for my 50th Birthday present - A Vintage 1935-1942 Martin Soprano Ukulele.  It's a great case.  Well made.  Light.  Perfect.  I have several ukes and many cases.  I highly recommend this one to keep your uke safe without breaking the bank!	1
It protects the ukulele from being knocked around inside the car and from grandchildren. I suspect it also helps with heat if you have to leave it in the car .	1
This bag works nice for my Lanikai Pineapple soprano uke and my other soprano uke.  The bag is nicely padded and has a big pocket. When the uke is in the bag, it resembles a hard case, but is soft. I rigged up bag with another inner pocket especially for tuner, which fit in outer pocket but bulged. It's perfect now.	1
Sturdy, easy to carry to class.	1
As advertised	1
perfect for my Kala soprano ukulele.	1
Good value	1
Well made and fits my ukulele perfectly.	1
Basic, very functional.  I ordered these for a kid's group and the backpack straps are great for the kids...really a good thing to have.	1
My granddaughter was really excited for her ukulele & bag to protect.  The bag was well made and good value.	1
I bought this bag for my niece who want to learn to play the Ukulele.  The bag is nice quality and not too bulky.	1
It's kinda ............ junk !	-1
Great quality	1
This case does exactly what it's supposed to - protect my ukulele when it goes with me on the road.	1
works	1
Came on time and nice product.	1
The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far.	1
As described.	1
Great bag!	1
Fits perfectly my Kala Soprano Ukelele. I bought this to protect my ukelele against dust and scratches. Does not give enough protection against bumps and drops.	1
This bag is perfect for the ukulele.  It is the right size, very protective & just what I needed.	1
This bag is so flimsy that they shipped it to me in an envelope. Yep, no box.. Padding is too thin in my opinion. If I were carrying my uke in a crowded location in this bag I'd be fearful of someone bumping into me. I gave this away and ordered a hard case (Polyfoam) which I LOVE... :)  I don't think that this "gig bag" is worth the price.	-1
Don't expect this bag to give the kind of protection a hard or foam lined case can give. It does provide som padding and will keep your instrument dust free. It will protect from minor bumps and scrapes but I'm not sure what will happen if you drop the uke in the gig bag so, try not to drop it! The price was good and I feel secure carrying my uke.	1
bought this for my uke and took it to Europe with me! It was awesome! I sometimes had to carry my uke in the rain and it kept it all dry as long as I did not drop it in water or it was not pouring. Awesome stuff!	1
It seemed like a good product but, a major sewn seam near the zipper ripped within two months.  Look for something else.	-1
Bought this for my son's Ukulele and it fit perfectly. It is nicely padded but not too bulky. Light weigh and made sturdily. I would recommend this Gig bag!	1
Good quality bag, padded to protect uke from the eliments.  Excellent way to carry around in and store. Arrived on time to store my new ukulele.	1
Nice little padded bag with roomy zip pocket for tuner and other accessories.  Good value for the relatively modest price.	1
Quire frankly Sennheiser should just include this with the microphone and charged extra. The little foam windscreen that comes with the mike is prone to falling off and that's why I ended up getting this. This furry wind screen snaps onto the mike unlike the foam windscreen which is held on by friction and since the mike is shaped like a long cone there's not much to hold it on. The XLR adapter seems useful but my video cameras with XLR audio jacks come with better microphones already so I haven't checked it. The only drawback is that many of the cameras you might use the Sennheiser mike on will be dwarfed by the windscreen accessory! It really looks like a small mammal has taken a perch on your camera. I might stick some googly eyes on it for fun. Otherwise it's a good accessory and I recommend it.	1
I bought two of these cables based on the price and the fact that the cable ends pictured were of the Neutrik aluminum variety.  The cables I received have the cheaper chrome-plated steel ends that wobble and lose connection after a few gigs.  You get what you pay for I guess, but I was hoping for what was pictured	-1
Have so far outlasted many other brands of mic cable that I've used. I like the "feel" and flexibility of the wire.	1
Hard to find a cable in the XLR world that is not overpriced. This short cable is performing perfectly and had a great price with quick shipment. The little touch of velcro was a nice addition.	1
Great price and worth the money. Going to up date my pa system with these for all our wireless needs.	1
It's difficult to manufacture a rotten XLR cable.  I got this one to replace a 20' cable I was running from a mini-mixer to a studio mike sitting right above it.  It connects well... and even includes a velcro cable-wrap to bind any excess cable-- nice feature, especially considering it's a 3' cable.  It comes in the packaging shown in the photo.  No complaints. Was pleased to find a 3' cable at a reasonable price.	1
This cable does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It connects my instrument to the amp.  No statis.  Why pay extra for a fancy name?	1
I chose this cable b/c it was supposed to have the more durable metallic interfaces and superior strain relief as pictured. What showed up is nothing more than some cheap and flimsy cable that can be bought for a lot less elsewhere. I feel cheated.  Dear Amazon,  Stop with the bait and switch.  -JC	-1
Does what it is supposed to do. Do know yet about durability. As of now, I would buy it again. Price was good. Seems to work well.	1
I love Hot Wires stuff.  Inexpensive, great quality, and durable.  I know this is only a 3' cable, but 3' or 30', Hot Wires delivers the same value in cables.  I  use my sound equipment to reinforce sound at a small startup Church that doesn't have a building yet.  That means setting things up and tearing it all down again at least once every week (twice if we have music practice).  Been doing this for a year or so, and have re-soldered many a cable -- but not my Hot Wires cables.  They really stand up to heavy use!	1
I love this mixer  and I'm a mixer snob (i.e. Rane, Pioneer, and Allen & Heath only). I use this as a back-up/portable mixer for my Pioneer DJM-600, and I think it's great. It has excellent ergonomics and build quality, for a very low price. I feel right at home when using this thing  mixing, cutting, scratching, etc. The build is solid, the cross-fader feels like pro-grade, and it has a balanced master output.  If you want a solid, inexpensive mixer, don't hesitate to grab this one. I've used a LOT of mixers since the 90s  this little rocker is great.	1
Perfect mixer when a small event is called for and / or I don't have to bring my much heavier case with my rack mounted mixer and controller. This mixer has great sound and lots of headroom. The only negative is you have to crank up the mic volume when using a wireless mic, but that's not a major issue.	1
This is a great little mixer and its extremely light on the wallet. I've had this mixer for a year now and its been great to me. Its very basic, no effects. I'm a basic DJ though so its perfect for me. Great for hobbyist especially. Also great for a road kit too.	1
The Shubb Axys is an excellent design, like their other products, but be aware that if you have large hands, this may not fit you.  Even with the largest insert, it won't fit over my ring finger knuckle and my hands are probably only a little larger than average.  However, in fairness, my knuckles are probably larger than most.  The only way I can fit it on my ring finger is to not use any of the inserts but then it won't rotate with one hand and that's it's claim to fame.  But if you hands are small to average size and you don't have large knuckles, you will probably be delighted with this excellent product.  On the other hand, if you  have very large hands or large knuckles this will work for you. I can fit it over my little finger with the 2nd largest insert but using a slide on that finger doesn't seem natural to me and it's virtually impossible to rotate it as it is designed to rotate when on the little finger.  But the folks at Shubb are class-acts and when I let them know that it didn't fit (just for feedback that I thought they might find useful) they responded almost instantly and even offered to buy it back from me.  So, as long as your hands or knuckles aren't large, buy with confidence. You will love it!	1
Great fit and finish	1
nice	1
just right for the  bodies that I use ...not too tight...not too loose....makes good string-to-body contact for sustain. would order again	1
My Fender guitar is 36 years old. I am replacing worn parts on it to make it more "user friendly". Not to worry: The old parts are going into the case. :)  These look great and fit the way they should. I put a little bit of tape around them to make sure they don't come out when I change strings.	1
They fit well, look good... don't use a flat board to pound them flush will leave a mark in the wood LOL	1
Fit the guitar just fine.	1
I needed vintage types, not the modern, fluted ones, and these were perfect.	1
They worked just like they were supposed to.	1
It's Fender people, enough said!	1
Trying to upgrade an import "Tele" with as much original Fender parts as practical. All has pretty much said in previous reviews EXCEPT to get a nice press in fit, use a 8 mm bit. Perfect fit. Makes me wonder if these were made in Asia.	1
as described	1
Thanks	1
nice quality	1
nice	1
Great!	1
Fit perfectly	1
Fit perfect, no issues.	1
I was able to install these quickly and easily. Thank you for getting them to me quickly and charging a fair price.	1
ok	-1
they do what they do	1
My 6 year old loves her guitar strap! She has just started taking lessons, and this makes her guitar feel more personalized to her. It is great quality and attached easily to her guitar.	1
Two and a half years ago I purchased a guitar for my step daughter as a Christmas present. I complimented the gift with pink guitar picks and this matching guitar strap. She absolutely loved it and still uses it today. I would definitely recommend this product to others.	1
First thing noticed is the pink on the butterfly is not as pale as the picture here. Mine was brighter and darker. But it is pretty just the same. This is the PERFECT guitar strap. I admit I bought it for myself but it just fit and matched my daughters guitar so much better... since she is 9 I let her have it and ordered a different one for me. :) She is so happy with it. It has a lot of length to it so it would fit younger (she is 9 and almost as it completely closed) to older players.  It was easy to put on. There is a black end that hooks to the guitar strap button. The string side is on the butterfly so it will sit by the headstock. I was thinking that it would be the butterfly on the body of the guitar but it is opposite. Which is fine. I had just envisioned it different.  We are VERY Pleased!  Would buy from again and would recommend to others. Thank you!	1
it is perfect don't get me wrong yet it won't fit my amp so I had to sell it. Make sure it fits your amp first.	-1
I HAVE A FENDER BLUES DEVILLE AND AFTER THE ORIGINAL HANDLE BROKE, I'VE TRIED REPLACING IT TWICE WITH THIS HANDLE, ONLY FOR THEM BOTH TO BREAK WITHIN A WEEK: THEY CAN'T HANDLE WEIGHT!	-1
needed 2 of these for my amp as one doesn't quite seem strong enough.  One on each end as opposed to one in the middle.	1
If your looking for a inexspensive electric guitar then this is the one for you the color is nice and sounds good a good weight to it good for a begginer or pro or just to have a jam session I hope my review helps	1
Here's what i know, I have a lot of different guitars, some of them are real nice and some of them aren't....if you're looking for a cheap guitar i'd say go for a squier or some such thing, don't get this guitar. Things that are wrong with it. 1. Its made of very cheap crappy wood that doesn't have any sustain. 2. The finish is the worst finish i've ever seen on a guitar. 3. The neck is rough and unfinished which makes it hard to slide your hand up and down. 4. same with the fret board. 5. even when in tune this guitar sounds very bad with no amp 6. even when in tune this guitar sounds like crap through an amp.  my advice, drop 40 more bucks and buy a squire, i also have one of those and they are 1000X better, just don't buy this guitar.	-1
This guitar is very good for kids as its not too heavy but built well and performs up to par. Just put your own new set of 3 dollar strings on it and it's ready to do the job A-OK	1
These guitars are fine... if you do a little googling and learn how to set up a guitar.  Meaning, learn how to check the frets, adjust the nut, adjust the bridge, and adjust the string intonation with the fine tune adjusters at the bridge.  I purchased a 59 Gibson ES 335 Reissue for 5,500, and it played just as bad when I received it.  The shop never did the 'set-up' that should have been done.  Even when I took it back in and had them, supposedly, set it up, they didn't.  They just open tuned the strings.  So, I learned how to set up a guitar.  Only then did it sound and play great.  The same for these cheapies.  Set up correctly, they actually play pretty fine.  Just saying...	1
I am 61 years old,been playing since 14. I have bought 4 or 5 Crescents over the years and have not found a lemon yet. These are great guitars!!!!!! I left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. I will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. It is a keeper for sure!! __________________________________________________________  This is the review I gave some months back. I thought I would give an update. Since purchasing this guitar,I have also purchased a Rondo SX,Hadean Tele,Epiphone Les Paul, Huntington Tele, Davison strat and an Oscar Schmidt Les Paul. I play in an old 60's style band and use my Crescent on stage. It's light,it stays in tune and the action I set perfect and the neck is comfortable and fast. I love playing my other guitars,but this Crescent is my workhorse. Ya gotta buy one.	1
Love this guitar! at first I was going to get this for Rocksmith   I have owned and played a lot of instruments Bass(Squire/Fender 5 string Jazz Bass) , Piano/ Keys (Yamaha Motif, Korg: Triton, M50, and others, Drums ( Percussion to 7piece kits with 6-8 Cymbals) and have bought and taken back a few Acoustics-Electrics.. Had an electric once, gave it to a band mate, even held onto one for a fried who asked for it back...all this over the last 8-18 years now.  So this is really MY First guitar  I know about 5 standard chords, a few Bar chords, and I solo enough on the bass well enough to have recorded a song 2 hours after opening the box!  the 1st E string was off its track and leaning over the side.. so I ended up snapping it thinking it was just loose and flat.(Guitar Rookie Mistake) Thankfully they give you spare strings to keep going. I will say I am a big guy so the strap is a bit snug, but for starting out this is a great package!  I noticed the cable that came in mine had a bit of a buzz, but I already owned a cable or two. The tuner I got was missing the clip and battery door... not cool but I have other tuners! The bag is great to have to get started with, but get some real protection or a thicker bag is a must to protect your investment long term!  For what I know... the action feels great... you can get your hands around the neck easily The ONE i pick i got was pretty thick.. So take it easy! Sounds good through a basic amp, but sounds amazing through Recording software like Ampire, or through a pedal. I am hoping to get a Zoom G1zon pedal and step up to a TC. Helicion Play electric when I am a bit more advanced	1
I'm buying some 10 guitars and 4 amps in Amazon, all under $200. Some are under $100. I purchased this one from Amazon Warehouse for $59. It's the cheapest electric guitar I bought (I'm waiting for a $49 classical with rave reviews). It's also the best. That is to say, it's my favorite guitar of them all. Mostly, for what I regard as its best feature, and the most important one to me. Playability. Pure and simple, I tuned it and it is the easiest one to play. And it plays perfectly, no buzzing, easy action. Electronics work fine. 5-way switching. And it arrived in perfect condition, blemish free. It has a simply beautiful design. I prefer this to my Squier Strat. Seriously. The Strat is really more like my Davison than this in build quality and playability, my second favorite (and cheapest) if guitars (the Davison). Out of Squier, Epiphone, Jackson (most expensive), I prefer Crescent (1st), and Davison (2nd). Through the experience I've learned I prefer Fender to Gibson styles. More playability, more streamlined and solid, less individual quirks. (I notice most of the notable rock/rocky-blues guitarists play Strats as well.) I have joined the other reviewers who think you don't get a better guitar by paying more, and often a cheap clone is *better* than the overpriced original, especially in playability. If you're looking for a Strat-clone, or a first electric guitar, or in a seriously restrictive budget, you won't go wrong with this Strat-clone. Not only is it better than all the others I tried, it's the most inexpensive! There's an inverse quality-to-price ratio at work here. I recommend you go for it! I'm not only completely satisfied, but totally happily thrilled I discovered it. I bought a second one in a different color from the warehouse, and it was really beat up unlike this (buy them new), but still played fine so I kept it. Unbelievable playability, can't believe the price (and love the color options!) Thank you, Crescent.  I was not given a guitar at a discount in exchange for a review, have no relationship with Crescent, Amazon, or any Marketplace seller or music store, and bought it with my own money. I'm a regular, uncompensated customer. :)	1
i BOUGHT THIS FOR A FELLOW BAND MEMBER AND SHE SAY SHE LOVES IT!!	1
delivery was later than suggested, but arrived just the same, sounds good, thanks br	1
made a nice beginner guitar for the price. i've since moved on to an epifone, but still come back to this one on occasion.	1
Very good	1
BEST GUITAR FOR THE RIGHT PRICE AND THE BLUE IS SUPER COOL	1
This is my very first guitar. Well, I've been playing for a while now but this guitar is great! It came with an extra set of strings, a bag, some picks, a cable, whammy bar, and an electronic tuner! The cable to the amp works great. I barely use the carrying case, but I can tell it's durable and well made. For the price I definitely recommend for any beginning guitarist, on a budget or not!	1
young mula bloods this guitar is the best for young bloods thank u geto mula bloods this is geto jj mula bloods out	1
Great product. The guitar sounds great, the tuner is indispensable for getting it right the first time. Great package deal!	1
Repeat customer and I purchased this guitar for a friend. The recipient of the guitar is very happy and is looking forward to learning how to play the guitar.	1
Met my expectations and will be a great beginner guitar. Big fan of the natural wood tone body! I plan to purchase another one for a friend.	1
This is an impressive guitar for the money. Maple neck, Solid body. Nice fret board. The paint quality was good. The fit and finish was also good. Sealed tuners at this price was a pleasant and happy surprise. This is the perfect guitar for a new, young player, but it is also an excellent second guitar. It plays well with a little setup time, and it comes with the tools to do that, both for the truss rod nut, if it needs it, and the bridge adjustment. You can not expect to get anything close to this anywhere else for the price.	1
Weather your new or old player, this Hohner set is an economical way to pick up 5 must have keys, and the carrying case give you room to add two more. I've added a Bb and F.  The case does not accommodate other brands at all. I've tried to swap out my Suzuki and Lee Oskar and they didn't fit.	1
I love these harps. Warm and rich, easy to bend, and the perfect amount of brightness. These are good for any type of playing and they work for any level of harp player. I bought them when I first started playing harp and they improved my sound ten-fold. They are the industry standard and the best choice for anyone who wants to start playing.	1
I have played "Bob Dylan Fake It" style harmonica on and off for 40+ years. After laying off for a number of years I decided to get back into playing and I knew I needed good but affordable harmonicas. The Hohner Special 20 fits that bill. I like these just as much as the Marine Band or Blues Harp, and they are more affordable. The case is quite handy as well, and even has room to add a couple more in some other keys.	1
...arrived, played......happy! Special 20's are  equal to,  or better than,  my Lee Oscar's.	1
Can't beat the pricing and these are my main keys that I use the most so I'm good. The case is a nice bonus.	1
Great set of harmonicas, especially for the price. If you need a few different keys, this is probably the most economical route. The Special 20's sound amazing and are easy to play and bend. They're good for beginners and advanced players, you really can't go wrong.	1
Does exactly what it is supposed to do....store my harmonicas.	1
Used to play harmonica "out" a lot; had a variety of harps, of which I preferred my Hohner "Pro Harps," most of which are lost, stolen, or strayed at this point.  I wanted to get back into playing harp regulary, playing for other folks, which meant I would be subject to weird keys. So I figured I'd get started with the 5-unit set and work my way out from there. MOSTLY I wanted consistency, and this was the least expensive set that all the reviews seemed to feel had that. I wish they had included an F harp instead of an E. But I bought an F, Bb and Eb at the same time so I'd be mostly covered.  My initial response is that the set IS consistent. It is as bendable as I need it to be, but has pretty good intonation, so it will do the job I need it for. That said, if I could have spent a few $$ more and got a "Pro harp" set instead, I would have. These are not QUITE as expressive. If I wind up playing out enough to need replacing any of these, I will probably replace them individually with the Pro Harps, but they are too expensive to buy a whole set at once.  One special note: My first F harp (way back when) was a Hohner Blues Harp, and I was disappointed with the tone from the start. I hadn't realized at the time that the thing was almost an octave higher than my G harps; with the flimsier reeds that they include to make bending easier, the poor thing just did not have the kind of gutsy tone I was expecting (and used to on my other harps). So when I needed to add an F harp to this set, there was no question about chintzing out on it. Again, an F Pro Harp may sound better, but the Special 20 F harp has a much fuller sound than the F Blues Harp, in case you wondered.  So, overall I'm very pleased, though I would have sprung for the difference if I could have got the Pro Harps in this sort of set. And I still would . . .  Paul Race - Creek Don't Rise	1
I snagged this deal from Amazon when they were at $106 the week before Christmas. The harps arrived just before New Years. I'm fairly obsessed with Special 20's these days, having come around from Marine Bands, and traveling through the gamut of harmonica brands and models.  A few things of note about this 5-pack:  1) These are, indeed, the new "Progressive" Special 20's, not NOS ones from before that change.  3) The case is pretty good, although it is a bit cheap, and made in China. The outer "clamshell" is quite rigid (although it is of a flexible canvas), but you can tell that lower quality materials were used for the padding and cutouts (probably cheap opencell foam for the one, and styrofoam for the other). It's all lined with a velvet-like material on the inside, however, and the harps do fit snugly. Not a bad "addon" for this purchase, but not really a main reason to buy this set. FYI, there is space for two additional harps in the case.  3) The harps are all gapped high for my taste, but the two lower harps (A and G) are gapped VERY widely. This is a non-issue if you know how to tweak your harps (which I do). The E and the C were the best two OOTB, but YMMV.  4) Yes, that E is in there, and it's a bit hard to know what to do with it. Two things, however: a) at $106, even if you never play the E, you are still getting a good deal for the four remaining harps. b) if you are handy, half an hour with a file and tuner, and you've got a high F. Still a "fringe" harp for me, but probably more useful than the E. Perhaps more useful still, break out the BluTak or the soldering iron, and you could take it down to an Eb. You could even experiment with an alternate tuning layout. Tuning this to "Easy third" would let you play across the whole harp in 12th position as if it were 2nd, which is the key of A major. Could come in pretty handy for country tunes and the like.  Some observations about, and thoughts on the new 'Progressive' Special 20 design:  first impressions are that they are not significantly different than the old Special 20's. The tone is clear and certainly darker than a Marine Band. On the better-gapped ones, the bends come easy, and can be sustained well with out squeals or unwanted overtones. The lower-keyed ones seem "breathy" to me, but I am fairly certain that's due to the wide gaps, and not due to being leaky.  Out of curiosity, I've just opened up the G harp, and am comparing it to an older Special 20 from my main set. Here's how they line up:  1) Covers: Other than what's stamped on them, the covers appear identical to the older version. Same profile, same placement of the screw holes (slightly forward of center), and same coverplate screws (slotted head with the little square nuts). The last is a bit of disappointment, as I was hoping that they would have upgraded the coverplate screws to at least those that are used on the MB deluxe.  2) Reedplates: The reedplates differ in that the new ones have two extra holes at each end, apparently for mounting on a different comb. The two additional holes seem to match the spacing of my MB deluxe. Otherwise, the screw hole patterns and other cutouts are identical to the older model Spec 20.  3) Reedplate screws: This seems like a bit of a negative. The new screws are thinner and have smaller heads. This could be bad, as the smaller heads would tend to put more focused pressure on the reedplate, which could warp the plate a bit if they are tightened too far. It also means that you won't be able to mix and match reedplates from the old Spec 20 line with the new ones. Here's the screw measurements (using calipers):  Old reedplate screw dimensions: Screw head diameter: 4mm Screw shaft diameter: 2mm Screw length: 10mm  New reedplate screw dimensions: Screw head diameter: 3.1mm Screw shaft diameter: 1.2mm Screw length: 10mm  4) Reeds: As I said, most of the reeds were gapped too wide for my preferences OOTB. The low harps were gapped especially wide. For example, it looks like the 1 draw reed on my new G harp is gapped approximate 2.5 the thickness of the reed tip. Reed dimensions appear identical to the old Spec 20's, and tuning marks seem comparable to the way they were done before. Looks to me like they were tuned with a hand file, and not a rotary tool or a draw-scraper. Reed tips have cross-hatched file marks, and only one reed was filed at the base. This was done diagonally, and over a very narrow swath. Tuning: a quick check with a tuner app on my phone suggests it's tuned to A=442 with the 4 blow dead on the money, the 1 blow a little flat, and the 7 blow a little sharp. The rest is definitely tuned to a compromise of some kind. For example, 2 draw comes up 15 cents flat, and 2 blow is 25 cents flat... Chords sound pretty smooth, and single notes are generally in okay tuning. Seems similar to the way the Special 20 has always been tuned.  5) Comb: Externally, the comb appears absolutely identical to the old Spec 20 comb. The only perceptible difference may be the color, which seems slightly "bluer" on the new harps than the old, but that could simply be a matter of age. Internally, it appears that the comb has some extra holes at each end. Perhaps to accommodate other cover plates (e.g., MB deluxe/crossover)? These seem not to have any effect on airtightness or ergonomics, however.  I spent about 15 minutes working on the G harp, doing basic gapping and shaping of how the reeds lay. That small work makes it play so much better than straight out of the box. The tone is rich, but clear. The draw bends are all smooth and very present. Chords are nice and full, and the tuning seems very accurate. The 6 overblow was there, and easy to get and sustain with minimal squeal, although I could not bend it up. Probably some embossing would help that. Couldn't get the 5 or 4 overblow to sustain, so those holes would need some work (although I tend not to use those OB's much). Blow bends were easy, and sounded good. Couldn't get the 10 half-step, however, which means I need to do some more adjustment on those reeds.  In general, I think these will all be very good harps once gapped to my playing style. The only reservation I have is the change to the reedplate screws, which I think could be a significant issue if overtightened. One should be very careful when reassembling these harps. The screws should be barely tightened, just so that they are not loose, and one should be very careful not to over-torque them. Probably, they should also be tightened slowly, one at a time, in a cross-pattern (like tightening the bolts on a care tire).	1
WARNING: These are Special 20 Progressives and not Special 20 Marine Bands as shown in the picture. These harmonicas are of much lower quality than the Special 20 Marine Bands and not recommended. Do yourself a favor and buy individual Special 20 Marine Bands instead of these inferior products.	-1
First, I was a guitar/bass player for years, but haven't played professionally since 1996, and have never played harmonica.  I really like this set of Special 20's; it's fairly easy to learn how to get a good tone from them.  However, I didn't scrutinize the contents closely enough when I received them.  Seven weeks later, I find that my set contained two 'D' units, instead of a 'D' and an 'E', along with the 'A', 'C', and 'G' units.  So.. I recommend the set, especially for a beginner (like me), but you'll want to examine the contents carefully as soon as you receive it.	1
The Hohner Special 20 harmonicas are legendary in their performance. My band (Black Valley Blues Band) uses these harmonicas exclusively and when we added another harmonica player, we needed to replace his harmonicas with the ones we use to keep a consistent sound. This is the best deal we have found anywhere on the internet to get the 5 most commonly used keys in one bundle. You're spending less than $150 for 5 harmonicas that would normally cost you about $40 each.  We had one small issue with our purchase: Two of the harmonicas were missing from the package... likely just a packaging mistake at the factory or something but Amazon quickly remedied the situation and sent us out a new set, this time containing all 5 harmonicas. To complete your set, you'd only need to buy 2 additional harmonicas that aren't included with this set, however, Hohner did leave room in the case to accommodate the last two. They aren't keys you'll really be using much so this set is perfect to get yourself started,  Don't start by buying the cheap harmonicas first because you'll learn to play on sub-par harmonicas and will need to adjust to the Special 20's at some point. Start with the best... these harps are made in Germany and are built to last.

Just received my set and they're all good.  Beginners need to know that one hole or another (usually the 2 hole will be hard to make sound right, mainly on the draw.  That's something you have to learn to overcome and make sound right.  That's doable.  It's a 'technical' thing and has nothing to do with the harmonica or manufacturer.  This is a really nice set right out of the box and they all have that very crisp harmonica sound that I like so much.  I have a Susuki Manji that comes close to the crispness but it's a tad bit mellower.  And my Hohner Golden Melody is mellower too.  But I love them all.  The case is very nice and protective too.  You can pick up the F and Bb to complete the set.  :)  My Suzuki Manji and Hohner Golden Melody fit fine in this case.  See what the others say to get much more comprehensive reviews.  About all I can say is I got what I paid for and think these are great little harmonicas that sound wonderful.	1
I've been playing 4 years now. Lee Oskars have been my choice of harmonica due to their durability and how great they sound. As a complete beginner, I wouldn't have been able to tell the tonal differences between a Special 20 and a Lee Oskar. They are subtle regardless.  After getting this set and giving each Special 20 a whirl, they have now become my harmonica of choice. Chords sound beautiful, the tone is great, bending is as easy as it is on a Lee Oskar, and overblows are performed much easier on the Special 20 than a LO. Don't get me wrong, if you choose a LO, you won't be disappointed either. I'll still be playing mine. They are incredible. In fact, just purchased a Low F LO and it's amazing. I just find that the Special 20 produces a slightly better sound than my LO counterparts.  The case is fine. Nothing special. It holds harmonicas.  Although, I get a weird taste after playing which, I believe, is caused by the fabric inside of the case being pressed against the comb. This is why I'm knocking it down a star.  Note:  I received 5 Special 20 harmonicas. they did not come in their separate hard cover case. They simply arrived in the zippered carrying case.  Also note, that the cover plates were not all the same. Some had the typical Hohner Special 20 marine Band cover plates, while a couple had the newer Hohner cover plates that say "Progressive" without the Marine Band name. I read that Hohner is rebranding their diatonic harmonica line. They are all still Hohner Special 20 harmonicas and all play great.  Just different cover plates. Slightly frustrating knowing someone just opened packages of Special 20 harmonicas and shoved them in the carrying case without a thought to uniformity - but this is a minor gripe.  Lastly, the price of this set was a steal. I couldn't pass it up. Practically received a free case and harmonica for what I paid on Amazon.  All in all a great purchase.	1
Best all-around harmonica for any reasonable money? I did a ridiculous amount of research on this before I bought. I looked at Lee Oskar Harmonicas, at the Suzuki, and other brands. Some guy named Ian Chadwick, for example, provides extensive coverage of his own experience with an amazing spectrum of brands and models within those [http://www.ianchadwick.com/essays/harmonicas.htm] which is worth checking out, as of course are the reviews you'll find here on Amazon. And yes, within Hohner there are other options besides the Special 20, the most notable perhaps being the Hohner Blues Harp. The difference between the Special 20 and the Blues Harp is mainly--so the story goes--in the comb, the part your mouth actually rests on and glides over. The Blues Harp is wood, the Special 20 plastic. Despite what you first might think, lots of players go for the plastic because it doesn't swell and warp with the large volume of--let's face it--spit that gets driven through a harp. I grew up playing cross-harp along with one of my best high school buddies as he strummed his guitar, and it's fun. Do check out the basic mapping from the key of the song to the so-called "2nd position" (aka cross-harp) key. For the likely songs you encounter in popular music, blues, etc, they seem to be as follows: KEY OF SONG / HARP KEY   E / A   F / B-flat   G / C   A / D   B / E   C / F   D / G This set gives you keys C, G, A, D, & E. There seems to be a consensus that if you buy F and B-flat you're pretty much set, though the Special 20 comes in 14 keys, maybe in case you want to play Mozart. These are so much better than the cheap Hohners I grew up playing, real musical instruments that produce sound effortlessly, bend notes with considerable expressiveness, and work very well on both the blow and the draw--if those are the right terms. I remember my cheap set being a trial for note-production on the draw notes. These are made in Germany, as printed on the harmonicas, and as stated on the Hohner website. Don't panic, the case of course is made in China, and that sticker is the first thing you see, of standard Case Logic type quality, but very nicely fitted for the harps plus space for a couple more, which in due course, for me, will be that F and that B-flat. Btw I also checked the price all over the 'verse (as they call it on Firefly), and every place has the same price, so you can just stop looking and get it here. Great way to enjoy playing music. I own a pretty complete set of tools for that job--nice Yamaha stage piano, Gibson Les Paul electric, Martin dreadnought acoustic, and recently a cool Yamaha electronic drum kit, which is the bee's knees, let me tell you. But this is the ultimate portable, entry-level musical instrument, very unpretentious, and honestly you can sound pretty passable on them soon enough that you won't toss them aside with a snarl of frustration. Also a great gift. But folks, don't play like Bob Dylan. I just bought the mono recordings box set of his first eight albums, and the guy, genius though he is, sounds like he's signaling ships at sea when he blasts that harp. I'm not the only one who seems to think his headache-inducing harmonica work renders many tracks unlistenable. Bobbie, think of the neighbors! I mean, am I missing something or is Mr. Robert Zimmerman truly bad at playing the harmonica? OK, you're a bard, but stick to the lute, will you?	1
Ordered these for a friend and he is pleased.	1
I have read many great reviews from amateur musicians and band members about  Hohner Special Twenty Harmonicas,and to have the perfect set of 5(minus the F) at this price was a great offer. I love the tone,the durability of the reeds,the full clear range of these fine instruments. I play these in two separate bands and they truly add great accompaniment to any instrument. At other music stores,they can be quite a cost but this set is fabulous. The case is very well made,lightweight,and very protective. Well padded nice material protects my well loved fine tuned harps. I highly recommend this fine set to anyone.	1
In&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Complete-Idiot-s-Guide-to-Playing-the-Harmonica-2nd-Edition/dp/1592574653/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing the Harmonica, 2nd Edition</a>&nbsp;the author describes what you should spend your money on.  About every third item or so should get an additional harmonica.  This case gives you a good start.  By having instruments ranging from G below middle C to E about, it allows one to play in most of the popular keys.  Be sure to spend some time on each instrument to break them in as the reeds are a bit tight when first coming out of the box.  The Special 20 harmonica is one of the most popular out there.  It has a very precise feel and a pure tone.  I am no expert, but it seems to be a very versatile instrument as I play everything from folk to blues with equal ease.  The case has a a few more slots open for you to add those 2 or 3 keys that were missed by this set.	1
Such a deal - $100 - for 5  of the most common harps and a case. $20 a piece and rated as the easiest hapr to bend in cross harp by JP Allen.	1
The only negative is that I would like it to include a Bflat and F harp.  Otherwise great harps in a decent case.	1
These work great. I'm very glad i made the purchase. These are my first set of harmonicas so I don't have much to compare them to. But so far they are very easy to play.	1
If you are a huge Megadeth fan this guitar is a BIG peace of art, the neck is very confortable and it isn't heavy as a les paul which makes it a great guitar for hours of practicing and playing. The pick ups have a strong output signal with a great Mustaine tone, and the deluxe hard case for this guitar brings a good protection for the instrument.	1
can as expected, when expected and I would recommend this product to friends and coworkers	1
So, like I said, its not bad but its not great. For the price i think its 5/5 stars. but I will rate this fairly and give my honest opinion. I bought this so I could have one and not have to worry about having to hook up a mic or anything to my 5 string banjo externally. I wasn't expecting to do any real live performances with it. But a few days ago, I did a song with my friends (I will wait, Mumfordnsons) for my school and I wasn't too impressed with the quality of he sound. I have a washburn B-14 and i love the natural tone of it. but unfortunately, this pickup kind of loses a litte bit of that natural tone. It doesnt sound great but its still not bad. as far as reliability goes, I haven't had a problem with it and i don't expect to because its fairly simple. For the price its great but over all i give it four starts just because the quality of the sound isn't quite what I expected, although I wasn't sure what to expect with this. Overall, I would recomend this to someone who maybe wants to do a gig or two and then not really do much after that, if you play like every week or maybe for your church, like I might be soon, you should invest in something better	1
A muddled, mess. For the cost, no surprise. Easy install. Might be better on a ukelele, or something. We must pay for sound. No way out.	-1
I have bought 3 of these pickup transducers and installed them in 3 different mandolins I own. Each mandolin is made by a different company. 2 of them are F-Mandolins and the 3rd is an A-Mandolin (oval sound hole). I love the different sound that comes from each instrument. That's because of the different wood and structure of each mandolin. But no matter what, the sound is always great through these pickup transducers. The only thing that I changed on each mandolin was to add in a volume control. I needed that for live shows so I didn't have to use a volume pedal. My tone is so good that I didn't need an onboard control for that at all... I highly recommend this product for mandolin. I have a Ukulele I am thinking of adding one of these on next...	1
I recently built a kit banjo from Backyard Music.  I wanted to amplify the banjo using a small battery powered amp. I read a couple of excellent reviews of this pickup transducer and it has met my expectations.  It is an excellent product at a very moderate price.  The installation is rather straight-forward.	1
Needed a pickup for a banjo. I had been using a lapel mic, which worked fine but was a hassle because of the battery and on/off switch. Got the Tyler Mountain transducer and couldn't be happier! Great product for the price. Powerful, and picks up the sound of my banjo clearly and with good tone. Easy to install, nice, well made with a good 1/4" jack.	1
This cheap transducer does work and has enough output to drive an amp. On my guitar, however, the sound is very thin and bright. With enough EQ it is acceptable. The mounting looks pretty flimsy and I doubt it will last for long. The instructions are pretty sketchy.	-1
For the price it is quite good, didn't need a preamp, and I like it.   Let's be clear, this won't let you play acoustic at 11 through a stack of Marshals, this won't drown out your heavy metal drummer just before they burst into flames, and it will pick up thumps and other vibrations on whatever it is stuck to.   What it does is allow you to run your acoustic instrument through an amp at a decent volume, without dropping a lot more money.	1
I read many reviews above before deciding to buy this one, it came in the hard plastic package, not just the transducer. Good packaging.  I spent about 10 mins to drill the hole on the side of my mandolin for the 1/4" jack. I got to start from the smallest bit to the correct size bit so the wood does not crack. It took me a few minutes to get the jack inside and thru the hole I just drill and a less than one minute to lock in the washer and the screw. First test with my amp is the sound is on the treble side so I move the transducer toward the bass string and now the sound become warmer. I got to say, this transducer is really HOT, it does not need any preamp circuit at all. I have to keep the volume low in my amp otherwise it's really LOUD. I am happy with this product, cheap, easy to install and works as advertized.  I have had some transducer for guitar that gave no sound at all, costing 3 times as much and I had to return them. But I do recommend this Tyler Mountain transducer for anyone who want to amplify their acoustic instruments at low cost.  Mounting trick: instead of putting the transducer on top of the sound board which look uggle due to the cable, I manage to put it under the sound board so both transducer and the small cable are invisible. No one knows my mandolin is now electric until I plug in the cable.  Update on Oct/19/2012: I bought another one to install in an old classical guitar. It does not sound good no matter where I put it. So, I tried again on another F-style acoustic mandolin I have, amazingly, it sounds really good, like an acoustic mandolin !!!,  thru my acoustic amp. No need to say, I went thru the normal routine to drill the hole, etc .... I can take this mandolin to perform in a crowd now.	1
This is a great little pickup for a small amount of cash. I installed it on my vintage Harmony with Aquila Nylgut strings. I mounted it on the underside lower half of the head. I did this so the tone wouldn't be so harsh. I drilled the hole in the side wall for the input jack and used a flushing bit to thin the side wall so there was enough thread exposed for the washer and nut. This pickup sends a very strong signal, I turn the midrange way down, consider a lower volume setting if you play hard. I hope the sticky tape lasts a long time. A differnt banjo head may give me a different tone and then maybe I would try the pickup directly under the bridge. The sound reproduction is very true. for such an affordable price and easy installation with the convience of a mounted 1/4" jack this is a great pickup.	1
This is the only transducer I have, so I don't know if this is normal to be this weak.  It's not very loud at all.  It works with one of my amps (with lots of feedback), but it doesn't work with another amp (vol and gain at max).  Oh, and it picks up everything.  I could record while talking into the guitar and it will record my voice, along with any guitar handling noise or clothes shuffling.  All these things might be normal for a transducer, but if it's just accepted as being the norm and not fixed I cannot give it a high rating.  I later found out why it doesn't work with my other amp.  My other amp is a KEYBOARD amp.  It must have something to do with the type of impedance or voltage coming into the input.  Make sure to use a GUITAR amp with this product.	-1
Came home in a couple days, I mounted it internally in my cheap knockaround Mandolin and the sound quality is great. I even had some fun with it before hand, put it on a snare drum and ran it through some delay effects and it sounded incredible, put it on a djembe and on a harmonica and it still sounded good. I can see me buying a few more of these. As someone else said the instructions are poor, but if you know what your doing its ok. I would not recommend mounting it on the outside of an instrument, the pickup is so strong it even picks up on the wire so if you brush it with your sleeve or anything it will sound bad. I set it on my mandolin by carefully picking a spot and drilled with a 5/16 wood bit, then I reached in holding the jack and wire with one finger and held it near the hole and I guided from outside with a fine handle of a small paintbrush then pushed through, put the washer and nut on outside and tighten hard. Then I placed the transducer inside the bottom curl of the mandolin cutout hole and pressed hard up inside. Switched on amp and plucked and it sounded great. I am playin it on a Line8 Spider II with effects and it is so much fun!!	1
A few months back I impulse bought my Kala Archtop and have no regrets! My friend comes over for jam sessions and sometimes my playing can get lost when he goes electric guitar on me. I coupled this with a Behringer Amp that i picked up off of Amazon as well. Not only does this uke hold it's own, but it also can really bring a new dimension to jam sessions!  I find myself strumming on it and keeping it acoustic a lot of times as well. Beautifully designed, it has such a cool clean look to it. When I held both the black and the tobacco burst I was leaning more towards the black. However, it seemed to get smudged so much more and in the end I went with the tobacco burst. The one drawback (the only drawback I see) is that people mistake it for a mandolin. But you can't control what people will believe.  I've been playing it with Aquila strings and it really does compliment the sound. It's nice and smooth to play and when I plug it in to the amp it gives it that much more oomf. I like the silver geared tuners, it really does look slick next to the black headstock. The abalone inlays and the purfling accent the edges and the f-holes pull off the whole Jazz uke look.  No regrets, love it a lot!	1
Truely great device and very thought out in terms of usablity. Like that unlike other multi-effect models it doesn't noticably pop when switching between settings.	1
One of the screens didn't work, customer service good about the return. But IMO 75% of the sounds were unusable. Back to dedicated pedals.	-1
The quality of the effects is good, maybe the distortions just ok. The easy of use is very good, i love the stomp switches and the immediate access to the controls. The scene approach is also good. The build quality is good too.  Definitely i'm happy with it.	1
GOOD: Great sounding effects for the most part.  No more tap-dancing.  MIDI control of amp channel switching is a definite plus.  BAD: Sorry folks but if you think this doesn't change your tone then get down at ear level with your speaker/cabinet and listen close, then completely pull it out of the chain and go direct and listen close.  You can hear the digital conversion.  It's a slight fizzy sound.  Recording-wise you may not notice as we all listen in digital nowadays anyway.  And maybe you wouldn't hear it with a loud rock band either but on your own or in your sound guy's ears, it WILL change your tone in a slightly unpleasant way.  For Line 6 to label this as "true bypass" is almost a marketing gimmick.  Yes, with all the pedals off and the global settings in "true bypass" your tone will be unaffected (with the M13 in front of amp only).  However, soon as you activate any effect/pedal the unit routes all signal to digital conversion.  If you use the four cable method like I do then you can't switch off the true bypass at all and are now 100% digital conversion (due to no true bypass in effects loop of M13).  Returned.	-1
Ok - I also have an expression pedal and separate volume pedal. With 12 scene modes and 12 stomp boxes within each scene, I can't think of a time when I will need anything else. The tube drive is a perfect low/mid gain drive. Add some compression and reverb and that's one scene. For an ambient sound, the particle verb and octo verb with some delay added is perfect. The digital modeling is so close to individual stomp boxes that this is a no brainer once you consider the price and ease of use.	1
It's almost perfect... Unless I'm missing something, as far as I can tell you can not turn on, or more importantly, off a bunch of fx at once. So you're still left doing the pedal dance to get back to your clean signal. If anyone can tell me how to do that, I'll bump my review up to 5 stars, as this is an awesome machine, and well worth the $$. A lot of people will say "oh, that's too digital sounding" and to them I say, get off your analog/boutique high horse and realize that not everyone can spend that sort of cash, AND 80% of the average music listeners can't tell the difference anyhow. I myself have a solid collection of boutique stuff as well, but who wants to go do bar gigs with a board full of boutique pedals? Not this guy, that's for sure. This is a solid machine and you will not regret buying it.	1
I have been in the market for an upgrade to my Digitech RP 500 for about 8 months now. I came across the Line 6 M13 while looking for comparable products. I bought one  used for 300 bucks. Best. Money. Ever. Spent. (on music gear that is) - this dude produces awesome sounds and is super-easy to use. The array of effects is dizzying and offers the guitarist a virtually unlimited set of options to choose from to get the sound "just right." And the sounds in this box are amazing. The distortions (usually weak link in digital pedals) are great (even though I use the distortion from my Blackstar tube amp more often) the modulators, filters, compressors, reverbs and host of other effects, all tweakable by parameter with the turn of a knob - are amazing. This entire unit is amazing. I'd pay full price of 500 for this little baby and be happy about it. That I got it used for 300 was a steal. I'm thrilled. If you are looking for a solution to buying a bunch of pedals and figuring out how to properly chain them, etc... just buy one of these and be done with it. You'll get top notch quality tones from this unit - seriously, easily gig and recording worthy. It blows the Digitech RP 500 and 1000 right out of the water, I've used both side by side (and owned the 500 for 2 years - decent product) -- the M13 is easily the superior product to any in comparable price range. It makes me sound better as a guitarist and yeah I'll pay 500 bucks to sound better. Don't know many guitarist that *wouldn't* pay 500 bucks to improve their tone. This box gets you there. Can't recommend it enough.	1
Been playing for 35 years, semi-pro for a short time in the '80s, and have wasted more time/energy/money chasing tone and buying into the analog snobbery that is ubiquitous these days. Was woefully unsatisfied with my board full of boutique analog peddles, so tried this. All those pedals are OUTTA HERE!  I've had Line 6 gear before, and wasn't enthusiastic. The modeling amp was, yawn. Doing many things moderately well is not for me. The POD was, at least for me, a toy. Couldn't compare with pro level gear. The M13 however shows that Line 6 has turned the corner. The modulations are first rate. The delays are outstanding by any measure. Actually the equalizer is as good as my Boss unit, which was surprising. And the interface is exactly as it should be: analog stomp simple but digital powerful.  I've never been (or never will be) interested in amp models. They're just not even close to the real thing. Hence I run the M13 through the effects loop of my Marshall JVM 50 head, and it blends perfectly. That plus a modded Gibson LPC is my rig -- very happy now.	1
This is a great product, enough has been said by others about how awesome everything is.  People need to know about one little thing, it makes or breaks it for a lot of them. Though not for me. The dirt pedals can lack the dynamics found in stand-alone units- that from picking and interplay with your guitar's volume knob. If this is a big deal to you try one before you buy it. To me it is not a big deal, all the advantages outweigh this.  Get an expression pedal, it makes the m13 come alive. I have a patch that utilizes the pitch glide and a drive. Heel down the pitch glide is mix 0, effect 0. toe down the effect is +12 (1 octave up) and like 60% mix - also on toe down the drive reduces some treble to ensure the effect is not too harsh. Solo and enjoy..	1
As a guitarist for 10 years... I've played mass amounts of pedals and variations of pedalboards. Nothing comes close.. or even compares to this stompbox. It literally will make you feel like you just learned your first song all over again.. that tingling feeling when you amaze yourself! It'll make you sound like a rock god, a space station, a country boy... anything you want it to! And any genre!  Also... the looping ability on it is superb. You can loop with any of the effects on... then you can even overdub with different effects! I'm honestly blown away... I will never use another pedal board again.	1
I've used a Line 6 DL4 and a MM4 for years as key parts to my pedalboard. If you're looking at the M13 you're probably already familiar with many of line 6's effects modelers. They're versatile, functional, quality boxes that can take a beating on the road. Now imagine you get all the Line 6 effects you already love put into one compact yet equally rugged package. Now imagine this package is way more customizable than than your trusty DL4, MM4, etc ever was or ever will be. Imagine being able to backup your settings to your computer. Imagine this one package costing just a fraction of what it would cost to buy all the effects modelers separately. Imagine fewer doctor's bills because your pedalboard ways about 1/4 what it did before you got this thing. Finally, imagine all that real estate that just opened up on the stage for you to rock some showmanship because your board doesn't hog all the space.    When you use the M13 in conjunction with expression pedals it makes the thing even more functional and can take your creativity to a whole new level. I knew it would be cool, but I had no idea exactly how versatile the thing was. The more I started playing with it and customizing it the more brilliant I realized the design was. The item description (as well as this review) can not really do the thing justice. I would recommend playing with one at a guitar shop if you get a chance, or even look up some videos online. If you already own Line 6 effects like I do, then just buy it!  For really real, it's a good investment for gigging and recording guitarists. I wish I could give it six stars.	1
I own 4 sets of these MS16 powered speakers. To me, they sound better than their big brother the MS40. I use the MS16's for: Laptop, Notebook, CD and DVD players, and Keyboards. I will sometimes use these over my Phonic 740 set up to accompany my drumming practice. (Unless it's a Jam session, and then bigger is always better) If you are just looking for some small powered speakers for you room or a small space, look into the Eagle Tech ET-AR302-BK's at $20.00; the sound is great, and they are about 1/3 the size and cost of the MS16's. I would buy more MS16's if needed, but would not buy another MS40 set. The problem with speakers, is like any other piece of audio equipment; it's up to the individuals preference and ear. Oh, by the way, I just bought another EagleTech set just to have them on hand.	1
Im very upset with the product. this company should stick with making mixers. I owned 20$ pc speakers that sounded way better than these. if you know nothing about sound or your hearing is bad then gets these, other then that do yourself a favor and BUY THE MACKIE SPEAKERS... yeah the are a little more but its worth it trust me. ( i know alot about sound, i own my own karaoke business and been a musician for years ... sorry these just are not good,...	-1
These give the high end power that a studio with strong mid, low, and sub forces.	1
Using for studio monitors.  They work and sound great.  I have other Behringer products am always pleased with the quality and performance.	1
Great monitor speakers. A great improvement to the computers speakers we were using. The 1/4" plug on front is exactly what we needed.	1
great speakers for checking mixes	1
Might be okay as multipurpose speakers for the home user, but definitely sub-par as studio monitors. Default sound is all mid-range with little highs and no lows. If you turn up the bass enough to get anything close to flat eq they start to distort.  The dual input feature is nice.	-1
It works fine.	1
Very nice sounding little powered speakers I use them on my portable keyboards all the time...	1
ABSOLUTE S***. DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH THESE.	-1
It works great. I love the sound and it stores great.	1
I love it	1
NICE.. Wish had a little bit more of Low end feel. Super loud.. Does the job.	1
Good	1
Decent sound, Not much bass. Better with a sub, any sub. I like the multiple inputs.	1
Sound great. Super loud. Great quality. Cool features like multiple outputs and multiple inputs. Have turntables hooked up to RCA, mp3 player to Aux in, then still have 1/4 inch input for using them as monitors when recording or playing tunes.	1
Not a bad pair of powered speakers. The sound reproduction is decent but I wouldn't use them for any serious recording. We use them for personal monitors at the piano and organ in our church. They are loud enough for the musicians to follow the music director.	1
I had another set which broke because a cat pushed the power-supply speaker off the table.  I bought a replacement set.  I would recommend these to anyone who's looking for a good set of desktop monitor speakers.  They have an even better set, but they're too big for my desk.	1
very weak.. could not use for full music recording  16w did not handle low freq.	-1
Very nice monitor speakers. Rich sound	1
Amazing sound!	1
Very nice speakers for the price. It has great sound and I absolutely love the direct control knobs on the front.	1
I paired these speakers up with a Sound Blaster 5.1 sound card and they went together well.  The speakers have an amazing range. I get the nice thumping bass and crisp highs for my punk rock, and with the program that came with the sound card, it gets even better.  As far as quality goes, you can't expect too much from a set of <$100 monitors but these are outstanding. The speakers themselves are a little weak and will get distorted very easily of you crack up the volume. There's also a lot of white noise when the speakers are on standby so I always have to turn them off even if I'm going to be away for a short period of time.  I don't care much for the EQ on the speaker itself because there isn't much to control. The Bass knob is the only one you need and that's to give it that kick.  But anyways, for the price, these moniters can't be beat. Great for home recording, gaming, movies, and just listening to some music.	1
Nice and fast deliver	1
poor sound, distorts before I even went halfway. my expectations were higher when i was reading other reviews. this was returned. i currently own the m-audio av 40 which is awesome but a little pricier.	-1
Excellent speakers for the price! Way better thank any PC speakers. Not much bass response, but no surprise there. Excellent stereo imaging! Best paired with a subwoofer. A bit tinny but for the money, they are awesome!	1
I have bought Behringer products before and have yet to be disappointed.  I bought these strictly as my PC monitor speakers and they sound great for most of what I want just out of my computer.  I had an extra powered subwoofer and found I didn't bother hooking it up as these have a good clean bass response on their own.  I don't push them very hard as I loop back through my mixer board and amps for more serious levels.	1
These are actually pretty good. if you already have a decent set of monitors to begin with and your looking for something on the lower end of the spectrum to check your mixes on that's even better. These are GREAT for that!!! They're small lightweight and delivered a clean/crisp sound. what more can you ask for on an $80 budget? plus they work perfectly with my behringer MiniMon800 monitor station. Be advised that they feature RCA outputs so be prepared with an adapter if you need one. hope this helps;^)	1
These speakers sound great for the price. We use them with our TV and also with an mp3 player. They provide solid base and are plenty loud enough for the 320 square foot room we use them in.	1
Sound quality is very good for the price I paid  .Very light and I have been using it and I don't see any problem with the equipment. Over all I do like Behringers sound's  equipment's. I also use speaker , recording mixer and pa system of this brand.	1
I scoured the internet a while back looking for some inexpensive powered monitors, with excellent reviews, and came across the MS 16's. I was looking for something cheap, compact, and portable for a large bedroom that could produce rich quality sound without breaking the bank. I've attached these speakers to a PC, a portable DVD player, a multi-track recorder, and to a tiny MP3 player with excellent results. The audio is accurate, crystal clear, and high resolution. They are Behringer's entry level media/computer/monitor speakers and of course dirt cheap! The MS16 system is a true bargain.  Like a lot of Behringer's products they are from a proven idea (borrowed) from another famous manufacturer and therefore deliver maximum bang for the buck. These are near identical copies of Roland MA-8's (now discontinued) and have 16 watts RMS total power output. The clarity & bass response on these small speakers is remarkable, they can easily fill a large room with pleasing sound.  If you are a "bass freak"...you'll have to find a way to attach a subwoofer.  Another great feature of the MS 16 is a front input with a 1/4" jack. You can plug a dynamic microphone or an electric guitar into the speaker, it doubles as a PA system and a guitar amp! Connections are very simple - RCA inputs. There are also volume, bass, & treble controls on the front. Since these are studio monitors, the tone controls are really handy to warm things up a bit for some casual music listening... Although I have much better and more expensive studio monitors, I wouldn't hesitate to do a little music mixing with them in a pinch, I'm sure that they'd be capable of doing an excellent job.  If you are looking for a great little pair of speakers to add to a bedroom TV, or maybe for a notebook PC or something, these are fantastic. You could easily pack these up & bring them over to a friend's house or a party too. They certainly blow away every computer speaker I've ever heard. Awesome and Recommended.	1
You can spend a lot more and get very little for it. I have done pro recording and sound design for several years and wanted to start up a little hobby set up during my retirement to use for local kids and schools. I was very surprised at the sound reproduction from these inexpensive reference monitors. I use 2 pair,  which is not necessary but it is fun, (That's what retirement is for) You can go through all the specs you want, bottom line is they're transparent. Great buy for monitors or book shelf speakers. Heck, they're cheap enough, use them for everyday computer speakers.....You're worth it!	1
I purchased these speakers to allow me to better hear my Boss EBand machine for guitar.  At loud volumes, it will be a little off due to the size.  However, I reduced the bass, increased the treble, set half volume, and used the volume from my machine.  The results have been excellent.  Really nice sound.  I could not be happier for the cost. Highly recommend. Would buy again. I have owned a decent number of Behringer products and have never found anything but quality.	1
But not as clear as some studio monitors - BUT - I work in a noisy music center and am competing with music teaching rooms in a hallway where it can get seriously noisy. Also - I need monitors with grills over the cones to prevent damage like my old ones got at the music school. These are beefy loud - and can get a little boomy - and blur fidelity, I run the bass slightly under half and the treble about 2:00 o'clock on the dial and when I need top listening i go to my fancy headphones to discern more detail in the sound. But these are sufficient for my student recordings - (keyboards, guitar, bass et al)	1
We needed powered monitors for the light booth t our theater. These are impact, and included the cables we needed	1
I bought these to use in my home studio. I use them to listen to music and play along with the record (I am in a band and I use it to practice). The sound quality is crisp and clean. The bass was a bit lacking so I hooked up a subwoofer I took off an old pair of computer speakers and together the sound is perfect. I would recommend these speakers to anyone and they are still OK without the subwoofer, I am just a bit picky.	1
I got these to provide better monitor capabilities than the built in computer speaker and they solidly handle this capability. I own better, larger, and more expensive monitors and these don't compare with them, but they are a great value and with some informed tweaking, they can provide decent monitoring capabilities for content destined for the web.	1
I had high hopes for these given the reviews, but was underwhelmed with them (and I have the rattle in the left speaker. I got them used from Amazon Warehouse for $100 and they were in great shape, (re)packed well. It included the right power cord and a nice long RCA to RCA cable for connecting the right speaker to the left. It's nice that it's a standard RCA cable so you can upgrade to  a little nicer one and/or get a longer/shorter one.  How do they sound: first a disclaimer, EVERYONE is going to hear a speaker different. What is too 'hot' for some is 'live' for someone else. My credentials. I'm 50+ years old so I have had a lot of listening through all kinds of speakers and systems including very high end audio. I also used to do live sound so I know what live instruments sound like. While I have not done a lot of it I have done mix-downs in the studio listening to songs OVER and OVER through multiple speakers getting the mix right. I play acoustic guitar and work on electric guitars. This means nothing except I'm not an idiot when it comes to using speakers.  I'm not going to describe what they do well. I'm going to describe what I hear as deficiencies. Let me be blunt, mid-bass blows on these There is a nasty resonance somewhere around 200-500khs. If you like being able to hear the difference between the bass guitar and the kick drum these are not for you. They don't sound 'bad' but they lack 'something' and have a somewhat dead sound. acoustics guitar sounds good and they handle easy to handle music like folk/jazz pretty well.. The tweeter as hissy and over sibilant. So you will hear the 'sizzle' of the high hat but not the 'metal' part. The whole presentation is somewhat blurred  Can I clean them up with a bit of EQ, yeah, but they they still lack something. Also the tone controls are useless. The Q on the high shelving is too wide (how many frequencies it effects. So if you try to tame the hiss/sibilance (I'm talking about highs in the music having a hiss quality, not hiss coming from the speakers) you lose what little cymbal sound you were getting, vocals get buried/blurred. It's a similar situation on the bass control. There is no fine adjustment with the tone controls. (The resistor on the tone controls needs to be a smaller value)  For source: I used CD's through the optical connector on my computer (which bypasses the sound processing on the motherboard) to the MS20. I made sure that I went into the device manager for the optical ports to make it handle 24bit/192khz. I used winamp with a plugin to clean up the output by using less software signal processing and fundametally only use the processor). All this helped. So at least they respond well to cleaning up the signal chain. They also did a somewhat good job of 'sounding' better as I moved up in quality from 192kbps MP3's, to 320kbps, to FLAC material.  I also used a Droid Charge which has a Wolfson DAC which I have set to use anti-jitter, oversamping and bypass the analog volume/tone circuit. I used a combination of 192kbp ogg and 320mp3 going into the line in on the back of the Behringers.  So what do they do well. They do a good job of revealing acoustic signature and effects. You can make out reverb/echo/room acoustics/live performance. They do a nice job on acoustic guitar and other undemanding music, but not as good a job on electric guitar. (The guitar solo in Sweet Child O' Mine sounded terrible) Depending on the range female voices sound pretty good (Madonna on Erotica sounded good).  They sound a bit better further back. I'm at 2-3' and if I move back to more like 4-5 feet they sweeten up a bit. On the good side this means they do function better as near field monitors where you are not sitting with your head shoved up inside them like when sitting at a computer monitor. I think this is because the drivers are not particularly close together for a near field monitor.  They are not BAD sounding speakers. Depending on your wants/needs you may enjoy them. But I'll sum up with they sound like $150 speakers. In my opinion, these are not 'they sound really good for the money speakers'.  I do like some of the features like the front tone controls, the optical out, the 'extra' line in, and that is why I decided to try them for $100.  So I'm calling them 3 stars. Not good/not bad. But again I'm going to say, some might find these 'nice' sounding speakers. But I don't understand the gushing over them.  ==============================================  Update: (I cleaned up my review above a bit) I tilted them up a bit and that helped that helped the sound over all. But they have a couple of nasty resonant frequencies and they don't like higher volumes. My guess is they need more mass/less resonance in the cabinet (actually this would undoubtedly improve the sound). Mid-bass is still indistinct but at least I can hear that there is in fact a kick drum in the mix. Cymbals only have tsk tsk tsk, you don't hear the ring of the 'metal' of the cymbals. I still feel they have a somewhat 'dead' presentation. BUT to be fair, these are $150 speakers, which means they were made from <$75 in parts and for that you are going to lose the 'dynamics' that I find lacking in these. I'll also add that Behringer has in fact created something that is somewhat of a nearfield montior, instead of just 'speakers'. In light of all this I'm changing my rating to 4 stars. And instead of saying they sound like $150 dollar speakers I'm going to say you could do a lot worse for $150	1
I might be the lucky one who received a bad oddball. Unfortunately, I stopped considering Behringers all together after I experience this one. The speakers behaved drastically differently from the specification on the manual. This monitor did *not* give the advertised near-flat frequency responses. It had weird resonance in the case. High frequency was muddled. Lower range was over-amplified. It totally beats the purpose of monitor speakers. Naively, I believed that Behringer was lower-priced because it did not yet establish its brand name. It was not a good deal. It was waste of money.  I am actually writing this review few years after hoping to help other shoppers. I should have purchased a Mackie, which I guess is considered a different class for good reasons.  By the way, even my PC speaker (Harman Kardon) gave better responses than this.	-1
I have had these speakers for about 1 year or so and barely used them. They have been on my shelf for months not plugged in. I just tried to get them set up again with my home studio rig and noticed the non-powered speaker is now dead. I tried different cables and all of the usual troubleshooting procedures.  They never sounded worth a crap to begin with but I figured I could use them for listening back to scratch demos in my studio. Now they aren't even good for that. I would suggest spending more to get something more reliable and better sounding. Behringer stuff looks good but the quality is pretty sub-par from my experience. I have had some of their rack effects and they didn't do anything useful so I sold them. These speakers will now be trashed.	-1
I have had powered monitor speakers on my "someday" list for years.  I use headphones while I do my audio work, but I sometimes need to play my results for others.  I have my computer hooked into my component stereo for when I need to do that.  But I have always hoped to some day have a nice pair of powered computer monitors.  Of course I've used the cheap ones that sound, well, cheap.  So that's why I plug my computer at home into my stereo.  It wasn't until I got involved in video production that I found what I was looking for in the MS20 pair, which was part of a Mac workstation that had been assembled as the best possible solution with a practical budget in mind.  The CPU had to be high-end, and for running FCP, a powerful Mac was a given.  The people that put together the workstation decided to have powered computer monitors in the Mac alcoves, rather than the headphones that were supplied at the PC workstations in a row on an open counter.  I was skeptical, because price-wise, Behringer is not high-priced gear.  But quality-wise, I have always found their products quite competitive at any price.  It's as if the product development team at Behringer actually get out and use the gear they produce.  Imagine that!  But I digress.  If you are looking for high-end home theater sound, the MS20 may leave you wishing for more.  But if you are used to listening to your work on typical computer speakers, you are in for a pleasant surprise.  If you need to fill a cubicle-size room with good sound, get the MS20 and you're set.  If you need to fill a classroom or a lecture hall on a regular basis, you might need to spend more and get the MS40.  It all depends on your listening environment.  Most of the time I am on headphones when I do my editing.  I seldom need to play my work for more than a few people at a time.  My position in the video production team is usually audio.  At home, my MS20 monitors are used to give room sound to an audio production setup where I feed a keyboard into a multi-track digital recorder.  It's nice to hear what I have done before I import it into the computer for further editing.	1
Behringer makes good speakers, these are very linear for the size and well designed for good bass response.  I thought about dinging it one star just because they are a tad underpowered with 10W per speaker (20 total) but they have enough headroom for their size as pc speakers or digital mixer speakers that I did not.  SELDOM do I ever need 20W at my mixing workstation but it's nice to have headroom, which these do have.  It's just that they want so much more money (1.5x) for the 40W total / 20W per channel version of the same speaker.  They should drop the 10Wpch and just make the 20Wpch which would be an excellent product.  Still, getting this ability for less than a benjamin is a great pricepoint.  The advantages are that these work well with all digital systems - I am moving to all digital workflow now and these speakers take optical or coax directly to the speaker, which is a great benefit.  On the coax digital you can use a video distribution amplifier to make multiple coppies of a coax digital signal to feed several devices from one digital source.  I use 24 bit / 96 khz most of the time but the speakers are rated to 24 bit/ 192 khz and autorange the digital input, so things just work no matter what you are sending to the speakers.  If you are not all digital yet, they feature a full compliment of analog inputs so you can buy these today for your analog mixer and when you move to digital your speakers won't need to change.  For flexibility - 5 stars For value - 5 stars For audio output only - 4 stars For ease of connectivity - 5 stars  In summary - its a 5 star product at 99 bucks  In all honesty you don't need more than 10 watts at a mixing board - save the kilowatt amps for the house speaker systems - hopefully someday we will run optical cable to our house amplified speakers and connect them digitally from the mixer.  I would recommend you measure the power in watts you use at your workstation today and decide on the 20W total or 40w total version of this when going all digital.  That way you do not underbuy power.  Keep in mind that both designs have ample headroom on the amplifier.	1
Loud, Bass Booming, Treble Baking, The Speakers Are Worth The Money.  Even when it sounds low to me in my room my mom screams at me because she can hear them. The bass is awesome, likewise on the treble. I'm glad I have these, their a big help!	1
I purchased these because I develop iPhone software, which means that I have my phone next to the speakers all the time.  Having the phone next to the speakers means annoying buzzing sounds.  Since these have an optical in I thought that should solve the entire problem.  I have a set of Roland speakers which these are a clear ripoff of and they do not buzz at all.  The Behringer speakers have apparently no shielding at all in the left hand speaker which is connected to the right hand side by a distincly non-optical connection.  End result is I now get the annoying cell phone buzzing happening in one speaker.  Fit and finish of the speakers is sub par, the knobs on the front of the speakers are wobbly and cheap feeling.  There is a input for earphones in the front of the right hand speaker, but it is quarter inch instead of the now more common eighth of an inch.  The sound isn't bad though so that is a plus.  I would recommend getting the Roland versions of these since the Behringers are simply badly made versions of the Roland ones.	-1
Cord delivers good quality	1
good cable. no hum and cheap	1
love it !wow	1
it's an okay cable. Gets the job done. Pretty cheap feeling but it won't break anytime soon unless you really try.	1
Nice product at a good price.	1
I love it.	1
I wish there was an option with black female XLR connectors.	1
Works great.	1
A cable is a cable write ?Wrong this one is of good quality and you can count on it.	1
muy bueno	1
Good quality cables. They do what they're supposed to do.	1
What can you say about an XLR Microphone cable.  Functional at a good price.	1
I bought two of these for my recording studio and the work great with their nice durable metal construction	1
Great product	1
Great cable.	1
Just ok	1
works good. no noise	1
Does what it's supposed to do. Great cable!	1
Nice cable. Very happy. Fast ship great package.	1
I really don't like to leave bad reviews, but I also really don't like having to replace equipment. Less than 9 months later, this has stopped working properly. Won't stay connected to my keyboard, and when I jiggle it around, it causes a loud pop in my monitors, obviously. I could probably find some way to reinforce the connection with duct tape or whatever, but I'd rather just have a cable that fits properly and stays firm and solid. I never even moved this. Very light use, in my studio only.	-1
Worked good	1
Works great!	1
Great price for a pair of XLR cables. These get pretty light use so should last forever.	1
It's a little thinner than I would like, but it works just fine. There are other brands that are little thicker and I like them more.	1
For the price this 20' XLR cable is hard to beat. I had purchased a new CBI MLC 10' XLR cable from this same manufacturer which would not click-connect into my microphone. I was unsure if that was an issue with my new microphone or the new CBI 10" XLR cable. I decided to give this manufacturer a second try since the reviews were positive and the price is hard to beat, so I ordered the 20' version. This second, CBI 20' cable connects to my microphone perfectly, where as the CBI 10' cable did not. I wanted to send the 10' cable back but I missed the return window by 2 days. The 10' cable works fine, it just will not properly click-connect to my microphone.	1
I needed some back up XLR cables for a gig and these came in clutch! I had to wire up 6 speakers and had no issues with them.	1
Good quality cable	1
Excellent product!	1
Great service speedy delivery, good quality, thank you	1
Not bad...so far lol	1
been installed and work great	1
works like it should	1
Excellent quality, works perfect	1
These work good. I just wanted to have some spares for my DJing.	1
Works	1
Very happy with these cables. All work fine and are a good price. Not sure what else I can add, but Amazon wants more words. Did I mention they worked well and are a good value as pro audio equipment goes?	1
Cable seemed good quality but ended up having to return the mic I got it for so no longer had a needed for it and can't return it. Gave it to my friend who is in the recording industry.	1
Gets the job done.	1
Product arrived quickly and as described and works well. Would purchase from seller again.	1
Get 10 of these! You will need them because you can hook them up and use them about 3 times before they stop working. Cheap, cheap. You get what you pay for.	-1
Great price. Sturdy. Low noise. I'm using this for occasional home recording with a Zoom H4N Pro. For this application, it's perfect.	1
Worked fine, just what I needed. No problems.	1
just what I needed	1
Bought this to.replace the generic one that came with the Shure PGA 58......works well	1
Cables work perfectly and have used them at 4 gigs and have not had a problem,	1
Extra cable incase, another we had broke	1
Works great. I would recommend this cable.	1
satisfied	1
Have several of these and will buy more.  My cables don't get a lot of abuse.  Most are permanently installed.	1
Good product. Thanks.	1
Work very well	1
it's a good chord.	1
Can't beat the price	1
Very happy with all my purchases.	1
In all fairness, I have not used my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CBI-MLC20-Low-Z-XLR-Microphone-Cable-20-Foot/dp/B000VJJQUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CBI MLC20 Low Z XLR Microphone Cable, 20 Foot</a>&nbsp;in a significant manner.

I do not regret this purchase though, as I don't know when or if I will need to run my mic through a different setup.	1
These are great. I use them for recording music and I haven't experienced any problems with them so far. Appreciate the ziplock type bags they come with. Helps with cable management. Would greatly recommend.	1
faulty cable	-1
Good Product, works well.	1
Works like a charm!	1
great	1
Good sturdy cable.	1
Cables work fine for what I needed to use them for.	1
Work well, a little difficult to operate the button due to old hands. well made. Great value	1
Good quality construction that should hold up well in the long run. No issues noted during use so far.	1
Works as advertised. Not the sturdiest cables, but since mine are sitting in a room for recording, they won't get much wear and tear. However, I wouldn't recommend these for a gigging group or for someone who does live music.	1
I'm not a sound expert, but this seemed to work fine. We bought it for a portable bluetooth speaker we have, and it worked just fine. I wouldn't recommend for any serious recording or events, but for small stuff its great!	1
Sturdy cord	1
Ordered 2, then two more today.	1
I used these in 40' lengths to record a stage performance.  The camera was near the stage lights and I did get some interference in the audio.  Can't say it was the cables as any other cables might pick it up too.  4 stars for the small wire that's used.	1
Decent cable for decent price. good delivery.	1
Great buy	1
works great	1
Excellent cable!  A must have and the price is really reasonable.	1
High quality for the price point!	1
cable works perfect and perfect length.	1
Just what I wanted	1
breaks easily	-1
nice	1
Appear to be of good quality.  No hum or any bad transmission while in use.  I'd do it again!	1
I'm a semi-pro in the audio field, and these fit my need and budget.  But I can see they're definitely not the high-end quality you might want for high-end, frequent use pro setups.  For the average setup, they're fine.	1
Thanks!	1
Nice.	1
Great sounding cable! No buzz or issues. Lasted almost two years so far. Will buy again.	1
Great product shipped fast and with using them everyday with my band for over 3 months they work great !!	1
great price for what we needed	1
good stuff	1
love it very soft and easy to bend ,  not stiff ,  standard mic plug in ,	1
As good a cable as any.	1
Very Satisfied	1
Love the quality of the wire. Good seller and great product.	1
Inexpensive cable yet have not have a problem with them so far.	1
Great cable.	1
seems to be a good value	1
seems great for the money lets see if it holds up	1
great price	1
Genial	1
Good Gear Fast!	1
I had not problems with this product.	1
thanks! it's wonderful	1
This is an XLR cable alright.	1
Great	1
Good cable, no problems except for a small burr on the male end that keeps getting stuck in my phantom power supply.	1
the microphone is just what I expected.  It works great with my Fender acousasonic 90 amp.  I usually only play at small gatherings but do occasionally use the amp and mike at Churches and nursing homes.	1
Worked perfectly, plenty of length to ensure I have mobility.	1
Good price point	1
High quality XLR cable. I needed another cable for the field. This is very flexible, making wrapping a breeze. Very glad I got this particular cable.	1
Does the job.	1
Works very well.	1
Good cable, love the length	1
Works Great!	1
Does what it needs to do.	1
Not much to say but, nice heavy cables.	1
Was hesitant because of the price. Not now! It is great and the price is amazing.	1
Great	1
Excellent product , a great buy , will recommend to friends and family !	1
Nice cable!!!	1
Great price, and they work well too.	1
Works great and nice price. Super long cord too.	1
thank you	1
Us with a Blue Spark and a Behringer UPhoria UM2. Its just a 20ft cable, so it will work with just about anything. Cheapest Price i could find. Great for the Price.	1
It's an XLR. It works. All you can ask for.	1
ok	1
Excellent length for moving around! Highly recommend for all musicians!!	1
It's a microphone cable.  What more can I say?	1
Perfect cables.	1
good deal	1
Works Just great and long enough for my needs.	1
Works as expected. Extra long!	1
VERY GOOD	1
I purchased the CBI MLC20 Low Z XLR Microphone Cable, 20 Foot for a microphone setup to a mixer on a budget. The cable is long and works well. No significant hiss or noise compared to my more expensive cables. The connectors are firm and I have not disconnected then very much so can comment on how they will hold up to repeat manipulation. For five dollars a great buy for a functional cable PA and amateur recording use. Would buy again if I need another.	1
good	1
It is OK	1
works fine	1
Great cord for the price	1
It's a cable. It works.	1
Works great	1
Works on my mic no problem out the box. In fact untill I recieved this xlr to xlr I had to test my new mic with a xlr to 1/4 ts unbalanced.lol the unbalanced cord n sm58s had to be turned up more than double to get the same result..	1
Poor quality	-1
This cable is a great value.  It might not be the best professional cable out there, but for the price it would be very hard to beat.  I've used it for many gigs and when there's noise somewhere in the system it's never me or my new XLR cable.  Two thumbs up!	1
Good deal, work great.	1
Good cable.	1
These seem to be good quality well made cables.  I'm a more casual user so don't have them in extreme situations but have found them to do what they say. They allow me to use a heavier cable that provide a bit more shielding than the narrow 3.5 mm extension cables I'd been using before. I used a Rode XLR adapter for my mic with that output and connected it to my XLR mics to route to my TACAM digital recorder.	1
good stuff	1
Very good product!	1
This might not be the highest quality cable ever made, but for the price you really can't beat it.	1
Good cable.  Nice price, and I would buy the product again.	1
Hubby's musician friend thinks it's great!	1
Works with no problems!	1
works fine -good deal !	1
Very happy . Sometime you get more than you pay for	1
I've used this XLR mic cable for my multiple mics several times. The cable and XLR connectors are good quality and should last for many years of use. No noticeable degradation in audio quality with this 20 foot cable. I highly recommend this mic cable.	1
Cable is amply long, connects solidly, and doesn't introduce unreasonable noise. No problems here!	1
A+	1
Good product. No complaints	1
Great product	1
good product	1
Feel pretty cheap but you can't go wrong for the price. None of them have crapped out on me yet.	1
as advertised, great price, great shipping	1
Works well!  For a cable not much more can be said.  Good price as well.  Use it on multiple mics that I own.	1
Works fine. Does the job at a great add-on price! No longer buying $15 plus XLRs from the music stores. Purchased 4 originally. Came back for 2 more. I'll be buying more to have extras for gigs.	1
Surprisingly good for the price. Would not recommend for pro use, I've had a few go bad over the years, so I keep lots of spares. But I've have expensive cables go bad also.	1
It's a cable and it works. The quality of the cable feels solid, even after repeated plug and unplugs. The ends are not too stiff but are also not loose. The releases feel good. The cable feels like it'll be best for situations where it won't get moved too much though - I'd look for something a little thicker if it's gonna be in a place where it may get stepped on. For a cheap mic cable this does the trick.	1
good	1
As always, this cable is inexpensive but does a great job. own many of these.	1
Worked well	1
great cable! so far, no hums or hisses. Not the most heavy duty, but what do you expect for the money?!  EDIT: after only one use, and a few months of sitting around, it has developed a hum. Very disappointed!	-1
Very good	1
Works fine, I've been using these for at least a few months with no issues	1
good for the price , and arrive on time .	1
Inexpensive and they do the job well. They should last a while, as long as you take proper care of them.	1
cheap and awesome	1
Works fine.	1
As described. Thank you.	1
For a cheap XLR cable it works great. The design puts a lot of tension on the cord, which can be problematic depending on how and where it's setup for how long. Other than that, its a XLR cable that works like a XLR cable.	1
Good Mic Wire For a very good price	1
It seems like a good cable, well assembled. arrived in good packaging.	1
I would tell many friends about this	1
For the add on price it is a great product . Would recommend this product . Very well built	1
Great quality!	1
Great cable and you can't beat the price !	1
So far it seems to work, though the quality of the rubber is not the best. But it was $5.	1
Great product	1
A good quality cable with extra length to use with musical instruments and microphones. Easy to connect with quality parts. Appears very durable and able to withstand even the most chaotic musical hall. Not much else to say, other than if you need a great microphone cable at a reasonable price, definitely check out this one. I don't think you will be disappointed.	1
Great quality !	1
It a basic cable for your microphone why reviews this. If it works it works, it does the job.	1
Served its purpose. Bought it to use with my Roland monitor speaker for a birthday party PA.	1
So far so good.	1
Surprisingly high quality for a very low price. 5/5 will purchase again when I need to expand my setup.	1
Works great!  I love the price!	1
It's a mic cable.  Nothing wrong with it, nothing great about it.  Fair price.	1
sounds clean so far, no labeling looks nice and sleek. feels heavy duty enough, no kinks in the cable. 5 bucks each?! crazy good deal. we'll see if it stands the test of time.	1
So far so good. Sturdy product. Only time will tell. Thanks.	1
Junk	-1
It's a cable. And it works as intended. Nuff said.	1
Cant go wrong for this price, bought 3, all work fine with no issues.	1
Good quality works as advertised	1
Does what its supposed to.	1
I can't believe I found a decent quality cable for such a RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME PRICE!!! Would recommend this to anyone.	1
Nicely made, works well.	1
Real flexable, and so far reliable.  Good value.	1
Great cables--fair price.	1
Fast shipping, works great, Quality is great, Thanks A++	1
No problems. Worked perfectly	1
Very long and dosent seem to add any noise	1
work great no problems	1
Fantastic, well built cables with low noise at a price that is 1/5th that of my local music store. I will be buying from this supplier exclusively from here on out.	1
Item as described smooth transaction	1
works good	1
does what it's spozed to do.	1
As expected.	1
Great product for price.	1
thay are nice cables	1
Standard mic cables.  Work as expected.	1
I purchased this for home recording use as an add on item with a condenser Mic since the mic requires phantom power. I hooked it up to my Focusrite and was shocked to find NOTHING coming through. Junk, stay away.	-1
I've been buying these in bulk, expecting to use them for 30 days and return the bad ones until I had enough working ones for my purposes. So far, I haven't returned any of them. They all passed inspection with my cable tester upon arrival, and passed again after 4 weeks. I now have enough of these so that my bands uses one set in the studio and a separate set live, so we don't have to move any cables out of the studio for gigs. Thanks to the low cost, this was actually possible.  Update, May 2016: All 17 cables purchased are still in working condition. I do not treat these cables nicely, either. When setting up for gigs, I throw the wrapped cables across the stage to the general location of whatever mic it's meant to connect to. I let fans/friends help wrap up the cables at the end, some of whom have no stage experience. I'm amazed that these have held up so well.	1
Makes a popping sound on multiple microphones.	-1
My mic sounds super clean with this cable. I've not had any problems.	1
works fine	1
These mic cords have worked very well for me....Fixing to buy two more...No problems so far...	1
GOOD!!!	1
Good Cable works wonderfully	1
Good cable. As described.	1
its a cable, carries phantom power no problem,  does what it says. worth the cost.	1
they are fine they do what they are suppose to do	1
Thank you.	1
Product works as advertised	1
Works good	1
It's cords simple it's does the job	1
Standard XLR mic cables that work great. No problems or defects found.	1
Works well!	1
Great	1
Good quality	1
My third time buying, and will continue great prices & product	1
You cannot beat this price for twenty foot mic cables!  I have to think it was a bot pricing error....18 cents per foot. I can't buy one of the connectors locally for what this whole cable cost.....great deal!	1
works great	1
Very VERY long. , pretty good quality of cable and is doing a great job connecting to my phantom power supply and powering my mw-700 condenser mic	1
Bought this to connect my condenser microphone to my Scarlett Solo. Works perfectly.	1
good	1
They're cheap, they work, and with no noticeable distortion or hiss.  Those are the three qualities that make a good mic cable in my book!  I bought three and had no issues with any of them.	1
Charges real fast and strong i will buy again if needed	1
just what i wanted	1
The clip is stiff but it does what it is advertised to do.	1
love it	1
Great quality and great price.	1
Delivered on time and looks and works as described.  Great product!	1
Works and sounds good	1
Thank you	1
Very happy with these cables !	1
Excellent value and easy to use. Buy some to keep as extras. There is no substitute when you need another mic cable.	1
Good Product  works as expected	1
Excellent quality 20' mic cable.	1
Awesome quality, keep up the good work	1
Stopped working after a week and a half.  JUNK.	-1
Perfectly good mic cable at a good price.	1
This product was bought to be used with a condenser microphone and Phantom power supply.  Together they all work beautifully.	1
I got the blue!	1
Need good quality cables that weren't overpriced and I use these in a live performance band and no issues at all, great product!	1
Awesome product to use thanks	1
Works perfectly	1
AWESOME	1
Good Affordable Product	1
A good, solid cable - no complaints - a good deal for the pocket change!	1
great product no problems with item or seller, arrived as promised, works amazing compared to units twice the price	1
Perfect. I bought a few.	1
I have use them for recording drums and guitar amps in my home studio. My friends of been impressed with my recording's.  It's not super expensive professional studio quality, but I don't have the playing/recording/mixing talent to do that anyway. I have been happy with them and would buy them again if I needed.	1
good	1
Thanks.	1
Do Not waste uour $5 here unless your goal is to buy tthe most toxic smelling cabble at the cheapest price.  I was so dissappointed i put mine strait in the waste basket for the trashman rather than bother to return it. Dont make the same error.	-1
These cables are jacketed with an awful compound that offgases heavily.  In other words, they smell really bad.  As soon as I took them out of the bag my friend across the room commented on the smell and we had to open the window.  They worked, but I had to put them back in the plastic bag and move them into another room.  After I put the cables away my hands smelled like the cables and I felt the urge to wash them immediately.  I am not a squeamish person.  I can recognize when a problem is minor enough to ignore.  This smell can't be ignored.  Don't buy these.	-1
low quality	-1
One of the 4 wires I bought went out the same night of use. The second wire, doesn't lock onto microphone vut still works. I haven't even open the other two wires I bought. Price is great for the poor product I received.	-1
Again?	-1
Great product, quick delivery!	-1
Hmmmm	-1
Here's the thing about XLR cables. If they work, they work and you never notice them. If they don't work, they create more of an issue than you can dream. I purchased 2 CBI cables and received them within the appropriate time line and they were well packed. However, as you will see in the photos below, one of the cables was absolutely a terrible cable to send out. The connectors were covered in some sort of sticky mess and the Phillips screw was completely stripped out on of the connectors. Terrible terrible experience for me. I will attempt to return this cable and receive another from the company.	-1
when I got mine it didn't work so..	-1
cable didn't work.  wasn't good quality work making it.	-1
ok usable	-1
Microphone cable is build very cheaply. The cord is thin and fragile.  You are better off going to Guitar Center and actually seeing what you are buying.	-1
That product I received was not as advertised.  It was a male to male not a female to male and cost me time and money to make it work.	-1
Be careful; I have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. They were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. Seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.  Fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. I actually had two blow at one time, and thought my PA was shot. Thankfully, it was just these cables. NOT GOOD. Spend a little extra on another brand. These have been my favorite:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GLS-Audio-25ft-Cable-Cords/dp/B000RKL8R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords</a>	-1
Cheap cables, cheap connectors that fall out of jacks. Don't bother. Try GLS instead. Tempting for the price, but unless you use in fixed install, these won't last long.	-1
I have finally learned my lesson.  I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say "good for static applications" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.  But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work. A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.  So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple "does it work yes/no" is clearly not good enough, as i learned	-1
Not for stage use. Broke after 2nd use, a total of 6 hours. Save your money and buy something else.	-1
it's true, this kind of cables need lot of care if you want to use them for a long time, after y fourth day of use, a friend put his shoes over cables and with a little pulled of the mic, cable has disajusted, and stop working. i've had to open the cable and use my knife to cut cables and make it work again	-1
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables. don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES	-1
This guitar is a good buy for the money, but with the new wave budget Oscar Schmidts, you have to watch out. They come up horribly setup from the factory and if they don't go through a good dealer you're going to get problems that other reviewers have listed... bad setup, electronics don't work, etc. Unfortunately Oscar Schmidt was bought by the same company that also now owns the Washburn name (which also come terrible half the time nowadays... though they sell upper scale models they also sell budget Washburns at Target). You're welcome to read my "So you want to own an Oscar Schmidt Guitar?" review under product review guides. Amazon always deletes the link but it will come up under that name.	-1
I ordered this for my daughter as a back up. we finally opened it to get it ready and started tightening , the end part broke!	-1
My old bow was broken so I bought a couple of new bows. This one was super cheap and it definitely sounds like it. The only good thing I can say about it is that the sound it makes is really muffled compared to better bows so if I am practicing after 9 at night I will use this bow to stop the sound from piercing my whole house and annoying my family.	-1
It came with the hairs very loose and with no tension whatsoever. I didn't try to tighten it because most of the hair had already started to come out of it. I wanted to use this to play the musical saw, but there was no way that this bow would ever take that amount of strain. That being said, I never got to use it. Very cheaply constructed and not worth the money.	-1
You get what you pay for. Spend $20 or $25. The hair sucks on this thing. The curve is also uneven. It's brazilwood so it is light and flexes well but it has too many drawbacks to recommend. AVOID THIS BOW.	-1
The amp works good enough for a beginning guitarist but is has loud static and isn't really loud enough to play with more than one other person.	-1
My guitar Amplifier doesn't working... After 2 days work, it doesn't working any more, something went wrong system burned. I'm very disappointing!!!!!! I can't find the master who can make my amplifier, don't know what to say... very very disappointed!!!!!!!!!! I was waiting this purchase as something very important for me and now I'm killed.	-1
These are great for practice if you don't mind going through about a stick or two an hour, also, I had 3-4 sticks loose their plastic tips within about 10 minutes of playing with them. As they get even the slightest bit worn, they become flexible and very flimsy, making drums sound flat and feeling a bit like you're playing with jello sticks. I am a heavy player, but do not have this problem with any other brand of sticks I use. Most other sticks I use can be missing half their diameter from rim shots and still hold steady. Moreover, my other sticks will gradually start breaking and become unusable, giving me time to switch out to a fresh stick, whereas these seem to be fine on one hit and the next you're left holding a quarter of a stick because it literally just exploded. Not good, cannot recommend.	-1
WEAK, HORRIBLE STICKS......DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.. BROKE 90% OF THEM WITHIN TWO WEEKS	-1
STICK ARE NOT MATCHED.	-1
now lets see recived my first package of drum sticks with a empty box(large) and a invoice that says 12 pair drum sticks.

This is not a Yamaha stand. This is not a good all around universal type keyboard stand. Even when locked into position it wobbles with a keyboard on it. Very uncomfortable to play on. Pieces fall off easily. I can't think of anything really positive to say about this item. An overall huge disappointment.	-1
This is not for a yamaha and the bottom legs are unstable	-1
This came with the Yamaha keyboard so DUH! Why doesn't it fit??  There are indentations on keyboard and a place for a stand to attach but clearly NOT this stand.  Why would Yamaha include a stand that so obviously is not made for the keyboard??  And now I have to pay to ship it back but where?  to Amazon or to Yamaha?  What a waste!	-1
NO Truss rod, No Fret Markers,Nut and Bridge was junk, Finish was like it was done outside in a sandstorm,Only after replacing the nut,Bridge,strings,Filing the frets, Did it even sound like a guitar able for a student, If you think this is a good deal, Sorry to say it's NOT.	-1
was damaged when received	-1
Bent neck. Does not play.	-1
IT BROKE ON THE SHIPMENT:(	-1
I ordered this for my son for school. He's going into an acoustic guitar class. He didn't take care of his electric very well, so I didn't want to spend a lot on an acoustic guitar only to have him break it. I decided to go with this and wish I hadn't. It was packaged just as any other guitar would be. Box appeared in good shape, but when I pulled the guitar out of the box and the bag it was in, I noticed some damage on the fret board.  Needless to say, I'm not happy. It shouldn't affect playability, but I didn't buy scratch n' dent guitar, I purchased a new guitar. I know it's not expensive, but come on. Have a little pride in your work! The strings look and feel like they've been used. And not just used to string, but played on. If I got a previously used guitar that was marked new, I'm going to be upset.	-1
I was a bit disappointed when I received this guitar set.  The guitar itself has a very visible paint or glue drip.  Also, the description said it had an extra SET of stings, but there is only one included	-1
This guitar is definitely a starter one.  After practicing on it for four months, I've found that it does not give off a good sound.  The face of the guitar is peeling.  The guitar bag that came with it is cheap material and give no protection at all.  This was not a good buy.  I would not recommend this guitar for a beginner or anyone else.  Not worth the money.  What a waste because now I have to buy a better guitar!	-1
Sent it back, I understand that I am buying a cheap guitar but it was messed up when I bought it one of the cords couldn't be tuned because the thing wouldn't turn right and that was brand new out of the box. I felt bad because this was my daughters Christmas present and she couldn't even use it so I sent it back.	-1
Poor Quality of string	-1
Very disappointed. The guitar does not stay in tune at all.	-1
no good to setup	-1
I gave this guitar 1 star, I couldn't find half of star. Dislike it and the seller didn't live up to their work. No recommendation....I wouldn't waste the efforts to return it. Don't worth the trouble. You get the guitar right away you replace strings before playing just to adjust the strings. Nothing else came just a little tiny plastic bag with a pick and a tiny string. Total disappointment ....	-1
seemed cheaply made,  i sent it back.	-1
Get this product for a 10-yr-old learning guitar, but for no other reason. It plays sounds, but is not fun to play at all. It's a great price, but not a guitar you would want to play with for long.	-1
Fretboard is loose screws pulling out from body.  Not a bit happy, let's see how return goes.  Really not happy.	-1
I have never played guitar in my life so I was looking for something inexpensive to learn on, as a beginner. I gave it two stars because it IS a guitar, I like the black color and it comes with accessories. Delivery was also very fast.  Instructions were not included (I have no idea what a guitar tuner is or how to use it). As soon as I took the carrying bag out of the box, I noticed a problem with the zipper and the bag is really, really thin.  I inadvertently tapped the guitar on a wall as I was walking and it caused a crack in the thin wood...OMG.  And to top it all off, my daughter just popped a string.  This is a nightmare purchase for me and I wish I would have put my almost 40 bucks toward something of much better quality.  This guitar hasn't been in my house for an hour yet and already it's garbage.  UPDATE! I thought I'd give the guitar a chance and get the string replaced at a music store and they wouldn't touch it.  Simply because the bridge is not molded properly and if an attempt is made to replace the string, the bridge could pop off in someone's face.  They also told me that the guitar shouldn't have cracked when it bumped the wall. I ended up spending about $150 for something decent from the music store. The cheap products are not worth the headache and I plan on returning the guitar.  Beginner or not, I would not recommend this item to anyone.	-1
All that came with the guitar was Bag, Strap, Whisle.  Needs to be finish by hand or ship it back...  Stain as well inside the tuner pegs, with wood shaving.	-1
Never ever stayed in tune. cant even be classified as a beginners guitar. was of complete waste of money and time! DO NOT BUY!	-1
Unfortunately, it didn't fit my child. Didn't keep it for very long. The return was quick, and they had excellent communication and were easy to deal with. Great customer service.	-1
As everyone else has said ok starter, or dorm room guitar. Has some cosmetic flaws, needs real string ect... I bought 50 $19.95 guitars in 2009 all in original boxes, sized from 20" to 38". They were ALL junk, several had broken necks, one didn't even have the fretboard attached. But I lovingly repaired them and gave them all away except one I keep for myself and the one I put the fretboard back on, (it's still junk) basically bought this just to see what a $11.00 guitar would be like. It's actually $25.00 guitar as it cost more to ship it than it sold for. After I do my magic on it I plan on raffling it off to benefit the Arkansas Coalition of Disabled Musicians not for profit that I am the Director of.	-1
cannot be tuned correctly.  can only be tuned to itself, but not to other instruments.  not good to develop an ear by.  will mess up a beginner.	-1
it does not stay tuned at all, may take it to a music store to see if they can fix it.  Want kids to learn to play on it but afraid it won't stay tuned enough	-1
I ordered two of them.  One box was punched in some  but Not enough to damage the product.  Both have Big Gash on the top fret where they hung to Dry I assume.  Broken at the edges, and blotches of stuff all over the frets. Very poor Toy at the least.. Still waiting to see if they will take them back, photos sent to show proof to them. I want my money back for sure.	-1
the f fret is hard to hold and the rest of the things are alright there were no return slip	-1
When I received the guitar in the mail, I liked it a lot. However, I found it hared to tune, and use. In a couple of weeks the bridge broke. I was very disappointed. IO was reimbursed for the instrument, and I ordered a better more expensive one. I do not know if all of these guitars are like that, or if it was just a freak accident. I must say, it was beautiful to look at.	-1
I brought this guitar in Oct11 for reason that I was not sure how many days I will be in the US...so just thought of buying a cheap guitar to pass around time (I already have a full size semi-acoustic in my home country)...When i opened the pack I was surprised to see the quality and finish....I tuned it and started playing, the sound was not that bad...I was happy with it, but after some days the strings won't stay in tune even when tuned daily...that was a big Off...but i kept on tuning, but always it went off the tune...Also the action is too high and the fret board wood is rough....Then one day in Feb12 i found that the guitar had cracked at the finger board and main body joint....That was the end of a cheap guitar....Had the guiatr stayed in tune for many days, I would have recommended it to a fresher, for one to decide if he can pursue a guitar seriously...I am giving 2 stars in place of 1, just assuming that my piece was bad and some other guys migth be lucky to get a good piece....But, no guarantee about this product....Finally I bought $200 Ibanez elecrtic-acoustic pack on Father's day in Jun12...Thats a class guitar, a real quality at $200...	-1
I wanted a temporary guitar until I get back home and bring my original guitar, and this seemed to be good enough as a temporary solution.  But I was thoroughly disappointed by the low finish quality (messed up paint-job and scratches), and how rough the finger movement on the frets was. Moreover, the "Crescent" branding was absent, and after having tuned the strings I noticed the bridge had been raised a little, which raises the question how long it will hold. There aren't even any dots on the neck to assist you in finger placement, so the educational value of this is questionable.  I have since bought another guitar for $90, and the difference in quality is enough to encourage you to go ahead and start playing, instead of deterring you from it.  If you've ever held a decent guitar before, stay away from this as you won't even stand holding it. If it's just for a beginner learning guitar, I would still get something for around $80-90, since the sound and overall guitar quality has a big impact on a beginner's enthusiasm and desire to keep learning.	-1
I have never had such problems with guitar strings. I've been playing for about 15 years, and these are my least favorite I've ever bought. For starters, they don't stay in tune very well. I get some times strings need to be adjusted, but these are like every single day. Also, they don't hold up very well. I usually just strung along to country music, and I've flown thru these strings. They pop so easy with just a little bending, very disappointed.	-1
They are just rusty from the package	-1
I did not expect that the device runs on 120 -volt electricity Alas and non-transferable to a 220 -volt electricity	-1
I guess I know why the price is so low.  These are nasty strings with a poor feel and a cheap metallic twanging sound one would expect from a coffee can banjo than a quality bass instrument.  None of the rich thumping sound the instrument demands.  Highly disappointed at the poor quality of these strings, which are not worth even this price.  The second star is only because the strings sound slightly better through the amplifier (but jangle annoyingly to the player), and are priced well below competing brands, which are more expensive, but rarely better.	-1
The deadest strings I ever purchased. I thought they were defective so Dunlop sent me 2 free packs. Both packs were dead too. If you are use to high quality strings like DR, Rotosounds, or Blue Steels you will be disappointed with these.	-1
Well, I bought a EPI Les Paul 100 to start with.  New out of the box it had a discolord bridge. The Frets where not filed and sharp and the neck action was way to high.  However, it did sound really nice for the price.  Figuring these problems were due to the cheapness of the model, I decided to take the step up and buy the EPI LES PAUL STANDARD PLAIN TOP.  Surely any guitar with a great name like this and a price around 500 bucks should be perfect.  WRONG.  NEW AND OUT OF THE BOX...First of all I noticed that the Volume and Tone knobs were so far off the guitar body that they looked like 4 ufos trying to land.  I tryed to help them land by pushing down on them and realized that the whole assembly was bolted in on an angle, making the stems crooked.  So, when you turn the knobs they didn't even line up with the body one side would raise farther in the air than the other.  Ok, I really don't like to get shocks off from things when I use them either.  The pickups make exploding noises that are not feedback to make sure your awake even when you are not even strumming it. The D string is dead at the 3rd fret...And lastly so far when I plug my MONSTER guitar cord into the guitar, I do like to be able to unplug it again without a fight. The Guitar's finished looked like it had be resanded, there are specks of black dirt in the paint...and there is to much grain marks in the wood and not enough PAINT.  And of course theres a spot where the red paint has left a birthmark in the yellow part of the top.  THE ONLY GOOD POINT, IS GREAT NECK ACTION.  MY INSPECTOR FOR BOTH GUITARS WAS INSPECTOR NO. 1.  I hope this review is helpful to someone out there because I thought this was a quality product.  Your not buying the product obviously, you are buying just the name.  I did not purchase this from AMAZON for fear of Mail Damage.  But I should have because the damage is already done before the Guitar gets through the mail.  I have an IBANEZ ACCOUSTIC ELECTRIC and it is a quality product.  This thing will be going back I will be looking at IBANEZ ELECTRICS for a well finished product that will be more than worth the money.  Im done with wasting my time with EPIPHONE.	-1

Used it a couple times - just sits there under the table.  Can't get the right height, not very comfortable or sturdy.  I think I may shop for a stool or bench that is adjustabe and just have it adjusted to the right height.  Maybe that will work.  Unit works - just not the way I had hoped.	-1
Useless it doesn't work at all no signal	-1
Great item, but description is terribly wrong.  This is a LATCHING footswitch and not a momentary one.  If you check the Hosa website, the FSC-385 is a latching footswitch.  Unfortunately, all over the internet this is sold as a "momentary"....which is not true.  I tried to use this with my boss rc-3 looper and of course it will not function properly.  The price was great, so I most likely will end up soldering in some momentary switches myself and reuse the housing and 1/4" stereo jack.	-1
Real flimsy, not a road worthy piece. If this will sit on your studio desk and not get knocked around or bumped a lot, it's probably fine. Otherwise, it's a real piece of doot. The price reflects the low quality of the piece. I was however disappointed as Hosa usually produces quality gear. Not in this case. Also, I purchased this with the idea in mind that I would mod it to suit my Kemper. Well that didn't work at all. Still takes two clicks of each button to switch functions. Anyway, search for the "Johnson" foot switch in the same configuration. It is just a little more money and much better quality. This Hosa switch is a dooty.	-1
I have the same problem that another reviewer has. Sometimes I record and the sound is great, then for no reason, the sound is all noisy and garbled. When that happens, I have to restart FCP. I lose a lot of good takes and also lose time in a fast-paced production environment. This is not good. This is not acceptable.  I don't know if the problem is with the mic or with Apple...but I have the same problem on two different computers in both Final Cut Pro and Garage Band.  I cannot recommend this to other users of FCP or Garage Band.	-1
Couldn't get it to work.  By the time I figured it all out, it was too late to return.	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price.	-1
No, don't. Too noisy. I swapped tubes and it didn't help. Not worth the space on your pedalboard.	-1
Probably going to send it back. Put in a jj. Playing through an ampeg v4.  This thing even dimed on master still sucks volume, meaning your clean channel is waaaay louder, so it's kind of unusable as a "channel switch " for dirty.  Tone seems ok, a little thin sounding but ok. Tha major problem is the volume discrepancies. I didn't notice anyone else saying this, maybe it's defective? I wanted to use it as a dirty preamp since the v4 (non master volume) basically stays clean even when it's ear drum busting loud. I'm sure I could mess with the eq on the pedal and dime that too to get closer to unity but really that's a bad problem, the pedal should not cut the volume so much when I kick it on. I don't want to have to fiddle with guitar knobs on the fly to get volume close.  Cheap pedal, worth a shot but not for me.	-1
I'm trying to like this pedal because everybody else does but I don't.  It is just blah.  It doesn't do anything well.  On its low distortion setting it is still too distorted with the stock tube.  On its high distortion setting it lacks richness and overtones associated with a more heavily driven tube amp and its too fuzzy.  I swapped out the tube for a JJ 12 AX7 and that is better.  The JJ is lower output so it does better on the low gain setting, adding just a little grain to the sound.  On the higher gain setting the distortion is smoother.  If I keep it I'll run this tube in it.  Then I tried an EH 12AY7 which is a lower gain tube.  Surprisingly it is louder and buzzier than the JJ and stock tube. When I adjust the gain to 1 - 2 the pedal seems to drop out or fade when the guitar decays.  It is obvious the circuit isn't designed for this tube.  I don't recommend it.  I've run it straight into a delay and reverb to a mixer, and I've run it into the front end of my new Bugera G5 and I feel the same about the pedal with both configurations.  The distortion on the G5 is much better than this pedal.  I realize this is only $50 so relative to its price point I can see why people think it performs well.	-1
I bought the used one on amazon and it has a buzz and control knobs don't work sometimes.	-1
Too ratty sounding even with lower gain tube.	-1
This pedal leaves me wanting more.  It has a nice crunch to it, but notes die off quick - the sustain is abysmal.  I used it linked up with a tube-based boost pedal, which gave some ok sustain, but finally the Tube Monster from my pedal board.	-1
Hercules DS410B TravLite In-Bell Trumpet Stand  A trumpet player friend bought this stand and was so disappointed, he returned it.  The product is very light weight, but his Bach Stradivarius  trumpet with a #37 bell leaned several degrees when on this "Hercules" stand.  That  made it more likely to tip over with his trumpet on it.  There seems to be three reasons for this:  -  the yellow "bulb" that's supposed to hold the trumpet straight is too small to be snug in many trumpet bells; it didn't work for my Schilke S22 trumpet either.  - that bulb isn't sufficiently high to reach into a smaller diameter bell area.  - the stand is rather flimsy.  My advice is to get the 5-legged K&M stored-in-the-bell trumpet stand.  It's heavier than this one,  significantly stronger, will hold a trumpet vertically, and is much less likely to tip over  with you expensive instrument on it.	-1
After 3 years of use the top of the vertical post that the seat spindle slides into split about 1" down the tube. Now the seat wobbles excessively while I'm gigging. Not good for the old back.	-1
Kind of lightweight cheap and squeaky.	-1
Looking for my first drum chair I bought this based on reviews.  I found it to be too firm for my body type and went with a different brand with a softer cushioned seat and back attachment.	-1
Broke, unsurprisingly. I was in the market for a good multieffect and so I purchased this, partially because one could achieve almost ring mod zaniness at the higher settings. I used it several times and then it would not work anymore. Pedal was not that great when it worked and now it is a paperweight.	-1
I own over 30 stompboxes. By brand name, about a third are Electro Harmonix. By type, about a third are modulations (flanger, phaser, chorus, tremolo, etc.). In other words, I like stompboxes, Electro-Harmonix, and modulation effects. Electro-Harmonix advertises the Stereo Electric Mistress as a special flanger/chorus that can make the classic sounds of David Gilmour, Andy Summers, and so on. I am not convinced.  The first thing to know is that Electro-Harmonix currently makes three units with the "Electric Mistress" name on it:  (1) Deluxe Electric Mistress -- This is the analog flanger used by Gilmour, Summers, etc. Along with the A/DA and the MXR, it is one that gives classic flanger sounds. But these units are different! Compare by listening. For example, Van Halen used an MXR for "Unchained" vs. Deluxe Electric Mistress in "Message in a Bottle" or Heart's "Barracuda" for another flavor of the Mistress.) You get a set of classic sounds with each, but it is a large unit -- as most analog flangers are. (Look at the schematics and you will understand why analog flangers are so big.)  (2) Neo Mistress -- This is the smallest Mistress. I have only heard these on YouTube demos, so I cannot attest to their quality. I am pretty sure it is a digital pedal, and it does not have the same controls as the Deluxe.  (3) Stereo Electric Mistress -- This is a DIGITAL pedal (not analog) designed to make flanger and chorus effects in a medium-sized pedal.  HOW I TESTED IT: I have tried the Stereo Electric Mistress through two amps (1973 Silverface Fender Twin Reverb and Fender 22W Supersonic) with two guitars (1993 American Standard Strat w/lace sensor single coils & Blacktop HH Jaguar with Seymour Duncan SH-1 humbuckers). I have used YouTube demos made by Electro Harmonix as a guide to setting it, and I have about 20 of them written down. Plus I have experimented with my own settings.  RESULTS: When I first got the Stereo Electric Mistress, I removed two pedals to fit it on, including my beloved Electro Harmonix Neo-Clone chorus (because I thought the Stereo Electric Mistress would cover the chorus). After a week of working with it, I took it off and put the Neo Clone back on because the Stereo Electric Mistress's chorus does not sound as good. So that was a fail.  Recently, I have reorganized my pedalboard and opened up space so that I could have a chorus pedal in addition to the Stereo Electric Mistress. Because I am playing a lot of Police songs, I decided to give the Stereo Electric Mistress another chance. I am still not convinced.  To my ears, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a unique pedal -- and I have used it in spots for good effect. But If you are looking for the classic flanger sounds of the Deluxe Electric Mistress, you are not going to find it in the Stereo Electric Mistress. It is too dark and seems to suck tone as it cycles. If you want the classic Electric Mistress sounds, then you will need to get a Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. Since I want to be able to make sounds like Andy Summers did in the Police, I find this unit unacceptable. It simply does not work as advertised there, at least with the rigs I have tried. (To make Police sounds, I am using quality stompboxes: a Keeley compressor and a Line 6 DL4 delay, and the flanger is the only problem!)  If you are considering buying this unit, I recommend that you only do so if you can test it out (ideally with your rig -- at least bring your guitar and maybe a couple stompboxes like a distortion to the store and borrow an similar amp). Do not buy this based on descriptions or YouTube demos. The Stereo Electric Mistress is its own thing, and it may be what you are looking for. One place that it does excel is in the effects loop of an Electro-Harmonix Superego pedal, where it can really change the timbre and even enable pitch bends. But my complaint is that it does not do what the descriptions say it will.  BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a good modulation to make Police or Pink Floyd like sounds, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a fail and I recommend either an Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. I went with the Hartman because it takes up far less pedalboard real estate. If you have a SuperEgo, the Stereo Electric Mistress sounds great there.	-1
Although advertised to work just fine on Windows Vista, that is misleading to say the least.  It comes with two sets of software that the publishers finally admitted will not work on Vista.  They do insist that the keyboard itself will work on Vista, so if you can find and buy some other programs that will run on Vista, it might work.  No, they didn't know which software to recommend.  And the instructions on how to use the keyboard were on the non-working software, so even if you do, you would have to figure out on your own how to use it on the new software. I returned it for a refund and am waiting for repayment.	-1
I bought the Tele version from Saga. The G- and B-string tuner holes in the headstock were drilled too close together, making it impossible to fit the G tuner to the headstock and making it impossible to tune the G string accurately. Also, one wire was too short, so I had to supply my own. The distributor wouldn't correct the problem, told me to contact Saga. Saga never responded. The guitar is useless (wasting not only the money for the purchase but the cost of the paint, hours invested, etc). You don't want this product!	-1
Was great, now does not pick up the sound of the string & is useless. New battery no help either. Another disposable product I guess. Trying the Snark next.	-1
This product will only tune one of the strings. When I pluck the string it thinks each one is the 3rd C-string and tunes each one to C. I spent a lot of time tuning each string up and down trying to get the tuner to recognize it as a separate string, but no luck. It just keeps tuning everything to C.	-1

NECK The nut was missing. I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....  BODY The shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.  PICKUPS and ELECTRONICS The electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.  STRING AND BRIDGE The bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.  PICKGUARD I didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.  FINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION At the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender.... So if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford: - new pickups and electronics, - new bridge, - new strings, - good finishing and lacquer technique  My suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts. It will cost you more but it will be your real Custom Guitar....	-1
the bag is cheap. It provides no protection for the guitar. The only pocket on the case is a joke	-1
EDIT: I just used the bag for carrying my stratocaster (in my house, just trying the bag) and the joints from one of the straps broke. thankfully I was using both straps, otherwise my brand new guitar would have felt in the ground... thankfully I think I can fix it (sew it up). -down grading from 5 to 3 stars-  My original review, 20 min ago: "It's a nice bag, looks nice, feels right, you can carry it as a back pack... I bought it for 25, the only thing that could make it better is a cheper price XD"  ---------------------- EDIT 2: It looks nice, but after travelling with it (wich implies I was carrying it as a backpack) BOTH straps started to get un-sewn from BOTH ends, so for avoiding and ugly accident to my strat I carry it with the side handle  -downgrading to 2 stars-  The padding is EXCELLENT though I'm keeping it, but please if you're buying it, be sure to look at the straps joints so your beautiful axe doesnt get hurt if they broke	-1
I used it to hook a Korg tuner to an upright bass bridge.  I did not need what felt like a 150 ft cord.  I've gone through 2 of these and they've broken.  I use a clip on tuner now.	-1
This will not hold a book with weight. I sinks right down on it's own.	-1
I don't normally write reviews but this thing is garbage!  This is my second set of these two different brands and I'll never buy this  style again!  Plastic into metal? I had to screw some bolts for extra support because the ends kept slipping out, really annoying.  Spend the extra money on a better quality stand, trust me.	-1
This is a great light stand I rated it to stars because there were parts missing when I received it I had to do a lot of running around to find part because I needed the light stand for a big gig the next day	-1
First I received it broken but I fixed it because i needed it . And when i put my lights on it , it broke in 2 different places. It is made really cheap and it is really thin. It is not a durable or dependent stand.	-1
Product was not as advertised. When I received it and opened the stand it was clear that it was used. Had many wear and tear and chips on the paint. My only regret was not having opened this package sooner so I could return it. Do not recommend this stand.	-1
Received Open & Damaged Item.   I want to return this Item.	-1
Are too thin to load lights and not steady. I have 2 Speaker Stands and you will see the difference on the pictures. I had to return immediately. Are not safe. Package arrive with damage also.	-1
Cheap and broke easily.	-1
This is not a professional (normal/ standard size) light stand. the poles are thinner, smaller. It has little crank handles, little non traditional parts that would easily get lost if you had to use this for any reoccurring or professional use. something you would expect to buy at Spencer gifts or a novelty shop.... if there was something advertized by Ronco like: "Band in a box: for $499.99 you get a drum set, a guitar, a bass, a microphone, AND A LIGHT STAND" all included... This would be the light stand you would expect to get. nothing wrong with it, (it did work) but its more or less a toy.	-1
As soon as I opened the box and saw it I knew it was cheaply made and not sturdy at all. Ended up buying the Odyssey brand instead.	-1
I had to spend 25 dollars to modify this to fit the equipment I bought it for. The stand tubes were too narrow and when I received mine, it was broke. I was able to make it work after modification, but who likes to "modify" something they just bought when they believed it would work in the first place. Wish the stand was taller as well.	-1
These stand need to be made a little thicker because they bend when they are put up to the top of the limit. From the second tear down they seem to be OK but after that they bend.  The poles need to bigger in diameter.	-1
Got an Orofon Red with my new Debut turntable.  After some 40 hours of break in, it still gets overwhelmed by the highs in Jeff Buckley's "Grace".  It also has this odd tendency to increase the noise floor in between tunes.  If your system is low fi you won't notice, but through a sub and 5 speakers you will.  Truthfully, it's substantially better than an entry level MM.  But still an entry level MM nonetheless If you're looking for audiophile quality out of the box, you need to spend another $100 and get an MC cartridge so you can get all the detail and richness you would otherwise miss from listening to a cd.  Make sure you change your platter to vinyl if you're going to do that because MC cartridges won't work with a metal platter.	-1
I put this plate on my MIM Precision Bass and when tightened down the entire plate warped and cracked the finish around all four mounting holes. Honestly feel as if Fender should pay for the paint touch-up since the plate came with no warning that actually installing it would ruin your guitar's finish. Really Fender? Really?	-1
Bad quality,	-1
Don't waste your money. It's too thin and the holes are not countersunk. The hole pattern doesn't line up to any Squier if that's what you're considering.	-1
very nice	-1
The plate is thin, much thinner than the original, the screw holes do not have counter sinks so the ship screws with smaller heads tho give the impression of a counter sunk screws. it's a replacement of a MIM Strat, not USA Strats, the original is far thicker with counter sink screw holes but its plane. cosmetically the F logo looks good, functionally? not sure.	-1
Horribly disappointed that this is optional.	-1
It's insulting that their keyboards don't come with these.	-1
The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yamaha-PA150MM-Keyboard-AC-Power-Adapter/dp/B000WS3GRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yamaha PA150MM Keyboard AC Power Adapter</a>&nbsp;sold by Amazon (as opposed to a vendor partner) is not a Yamaha part at all.  The transformer is the one pictured, but there is no picture of the label that would make clear that this is a generic product.  Having noted this, I must admit that the transformer apparently works with my keyboard.  However, the cord on the adapter is no longer than two feet.  It is so short that the adapter cannot lie flat on the floor from a keyboard stand at seated height!  Fortunately, I have an outlet near the keyboard close enough for the adapter to reach, and since the keyboard is stationary against the wall, I am not concerned.  This is one of the first times that I have been disappointed with the misrepresentation of an Amazon-storefront product.	-1
The strap hole is way too small for any of my instruments, and the strap itself is very small. Also the color depicted for my version is a dark red, but it's more a bright Clifford the big red dog red. The strands are small enough to go under a classical head stock, which is appreciated. However, I'll need to buy another strap. This one is not dependable.	-1
Definitely good for the price, but the material seems a bit cheap. Mine also came a bit dirty with the "leather" part frayed. Does really affect the usage and it definitely a good strap for 5 dollars  Bit of an update, I've had to stop using the strap because it causes strain on my shoulder and back, really don't recommend this to anyone planning of regular using the strap, or with heavier guitars	-1
Piece of junk not even big enough for an acoustic, also texture is hard plastic.	-1
With no dimensions in the listing you are at risk on how it will fit your keyboard.  Much too big for most 61-76 key keyboards.	-1
What is the inside dimensions???? What is the inside dimensions???? What is the inside dimensions???? What is the inside dimensions???? We are tying to buy something based on size and fitting...	-1
I persevered with this keyboard for a couple of weeks but have decided that it is more trouble than it is worth and cannot be trusted for live use. Why?  1) It defaults to playing a piano sample. I know that this will be a disaster on stage at some point and I don't want to take that risk.  2) The 'piano' volume knob is hardwired to adjust all volume knobs in Apple Logic. I cannot figure out how to disable this and am not willing to invest the effort.  I had to read the entire manual to figure out how to disable the piano sample from playing. Only in the addendum did I find something related to disabling 'local' by hitting the edit key followed by the A# middle key. How ridiculous it is that:  a) the piano sample is on by default and b) there isn't a simple switch to enable/disable it c) every time you power cycle the damn piano comes back  The headphone jacks behaved very oddly and weren't anywhere near loud enough to be useful. My lead singer could not record vocals because the max output level was way too low compared to his singing voice.  It doesn't have phantom power for the XLR input.  The keys aren't full size and feel spongy.  I needs to have at least some assignable pads / sliders / rotary knobs.  If you even slightly knock the 'piano volume' knob it will set every single channel strip volume in Logic. Apparently it is programmable but the manual doesn't explain how and this is nigh-impossible to figure out in Apple's Logic.  Coupled with that damn piano sample is just too dangerous for live play and very frustrating. The piano volume knob was the last straw so I'm returning it for a refund and will look for something else.	-1
Not impressed. You need to talk really close to the microphone to be heard. Save your money on this cheap one and get a better quality one. I'll be looking for new microphones for our karoake machine.	-1
bad solder joints inside.  poor frequency response on this microphone.	-1
bad solder joints inside.  poor frequency response on this microphone.	-1
Nothing but static... Won't pick up sound.  Waste of money.	-1
too bulky , not quite what i expected.	-1
Buy this mic if you hate your voice and do not want anyone to hear it, otherwise move on to a better mic	-1
The product basically fell apart in the first 5 minutes, we are returning it.	-1
cheaply built.  what can you expect for a microphone this cheap?  I still buy them because people cant take care of things so why buy something more expensive people will break anyways?	-1
The sound of this microphone is poor at best. Spend a few extra dollars and buy a real microphone even if it is a Behringer, Samson, or Pyle it will blow this piece of junk right into the trash. If you really want a good sound and a mic that will last you a lifetime buy a Shure SM58.	-1
I bought this to replace the Karaoke mic that came with my daughter's karaoke machine - and it stopped working just days after she got it.	-1
Please do not buy these.  Even though the batteries are still strong they stop working after a few uses.  I start drumming and 1 minute into the song one stick stops lighting up.  Then before the song is done the other just flashes with each tap and does not emit light for the few seconds it initially did.  I have purchased 2 sets of blue thinking it was a faulty set but I get the same results.  I also purchased red and green initially. They too suck.  One of the red ones just does not work at all.	-1
The light on these sticks don't last long.  After a few uses they just flash briefly.  The batteries are still good but the light is just brief.  The light on one stick might be visible for a few seconds after tapping but the other is just a flash.  Just save your money.	-1
Don't buy.  The lights on these are not consistent.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  Most of the time the light is only briefly visible, like a flash.	-1
Horrile broke within an hour couldnet find the baterrie or screw to return it.	-1
One of the sticks stopped working after 20 min.	-1
I bought the purple ones as well, which were fine. One of these came damaged...it was much less sensitive than the other. And then one day later, it completely failed.	-1
absolute garbage do not buy. Worked for about 30 seconds.	-1
These are a cute gimmick which will provide about 10 minutes of entertainment.  They weigh a ton and flex like crazy.	-1
I have owned a few different pairs of these sticks in the past.  I thought I would change it up by using the red ones.  The red light is so dim you can barely see the glow.  I am going to stick to the BLUE ones!!	-1
They hardly light up. Either batteries are dead or they are just terrible. They need to test them before they send them out.  I'm sending them back.	-1
Well my wife bought these for me for Xmas... At first I thought they were real drum sticks. They are NOT! They are the shape of sticks but, as others have put it they flex, vibrate really, really bad, you cannot just turn them on and off. But..... the worst is the sound. Cymbals sound awful and there is no noise from drum hits themselves. Great for kids to mess with in the dark. I don't really know what to do with them, give them to a kid I suppose. I do play tomorrow night for a New Years party. We do a slow song I think I will use them on it and maybe throw them into the crowd?  I think the manufacturer should say, toy sticks or something....  Mike	-1
From all the great reviews I expected this to be more solid and secure. I'm a longtime pro player, & I've used an off-brand metal stand on my gigs for over 30 years, and it's still just as solid and reliable today. This one however, doesn't want to hold my tenor very securely, as it feels loose, and can twist around in it's place. Also, when I reach to take it out, & pull towards me, often the entire sax part of it comes with, it rocks from front to back, which is really not good, and something I'd never seen in any other stand I've owned. Finally, when I've got my tenor, flute & soprano in it, it's very difficult taking my tenor out or placing it back in, without it knocking into my flute! Also, something I'd never seen before in a stand. It's nice that it folds up, but I only use it as a spare, it's too risky using it on a gig, as I don't trust it....	-1
Cheap toy from China. Flimsy twisted plastic hangar, handle that came was plastic tipped stick, not like the one shown. Dull tone. Rusts over time.	-1
It's a good quality strap but the metal clips destroyed the finish on my banjo rim. I didn't notice it until it was too late. I took it to the shop and they said I need to get a good rim job to fix my wood	-1
Yes, they do look good, but they do slip, and can be wild and slippery unless tamed: Poke a tiny hole through the underside of the loop and strap. Feed a twist-tie (or similar) through the holes, and secure. I 'fixed' three of these when I bought them several years ago. I have since switched to the non-adjustable type straps with several holes for the end-pin in lieu of a sliding adjustment.	-1
If getting this strap for a 5yr old then go for it, other wise it is way too small for 8yrs on up	-1
This strap is well-made and potentially comfortable, but at its longest length, shorter than many other straps I own. Disappointing but not worth returning.	-1
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people.  The strap is about 6" too short for my Seagull S6 guitar.  I will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short.  I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap.  I just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.  2/22/2013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and "short" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extendo for this strap. I don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place.  here's a link to the extendo option   LEVY'S LEATHERS MMGXL-2.5-BRN STRAP EXTENDER http://www.amazon.com/LEVYS-LEATHERS-MMGXL-2-5-BRN-STRAP-EXTENDER/dp/B00BH5N91E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1361565768&sr=8-2&keywords=MMGXL-2.5  the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.  This is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider. I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap. It's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other.  I will keep this strap but sure feel like I've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind.	-1
I thought I was would love this strap due to me having a swamp ash bass and reading many reviews on it. The thickness bought an extreme discomfort within sec. It came this morning and I'll be shipping back out for the 2.5"	-1
I've been using this strap for about two weeks and so far it is not the miracle some reviews would lead you to believe.  The basic problem is that there is simply no free ride with physics: your body/shoulder is going to be supporting the full weight of the instrument no matter what. All that the gel and elastic in the shoulder pad is going to get you is a slightly better spread on the load. That effect with this strap is marginal; it did not provide any great relief for me.  And there are other issues.  As many have mentioned the smallest size strap (Large) is WAY too long. Add in another $10 to the cost to take the strap to a shoe repair shop to have them take a good chunk of length out of the strap and restitch it. Even if you somehow needed all that length, since the shoulder pad is fixed, all that length only feeds out to the back end of your guitar, so the guitar will approach a vertical orientation. A superior strap design has adjustable straps on both ends. Not so with this one.  Another problem is the crazy hard thick leather on the front end attachment point/hole. It's damn near impossible to get it onto a strap button. Oddly, the rear strap end is a softer leather and doesn't have this issue :/  The front end of the strap also has a very hard, thick leather piece that has quite a bit of bulk to it. Probably not an issue with a typical guitar but on my SG, which has the front strap button on the back of the guitar near the neck, the twist due to the attachment point forces that hard bulky pad into my body which is annoying and uncomfortable (attaching the strap end the opposite way as is common with an SG doesn't help much). There is seemingly zero added functionality to this piece and it only serves as a place to attach a brand logo and/or to make it look more expensive(?).  So this strap just isn't working for me. It only affords a modicum of increased comfort and there are too many other issues that simply have not been thought through.  The search for a more comfortable and better designed strap continues :(	-1
This strap was a disappointment.  It's padded nice but it's bouncy.  It's elastic so it stretches from the weight of your guitar and will bungee up and down.	-1
Too Short!  I had to rob another strap with a longer tailpiece strip.  I am a large Man, but c'mon.  Would 3" of skinny leather cost that much?	-1
I would caution any buyer of a Levy's strap to beware of this "con" on the part of Levy's.  Their straps are way to short for most people and if you connect it to the neck of the guitar.  They could eliminate this with the strap that comes with the origianl in a lenth that could be cut by the purchaser.  I too am plenty ticked bout the fact that the extendo deal does not match my guitar strap and makes it look very cheesy. I simply will not buy another Levy's Guitar Strap unless I have it in hand to examine before buying it.	-1
If getting this strap for a 5yr old then go for it, other wise it is way too small for 8yrs on up	-1
Levy's leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material, especially on the edges.  It cuts into your neck horribly, even thru a shirt. Yukko.  The fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap.	-1
STIFF as a board !!!  Not only is stiff, it digs sharply into my neck. Yes, there are things I could do to modify it, but for this price it should be good to go. I gave mine away.	-1
The leather is too stiff to fit over the strap buttons. I had to unscrew the strap button to put the awful thing on. Also, the nylon strap material is so stiff that it barely flexes, so it digs into your neck and shoulder. Very uncomfortable. I have replaced this with a strap by a different manufacturer.	-1
I have had a Levi's strap for many years and love it. This one is MUCH shorter and was returned.	-1
We own other Levy straps and they are good. This one looks and feels cheaply made with low quality materials.  The picture shown is not the actual product recieved. Levy logos not printed on underside of strap and the ends are made of a stretch polyester that feels like it would scratch instrument as well as stretch to not stay on. Very disappointed after such a long wait for it to ship. Sending back within 5 min of opening package.  This looks like a poor reproduction of there usual quality.	-1
Was hoping to not need my mixer for my one condenser mic to provide phantom power. It provides enough juice for the mic, but the hum is unbearable. It's being returned.	-1
Didn't want to spend much money for just one project so bought the NADY. Big mistake. Loaded with 60 hz hum. The wall wart was the problem. Found an 18VAC power supply for the unit and that got it fixed. Too late, but it got it fixed.	-1
Just got this yesterday. It worked OK until today then then started flashing Err on the screen. I presume this is an error code. So I'm sending it back. Just as well. This thing is a piece of junk. All plastic, and cheap plastic at that. The sounds are OK, but not a lot of flexibility when trying to edit the effects. I would have returned it anyway even if it hadn't failed.	-1
These picks are terrible.  The sand paper that is glued on rubs off easily.  The shark also isn't centered on the picks very well so the tail is right where you pick the string.  Stay away from this garbage.	-1
I tried Legere for a bit.  Not long.  I found two big problems with them: 1.  The Legere is a lot stiffer than the cane of the same size.  They may have fixed this since I last played on them, but I used to play on Mitchell Laurie 4 (sometimes 4.5) cane reeds and I couldn't get a single peep from a Legere 4 because it was too stiff.  I had to drop to a Legere 3. 2.  This is solid plastic so it does not vibrate as well as the cane reeds.  This means that I have to blow harder to get the same volume level.  It also means that the notes can sound somewhat muddled or stifled... particularly after 45 minutes of playing when there is quite a bit of spit clinging to the reed.  These reeds are meant to be played WHILE TOTALLY DRY.  As soon as any moisture (like spit) hits it, the sound quality goes down.  I will say that I like Legere slightly better than the Plasticover reeds; those are just normal cane reeds with a plastic coating so they have even more problems than regular cane reeds in my opinion.  However, if you want a really great reed that will last a long time, give you awesome musical quality, and has a sound similar to (but crisper than) regular cane, try Fibracell instead of Legere.	-1
won't stay on the metal rest, and always falls off right in the middle of a piece of music, it's distracting to me	-1
I don't understand how this is supposed to "save" your thumb. It's more uncomfortable than the bare thumb pad! Definitely a waste of money.	-1
I wanted to like this.  The value was right and it seemed like a great solution for my tenor, alto, soprano practice room.  BUT, unfortunately it hasn't worked out. There are 2 problems with this:  1 - The stand does not work on any surface except a hard surface and even on a hard surface, I'm worried.  On any carpet, this is very unstable.  The problem are the two little feet that you can see next to the soprano pegs.  They are simply too short to be stable.  Turns out much of the weight of a sax is on those two little feet.  So on a carpet especially, the feet are pushed downward and the balance tips the saxes back and over.  Exactly what you don't want to happen.  2 - The cushioned areas on the stand for the alto/tenor spots don't work well for tenor.  The bottom of the bell hits the metal at the bottom of the brace.  Might be correctable if you made the lower cushion (not the top "Y" cushion but the second smaller cushion extended out a little.  Basically the whole tenor sax is flush against that metal rail and the bottom knocks on the sax.  So lay it on there very slowly because it will touch metal to metal.  Over time, I'm sure this will wear off the lacquer at the minimum.  Overall, like I said, I wanted to like this stand but it didn't happen.  For all you other sax players out there, move on and try something else.	-1
I used this product recently on a theater gig.  It is incredibly awkward.  It does not fold well for travel, and the straight design (and long t shaped bar) made it too big to fit comfortably anywhere around my chair.  I kept smacking my instruments either on the chair or stand...even against each other as I tried to pick up the saxes.  The worst part of the stand though is that it tips over!  With all 4 instruments on it, it would start tipping forward at the slightest jostle.  I ended up keeping my foot on the stand the entire performance.  If you have enough room (and really good eyesight) to have it in front of you as you play, with plenty of clearance for the music stand, that seems the best spot for it. I'd still keep a foot on it though.	-1
Purchased for a cellist -- it slides across the floor and is useless in concerts on a hard floor.	-1
I guess I have the wrong type of floors or something, but this didn't work for me.  The cello still slid on my floor.  I have laminate flooring but it does not have a smooth surface.  Maybe that was the problem?  Don't know.  Returned it.	-1
I really tried to like this, as my original chinrest was not as confortable as I think it is necessary for one hour practice. I really enjoyed the confort it provides and it sticks well on the chinrest (despite being a little smaller than my chinrest).  My major complaynt, that became a real dealbreaker, is the strong rubber smell this piece produces. It is installed on a spot too near of my nose for it to make me lose my concentration some times. I used it for 15 days, waiting for the smell to fade out but it didn't.  At the end I removed it and bought a wittner center chinrest.	-1
This thing won't stay on the violin, no matter how much you fiddle with it.	-1
Hate this product...keeps collapsing on its side.	-1
UPDATE OCT 20, 2016: The zipper finally completely broke and no longer zips after only 4-5 months of use.  VERY disappointed.  For a bag that was made specifically for a gigging musician using a Privia, they really shortchanged the zipper design and there's not enough cushion/padding IMHO.... The bag fits perfect, and the two accessory compartments are great, but the zippers are very cheaply made.  I perform nightly, and if you do too, this may NOT be the gig bag you want to use for your Privia keyboard.  After only a couple months the zipper pull broke...  the actually zipper pull broke in half simply from my pulling it it closed one night... cheap metal... See Attached Photo... and the zipper teeth also pulled apart from both sides a few times and I had reconnect by pulling all the way closed, realigning teeth and reclosing...... furthermore, there is only ONE zipper pull, instead of two which would make it easy if they can meet in the middle and maybe would help the teeth from coming apart on both sides of pull.  I recently purchased another accessory gig bag, this one is from Phitz, now THIS is what all bags should be made of... really touch design.  Zipper pulls are huge, heavy duty and have a rubber sheath around large metal zipper... heavier duty teeth design too and great padding... (see photo) unfortunately they do not make a keyboard back that would fit my 88-key Privia... not yet anyway.	-1
Returned, chorus on my Fender modeling amp worked better.	-1
Maybe my expectations were too high... as soon as I plugged it in I smelled something burning. Pulled the plug and just use a battery...and yes, it was the proper fitting cord. It works, but now I'm hesitant to try any other Behringer product.	-1
Save your money. This chorus is very weak. Ive tried it in different positions in my chain of effects I cant tell its there. Disappointed.	-1
Not good at all	-1
The one I received was defective in that there was hardly any modulation range. But the controls that worked and the overall build quality earned two stars.	-1
This thing will make you sound muddier. It is a poorly designed effect.	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price.	-1
With any peaks, or even just mildly loud guitar input, there is a 'buzzy' kind of distortion noticeable, which ruins the otherwise decent effect. I ended up with the Boss, as this distortion is just unacceptable on clean acoustic or electric guitar. Too bad, because I've had good results with other Behringer equipment.	-1
This thing gives your amp a ton of noise in the background, even when the pedal is off. Not recommended...	-1
First Behringer pedal I have returned. Almost no effect provided by pedal. I have returned the unit. Not worth it. Lousy pedal.	-1
I thought I would give this pedal a try, because it was inexpensive, but as usual, you do get what you pay for. Try to hold out and get a better quality pedal, you will be happier, I'm sure.	-1
I bought this item to use with my Tascam Portistudio and was dissappointed.  There is a constant whirring noise and a massive static attack of white noise when it is plugged in to the system.  It is a good delay pedal other than that.  If you're looking to use this pedal live or just jam out with it then it's for you.  But if you want to record and have a clear sound...I suggest Boss or Digitech.  More expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for.	-1
Stopped working after only 2 1/2 months.  Still has power (bought the power adapter), but suddenly last week the line in/out stopped working.  Tested all cables so it is somewhere inside of the unit.  Kills the signal whether it's active or bypassed, output A or direct output.  Just poor quality.	-1
Pos. Crapped out after one use.	-1
SUCKS , BROKE IN ONE DAY	-1
I have a multiverb that I love, but it is big. It's rack mounted. I was hoping for something cheap but worth the money. I play a lot and I can tell you this is not what I need. I can't tweak it to where it needs to be. Tone is terrible in some positions. Maybe for players in different genre of music may be fine or to just play with. I should have known better. However, it is made very well though. I have no problem with the hard plastic structure.	-1
I bought 3 Behringer pedals in Nov 2010 and all were very poor quality. I returned the DOA volume pedal right away and bought an Earnie Ball. I tolerated the Behringer delay pedal's awful tone for 6 months--then the off-on foot switch stuck ON. The chorus still sorta works, but the effect randomly cuts in and out (very annoying).  Don't waste your time and money on Behringer pedals. The price seems too good to be true, and it is.  Based on these three bad experiences, I cannot recommend Behringer products for anything other than service as a paperweight. Meanwhile, the BOSS pedals I've owned for years, and the ones I recently purchased, all are excellent products.	-1
I liked this a lot at first, but carrying it by the shoulder strap pulls at some of the corner seams and they started coming apart. It's getting really bad now, two years from purchase.  The worst part is that Pedaltrain has reneged on their warranty. I purchased this largely because it came with a lifetime warranty on all parts. Since the time of my purchase, they've changed their policy to only cover the board itselfcases are now covered by a 1-year warranty. That's fine, they can do that for new purchases, but they decided that the new policy applies retroactively. So the fact that I purchased a board with a lifetime warranty means nothing. They're refusing to honor my warranty.	-1
I bought mine a few years back from guitar center and the zipper broke asap.  I repaired the zipper at a shop for ten bucks rather than shipping back and having to put new velcro on a new board.  Otherwise a good concept and good design.  My issue to give it so low a rating is due to break, and frankly and subjectively that its too big for my apartment.  It just has a big footprint.  I don't recommend it unless you are a gigging musician with a studio etc to need such a big piece.  Just sold it at a lost on clist and will either buy a smaller version like the 2, or check out some other custom boards on ebay.  good luck.  also wanted to copy and paste the following review from another user and say I AGREE!  I did one or two gigs, and all the pedals had completely come off the board, total bs.  If you're anything other than the very occasional musician, you'd be better off buying the version of this product with the hard case. I'm gigging 3-4 times a month and find that the soft case allows pedals to shift so much during transit that they come loose from the board. The padded flight case would hold pedals down more securely.  But there's more to the problem. First, the Velcro isn't anywhere near strong enough to hold down heavier pedals (e.g. a Digitech Whammy, even a Cry-Baby), which come loose even when picking the board up to put it in its case. I've ended up using cable ties wrapped around the crossbars to augment the Velcro. Second, the glue on the back of the supplied Velcro isn't strong enough to stay attached to many pedals. I've ended up using Gorilla glue to get the stuff to stick.  I'm not sure there is any solution to these problems, since any pedal-board would have the same issues.  Having said that, it's a good solid pedal-board, probably the best available.	-1
This capo's spring mechanism is too weak to be of any use for most guitars.  To me, it is worthless.  I cannot recommend anyone buy it.	-1
Failed early on.  Spring which is the key to its operation flew out of it across the room after a couple months.  Despite putting it back in place it no longer generates enough strength to keep the strings down.  Quite disappointed as it is a sleek looking capo compared to many.  It was a warrantee for replacement but sending to the UK costs far more than replacing it with a better capo. It was fine before it broke and I do have other model G7th capos that I like.  This one didn't pan out.	-1
I'm giving two stars simply because the capo does what it's intended to do to an extent. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. Yes, it holds down the strings so you can play in a higher key. However, the design on this capo is awful and I can't recommend it.  First of all, it is not adjustable, and out of the box, the spring tension is way tighter than it needs to be to get the job done. You need a fairly strong grip to spread it wide enough to install it. Once you do, the tension is so tight, it pulls the strings slightly, causing some tuning issues. The tension is so tight, if you have a chunky neck, you're going to have issues placing it higher than around the fifth fret.  Secondly, when installed, the darned thing is an eye hazard. I don't like how the two prongs stick up.  Thirdly, the bar that comes in contact with the strings is very narrow and tapers even more narrow toward the high E string. My guess is that from a design standpoint, their thought was that the skinnier strings need less surface area to hold them down. I'm not sure that I agree. The fact that I experienced string pulling/tuning issues leads me to believe they were wrong.  You can get a better capo for the same or less money.	-1
This is the second one of these that arrived 10 cents sharp (or more).  If you want to play by yourself, it's fine, it's in tune with itself (for the most part), but if you want to play with others, or record with it, it is totally unacceptable.  It's WAY sharp, and won't do at all.	-1
Okay, not sure if I got a "bad one" or if tuning is just not a concern for most Melodica / Pianica players, but the one I got is badly out of tune. The sound is wonderful, much nicer than the Hohner Piano 36 I used to own. However, the Pianica is not in tune with itself. My old Hohner Melodica was, at least when I first got it. I'd say most of the octave notes are in tune, but some of them are so out of tune that you would not ever want to play those two notes together and this is something I want to do. I've noticed that the tuning of many free reed instruments these days seems to be a real issue. I guess with Yamaha's reputation and the good reviews here I thought I would be avoiding this problem. Maybe I should have paid double for the 36 note Suzuki Melodian? Perhaps it would have the same issue? Not sure if I can return this item or not but if accurate tuning is an issue for you then buyer beware. If you are a beginner or hobbyist then perhaps you don't care. But if you are a professional or semi-professional musician then I think the tuning is unacceptable for a brand new out of the box instrument. Again, superior tone and quality of construction, but the tuning is just too much. Such a shame.	-1
Headphone sound is very personal, so I'm willing to concede that these may sound just fine for some listeners... They just didn't work well for me. I'm finding that I'm partial to the sound signature of Sennheisers, and I have some mid-priced ($80-$120) Sennheisers that (IMHO) blow these away.  If the price is right, and you don't mind returning them (Amazon is AWESOME, BTW) if you don't like them, they're worth a shot.	-1
Don't waste your time with this, or other sub-20 dollar plastic ocarinas in its class. It's not tuned properly, it's not meant to be a musical instrument. Find a plastic ocarina made by Focalink, Noble, or TNG (STL Ocarina). I most highly recommend the Night by Noble plastic 12-hole ocarina. It sounds so nice that it could pass as a more expensive clay ocarina.	-1
This is a toy replica and not to be confused with a real ocarina.  While the price seems very reasonable, an actual musical instrument can be had for less money . For instance, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Focalink-12-Hole-Plastic-Sweet-Potato-Ocarina-in-Soprano-C-Blue/dp/B004CTVVY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Focalink 12 Hole Plastic Sweet Potato Ocarina in Soprano C Blue</a>&nbsp;actually costs less and it plays its entire range : A5-F7 and is fully chromatic.  Even if it were well tuned, the highest notes barely make a note and are more of an airy sound.  Nothing can be done to overcome this.  This makes the playable range much less and for parents, you end up listening to the wheezy airy sound more than actual notes.  I can't explain why this product is so highly rated, but I implore you to keep searching for another ocarina.  Google OcarinaDiva and watch her ocarina overviews.  This will help you learn what questions to ask.  Also search for TheOcarinaNetwork and ask them for help.  No one has to start on such a horrible instrument.  There is a huge community of helpful people that want to let the world know that the ocarina is MUCH MORE than cheap plastic toys.  Take some time to research a bit more outside of amazon.  I'm sure the reviewers here mean well, but they are ill-informed and ignorant of the diverse high quality market that is out there.	-1
I was hoping to have fun with this expecting it to be a toy. I was very disapointed that even at that one couldnot get any tone modulation. I was not going to record the entire Zelda album cover but to make even toy music would have been nice.	-1
A very little guitar. Dificult to afinate. Disappointed.	-1
The strings it comes with are bad quality and aren't strung properly. They fall severely out of tune within seconds and eventually pull right out. It is nice in appearance, but is 100% unplayable, even as a backpacking/trunk guitar.	-1
I went thru 3 of these - they all worked great on batteries.  But with AC adapter (standard 9v pedalboard power supply) after 5 minutes they started humming/distorting/robot-like stuff.  UNTIL i got the latest revision of the XDS95 which had a new frequency label pasted over the original label on both units.  THIS ONE WORKED GREAT with or without power supply.  I was disappointed that LINE 6 realized they had a problem but made no effort to have the vendors recall or offer a free fix.	-1
Unstretched size is about 10" x 10".  When stretching, one corner pops off when stretching (we're talking a BIG stretch guys) over adjacent or opposite corner.  a 2 - person job putting it on!	-1
This doesn't stay on my Soundcraft mixer.  I mean, it'll stretch out and go over the edges, but it's SO stretchy it usually finds a way to pop off.  It's a cheap, nasty nylon or something; I doubt it'll wear like a good canvas--like my old one.  Notice in the picture that they don't shot anything plugged into the mixer.  That's great: if you never plug anything into yours, this will probably do fine.  But with cords hanging off it, you'll be annoyed with this thing coming half off.  Sorta like in the picture!  Keep looking.  Great idea, poorly executed.	-1
Way too bulky.	-1
Died after running for 5 hours at 9v. Device only used 600ma. Very disappointed.	-1
The Hosa Cable ACD477 Universal AC Power Supply has multiple voltage settings and tips to work with almost anything that takes a wall wart. The tips are simple to change or flip polarity, and voltage configuration with the well-marked dial is easy. Unfortunately, the ACD477 falls short in actual use: cheap lightweight build, really thin and delicate power cable and runs hot. Mine makes a hissing sound after powering a small LED light for 30 minutes, so no good for video or audio sessions. I don't have any way of measuring if the rated 1200mA output is true, but my old Radio Shack 500mA wall wart is twice as heavy, runs cool and powers devices silently. Perhaps the ACD477 is okay for light duty use but I wouldnt trust it in any mission critical assignments such as paying gigs, recording or data protection.	-1
I ordered the CBI Gold Rush guitar cable, 15 foot length...Right out of the box it did not work.  Used my sons working cord to verify that it was the cord.  I sent it back for a refund, bought another brand.	-1
I bought two of these and they are supposedly identical but they were actually two different cable weave patterns, similar but different. The packaging was identical though. Makes one wonder about actual sourcing. I found them more prone to noise from electrical fields than most cables so they are set aside for emergency backup. I'd pass on buying any more.	-1
IT'S NOT A DURABLE PRODUCT!  I say this simply because I am so incredibly cautious with my instruments, take great attention to detail and just about three months into using it, the cap snapped off one of the ends and the string fell through the entire seams and now the cover is basically worthless.  there's gotta be better designs.  It's not well made.  I would not recommend this at all!	-1
Unless you need something that's a perfect fit, all of these spandex covers do deteriorate after a while. Anybody who uses them knows this. If your piano is a homebody like mine, do what I did and simply find a microfiber sheet--here in NYC you can buy a flat sheet for a few bucks--in a neutral color and toss it over your whole keyboard. Doesn't look all professional, but sheds zero. It's microfiber!	-1
so so	-1
This didn't work at all.  Unfortunatly I didn't need the plug right away and didn't know it was faulty, so I missed the return window. Just make sure if you buy it to test it right away.  It is a nice design.	-1
am using it, but it fabric, so dust does accumulate on the exterior like furniture would.  have placed bubble wrap under it to protect piano	-1
This product lasted on the order of minutes- I bought it for an IP camera. The power supply seems to be made of cheap electronics, and after about 15 minutes, I noticed it was no longer supplying power to my IP Camera. Upon investigating, there is no way to fix the circuit inside- try another universal AC power supply, this one isn't worth buying.	-1
I bought one of these before, but this time, I got a lemon. I opened up the box, and it looked like it had been stepped on or dropped, once I put it on my keyboard, it worked great up until I used the drawstring to sinch it up. The draw string had broken, and just pulled out completely.  If you're looking for feedback on my previous keyboard dust cover, it was great, I've been using the 88 and 61 key versions for the last year, going to gigs and back with no trouble.	-1
Needed to power a USB hub which did not include an AC adapter so I bought this. Never worked...AT ALL. What a big disappointment. It shall now be labeled with the appropriate acronym of POS.	-1
It is nothing but a thin piece of cloth. And even gets dust quick.  Please do not waste your money.  3 to 4 dollar is a good price for this.	-1
This is a near formless black cover that i could replace with a nice piece of cloth. Not worth 16 bucks. U G L Y I found the tightner cord. I tried to snug up the cover to the keybord, and the end came off in my hand. I fine garbage quality rag.  I have no idea what folks are talking about when they speak of how well this thing fits. It is a formless rectangular rag.	-1
when the product doesn't work.  I plugged this in to my bass and amp.  Turn on my amp and the loudest hum I've heard rolled thru my house.  (my bad for not having the volume down but jeez)  I thought I blew my speakers.  The cable I received is complete garbage.  Is there no quality control at this "made in the USA" facility?  I have a hard time believing someone plugged this in and checked it before shipping.  Back to Planet Waves.	-1
I purchased  this cable for use in a non - stress position, connecting a stage keyboard to a direct box.  The cable bore no weight and did not hang, rather was very careful run as art of a defined setup that was never changed from stage to stage.  The cable was noisy, and did not feel like quality.  After three consecutive dates using the cable, I removed it from service,, replaced it with a spectra flex cable.  Noise was eliminated - no him, no crackle.  I felt like I was using some old radio shack cable from the 80s where I had to make sure not to move it or I'd run the risk of static in the PA.  guess you get what you pay for, in this case, I've been using the spectra flex for nine months - three days a week, with no trouble - and removed the remaining CBI cables from the stage.  Not worth the risk.	-1
Horrible, the keys are fake and cheap. The drum pads...for lack of a better word...SUCK HUMONGOUS DOG POOP. The macros are cheap and plastic, I paid 100 for a semi-weighted m-audio MIDI and had a better experience with that. I even took it apart and tried fixing the pads. HORRIBLE UNIT FOR THE HIGH PRICE. DO NOT BUY	-1
If I could give these tuners ZERO stars I would. These deserve a minus rating category. Poor workmanship, binding and a 12:1 ratio render these basically unusable to anyone seeking to have their guitar play in tune.  Tune a string which is 2 cents flat (on a Peterson strobe) and move the tuning key the slightest and now you have 2 cents sharp.just starting to put pressure on the key and you can see it change pitch. This is most likely due to the crummy machine work on the gears which cause them to bind. Honestly, these are the absolute worst tuners I have EVER used.  Contacting Sperzel gets a send them back to be repaired. They are new! When asking about buying another set, I asked if they were as bad, could I send them back for a refund. Their reply,"No!" They stated I could only return them for replacement or repair as well.  A 12:1 ratio, in my opinion, isn't a good ratio. The replacement tuners I ordered from Hipshot are 18:1, meaning you can fine tune your guitar. Steer clear of Sperzel, they honestly don't seem to care. How anyone can say anything positive about these, or rate them 5 stars, is beyond me. Total junk.	-1
Used only about 4 times without any problems. Then while setting up at a gig it powered on but no inputs worked.  When it still worked sound quality was acceptable but had an electronic, metallic sound for vocals and acoustic electric guitar and made electric guitars sound thin and tin-like. Playing DJ music through an iPad or iPhone lacked fullness and warmth. For larger gigs I use an Allen & Heath 16:2 MixWizard so the sound quality of this mixer is awful compared to that. I liken this Yamaha's sound to that of an old Mackie.  Having no mute buttons meant needing to memorize levels and turning channels down to zero. Not a deal breaker for the convenience. I really like how this mixer mounts onto a microphone stand using the BMS 10A Mic Stand Adaptor. But now I feel the entire rig was a wasteful purchase. Even though I have only owned this mixer for a few months Amazon says it is past their return policy and the seller J-Tech Digital Inc claims they have no record of the Amazon order number and is offering no technical support. Yamaha has not responded at all. Looks like I am out nearly $250. Totally unacceptable.	-1
Too cheap feeling for pro use, in my opinion.  Spend the extra dough and get a Mackie.  Feels like it would break with a bump.  Effects were not very good...	-1
I've owned 3 of these. It does not sound natural. I would not use it for studio recording and I'd be cautious for stage use. SM58 is better. This mic is loaded with features but fails at what matters which is natural sound capturing. Trust me I researched the hell out of this mic and used a lot of mcis the past few years. Just get a SM58 and EQ it until you get the sound you want from it. It'll be a lot better. This mic also is more plosive than the sm58. Only mic I like from Electro-Voice is their RE20.	-1
Not working right need to get a new 1 not happy	-1
After reading all the great reviews and having good luck with Yamaha products, I ordered one of these, and it appeared to work fine at first (I say appeared because of what happened seems to have plagued this unit from the outset). And wanted to use this to simplify my P.A. Set up (tired of lugging around my 60 lb Yorkville) .  The first gig sounded pretty good, except one of my speakers sounded weak...after tweaking it..there was a slight improvement..until the next gig, when it went nearly dead....  During the time I brought them in...the Yamaha simply make a slight pop sound when I turned it on..and went silent...then the repair shop called and said they could not find anything wrong with the speakers..and sure enough, when I plugged them into the Yorkville, everything sounded as it should. So obviously the "weak" speaker was in actuality, an issue with the mixer.  i plan to send this back to Yamaha and find out what is/was wrong with it. I was hoping for a good Little P.A. Mixer, but so far,no go....	-1
Fri 12/30/2011 3:45 pm. The Yamaha MG102c is a lovely mixer, but it has a defect -- for my purposes -- which is shares with *numerous* other units: the "monitor/phones" output level is controlled by the master level; in this case, by the Stereo level. ... I took the trouble before purchase of downloading Yamaha's manual mg82cx_en_om.pdf, which says "The PHONES jack outputs the same signal as the MONITOR OUT jacks" which "output the signals adjusted by the MONITOR/PHONES control" and "MONITOR/PHONES Control: Controls the level of the signal output to the PHONES jack and the MONITOR jacks; STEREO Master Control: Adjusts the signal level sent to the STEREO OUT jacks."  I obviously don't know how to read these things, but I can't see anything in there about the "Stereo Master Control also controls the headphone level".  Many of the mixers are like this, although not absolutely all; I have no idea why. It was probably cheaper once, but I doubt that's an issue now, and it seems obviously advantageous to have independent control of the two levels, instead of one depending on the other. It would at any rate be advantageous to *me*. So I'm returning it.	-1
I Highly prefer the more natural sound of the RE20. I don't feel this mic is worth the money. I'd rather use a re20 or SM58 over this mic depending on the situation. This mic has horrible sound quality.	-1

They are stiff and not nearly as smooth as the 3 other sets of Sperzels that I own. They are going to require some work. I may just return them.	-1
I own a couple of these, and a couple N/D767s, and have purchased & use many EV speakers, over the years. I've always liked EV products, but the 967, & EV, have disappointed me greatly. I did get about five years of occasional use, but I have much older mics that just keep working.  I take excellent care of all my equipment, and this is the first mic I've owned that just stopped working. It may have fallen to the floor one time, not from the stand, but from a table a few feet off a carpeted stage, but I guess that was all it took. Cause I went to use it the next night, and nothing, no sound at all.  A friend who does some electronic work opened it up but said the problem must be deeper into it than he wanted to go. I tried contacting EV, on two separate occasions to see how much it might cost if they repaired it, but they never even responded... I'm used to companies standing behind their products, so this was unexpected, and quite disappointing.  I'll probably have to just toss it, as a repair place would probably charge nearly what's it's worth, just to fix it; and who knows how much longer it would last, anyway? Therefore, I can't really recommend this mic, as I won't be buying another from EV...	-1
Don't buy this if you want to perform with it.  It is interesting to play with, but no true musical skill is involved(in my opinion) and it does not save any programed melodies once turned off.	-1
My first impression after opening was a mixed bag. I really liked how it looked, but, it felt very light and toyish in my hand. First noodlings on this were impressive when hooked up to speakers, the sound quality this thing generates are very clean and good. Controls are intuitive but would take some time to really tweak to your own personal flavor but the 150 presets are fun. I played with this for about 5 hours making dance songs and some cool ambient tracks and the batteries were almost dead. Now the reason I purchased was really to be able to record other devices like my microkorg and guitar and loop all together while overdubbing little tidbits from this. For me personally it failed. The microphone feature is cool but it takes two people to use effectively and the sound quality was sub-par. The loop banks need to be held down to record ( basically loosing a hand ) and once you overdub a loop bank its forever. Meaning, if you lay a drum track then a bass line on loop one then decide to throw in a synth lead over them but don't like how the synth lead turned out you cant simply just delete the synth part, you have to delete the whole loop and start over. Now anyone who has played on Korg X-Y pads know that it is a crap shoot when it comes to playing the exact thing twice, it takes a lot of practice so this really turns out to be what I had expected, a really cool music toy. There are a lot of features on this that make it appealing and I am no Kaossilator expert but for the money they are asking and the cons that I talked about earlier it lasted one day and I returned it. Remember this is my opinion and I really wanted to like it but I couldn't justify keeping it when music gear is so expensive and I could spend my money on something else that would work better for me.	-1
It sounds pretty good and it is a lot of fun to be able to walk around your house while playing electric guitar. However, they are VERY fragile. While playing and walking around my living room I accidentally stepped on the earphone plug cord, and it pulled the ear plug jack partially out of the amp. I cursed, but then noticed nothing hadn't cracked the amp or anything visible, so just pushed the plug back into the amp. No go....the thing won't work anymore. Now obviously this was my fault, but it really is fragile, which is why I can only give it a 2 star. My advice is to get a very short earphone wire so it won't dangle anywhere near your feet while walking around. Just baby it and it might last awhile. The concept is very cool....I just wish they used a metal casing and not cheap plastic. Still...it was fun while it lasted. Enjoy!	-1
Poor dynamics - I hate playing through it with distortion on. Does the job for having a line in, and for a clean sound. I still use it when I play late night when everyone is asleep, but overall the amp could be better...I would not recommend this. Better to go through your amp, witha direct out to your headphones if you can. The portability of this thing is cool, but again, just if you're playing thru the clean channel, with or without a line in...	-1
I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. Generously, I'll give it 2stars. Something like this really should last at least a year or more. Cheap parts/manufacturing?  50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature.	-1
As an amateur musician, I'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such.  I thought this gadget would do the trick, but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn't meet my expectations.	-1
If you are desperate to have a quiet guitar and can't afford a 1 watt amp, this is a good substitute.  It sounds about the same through cheap or expensive headphones, which is to say it sort of sounds like a guitar.  The highest headphone volume isn't all that loud, so you won't lose any hearing with this unit, although I still like my music loud, even through headphones.....so it's sort of a disappointment.  The knobs are small and hard to read, so memorize what does what.  It isn't difficult as there are only three of them you need to bother with, but they are small and virtually impossible to see while playing.  I usually plug in an MP3 player with some backing tracks on it, and play over them. The battery is easy to change but doesn't last all that long.  These little units have their place, just don't expect too much. I paid about $30 for mine so I guess I shouldn't expect too much.  Waddie	-1
Sound is not so good. Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything.	-1
I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these. Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.  For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same). Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans..	-1
I bought this unit to use with a ZT Lunchbox amp. The idea was to have a giggable rig that weighs under 10lbs. At the time, the ZT Acoustic LB Amp wasn't yet out.  So far, in hours of trying, I haven't been able to get a really good sound with this combination.  If I use a Boss ME50 instead of the Korg unit, I get a better sound. These aren't comparable products, but I mention this to point out that the problem is not entirely the Lunchbox amp.  What I am looking for is EQ and Reverb. I really don't need the other features, except for the tuner. I can't quite get a reverb sound I really like. The EQ depends on the amp model. I can get it dialed in, but then, for some reason, I'll find myself fiddling with it over and over. Part of the problem may be the Lunchbox amp -- but I don't need the Korg's small size, EQ or reverb if I'm toting a larger amp anyway.  On the positive side, when used as a practice amp with headphones, it sounds great. I don't really understand why I can't get it to sound good through the amp.	-1
I'm an amateur hip hop artist and a good mic is paramount for me. Long story short, I'm still looking for one. Next on my list is the Rode NTK1 as I hear good things about it. I found this A-T mic model number on a blog where someone said it was a good mic and I decided to purchase it. First off, it's WAY overpriced. I think its worth about $160-180 dollars max. Its an extremely flat response mic, not dynamic at all. I'm sure it would work well for some type of plays or film works where a depressing, flat sound is best. I think they made it that way to reduce background noise, but regardless this mic does not sound great at all. It is accurate though, I'll give it that. But its just a boring mic. I don't really know how else to explain it. My vocals were a lot quieter than I would have liked, and they just sounded kind of dry and minimized before I threw on any special effects.	-1
It did not work at all. Now I am stuck with a useless piece of  cheaply made plastic.	-1
This thing is all right for what it does, but either way I wouldn't buy it again. If you are REALLY dead set on using headphones, then just buy an eighth inch to quarter inch cord adapter. It's cheaper and not as bulky. Personally, I hate headphones when playing - I like to hear myself rock out. They make a lot of great, inexpensive products similar in size to this one that actually emit sound and act like a mini, portable amp. Get one of those!  Bottom line: not worth it. Either get a standard eighth inch to quarter inch adapter for headphones, or even better get a portable mini amp that emits sound that doesn't require headphones.	-1
This toy headphone amp sounds okay, and may sound a little bit like an AC-30, but it's junk. It is made of cheap plastic and will not be around for long before it breaks. A reasonable price for this might be ten bucks.  Please don't waste your money on this.	-1
The Amp itself is weak at best.  But it is useful and I guess the concept is a good one.  It warbles and you have to find the right 'sweet spot' to get a decent sound.  Echo is acceptable but distortion is well, distorted - but not in the good way.  I think it's good enough for what it is/does and probably worth in the $20 range.  Now for the warning.  See the Bundle picture, it shows the Vox Lead amPlug Amp,  the Vox Speaker unit and an unnamed Headset.  Then in the other pictures they show each item individually?  See those?  You don't get those.  At least *I* didn't get those.  I got the Vox Lead amPlug, some batteries and a patch cable.  After several emails and a couple of phone calls, I still haven't received the VOX Speaker box or the unnamed headsets in their so called *bundle*  When I saw the bundle image and the individual pictures of each item from the 'bundle' I figured the individual Vox Lead amPlug was $43'ish all over Amazon and other outlets so $5 more for the Vox speaker was a great deal as that item goes for $23 and the headsets are a take or leave bonus throwaway item.  Forget it.  You get the Vox Lead amPlug Amp and $2 worth of 'extras' in this *bundle*  Bottom line.  See the pictures?  You don't get those, you get the Vox amPlug Amp. For that you may as well order just the Vox Lead amPlug.  Keep that in mind if you go to order this.	-1
These were recommended as softer strings for easier action by a friend.  Not so.  Equal or worse than original Aquilas and sound is not as sweet.  Brighter sound and lower price but not as mellow.	-1
I purchased the amPlug AC30 to use with my Speedster Traveler Guitar, and I was excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately, it never worked.  The quarter inch male plug is slightly too short to engage the female socket on my guitar. No matter how I turned it or how hard I pushed, it would never "snap" into place.  I checked to see if the guitar would make any sound through the amPlug.  The amp made the usual hissing sound when I turned the gain all the way up, but I never got even a single guitar tone from the device.  It's back in the package and will be returned tomorrow.  Nice idea.  Bad implementation.	-1
When this thing arrived the head was cracked in two places. All it would do is buzz when plugged in. I gave it to a friend to fix and he replaced the pickup and counter sunk some screws to hold the head together. The body seems to be particle board. As someone said you get what you pay for.	-1
I've noticed that most of these reviews are on recently purchased units.  I repair and build guitars, and one of these arrived at my shop for repair which was about a year old. In my opinion, there are some inherent problems with this unit that make it low quality. When intonating, the saddles on the bridge cannot move enough to keep it intonated correctly at the 12th and 24th position. It always goes sharp. So you have to adjust the whole bridge back with the little screws they provide for this purpose until the saddles come into range. That's why the bridge has the long slots. Once you begin to move the bridge back,(with strings loose, of course), the bridge posts are riding out further in the bridge slots, which puts the bridge behind the posts. The adjustment screws are terribly undersized, I believe only 2.5MM.  When you tighten the strings, the bridge will begin to slant up, putting undue stress on the posts, since now only the bridge wings are holding the whole setup to the posts. The one that I received had bent posts from tilting bridge stress, and the threaded inserts had started to loosen in the low quality wood used in this unit. The bridge wings had started to move apart.  I was forced to rebuild the insert holes, replace both the inserts and the posts, and reassemble. Upon doing this, I found that one of the tuners had suffered a tooth skip, making it unusable for tuning. Also, the handles on the keys of the tuners come loose constantly, making it seem like there is a lot of play. Possibly putting Locktite on the key screws would help. I'd look for something a little more well built, if you consider yourself a lapsteel player who is concerned for correct tone across the entire board.  UPDATE, June 2012: Just got another one of these in, a shop owner told me I could buy it for $25, case and all.  Perfect condition, not a scratch, save the bridge is again doing the same thing.  The posts are down in the wood and the bridge is coming up.  Will make repairs in my shop so it is proper and sell it at a small profit.  I'd stay away from these, just junk.	-1
If it were made better, it would be a great case.  The backpack straps are comfortable, having lots of pockets is awesome.  The foam body probably won't protect well if the guitar is stepped on, etc.  But if the guitar takes a fall, the foam will probably take the shock better than a true hardshell case.  But the build quality seems to be problematic.  First, as others have noted, the zipper catches.  You have to work it a little to get the case open.  And the case is top heavy, and tends to fall over when you open it.  Be very careful, or your guitar will get dumped and scratched.  Those two problems were annoying, but not enough to turn me off of the case.  Then after one week of light use, the strap that keeps the top from opening all the way popped out.  Apparently it's held on by a single staple into foam!  I almost set my guitar right onto the staple before I noticed the problem!  I wasn't too bummed about that bc then I could open the case all the way, so it didn't topple over.  But then, after a couple of months, the hinges broke loose, and their screws were projecting into the case.  When I returned the case to the store where I bought it, they said that this was unusual.  But, fearing that the poorly attached strap would break again, causing the hinges to fail again, I decided to trade in for a different case.	-1
Ordered 427R, which looked gold/yellow, and got skin/translucent picks??? It looks like ALL Ultex picks are translucent skin, or black color, and the translucent skin picks are VERY HARD TO SEE. If I dropped the skin pick on stage, I  would NEVER be able to find it! As stated, Dunlop makes a black version of this pick, so introducing a pigment into the Ultex mix does not look like a problem. Pick is small (jazz), Very stiff, and slippery; I like it. Since this is one of  the smallest picks you can buy, it makes me wonder what Dunlop was thinking by also making it close to impossible to see.	-1
There is a slight hum from my Digitech vocalizer 4.  This amplified it.  May be an electrical thing this won't handle so I won't criticize other than to say it didn't do what I expected and needed it to do.	-1
It didn't work for me. I still heard/have the hum at one of my gigs. I will try it a few more time in different scenarios. Will switch XLR cables. For the most part, this is a dud. Stay tuned.	-1
It was very FRUSTRATING to excitedly unpack the product only to realize that the power input socket is misaligned with the metal case, making it IMPOSSIBLE to properly insert the power adapter cord. Without power, the unit is useless. I am sending it back, and have ordered a replacement. I did notice that others have also discovered problems with quality control on this item, so we'll see if the replacement unit has the same issue as the first.  For now, I can only give the Rolls PM351 ONE STAR.	-1
I really tried to like the product, inexpensive but not ideal.  A little bit of static in headphones from device.  The worst part was the little tiny opening that you have to use a needle-nose pliers to remove a tiny little connector to switch from mono to stereo.  Just that alone was worth a 1 star but I thought I'd be nice and give it 2.  Rolls, change that one thing and I could handle the little static because I'm sure that is fixable, but that tiny connector and opening...yeesshh!  That is/was a PAIN!!  I returned this and spent a little more money on the Behringer P16.	-1
NOT good for line level signals.  Tried to combine two synthesizer keyboards into one stereo input on my digital mixer.  The volume was attenuated so much, it was unusable; the signal seemed to lose crispness, though perhaps that's just because so much of it was lost in the noise floor.	-1
Mine was dead on arrival. It shafted me twice the first two times when I tried to use it and it didn't work.  It's a simple passive device, what could go wrong? I popped it open and took a look for myself. General build quality is cheap, one notch above junk. I examined the solder joints with a hand held microscope and the joint quality was pretty bad. Cold solder joints all over the place. You could see where the solder was not adhering to the leads of the transformer and the connectors. Even worse one of the solder pads for one of the transformer leads was broken from the pc board trace leading to it, a nearly invisible defect that was hard to find. After fixing that I did an A/B test to listen to how transparent it wounded. I have 50 year old drummers ears and even to me, it was easy to hear that this unit smeared the sound, not horribly, but certainly noticeably. I really wanted to like this, but I can't. This is the second Rolls device I've purchased. Both were DOA.	-1
I bought this, the 2nd input produces no sound which renders that input useless. The fact that the full intent of this device is to provide 4 outputs, yet fails to do so.  Means the quality control is obviously not there. So if u want 3 outputs for the price of 4, go ahead and buy this.	-1
I own several Rolls products and am satisfied with all of them, except this one.  The workmanship was terrible.  It feels solid in your hand, but the potentiometers cut out left or right channels intermittently.  Additionally, the unit adds severe distortion to the signal long before it's maxed out.  in fact, the distortion is grotesque and unbearable beyond the 5 setting on any channel, with input volumes at any audible level (for my uses, I'm at line level).  I'm confused as to how other reviews are so kind.  Perhaps my unit was defective?  I'm not going to chance another 80 bucks on another defective unit.  Amazon was fantastic in the return process, though, so if you are going to take the risk, Amazon is certainly the route to go.	-1
wasted money	-1
The mic stand arrived broken.  Not a very good quality stand anyway.  Neither is the mic cable.  The mic?  It's a SM58.  Can't really go wrong there. That's the only reason this gets two stars.  Otherwise, it'd be one star.  I'm sending it ALL back because of the stand.  I will just buy the components separate and get a better quality boom stand.	-1
I thought these picks would be interesting to try out, but the raised portion is way too thick, and I did not get a very good strumming experience from using them.  Can't recommend them.	-1
I don't care how much I choke up on these.  I still can't get the level of stiffness that is available in a Dunlop Tortex green.  I was very exited to try these, but after trying them extensively on both acoustic and electric guitars, I can say that these just don't work for me.  If you already use and enjoy thin picks, then I would recommend giving them a go.  Otherwise, don't waste your time and money.	-1
HOSA CABLE DMX 500, 20 FOOT. LIKE THE REVIEWS SAID, ONLY 3 PINS WORK OUT OF 5. PIECE OF CRAP!	-1
These would be perfect, except for the play or space between the cable coming out of the connector and the connector itself. They should've put the heat shrink tubing on the outside of the metal to make it more robust. I've come to prefer the solid molded patch cables for connections on my pedal board. They take up less space, their more compact which if your using a Stereo pedal means you can connect the second output cable without too much interference from the primary (mono) output.  STSI, the 3rd party vendor went above and beyond the call of duty when it came to Cust. Svc. - 5 Stars*****	-1
Not the best. Failed after 2 weeks. Would not buy again.	-1
Works but the cable is very thin and looks cheap. This is hard to see in the picture. I would at least go for the pig hog cables for patch cables, bought a couple of them at Sam ash and ordered them on amazon. They were all well made with much heavier gauge cable.	-1
Total crap and worthless	-1
The silver bolt's has internal threading to attach onto a smaller black bolt that is affixed to the clamp.  The issue is that the threading goes the same way - so when unscrewing the silver part comes off and you have to get pliers to get it out of your mic mount.  This makes it a hassle to deal with on the road or if you ever have to move your mic.	-1
Has no Yamaha logo. Legs are not ideally straight, the one I received had one of the legs slightly twisted. Makes whistling sound when one sits due to air escaping through the featured air vent.	-1
RETURNED THIS DUE TO FACT THE ELECTRONICS  FOR THE KEYBOARD THIS CAME WITH WAS OLD SCHOOL , HAVE TO NAVIGATE TOO MUCH  TO CHOOSE SELETION  OF  TONE  HARMONY  AND RYTHM	-1
It arrived broken at the neck, so have to return. I may try again and post an update...	-1
This has been a great gift for my daughter; but the instrument will not stay tuned.  The pegs keep slipping. Emailed customer service and they indicated that it could be a result of temperature change.  It's in the same room and the pegs keep slipping. - The cello arrived and I took to local shop to have tuned.  The bridge had a gap and had to be fixed (cost $35). - Wish someone could tell me how to get the pegs to stop slipping?	-1
It's a toy.  Don't do it.  Rent or buy from a local music store.	-1
Wtf I was going to put a speaker on this but I can't reach 8' and I need my monitor next to my ear. This pole is like 5' long no way you can use this with out cutting it	-1
This On-Stage bag doesn't fit their own stands!  The bases fit, but the poles do not.  We have the On-Stage Quick Release Round Base Mic Stands, model MS7201QRB, paired with the Top Mount Euro-Style Tele Boom, model MSA-7040 TB.  The pole sleeve is too narrow to accommodate the bottom washer on the pole.  You have to remove it to put the pole in the sleeve, meaning the washer is easily lost.  The pole sleeve is also too narrow to accommodate the quick release mechanism at the top of the pole.  The pole sleeve could be cut away so that the rest of the pole fits in the sleeve, but that still won't fix the problem.  When using the quick release bottom paired with the Tele Boom top, the pole assembly is too long to fit in the bag, no matter if the pole is in the sleeve or not.  So, to use this bag, the pole must be removed from the base, the bottom washer removed and stored somewhere else, and the top mount boom assembly must be removed and left loose in the bag.  That is really dumb.  The bag itself has reasonable construction, so it might be useful for other mic stand brands, but it won't fit their own On-Stage mic stands.  NOT RECOMMENDED.	-1
Doesn't clear a Casio PX-560 keyboard. Needs to be an inch or so taller if you bought it to mount a small monitor.	-1
I bought two of these and on both samples, the threads of the screw did not turn smoothly. There was binding at several spots. One was pretty bad and the other not so much but still, poor quality and/or quality control.  Also be aware that this item will extend upwards only 6" from where it screws into the keyboard stand. This is fine for mounting a mic, but if you're thinking of putting a laptop tray on it, it may not clear the top of the keyboard (misses on mine by an inch or so). So for that application you may end up needing some extension tubes.  Haven't tried it yet with a mic, but for all the people saying it picks up lots of low frequency, the way around that is to filter it out with low cut filters. Shouldn't interfere with vocal frequencies.	-1
This did not work out for me because there is no way to cut a whole into the stand of the keyboard---the handle is solid steel or has a and end cap that is impossible to chip out. I ruined a whole keyboard stand trying. Make sure your keyboard has a tube  available in one of the arms after removing end-cap. It is definitely not universal because  your keyboard design may be different from their  install method. Disappointed with design and install requirement.	-1
The vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone. It now rest at bottom of a box.	-1
Has some Hiss in it, which is unacceptable to me. Will be returning for some of Elite Cores Snakes which seem to be cheaper & higher quality. I'm using these as drop snakes not main snakes, however if they introduce issues, it provides me no benefit over running mic cables direct to the main snake head.  For a small bad/church etc it would probably work fine.	-1
Don't drop this thing on your toe!  This is a seriously heavy hunk of metal that secures very poorly to a microphone boom via a single, small threaded screw, capped by a flimsy plastic hand twist.  Easily falls off the boom during attachment, and when it hits the floor, the plastic hand twist immediately breaks off (mine broke off during my first attachment).  It's just as well, however, as a pliers or a socket wrench is absolutely required to tighten the screw hard enough to keep the weight from moving about and/or falling off.  This boom weight is a good idea....but an extremely poor design with no attention whatsoever given to weight symmetry within its own shape.  Most importantly,  a much more substantial bolt is needed to keep this monster weight from falling off and killing one of your pets!  And don't even think about repositioning it once it's finally bolted into place.  The position of everything on your boom has to be carefully aligned AFTER the weight is completely secured, or the entire top boom will rotate to the weights asymmetrical balance point, no matter how much you tighter the boom's securing bolt.  On a positive note, however, you could probably hang off the other end of the boom without tilting the rig.    One final caution.......the final total weight on the top boon may be so heavy with this weight plus mics, iPads, cables etc., that the mic stand's center securing nut may not be strong enough to prevent slow collapse of the entire upper rig into the bottom pole (especially with a flimsy mic stand).  To stop that dogged tendency of the upper pole to collapse,I had to tighten mine so much that I stripped my stand's metal secure nut, and wound up having to purchase an entirely new (and stronger) stand.  Just carrying my keyboard IPad stand is now an aerobic exercise at every gig....but that baby don't fall over no more!!	-1
Had a tune-o-matic with one saddle that was cut too deep - thought I'd give these a try since I've had good results with TUSQ and synthetic nuts . . .ordered correct, specific parts and still needed filing to fit (ok with that so far). . .then one cracks! Save yourself the trouble, go buy a brass saddle or other metal.	-1
I bought this amp twice in one week - first one I purchased was dented and the fans didn't run, only channel A put out sound.  Returned it to amazon, bought a replacement, opened this one... same problem, dented case, "void if opened" sticker was half peeled off and channel B was the only one to work this time..... from the looks of the reviews on this site, I am not the first, and probably won't be the last to be ripped off on "re-packaged" broken amps that obviously the manufacturer is trying to offload on the unsuspecting.... boo Pyle!!!!!	-1
OK - 1st unit arrived dead in water apart from the power light. Connected a know, good mic and to our working speaker. Unit was replaced quickly but the replacement also failed to work. I looked for a supplier to see if there was some unseen trick to getting this running to no avail. Therefore I am forced to give up on this make/model and look elsewhere. So far it has put my theatre project back a week	-1
weak amp...don't bother	-1
The amp doesn't work on channel a if i new it was broken i would have never bought it Im not happy at all	-1
I purchased 3 of these for our church.  Now only one channel works on 2 of them.  I hope the seller would contact me or be able to replace them.  [...]	-1
Returned same week. Power may be seriously overestimated. My 200W Sansui Stereo receiver sounds better	-1
Used it for two shows, pushing (2) 400 watt (PYLE) passive speakers at approx half volume - and the right channel blew.  It took too long between getting the product and working a few shows for me to still return it.  Pyle is an awesome brand for getting sound equipment on an Amazon budget....but the stuff is reallllllllly unreliable.  Buy three if you only need one, that's your insurance policy and it's still cheaper than the next level up!  :)	-1
Don't even think about this.	-1
Was broken as soon as I got it. Not happy !! But the 3100 Pyle pro is great works good and is durable thus far.	-1
Amp has no power to drive speakers.plus you have to turn it all the way up to get sound.and it cut, s out	-1
Stationed in Australia, so we shipped DPO. first off it will cost more and be a bigger hassle to return from here. Secondly in spite of cautious reviews I thought the law of averages meant more people would complain than praise, so hopefully numbers were skewed, I was mistaken. Pyle evidently has no quality control at all? one channel cuts in and out on our first practice? yes I replaced cables, checked board, this thing fails right outta the box. So disapointed they can sell broken poor quality junk like this? I am just trying to give a few people far from families and home, a little joy and play some music with everyone...? You know we are not getting rich over here, but I can right this off I guess, as I should have known better. I though Amazon would not sell broken poor quality cheap junk as if it is decent working affordable gear... buyer beware, my bad?	-1
CHANNEL A WOULDN'T WORK AND BRIDGE MODE SOUNDED HORRIBLE I CAN SAY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE PERIOD	-1
The only two things I have positive to say about this amp is that its cheap, and very light weight. The negatives, the fan is super loud, it is no where near 1000 watts, it redlights very quickly, very poor sound quality. If you need something cheap to play soft music through some 50-100 watt speakers, just buy a boom box. The fan produces more sound than the amp itself. Dont you it for a PA because people talking or singing into mics  peaks it out really quickly.	-1
I Bought this Item in OCT 2012 I Have only used it twice and the output port is bad on it it sounded pretty good when it did work but the craftsmanship of the item sucks. I learned my lesson only by good quality products where the manufacturer stands behind their items	-1
This is my second one.  The first one I got, I wasn't sure if it was the cables I am using so I bought new cables (twice).  The sound is muffled and low.  Finally confirmed that the receiver is defective so I sent it back to Amazon for replacement.  The replacement came in today.  Alas.  There is sound coming out when I plugged on Channel B!.  Ok.!  Moving along, I tested the bridge setting.  It's working.  So far so good.  Plugged it in Channel A on bridge.  NO SOUND!  Switched back to stereo.  Sound came out on one side.  The Bridge doesn't work when plugged in to Channel.  Conclusion.  Similar to other reviews.  Piece of junk.  Too bad.  The exterior is well built and sturdy.  I was going to buy a pair of 500 Watt Pyle speakers but not anymore.  Spend your money on other brands.	-1
THIS IS AN ADDENDUM TO AN EARLIER REVIEW.........SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING BUT A PYLE POWER AMP....TODAY ON MY 6TH GIG WITH LESS THAN 20 HOURS (AT ABOUT 2-3 HOURS AT A TIME) IT DIED!!!!!!I DJ ON THE SIDE AS A HOBBY AND THIS AMP MADE ME LOOK BAD......NEVER AGAIN..BUY A PEAVEY, CROWN, QSC OR ANYTHING BUT A PYLE.	-1
IVE HAD THIS A TOTAL OF THREE MONTHS AND TODAY IT STARED FADING IN AND OUT WHEN I WAS PLAYING MY KARAOKE MUSIC.  THANK GOD I WAS NOT AT A GIG.  MY ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO GO WITH THE INVESTMENT AND BUY A MARSHALL AMPLIFIER HEAD AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME HEADACHE WITH THIS GARBAGE.  GOOD LUCK WITH ANYTHING THESE DAYS MADE IN CHINA.  I GO THROUGH A NEW AMP EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS BECAUSE IM A PROFESSIONAL SINGER AND IM REALLY GETTING TIRED OF THE GARBAGE THEY SELL TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I bought this little amp because I didn't want to blow out the speaker system hooked up to my computer, and also to have something light enough to carry around without hurting my back when performing outside my home. I had read many of the reviews on this site and decided this Behringer would definitely fit the bill.  Oh, well. It's light, all right - but unfortunately that's the only plus I can come up with. Although I used high-quality cables to hook it up to my Yamaha keyboard, and although I adjusted the low, middle, and high range, and although I set the volume so it was pleasant and not buzzy - none of that really helped with the fair (at best) quality sound that came out of its speaker. As another reviewer wrote, I guess I expected too much of something that's just unable to produce what I need it to.  The speaker system I have hooked up to my computer is a Logitech Z623, and the vibrance and flat response across the board are wonderful indeed. People who hear them are wowed by their fantastic output. Unfortunately, when you compare the sound to the Behringer, it's not even comparable.  Guess I'll stick to my Logitechs for awhile. Lesson learned.	-1
Ive been playing guitar & bass for over 25 years & I also like to D.J. I bought this with intentions to use it bridged to drive a Dayton 15" sub. I never made it there. Testing it I'm running it -2-chanels. side-1 to a pair of full range (5.25" bookshelf speakers)total 4ohm load. & the other channel crossed over to a JBL 10" sub. Both are run through a compressor / limiter. I cant believe how weak this amp is! I can actually push it to start CLIPPING before the cheap 5.25" speakers give out . I also have a CARVIN 1000 watt poweramp that I play bass through & believe me that the PYLE is just a pile. The carvin will push a Eminence 15 with -1- channel & push it to it's max. The voice coil will start to smell & thsts when I turn it down. The Pyle is clipping with no problem & a true 1000 watt amp would melt those 5" speakers within seconds. Save the money & spend it on a quality poweramp About $300 will get you in the REAL 1000watt range.	-1
Not working at all!	-1
I usually don't like giving things a 1-start rating, but I have no option. I got this thing and plugged it in, for nothing to happen. It was pretty much completely dead. It did get it to turn on once, but when i turned it off to move it by my sound equipment, it never turned on again. I could not take the change when I need something that will work every gig. I sent it back for the Behringer EPQ 12000. I have never had a single problem since.	-1
I ordered a wireless PA system from Pyle Pro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. The unit itself worked fine but the antenna for the belt transmitters are poorly mounted and pulled out on both units supplied. I understand that things like this happen but here is the big problem. Customer service is non-existent with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts department that NEVER gets returned. Out of pure frustration I went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. Finally I got a guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me the next Monday. No call came. Again I called and got nasty this time and finally got my order placed through a rude man. I guess that serves me right because I was rude right back out of pure frustration. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. Well second worse, Sears appliance repair takes the top spot on this.	-1
THE AMP CAME DAMAGE WITH A LARGE DENT IN THE TOP AFTER 3 months of play IT STOPED PLAYING STEROE THRU CHANNEL A so I use channel A as mono	-1
The price grabs your attention with this item but I would not recommend this amp. I have already gone through two of these amps.  You get what you pay for with this item.  The first one I had, one of the channels died after about 4 months.  When I got the replacement that one worked for not even a month.  I was at a gig when it died and had to go to my local music store to purchase an amp.  This product is NOT dependable.  Especially if you are DJing weddings or parties.  Spend the money on a GOOD amp.	-1
I got  mine  yesterday and  plugged in, went out and got adapters so I could plug it to my comp and..... nothing. I try different  adapters but I had the right ones the first time. When I turn it on I have to  turn the volume all the way up and it sounds like the speaker wires are crossed. I tried several different ways to get it working  right but it just  don't. Today I'm returning them for a new amp and  hopefully the next works right. Now I know  Pyle isn't the best  brand  out there but I don't have  $500 to get a GOOD amp after I lost my Sony Muteki in pawn, over 1k in that unit, pawned twice + 2 yr insurance on that unit.	-1
As I've heard with the Pyle Pro amps, I received mine today, and it was defective. Only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. The packaging was very good though, so I'm  thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. Already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday...	-1
This PA head has all the "features" you would want. Reverb, delay, 4 channels, etc. However, to get the effects to work to the point where they actually sound like effects requires turning all the control knobs up all the way. Another quirk is if you want only delay, you can't get it unless you turn up the reverb control. What? Anyway I finally got it setup for my practice room with my piano and it sounds good. But this head would never work in a band or rehearsal setting since it's underpowered and the effects are quirky to manage and set. Best bet is to go buy a straight PA head with no effects and then buy a mixer with built in effects. It will cost more but you get what you pay for. BnB Beatles Depot	-1
I am sure the amp head is amazing but didn't get it yet, tracking still says the same thing and pyle trusted Amazon to ship it. So I must blame them both and I am such a loyal customer to both company's . I may just find another supplier	-1
It says "Tapered design allows greater fit to a variety of guitars" and has no mention of hole measurements in the description as of writing this, yet it didn't fit my Palmer guitar's hole, the hole is quite smaller. Now that I go back to the product page I can see some other people have had the same issue. If it's not good for all guitar holes they should at least specify in the description the range of hole sizes for which it will fit.  Also, as others have mentioned, it came with TWO HOLES punched through it to pass the twist tie they used for packaging. Seriously Planet Waves?!? You couldn't find a way to package your product without intentionally damaging it in the process?!? Wow. (If you're wondering about this, look at the review photos, someone else already took a photo of the holes it comes with)	-1
Cheaply made.	-1
ehhh	-1
DEFINITELY does NOT fit a Martin Orchestra size (OOO, or OM) model sound hole which is 3 7/8". Wood made cracking noises trying to get it in pushing in the sides of the rubber with a plastic tool. Yikes!!! The product may work great - couldn't tell you. It also would not fit in my Epiphone DR-212 Dreadnaught. Both common size guitars. Just too big. Obviously so when you look at it.	-1
too hard to fit in the sound hole, seems to be oversized and interfered with my preamp	-1
I work in a music studio. No need to explain why the company that makes these should know better than to shoot two huge holes in this item as a packaging method. A plastic bag would be fine as this hard foam wouldn't be damaged in the shipping process. Also this product is not "ONE SIZE FITS ALL" by a long shot. Measure your guitar hole before ordering and fill the holes with rubber cement.	-1
This is useless to me.	-1
NOT happy at all with this item, doesn't fit any of my guitars. It is extremely larger that any full size hole.	-1
Doesn't reduce sound worth a darn.  I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things.  Muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in dB.	-1
This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar.  I measured the whole at 3 7/8", but this cover does not even come close to fitting!  It measures 4 1/6" in diameter, so check your guitar closely!	-1
firstly, the package arrived on time...thanks for that! secondly, when i opened the package, i did not like how it was presented...why? the product was punctured on two areas for a string to pass through it and be attached at the ad paper/card board that went with it...why does it has to be like that? they should have just placed them on the ad paper and not drill a hole in it...thirdly, the diameter does not fit good on my guitar...it is kinda big...and lastly, when i forced it in placed even though it was not positioned properly in the hole, the sound quality of my guitar was changed...i was completely dissatisfied with the product...sorry! i would not recommend this item to anybody...	-1
I used this thing for one live show and I look down to find black scuff mark all over my guitar!!!!  I guess from where my pick was making contact with it......  I will never use it again	-1
Cumbersome to use.	-1
I really didn't like this case humidifier.  It doesn't hold enough water and didn't last a year before I had to replace it.  I went back to the sound hole sponge type which, despite having to move the strings, does a better job and doesn't need refilling anywhere near as much.  This one also started leaking, which is another problem I don't have with the sponge type.	-1
I bought 4 of these humidifiers, 2 each for my tenor size and soprano size ukulele hard cases. I live in Sedona Arizona where the humidity in the house regularly gets below 20%. Even with 2 oasis humidifiers for each uke, the humidity in the hard case goes down to 30%. Just recently I noticed  I could start to feel the fret wires stick out on the tenor, this is a sure sign of wood shrinkage. So I put 2 pieces of damp sponge (each piece about 1"x2") in the case by the neck and that got the humidity up to 80%. After a day, the neck started to swell again and the wires felt more normal. The point is: 2 oasis humidifiers for 1 uke could not bring up the humidity to normal range, 35% to 55%! Absolutely useless, could not even come close to the effectiveness of an ordinary household sponge! Give me a break Oasis, you charge $20 each for this junk? A ripoff as far as I'm concerned.	-1
I've used various humidifiers in all my cases over the years, mainly in fall and winter when the indoor humidity drops. This one caught my attention last year so I thought I'd get a couple to put in the cases of my old Les Pauls, just to see if they are any better. They both have worked fine until recently when one has decided to leak. The outer fabric is soaked. NO! Not in the case with one of my babies! There is no way to verify what the problem is but I'm sure the bladder has split. Of course, this made the plush lining wet in the case where it sat. Luckily I still had my Planet Waves case humidifier to put back in this ones place. None of them have ever leaked. Unfortunately, those seem to be disappearing from the market place, unless you by one with the humdity sensor which boosts the price way up. I'm sadly disappointed with the Oasis due to the leaking. And since they go for nearly $20 a pop, I won't be buying another.	-1
This review is for the 185 lav when used with the "presenter" receiver which it is normally packed with. Bought this 185 and plugged it into the mixer and it seemed to work so I left for the night. The next day the seminar speaker used it. He stood 20 feet away from the receiver. When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a pillar) it dropped. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, "You ruined the event." I took full responsibility but no, I didn't. Sure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feel like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. The worst part is, for $100 more I could have got the nice RE2 from EV which has awesome ratings and lasts for 10+ years. What the heck was I thinking? I'll never ever buy another sure product as long as I live and neither should you. Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store Chinese junk. What a horrible terrible product experience. Sure, you used to be such an amazing company with a rich audio history, why did you sell your soul to the devil? You ruined my reputation because I banked on you. I won't make that mistake again.	-1
This is a cool pedal. It works as they say, tracking all the way. I'm just old school. Sounds ok. Way too expensive!	-1
Not a good unit had trouble with the output..	-1
GOT ONE AND IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT, DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT AND RETURNED ITEM. got my other one and did my first gig with it and it failed. got hot and quit .  i am returning it and getting a peavey..	-1
Quality 's kind of below standard, even for speech, I'm not gonna even touch on  singing with this thing.  Not loud enough at all even with the volume cranked to the max.  Returned this thing as fast as I could	-1
already explain to the seller that everything was ok, ecepct the guitar input is not loud enought no matter how high you try to raise the volume. mic. 1 & 2 inputs are ok.	-1
It worked all of 2wks then I got another one but with so-called 800 watts, and was pretty much the same junk. I sent it back as well.	-1
OK, Amazon was great, and it arrived in 2 days! However, the previous reviews are right - the wireless mic SUCKS - POS! The sound quality was very poor, it was made of cheap plastic, and it cut out when I got more than a few feet away. So I plugged in my Sennheiser - you need XLR-to-phono cables - and the sound sucked as well. There is no EQ control, and that is a deal breaker for vocals. However, the guitar input was much louder, and my guitar sounded great. I read a review that said they used this on an airfield - whatever! There is no way this puts out much sound beyond filling a small room. I wouldn't even use it for karaoke. I was expecting something bigger and louder. I sent it back.	-1
I never planned to use this for anything heavy and have yet to do so. However, I have used the truss a few times just to hold up a backdrop with my name on it and it sags terribly. The backdrop can't weigh more than 5 pounds and is 10 feet wide, so I know I'm not overloading it. The light stands I have used quite a few times to stick up some par cans and dimmers and they work fine for that.	-1
I'd really like to give this product a better rating because it looks like it is made from decent materials, but I can't because I'm about to return it for the SECOND TIME.  :(  The box that the product is shipped in does not protect the product. The tripods, truss, light bars, and hardware are in plastic and loosely placed in the low quality cardboard box. There is no styrofoam or hardboard to protect the pieces.  Each time I received the package the box looked ripped, re-taped and damaged. Upon opening the first shipment I found that one of the tripod legs had been dented - as if the box had been dropped on it so i returned it.  With the second shipment the pieces had rubbed together during shipping and scratched each other.  I know that I'm going to beat it up using it, but I'd like to start with something that's new and not messed up.	-1
(Very poor quality. You can not really tune it alright. The frets are un-precise. After tuning with strobe tuner each fret is off. I probably give it away for free because it is useless.) 02-22-2014 Sorry for the confusion, this comment was meant for the article "Dean Playmate Mini Acoustic Guitar, 1/2-Size" I was reading all your replies. Very funny! I deserve it :-)  This bag is actually of OK quality . Can't find anything wrong with it. would give it now 4 stars.	-1
The description on this says that it comes strung for right-handed players but can be easily converted for left handed players.  I am right handed.  When I opened this up i saw the it's strung upside down.  The sixth string is at the bottom and then progressively gets thinner.  That's upside down so this is strung for left-handed players bc if you flipped it over it would be correct for a left handed player.  This is stupid.  Why would you write in the description that it's strung for right handed players if it comes strung for left handed players.  I obviously bought this because I don't have a lot of time to practice on my actual guitar, so when I have a break at work or I'm commuting on the subway or train, I can squeeze in some practicing so I obviously don't have the time to screw around with redoing the strings on this to switch them so that they're in the correct order for a right handed player.  This is a waste of time and I'm extremely disappointed for the 50 bucks I paid for this that it's been this much hassle.  This seller obviously doesn't bother to check their products before they go out the door so I won't be purchasing from them again.	-1
Much better success  with the dadario finger exercise piece. Very awkward to hold. Hard to practice with	-1
Being beginner I thought that I can use it while on trips, but not as useful and as a matter of fact I think it ruins my ability to play chords.	-1
The one I received was not threaded, so I could not attach it to my mic stand and use it. Great idea...maybe it was just a fluke. But, just in case, I went with a K&M Quick Release Adapter 23910 instead. It is similar, works great and is unobtrusive. You barely know it's there.	-1
As magnificent as this product is receiving support or having your product authorized again when you upgrade your studio's computer or operating system is non existent. The only way you can receive any kind of help is through a third party yahoo group that you have to join or some random music bulletin board that's so obscure I can't even remember the name of it. There is no support forum on the company website at all in 2011 the time of this review. If you email them for help you will never get a response, PERIOD! You have to call them long distance and leave a message and sometime within the next 2 weeks they either call back or blow you off. I've had my software in a commercial studio down as long as 6 weeks with several voice mails left on the support line (no one has ever answered).  I've asked the owner a man named Eric Persing who is nothing short of a complete genius at NAMM and in the Yahoo group publicly (as many others have) about the support and the technologies they are using. The people around him become outright hostile at the inquiry this online, ask him at NAMM face to face and boy watch out! It's like having a lawn gnome threaten you with a whooping. It's the Emperor's new clothes I've never seen anything like it. A software company without support in this day and age on the company website? They're a software company!  Spectrasonics Makes some of the most cutting edge products in the industry but without proper technical support how can the software with any longevity be of any use? I hold a BSc CIS and have 20 years experience in information systems pertaining to digital media, Multi Media and am both Logic and Pro Tools certified. I've never seen anything like it. If your name isn't Quincy Jones or Baby Face Edmonds you're wasting your money, these people could care less about you.  I want this review to be completely honest and is respect to spectrasonics defense they have done some really nice things for their customers. They have taken their $500 sample library and offered it to customers for $100. My opinion is that at the price they weren't selling a lot of them and the sounds should have been included in the software at purchase but still that's a very nice thing to do. They have also given upgrades for RMX for free for several years. One so significant it should have been a paid upgrade. Their Trilogy Bass emulator software is nothing short of genius and their Omnisphere Synth blows everything out of the water in the industry hands down.  But again I say what good is it if you can't receive tech support for software you've paid for if it doesn't work?  Bottom line as a studio owner RMX has cost me money in canceled sessions because they refuse to answer email and won't return phone calls if any for weeks. What are you supposed to tell a video game company or a movie studio when you can't make your deadline? Uhhh we're waiting for spectrasonics to authorize our software?  I say it again the Emperor's new clothes, it's ludicrous. I cannot in good conscious recommend Spectrasonics software to anyone.	-1
The description here describes two different units.  The DP-02 and the DP-02 CF (compact flash) The DP-02 is the more expensive unit with a 40gb hard drive.  The unit being sold here is the DP-02CF .  Not the one with the 40gb hard drive.	-1
Theses are extremely lacking in range and fail to capture the full range of sound, this is most noticeable in the higher frequencies. They are also very quiet even for speakers of this small size. The lack of volume makes them unsuitable for most purposes.	-1
I purchased these monitors and used them a few times to test out - they sounded good enough for their size.  But, after not using them for 4 months I finally installed them in a vocal booth and after just 1 day of moderate use the power supply blew out.  No power, no blue light, nothing.  There is still some spark visible when I plug the cord into socket so there is some power going into the box, but nothing works.  This is apparently a known issue with Alesis and I've read other reports of similar problems which is a design flaw in the power supply board.  Don't waste your time or money.	-1
I hemmed and hawed about buying a pair of self-powered monitors versus a Dayton T-amp with a pair of Dayton bookshelf speakers (both very well reviewed on various audiophile discussion boards), which would have come in at just around a hundred bucks, but finally decided against it due to the sheer size of the speakers, plus the additional tangle of cords/cables that would entail.  Then I started to read up on the M-Audio AV30s and AV40s, but kept hearing persistent complaints about poor reliability...so when I finally stumbled upon these, I was totally stoked by the price and the form factor---these are somewhere in the middle in terms of size between 6.5" bookshelf speakers like the Daytons, and your typically tiny and tinny-sounding 2" computer speakers.  These M1s have 3" woofers, so of course you're not going to get thumping bass---since I despise techno and most forms of rap/house anyway (mostly listen to jazz, classical, and vocal/guitar-dominated rock and folk), this was not an issue.  Though I have to agree with the other reviewers that what bass they do put out is quick, tight and accurate.  But the real magic is in the tweeters: they are full 1" silk domes, which is exactly what you want for stunning detail and clarity and imaging.  I have no idea why the Amazon listing for this product neglects to mention this outstanding fact.  Even the Dayton full-size bookshelf speaker has only a 3/4" tweeter, and what few 2.0 computer speakers that have tweeters, usually have only 1/2 to 3/4" tweeters---this often produces a smeared and veiled quality to the upper mids and highs.  You usually have to pay $300 and up to get a 1" tweeter in a pair of decent bookshelf speakers.  Just like the run of the mill Logitechs and Altec Lansings, Bose's computer speakers have 2" single drivers as do their home theater "jewel cubes"---hence the common ditty, "No highs, no lows, it must be Bose."  The Alesis tweeter is also remarkable for its non-fatiguing smoothness...I can listen to these speakers for hours and hours without the notorious "listener fatigue" that results from overly bright tweeters and their over-the-top treble.  There is a bass boost switch you can turn on, but like all "bass boost" settings, this simply exaggerates the mid-bass and creates a very unnatural sound---which, sadly enough, is what too many consumers are used to these days.  So if you like a smiley-shaped EQ curve (bass and treble maxed out), these are probably not the speakers for you...get a Klipsch or Logitech or Altec Lansing 2.1 system instead.  The other standout feature on these speakers that sealed the deal for me was the USB connection. Most computer speakers connect with the 1/8" headphone jack...which means that they are using your computer's built-in soundcard, which usually are mediocre at best, and on many lower-end laptops can be absolutely horrible (hissy and shrill).  With a USB connection, you are sidestepping the internal sound card and having the speakers' convert the signal directly, which yields by far the purest, noise-free sound output possible.  Standalone USB DACs (Digital Audio Converters) which do the same thing can go anywhere from $30 for the cheapest to several hundred bucks...so to have this already included in the system is really a HUGE treat!  Now, to put this into perspective: these are NOT party speakers!  If you are dumb enough to try to use them in that capacity, you deserve to be bummed out.  They are also not home theater speakers, so while their voice reproduction is top-notch, you are not going to get deep rumbles and wall-shaking explosions (you really need a sub for that, in any case).  They are designed for nearfield listening at low to moderate volumes (about 70db tops).  They are not quite audiophile grade, but definitely mid-fi, which means several notches above the typical $50-200 computer speakers you are going to find at Best Buy if a balanced, accurate sound is what you are looking for...for eighty three bucks they are an absolute STEAL!  UPDATE 10/19/12: I received the first Alesis speakers on October 9th, at which point I wrote the above review...LOVED them.  Less than a week later, the right speaker suddenly died for no apparent reason...I was using it only lightly, and with the volume only at the 9 to 10 o'clock position.  So, I figured this was just the luck of a draw, everyone gets a lemon once in a while.  So I shipped it back to Amazon, they had a new on my doorstep by 10/18...and guess what?  This time, the right speaker was DEAD ON ARRIVAL!!!  ARRRRRRRGH!!!  I am wondering if I should go through the process one more time, or try something else.  Really really annoying because I otherwise love the sound quality!  Nothing else in this ballpark comes even close...but why oh why was the QA on this product so horrible???  0 for 2...I'm sorry Alesis, I'm looking elsewhere now.  Downgraded rating from 5 to 2 stars.	-1
The sound was pretty good, while they lasted..  After three days, the volume control began to scratch and fade. Within a week the right speaker stopped working, yet headphones work fine (through the front panel jack) so I know its not an audio source or input issue.  As another reviewer mentioned, I too was instructed by Alesis to ship the speakers (at my expense) to an "authorized" repair facility in another state. Because these speakers were cheap, the cost to ship the item doesnt justify getting them repaired.  Bottom line, these speakers are junk, and Alesis tech support is useless. I will NEVER buy another Alesis product.	-1
Even with a proper mouth piece, this instrument fails to create anything close to a proper bugle sound. Just as others have said, it's for decoration.	-1
I was pretty disappointed with the sound quality out of this mic. The directional pattern mostly works but it's really short and almost any mic in my apartment (including built in mic on my iPhone) has better sound quality and reproduction.	-1
I ordered this thinking what do i have to loose. This is not worth the box it came in. It creates huge amounts of frequencies. There is no such thing as clear sound with this piece of junk.	-1
I bought this capo because it was advertised for "curved" necks. However, this capo has a flat edge and does not work on a curved fretboard. My 1968 Rickenbacker 360 has a curved fretboard which prevented my trusty Shubb capo from working properly. This capo will not work any better. This capo otherwise works OK, but I prefer the compact and fast-acting Shubb design.  Don't buy this if you have a curved fretboard.	-1
Horrible.  Wasted my money on this CHEAP thing.	-1
This thing is all sharp edges and cheap feel, and the "rubber" piece is more like plastic. Combine that with the overly-flat radius, and it's kind of a pain to make it work well. I'll stick with Shubb and Keyser.	-1
PROS: It is a triangle shape. It comes with a beater.  CONS: It sounds terrible. What I wanted was a crisp, high, single tone. This is more like the sound in cartoons when characters' heads get hit with a hammer.	-1
This kind of tuning fork is not durable, and over a short period of time it went flat by fifteen cents. I could not use it to tune pianos.	-1
This is supposed to be a 440 hz tuning fork. It's not. It's around 447 hz. Other than that...it's got okay sustain, I guess. We'll see how re-tuning it with a file goes.	-1
Don't waste your time and money with these very poor quality wind screens. You get what you pay for. The foam on these is extremely thin and brittle. The foam tore apart as I very carefully attempted to place these screens on my standard size ball mics. I returned them for a refund. Ironically, the product name is "tour grade." Not even close!	-1
The product was offered at a very reasonable price.  Unlike my other foam windscreens, this one arrived incredibly brittle. It tore as soon as I put it on the microphone.  The color washed out and closer to teal than pea pod green.  Considering how similar in pricing many windscreens are (low), you may want to spend another buck and get some that don't tear apart so easily.	-1
This is really a toy. It is hard to get sound out of it for beginners.	-1
In the product description, it is labeled as Grover, but the packaging says it is a Trophy Toy brand. The sound is less than the snoopy toy harp. The volume is great if you don't want to annoy someone that is sitting in the same room as you can hardly hear it.  After reading the product reviews, I even opted for one day shipping since the price was so good.  Save yourself the time and disappointment, and spend the extra $20 for a real one.  I suggest googling for a good brand (they can be bought in any key for $25)	-1
This thing could not make much sound.  It was frustratingly quiet.	-1
the flange is to soft and bends to easy interfering with the vibration.  Very hard to play, but if you can do it, it sounds good	-1
week sounding.	-1
The end of this is sharp and I cut my finger and in the process also cut my lip. I don't care for the sound quality and last of all the reed is almost heavy paper thin. With the sharp edge and flimsy reed it's almost dangerous to me. I have many mouth harps and I would place this on the bottom of playable harps.	-1
I got this as part of a birthday gift for my husband. He liked it until he started to use it. He says you could hear a metal piece hitting where it shouldn't. I couldn't hear what he was talking about but he's had them before and I haven't so I'll just have to believe him.	-1
I sent back TWO of these lights after the Blue LED's just died in the middle of a show, followed by uncontrollable Blinking. Still have NOT received any credit or Replacement from Amazon...do NOT waste your time.	-1
It's cheap. And not amazing.	-1
The illustrations for this in the ad make it seem like the pattern covers a wide expanse; unless you're hanging it from 12 or 15 feet, it really doesn't, and quite honestly, comes off as quite hokey. I thought you could control the patterns, such that if you found one you liked, you could freeze it and leave it be. Not so. There are two modes; manual, which automatically changes the pattern, and audio, which changes the pattern per beat from music. There is a sensitivity knob, but that really just controls how fast the patterns change. And speaking of the patterns, I like the full on dots mode, but after that, it circulates through a bunch of straight line patterns, that for me were frankly boring.  Sadly, I'm returning my unit. As some reviewers said, it might be good for a fun party at home, a faux disco night event or something, I have no qualms about that and don't mean to disparage Chauvet at all, but forget about it for a DJ show with more than a couple dozen people, or band performance, you'd get laughed at...	-1

yes. this mixer was great until it just suddenly stops working for maybe after a year or two! I am so devastated with this. I do music vocal recoridngs and this one just stops working, it means i need ot buy another expensive pre amp? huh	-1

I should have known better. I have been playing diatonics for over 50 years. I have owned mostly Hohners, from the cheap, childhood instruments I learned on to Special 20s, and a Hohner Blues Harp that I have had for decades and still plays dependably, probably because it was my "car harp" and only got played at the occasional traffic light.  After retirement, I decided I could be a bit extravagant. I purchased the Suzuki SCX-64C because of the reviews, the reputation, and the comments in several reviews on the mouthpiece.  Mechanically, it has been great, but musically, it has been horrible. All low notes respond at their preferred pressure, and each seems to require its own particular pressure; the upper notes require increasing pressure, with the highest requiring extreme pressure. Worse, many of the low reeds fail with the least attempt at volume, while others seem fully responsive over a wide dynamic range.  In brief, it is an inexcusably uneven instrument with numerous defective reeds that I foolishly tolerated trusting that it was my ineptness rather than the instrument. After numerous attempts to get this thing to play, I'm convinced it is the instrument.  Not sure what I'm going to do with this overpriced piece of junk, if I can't find an instrument repair shop that can even it out a bit.  My recommendation would be to skip Amazon and buy locally. Had I done so, I could have established a trail of complaints and likely gotten some resolution long ago.  Physical configuration notwithstanding, if I try another chromatic, it will be a Hohner.	-1
Once the air temperature drops to about 70 F, the reeds are slow to respond.  Also, the first two draw holes were flat upon arrival (FUA) :)  Sent it back.  Still a big Amazon fan.	-1
I was disappointed with this harmonica.  I expected really high quality.  I am new to harmonicas, but I do have a sense of when something is wrong.  The second hole sounds more like a dull buzz.  The noise is not crisp at all.  And the fourth or fifth hole changes pitch when I blow into it.  The instrument does not sound bad if I blow into several holes at once to produce a chord.  But if I am going to play melodies--which is what is typically done with a chromatic--I am out of luck.  I mistakenly thought there were no reviews, but that must have been another product.  I am now seeing there are good reviews.  I do not know what went wrong.  I must have gotten unlucky.  I am returning this harmonica.  I am going to try a Swan chromatic with good reviews.  I hope I get a good one.	-1
Didn't like these strings.	-1
Totally subjective opinion; I just didn't like these.  I am a fan of GHS strings, I use GHS boomers quite a lot.  These say GHS boomers on the front, but they are not like regular GHS boomers.  Maybe I got a bum package that was stale or something??  Half price of regular boomers so I thought I was getting a deal, but I think I got bait and switched!	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price.	-1
I ordered this distortion pedal as a cheap alternative to the costly Boss foot pedals.  When it arrived and the Behringer 9 volt adaptor I also ordered wouldn't plug in all the way, rendering both items useless, I realized that you really do get what you pay for.  I'd advise everyone to save themselves a headache by steering clear of Behringer pedals and stick with the tried and true pedals made by Boss.	-1
I was in need of a distortion pedal for my guitar seeing as how the one I've used for years broke. However, I've been low on cash lately so to save some money I bought this after reading some glorious reviews. So I ordered this thinking it would do at least a decent job, but upon using it, first I'd like to stress how confusing it was to install the battery. It's not like most pedals, and there were no clear instructions on how to do it. I went through three of my friends and my dad before we finally figured out how to install the battery. And our work was put to shame, because while this would probably be a good product for a beginner or practicing guitarist, it had very mediocre sound, and there was far too much feedback for it's own good. Adjustments to it's settings did not seem to make much of a difference. So while this might be a good idea if your low on money or are just a beginning guitarist, I would not recommend it for anyone experienced or planning to record or perform.	-1
We compared this pedal with a Metal Zone by Boss using the same power supply (9v Dunlop) and this one was pretty noisy and had a lot of feadback in any position (regarding the position of the guitar and the amplifier). Maybe it would not produce undesire noise using batteries... It doesn't sound that great, but the price is unbeatable!!	-1
Good	-1
If you're after a true jazz sound (I'm not talking about smooth jazz or fusion, but a real straight-ahead bebop, warm and rich jazz tone, using a clean, undistorted amp) do NOT buy these strings.  Even with the treble on the amp at only 25% and only a neck pickup, they made my 17" hollow body archtop sound like a banjo: Overly bright and twangy, with all kinds of annoying finger noise.  I always had used flats before this, but I thought I'd try "pure nickel" because the price was right, the reviews looked good, and I'm adventurous!  But never again. They have no business calling these "jazz" strings. Going back to Thomastik-Infeld George Benson flat wound GB114's (14-55 gauge).  They're flat, fat and silky smooth and give that nice mellow and rich jazz sound. They're also a lot more money, but they last forever, and actually sound better after they've been on your guitar for a few years!  I keep going back to those after experimenting with other types.  Don't cheap out:  They're expensive for a reason: QUALITY!	-1
The product description says "Spandex Material" but you should know this is not made of what I would call "typical" Spandex used for clothing that would be of much higher weight/thread-count and as another reviewer stated, if it were to get snagged on anything it appears it will likely leave a hole.  In fact, if you wore clothing made out of this in public you'd likely get arrested!  You can easily see right through the material.  I'd say either buy a cheap bath towel at 1/4 the price or look for a vinyl cover if you can find one.  The only advantages I see are 1) that it has adjustable (via a pull string) elastic around the edges to keep it in place; and 2) it comes with an attached built in pouch to stuff the entire cover back into if you were to travel with your keyboard; however, given the pouch is all of 5" x 6" that should tell you how thin the actual cover's material is (another reviewer said it was 3"x3"x4" but it's a bit larger than that and only expands due to the Spandex, otherwise it's flat).	-1
I was expecting a durable cover, but this thing is made of delicate material that looks like it would snag easily. If it gets caught on a corner or my cat decides to play with it, a hole will definitely appear. It succeeds in keeping dust off the keyboard, but that is about it.	-1
The instructions were fairly easy to follow (if you are familiar with doing this kind of thing) and the components are high quality. It takes 2 or 3 hours to do this mod if you check the pedal after changing every 3 or 4 components to make sure you are not messing it up. The distortion side of the pedal is almost useable after modding. You lose the harshness you get when you turn the tone up, which is good, because you need to run it with a good bit more treble on the tone than before. So far, I'm not impressed and somewhat disappointed.  I was VERY disappointed with what it did to the overdrive side. If you turn the mix to the OD side, it sucks the gain out and you end up with less than 25% of the gain you had before. You also have to dime the tone to get anything out of it. When you turn the mix to about 25% up, it begins highly favoring the distortion side. That's good, because this side of the pedal is worthless now.  If you prefer the overdrive side of this stock pedal, run away, because this mod will ruin your pedal. If you prefer the distortion side of the this stock pedal, still, run away. If you just want to mod a pedal for the experience and have no standards for what it sounds like afterward, then maybe you should give it a try.  7/20/2015 UPDATE: I all but stopped using this pedal after I modded it, partially because the mod neutered it and partly because I bought a Tech21 DD3X Mod pedal, which is far superior in every imaginable aspect. So last night (2.5 years after modding), I pulled my pedal apart and returned it to near stock condition. I say "near stock" because I left a cap in that was the same value and left the diodes in because they affect the sound in no manner whatsoever. The info that comes with this kit does not help if you want to restore your pedal to a useful state, so you will need to do your homework if you don't like this mod (I can't imagine you would) and want to undo it. I found a schematic online that had a couple of mistakes, but I was able to use it.  After listening to the pedal back in it's stock form again, I had to lower my review from 2 to 1 star and revise comments that were far too kind. The pedal is once again useable as more than a paperweight. It's not the greatest dirt pedal now, but I'll maybe use it occasionally now.  Now that I know much more about pedal modding and pedal building, I would never buy a Fromel kit again. Many of the changes you make with this kit make no sense. Some of them are not even in the signal path. Some suck the gain out. Others suck the tone out. Sure, the components are a little better quality than stock, but the tiny difference those parts make are undetectable in a distortion pedal without seeing them on an oscilloscope. I don't know about you, but I use my pedals for what they do to the sound, not to see a little different jagged line on a screen.	-1
Nothing like their older units from the 80's and early 90's. I have an old beat up one I bought new back in 88 and it is a smoother and warmer with a natural tube breakup and push. These new ones sound smothered and artificial. Sorry but the new one is back in the box and on a shelf.	-1
I went with Boss because of their rugged construction but, so far, I have had nothing but trouble. This pedal is noisy. I've had to reconfigure the order of my pedals, had to deal with all kinds of hum and high pitched beeping. I've had this pedal several weeks and have yet to even successfully play with it.	-1
This is the 1st new production Mullard I bought to use in V3 of a Peavey Classic 50 combo, phase invertor. Seemed to be a low gain or output problem in this application. I got it for it's "clean" reputation but I guess it is a bit too clean.	-1
Returned. After looking closely at the soldering connections I decided to go with a new higher end tube.	-1
I bought this by mistake ,tried it out . Amp works good again but it sounds flat , no rich harmonics . Like the description says for hi fi .	-1
ok	-1
Cheap construction.  The tripod tightening bolt at the bottom stripped on two of the three units I purchased.  I sent the units back for a full credit.	-1
I ordered 2 of these stands.  The first one didn't stay up when I tightened it.  I tried the 2nd stand and it seemed to work OK but they are very cheaply made so I sent them both back for a refund.	-1
One light burnt out within a week of owning it.	-1
I hate to give anything a bad review. Everything that had a small buzz, still has a buzz. Cords all tested. Multiple plug ins and the lights are nice...	-1
The lights get super hot. The bulbs burn out fast. I will try to replace them with LED if not, they're just power strips.	-1
I bought this instead of the Rogue RA-090 by accident. This was a horrible guitar and I sent it back immediately. The action was way too high, and the intonation was terrible up the entire neck. It has no adjustable truss rod like the RA-090, so there was nothing I could do. If you're in the market for a cheap guitar, spend $10 more and go for the RA-090.	-1
The guitar I received was unplayable.  The action was so high that merely fretting a chord pulled the instrument out of tune.  The intonation on the lower strings was way off.  I returned it.	-1
High string action. Intonation is ok for a smaller size guitar. It is not a 3/4 size guitar which is fine. The bridge does not use pins to hold in the strings but ball end type strings are used and they slip through the slot on the bridge. I bought this for my son but he does not like it because the strings are too high on the neck. I plan to return this beautiful guitar and get him something else that, hopefully will be easier for him to play.--For me I give it only 2 stars due to playability. The guitar is not a toy but it is difficult for a beginner to play.  UPDATE: Not very pleased with seller's approach to handling customer service and unhappy customers. I got a return authorization. I have to pay the shipping back to seller. UPS wanted about $27 to ship to seller. Too high. I paid about $50 for the guitar. Took the guitar to the US post office and shipped for about $16. Plus, with the RA from seller they will debit from my refund about $7 for the initial shipment to me. I lost money on this deal and got nothing for it other than a bad taste in my mouth for the seller---WOODWIND AND BRASSWIND--which I will give ONE STAR ONLY and will avoid at all cost for any future purchases here on Amazon...I'll stick with Music123 when possible for they are responsive and offer and honor their coupons.	-1
These speakers worked great for 14 months. Last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again.	-1
On the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing.  They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.  They don't sound horrible.  I mean, they are not computer speakers or anything.  The sound is very forward, I would say harsh.  That's not uncommon among studio monitors.  There is definitely a lot of clarity here.  Not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size.  There's a few schools of thought on studio monitors.  Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker.  These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first.  I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this.  Any flaws would be quite noticeable.  I previously used KRK RP8's so I can compare these to them.  Granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors.  I liked them better than these.  They were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.  I was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if I could improve the situation...BUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on.  The buzz increases in volume over time.  I tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power).  Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.  Maybe Behringer 3031a's or something.  I think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor.	-1
Sound nice, but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.  I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.  2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.  I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.  I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on, and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.  I am back to using my 20-20's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.  M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over!	-1
It really look's great, But to much air is leaking between alu.comb and reed plate, I took a little flashlite put in 1-10 holes and 4-8 I saw lite out back side, NOT SATISFIED with this Harp	-1
I would not recommend this  Suzuki Harmonica to anyone. I went to use this harmonica and no sound came out. Nothing but air came out, no sound. I returned this immediately to Amazon.	-1
Something about this harp I don't like, I think because it seems narrow.  The sound is good but not great in my opinion.	-1
I've been trying out lots of different harmonicas recently, which has given me a great opportunity to compare and contrast.  The Promaster just strikes me as a mediocre harmonica, despite it's high-end name and price.  It certainly looks great (aluminum comb!) and has a nice looking case.  And the notes that play, play well, and have a very distinctive sound to them, almost smokey.  But like the Suzuki Bluesmaster, I find that some notes just don't play, irrespective of technique or tweaking the reeds.  Overall, I don't regard that as any better than the Bluesmaster, just nicer looking.	-1
Too bad the reeds go out in a few weeks just like ever other G Harmonica regardless of price range or quality.	-1
Very underwhelming, sound and quality.  Looks nice, though.  Frets were all about 1/8" too long and were razor sharp.  There are cheap guitars and then there are cheap guitars.  This one is the latter.  Returned.  Will not be buying a Dean Vendetta again.  Cheers.  P.S.  Check out the Squire Tele Affinity guitar.  It's selling on Amazon for about $180 and sounds and looks great.  I would buy it again any day.  Also, the Epiphone Les Paul Special II and 100 guitars.  I have both and they are good low end guitars ($170 and $270, respectively).  BTW, I've spend 100 hours looking at guitar prices in stores and online, and Amazon's prices are either the same or lower on every guitar which I've compared prices.  Good luck	-1
this product works great for about 2 months and then suddenly stopped working. i tried replacing the batteries and i also checked to see if the batteries corroded inside the product, no corrosion was present. i am very disappointed with this product and  am also sad that i am unable to have this product replaced or refunded.	-1
since it cheap I wanted to tried it out as if last about couple months, but unfortunately I didn't even get to use it and had to return ( which didn't work at all). I really hope my comment will help stop someone from spending $$$ unless you don't mind spend just $12 for nothing. NOTICE, THEY WILL CHARGE U THE RETURNING MAIL Fee.	-1
Received this unit at 2pm on a Saturday  after hours, four hours later and still unable to get it to work.  Registered unit then downloaded the software when clicking run it locked up and stopped.   I knew then I was going to be wasting a lot of time trying to get it to run again. Since you only have one download  license you can't download it again, it's  dead in the water.  .  Went back and read the license again and maybe it will allow you to download on two Computers with up to four downloads.  Getting desperate and not knowing how this download program look at my computer to determine if it's installed,  I deleted the download from the download folder thinking that a new  download would not see a copy already on my computer and indicate I already had a copy and would not install .  Half hour later I noticed  Presonus sent me an email indicating I could activate it by clicking on the link.  I don't want to activate it  since it's deleted.  Tried in vain to download the program again and refused to do so  since it has already downloaded.  If you're having issues with Presonus the web site is a joke. As last got a download that is missing dill's  still won't run. Customer email  support three days and still waiting after creating two tickets. THEY DON'T CARE.	-1
didnt work had to return it	-1
I don't want to totally kill this thing, it looks good and is set up nicely. However... ...it was completely INcompatible with our MacBook Air + El Capitan (probably because the USB3s don't recognize this USB2-based unit - although the USBs are supposed to be designed to be backwards compatible, I found retrospectively several warnings about this issue on techboards).  Presonus tech support also replied to our questions by informing us that they considered the 'Air' to be a portable laptop and therefore 'not suitable for serious recording projects, and thus it is not supported'. Not an explicit answer, but sometimes you have to read between the lines. We just wanted Mac Air users to be aware of this.	-1
Do Not Buy! I got this as a starter interface. It really makes it difficult to actually do any kind of recording with this as the mic pre's are so sensitive that even a low output guitar will clip the input with the gain turned all the way down. It has the same issue with Any line input, Di, etc. As some other reviewer stated, it doesn't work well with the SM57/SM58......which are only two of the most common mics EVER!!! Chances are if you are buying a starter interface, you are picking up one of those mics to go with it. I purchased mine at Guitar Center for a little over $100 several years ago. I recently found two Shure variable pads which actually make this device halfway usable. Those cost me $35 each... so had I known, I would have just bought a decent $200 dollar interface and been done with it. I understand the concept of use what you have and don't spend too much time researching and buying gear because you can just invest the time in making and recording music and learning how to do that well, but please, read all of the one star reviews and don't buy this. I tried and tried and tried and tried to make stuff work with this... I'm an engineer that builds satellite uplink facilities, mind you...... and this thing is just not worth using. Other issues are the poor quality of the headphone amplifier and it not supporting certain impedances of real headphones. I have found crosstalk issues on the input monitoring/playback blend. I would far rather just monitor my input through software. I could go on and on, but I'll just give you some suggestions that worked for me to replace this. I picked up an Apogee Jam for a guitar interface and an Apogee Mic 96k for a condenser mic. Both USB powered and are small and compact and easy to travel with. get a decent pair of headphones or IEM's for a bit of isolation and you can do a lot with these two things. When I go on longer trips, I even pack my Fender Greta tube amp and actually mic it with the Apogee Mic. It's wonderful and sounds excellent. I picked up a pop filter for doing vocals on it. I've recorded drums with it too and it even came out sounding better and clearer than the 5 drum mics run into a mixer which had its outputs run into.....yep. you guessed it. The AudioBox. If I were to start over from scratch and was looking for something portable and inexpensive, I would get an Apogee ONE. It's basically a Jam and Apogee Mic in one box. Even has an XLR in and you can use the mic and guitar in at the same time. If you need two mic pre's, I would go for a Duet. A bit more expensive, but well worth it for the extra I/O. If you want a really solid desktop interface, pick up a Universal Audio Apollo Twin Duo Thunderbolt. You won't be disappointed, nor will you have to replace it. You can even add more I/O via ADAT. Whatever you decide to get, just don't get this AudioBox.	-1
I bought this item by the recommendation of a sales person at a guitar store.  I can't tell you if it is a good product or not because I can't get the driver to load into my Windows 10 PC with 64 bit operating system.  Here are 2 recommendations the tech support person told me: 3. Visit your computer manufacturer's page and check for updates to the following ~USB controllers ~Chipset/motherboard ~BIOS  4. If all else fails then you will want to either do a system restore as far back as possible or reinstall your OS. We have seen a number of install failures on HP computers and the only 100% fix is this.  Did you see that..."reinstall your OS"  You got to be kidding!  I reviewed their forums regarding the error message I received and saw that I was not the only one who has had this problem.  As far as I could tell, no one was able to find a satisfactory solution.  This problem has been around for months, if not years and still hasn't been resolved by driver/software updates.  I think this company caters to Apple compatible products primarily, and secondarily to PC compatible products.  So, if you have a PC, you might do better to find something else manufactured by a company who makes products with PC compatibility at the forefront of their attentions.	-1
After very little use, my input 1 stopped working. Besides, I get A LOT of Radio Interference. Unfortunately, I can't recommend. It work only as a door step.	-1
As other reviewers have stated, the instrument inputs on this box are SO hot that with the Audiobox instrument input controls set at 0 (literally 0), my guitar STILL clips, giving unwanted distortion to clean settings (forget trying to get sparkling clean tones outta this box entirely). I can even hear a distinctly unpleasant "fizziness" on highly distorted settings (again, with the Audiobox instrument inputs controls set at 0). I don't know what more needs to be said. :P  The guys at GC tried really hard to get me to buy the Scarlett for only $50 more (they said it TOTALLY blew away the Audiobox)...but it was one of those occasions when I literally ONLY had $100 to spend...and it was only for a temporary (hopefully) fix of my system.  I have since resuscitated my Rig Kontrol (Windows 8.1 driver issues...headdesk...headdesk...headdesk) and am lovin' the clean tones and lack of fizziness!  Bottom Line: AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!	-1
I got this product a few years back and could never get it to work right, and I work with computers all the time. I kept getting noise going through it, all the time. I deadened my mic on my PC, I turn volumes all the way down. Finally after about a year and a half of it being a paper weight  I noticed this little mixer knob in the middle. If you turn it one way it's Monitoring, and you turn it the other it's Mixing. Little did I know, if you put it in the middle you could do both. It was a real pain in my crack, but once I got that figured out, it was usable. The other thing is recording direct guitar can be a nightmare, the signal was always to hot. I found out that I have to back off the volume on my guitar, and turn down the Main channel volume on the Interface, to make the signal work. I record direct, so I like to use Amplitude for my effects, and even with a good PC, and the setting set to low latancy, I still have some while using distortion and luckily I haven't had anything that I needed real precise, or it wouldn't happen. I'd love to record with my guitar turned up, because I love to back off for various tones, but it's hard with my volume down so far. I seem to get pretty good sounds with Ampltude 3 and it has an Economy settle to put less stress on my pc, which helps. Hope my insight and misery will help someone else.	-1
I recently bought the Audiobox USB. The salesman at Sam Ash Music said it had served him well, and when comparing similar products by competitors that were around the same price range, he said this is the one.  I think he meant well. I do not think he deliberately deceived me. i think he probably only used it on an OS no newer than Windows 7, or he may have used it on a MAC.  Yes, I had the perennial "unknown device" issue when I tried to install. What is interesting is that I normally just tear open the wrapper, decimate the box, take it out, plug it in and get to work, but not this time. This time for some unknown reason, I took the time to read the installation instructions. I downloaded software and driver updates and then proceeded to install the unit. I got the "unknown device".  After a few uninstall/reinstall attempts over a night, morning and early afternoon, even following the multiphase procedure on the support page, i submitted a service request ticket.  Here is where I decided that Presonus is not my idea of a good product provider. I see a lot of discussion about this problem. So, it is obvious that Presonus is aware of the problem. Yet, there is no one available over the weekend to help customers through the issue. What if it is a procedure to follow or a file to download or even an issue that can be resolved via remote access? All of these would be fine. Then if there is no resolution the customer at least feels like Presonus cares about their customers enough to at least try. I am then not opposed to buying other Presonus product.  I am not unrealistic. I know, sometimes even expect, products to fail prematurely or even to not work at all. However, what i do not expect is the company leaving their niche customer community without help from 5:00 p.m. Friday to 9:00 a.m. Monday morning (Central Time). maybe this is not an issue to some, but this is far below the "fails to meet the standard" grade in customer service for me. Does Presonus realize that there are competitors, very strong competitors, in the market? Does Presonus realize that once a customer has paid for the Presonus product, the $50 or so difference in price between theirs and a competitor's more expensive offering is not so great a chasm anymore?  When I train sales professionals, I always tell them that mishaps and errors are almost inevitable. However, these are not what break business relationships. It is the lack or poor execution of a plan to address them. Presonus has made it into my "what would be your response as a customer, if... ?" lessons.  I think it is obvious what my response was. I uninstalled all of the software, and once the replacement process is complete, I will de-register everything and delete my Presonus account.  I am not angry. I am disappointed.	-1
NOTE: I originally bought an AudioBox USB as part of an audio package but needed to re-order a separate AudioBox and wanted to warn other potential buyers.  Here's why:  Upon setup, the PreSonus AudioBox USB wasn't being recognized by my MacAir (supposed to be plug/play).  I am comfortable with tech equipment but still thought it could have been my mistake.  I called the PreSonus tech line and was on hold for 35 minutes until closing time and then got a cheerful recording that they were closed and I should call back during business hours.  Okay, I'm still stuck so I called back the next day and waited about 40 minutes this time -- I don't blame the techs, they are understaffed.  When I finally got a tech he did a quick diagnostic and announced "Yes, your AudioBox has a problem and we are aware of it.  We've had a problem with some units recently."  Great.  (BTW, how many is "some" units?  A hundred?  A thousand?)  He then told me to "call Amazon" about the return.  What?  Your company made the defective equipment and I wasn't going to re-pack the mic, cables, pop-filter, stand, headphones (from the full audio package I originally bought) just to return the AudioBox.  When I called back and spoke with a supervisor to get a phantom Return Authorization I was told the same thing.  The best he could do was "send me a form" so they would consider repairing it but he wouldn't even commit to a matter of weeks for turnaround.  Super.  They even wanted me to provide them with the unit's serial number so they could "track the problem".  Apparently track but ignore.  (If they are defective, recall them or do the right thing and replace without hassle.)  Finally, because I was stuck with everything else, I ordered a new AudioBox (on its own, a separate order from Amazon) and then returned the old one in its place.  (I would have ordered a different brand but then I couldn't have returned the first AudioBox.)  Thankfully, the second AudioBox was not a lemon, too.  Amazon handled the solo return perfectly and amazingly fast.  The refund was in my account the day after an easy UPS pick-up.  Really happy with Amazon but don't count on PreSonus.  Even their beloved software set-up was needlessly annoying -- do you really need a 28-digit key code???  This isn't a nuclear launch.  Also, the "Studio One Artist 2" software was overly convoluted (just the name hints at that -- call it "1" or "2" but not both).  Crappy manual as well.  I ended up using their hardware but with Mac's GarageBand which was so much easier to deal with and learn.  Bottom line, order if you must, but beware.  Don't count on PreSonus corporate office for anything.  Consider other audio interfaces.  Zero stars for AudioBox USB, 4 stars for rest of equipment (in the original package -- see other review).  Headphones are a bit cheap but great mic.	-1
They may work, but will take some time to get used to	-1
The rubber grip extend s to far down the pic and mutes the string that it hits.	-1
I thought these would have a better grip than a standard guitar pick but they don't.  I feel like it might be a gimmick.  I would go with a regular fender pick from now on.	-1
Lately, all I have been buying are DAVA picks, but not this crap.  What I thought would be a good idea turns out to be a miscarriage. Let me tell you that I used to tend to throw half a dozen picks across the stage/room about every night I play.  Even Gorilla Snot didn't keep the darn things from going airborne. Don't get me wrong, DAVA makes some other picks I really like.  The one I use most is the red(delrin)-tipped, black model 1303 pick.  But I cannot use these stupid "grip" picks for an entire night without the soft rubber coming loose from the hard plastic and turning the thing to junk.  The problem is, the soft rubber is needed in the center area of the pick, where the center of your grip is.  All that soft garbage around the edges is useless, unless it is for DAVA to sell a damn lot more of them than necessary.  The soft crap tears away from the hard plastic and then the whole thing comes apart.	-1
tried, didn't like, the pad actually hits and catches on the strings when playing fast licks. OK for beginner player	-1
Good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. Probably good for strumming, but not good for lead.	-1
In an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, I decided to dive in and give these a go.  They are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick.  I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just can't compete.  Not only were they too flimsy, but when I played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands.  This was a huge disappointment.	-1
For me....you know everyone has a different type they have to use...these are easy to grip and thats a great idea but I need a more flexible, light gage pick...I love the grip though that part is brilliant...they need to branch out with light gage models...the idea that you can make them more flexible by holding them differntly is all advertising amd bogus.	-1
