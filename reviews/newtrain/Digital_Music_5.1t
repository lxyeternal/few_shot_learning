This is awesome to listen to, A must-have for all Slayer fans..sadly needed to be a triple disc set..They have so many hits!!	1
bien	1
It was great to hear the old stuff again and I like the new stuff too. I recommend it to any Slayer fan.	1
well best of's are a bit poison normally but this is not bad it's pretty good because I'd have put 90% hell await,reign in blood,south of,seasons ,divine and a couple musica's tracks and everything on god hates -at that point best of mean every cd mainly so this is not so bad  it dose put some great tracks that live shows don't play much out there like,213, skeletons of society,sex murder art and Gemini and some rare track too,final six is just a bonus track on Christ illusion but it's here with the mystery cover songs from unditstputed attitude cd(why these would be on a greatest hits collection I don't know) but the also put a couple of live tracks on here too.all in all it could be much worse but it's great for the car.	1
What can I say? This is Casting Crowns!!!This is a good, blessing filled, CD.	1
Enjoy Casting Crowns and their songs	1
Another very inspirational collection by a Very popular Christian group.  Another of my Favorites.	1
I love the song Slow Fade by Casting Crowns, especially how they put the children version at the end... its a song that speaks to everyone of us to be careful on "itching ears" that may take our faith and attention away from the Lord and to be watchful all the time and put on our armour at all times in the gospel. The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say "people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away..." this is so true, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a "slow fade" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.	1
This is an awesome album from the amazing Christian group Casting Crowns. You can't go wrong with this album. Amazing and worth the buy! I think if you like Casting Crowns you'd probably also like my current new favorite artist I found through myspace. I think they'll be as big as Casting Crowns and already starting to see a huge interest in them. See my other reviews for The Warehouse Band	1
I can't believe I haven't written a review for this album yet! Maybe I didn't buy it from amazon, lol! I love this album to pieces. All the way from What This World Needs to Every Man, Slow Fade to all because of Jesus...great just awesome! I had the privilege of seeing this band perform at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, VA back last November with my brother and I tell you what..this band cares for souls! I, only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to. I had Lifesong and I knew how much I enjoyed that album, still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns. If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it, I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving.	1
This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project.  As with their other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound.  There are several very good songs on this album.  The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, not just on Sunday mornings.  There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.  As with their previous albums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles.  'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.  For those who are unfamiliar with their music, I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut.  In any case, this is well worth buying.	1
I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with "If We Are The Body" and "Does Anybody Hear Her," but with "What This World Needs," it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!  This CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf.	-1
I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that "Voice of Truth" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.  I really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.  The first song on the album: "What This World Needs" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.  Song #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.  #3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.  #4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )  #5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.  #6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. "The Altar and the Door" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.  #7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my "anthem". I admire Mark's clever word play- "Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is..." What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.  #8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.  #9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.  #10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.  #11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.  One more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album.	1
Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.  The group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.  The disc starts off with the rock anthem "What This World Needs."  Think "If We are the Body" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.  The title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, "Somewhere in the Middle."  In fact, the phrase "between the altar and the door" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.  As with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with "I Know You're There" and "All Because of Jesus," but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.  My two favorite songs are back to back.  "Slow Fade" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing "Because Little Eyes."  It's enough to give me chills.  Appropriately enough, the next song is "East to West."  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.  Musically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.  I'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.	1
Elvis is still the best!	1
Great cd.	1
Outstanding!!	1
No one sings gospel songs with such true feelings for God and Jesus the way Elvis did. I find his gospel songs very comforting when I am upset about anything. I think you will as well.  His 2 CD set with 40 songs called "He Touched Me" is one of my very favorites. Sincerely, Joan Wear, Nashville, TN	1
Great Album.	1
OK!	1
great	1
love it	1
And I love it!  It truly is Elvis at his best.  The songs are songs I know and can sing along if I want or I can just listen to the "real" Elvis sing the kind of songs he loved the best - gospel!  A terrific collection!	1
Michael Jackson has always Been Badd period. from his days as a Kid leading the Jackson5 to His Incredible Adult solo Run. His Vocal Instrument alone has touched so many lives. His Instrument of a Voice has gone through so many styles&Eras. no matter what the Era or what was the "IN" Sound or vibe you could always count on MJ hanging tough. His Voice as a Kid was that of a BluesMan in a Kid. He explored so many styles&Influenced so many era's of future Musicians. as a songwriter he has composed some of the Most Timeless songs Ever in "don't Stop Till you Get Enough,Billie Jean,Beat It. His Vocals Lead&background have captured people all over the world&back.as a writer,producer,Arranger,Instrumentalist,conceptionilist,etc... He has His Own Mount Rushmore of Music Makers in the History of Making Music.for the new Listener to His Musical Genius this is a Great place to Start.	1
It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.  The Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.  All in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.  Album Cover: B+  Mastering: A-  Songs: B 1/2+  Price: B  Overall: B 1/2+	1
This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo.  There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future.  But as of 2005 there are none on the market.  But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits.  So, why isn't this a 5 star package?  For one there's no "Dancing Machine", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it).  The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time.  And they included "Dangerous" a decent album cut that's not essential.  Better choice would be "Working Day And Night". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need.	1

Classic Michael talent. Once a Michael fan always a Michael fan. This man just had what it took to make us dance, laugh and cry. There is only one Michael and all the rest are just imitations.	1
An amazing cd with so many awesome songs!! For $10 this is a steal for 38 songs!!!!!! Buy it, even if you don't like MJ you'll end loving his music! It makes you want to clean, dance, sing.......be happy!!! Just puts you in a good, uplifting mood!!!	1
i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio stations coming out of chicago. when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which as far as im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever	1
great songs!  After all it's Michael Jackson. Enough said. (now just filler words for something that Speaks For Itself. )	1
This two CD set contains just about every MJ classic tune that you could possibly think of!!! Thriller,Beat It,Man In The Mirror,Smooth Criminal,Billie Jean...they are all on here. Plus so much more! This collection is a must for every MJ fan! Highly recommend!	1
I've been a Jackson 5 fan all my life and Michael Jackson still reigns as King of Pop.  I first heard In the Closet when I saw the video on VH1 and loved it then.  When I saw it was available on kindle, I thought "about time."  A classic Michael song.  Perfection.  I only wish I could have downloaded the video to it as well.  Hey now, kindle, there's an idea!	1
I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).	1
38 songs of Michael Jackson's top songs! wow, can't beat that for this price. I'm very happy with this purchase.	1
we usually listen good music when driving somewhere, usually a road trip will take 2 to 4 hours. we like Michael Jackson's music and is never boring or annoying at all. sound quality is great as well.	1
Good luck finding any artist or group putting every song hit on one cd - it just doesn't happen. But if you want to buy a Cd with a lot of Michael's hits- you cannot go wrong with this selection. Pricing was very fair.	1
i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easylove	1
I was a bit late in becomming a fan of Mr. Jackson (unfortunately!) so I'm trying to catch up on his works. Hopefully I'll find more CDs to add to my collection; this CD is a great start. I definitely recommend this to other fans--existing ones as well as new ones like myself.	1
I've purchased this album in iTunes and again through Amazon because this album has so many of Michael Jackson's awesome works, it's a great one shot deal. Some of the songs here I never (or may have been too young) remembered like, "Ben." Michael Jackson is great house cleaning or sitting in traffic music.	1
There's no denying the impact Michael Jackson has had on popular music over the course of forty years. From the Jackson 5's first No. 1 ("I want you back" when Michael was eleven) through his untimely death at the age of fifty.  I was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No. 1s (something not even the Beatles did). Despite Michael's popularity, I remained essentially a casual fan. I didn't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER--an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date.  I eventually bought 1995's HIStory and later 2001's GREATEST HITS. But if you're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career (I bought mine as a Black Friday deal), this is everything the casual fan needs:  solo hits starting with 1971's "Got To Be There" through 1999's "You Rock My World" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5/Jacksons hits. [The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet ("Scream") and Paul McCartney ("Say Say Say")]  Overall, this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever. This music belongs in any serious collector's library. ESSENTIAL  [Running time - Disc 1, 78:56; Disc 2, 78:50]	1
The title says it all. It has all the classics and popular MJ Hits 2CD pack, a must have for everyones collection.	1
It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.  The first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this "essential" collection. Besides the "Ultimate Collection" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.  I can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could/should have been included. "They Don't Care About Us" and "Earth Song" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think "Whatever Happens" should have been here and perhaps "Butterflies". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop "hits" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!  The Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  /5.	1
While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the "King of Pop". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.  The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.  Overall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.  Album Cover: B  Songs: B 1/2+  Price: B+  Remastering: B+  Overall: B 1/2+	1
All the Essential CD's are fantastic. Heart,Barry Manilow,and alot of artist have the Essential collections at Target for 9.99. This Michael Jackson collection is also great. All the hits are here from the Jackson 5 years,and Michaels hits,including his last,"You Rock my World."	1
Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.  "I Want You Back" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! "ABC" is very catchy. "Got To Be There" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings "Got To Be There" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! "Rockin' Robin" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?  "Ben" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes "Ben" even more beautiful. "Enjoy Yourself" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. "Blame It on the Boogie" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in "Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground)." Listen also for Michael to deliver "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings "Rock with You;" "Off The Wall" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled "The Girl Is Mine." "Billie Jean" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! "Beat It" is yet another jewel on the first CD. "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like "Thriller;" "Thriller" is timeless and just one listen proves it!  "Bad" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and "The Way You Make Me Feel" is pop music at its very best. "Man in the Mirror" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on "Another Part of Me." I love it! "Black or White" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. "Heal The World" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.  "Remember The Time" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. "Will You Be There" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and "Dangerous" has some beat! "You Are Not Alone" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing "You Rock My World." Awesome!  Michael Jackson fans should consider this a "must-have" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set.	1
This CD is awesome and I have enjoyed it so much his music is so inspiring to me. He has talent no one else will ever possess and the music on the CD shows it. I am truly devastated over the loss of MJ I am still crying about it.  He will live in my heart forever.  I only wish the negative people would have known the real MJ. Listen to his words, look at his various videos on the web in regards to children, read the court transcripts and read the book on his conspiracy.  You will know why he was acquitted because he was totally innocent from day one and every juror knew it.  God Bless his beautiful children.  I am looking forward to the day his children are older and they give an interview on what a wonderful "DADDY" he was.	1
This is the only Michael Jackson album you need to buy. It has all the essential hits/tracks spanning his entire career!  While he had tons of hits, all of his individual albums had songs that were not hits and not good songs. So, there is no need to buy the individual albums unless there is a particular song that is not on this 'essential' album that you are looking for.	1
Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in "Billie Jean." That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into "Bad," opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire "Dangerous," which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.	1
Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like "Ben", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out "Never can Say Goodbye" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is "Jam".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of "Dangerous" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of "Bad" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note...."Farewell My Summer Love" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.  I used to have it on 45.	1
Even though Michael Jackson's personal life was rocked with scandal and I didn't always approve of his antics but I cannot ignore the cultural impact this gifted performer had on me as a child. I was in born in 1982, I remember hearing him on the radio and thought wow what a voice! The song was Dirty Diana from his Bad album. It wasn't until 1991 when his Dangerous album was released that I became a fan of Jackson, Black or White was a stellar video and the cd was just pure pop candy, I ate it up! After the scandal broke in 1993, I lost interest in Jackson but now that he is no longer with us - I hope will be remembered for his music and dancing ability - he was one-of-a-kind. This collection of greatest hits is spectacular! There are couple of Jackson 5 classics and of course the best tracks of his career like Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, The Man in the Mirror, In the Closet, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), She's Out of My Life, Will You Be There?, and Don't Stop Til You Get Enough. He changed the sound and look of pop music forever, RIP Michael!	1
Thjere are many Michael Jackson CD's on the market. This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums "Off The Wall" and "Thriller". His best songs are all here" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like "Bad" and "Dangerous". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of "Never Can Say Goodbye" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!	1
In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific "Essential Michael Jackson", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.  The international version of "The Essential Michael Jackson" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:  1. The Jacksons' "Can You Feel It" replaces "Enjoy Yourself" (an improvement); 2. Somehow "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" (from "Bad") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the "Thriller" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement; 3. The title track from "Dangerous" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's "HIStory" second CD of new material are added ("Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us"), a wash as far as I'm concerned although "Earth Song" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How "They Don't Care About Us" ended up on the "essential" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).  Would I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, "The Essential Michael Jackson" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best.	1
Michael Jackson is a timeless Musical Genius. He Owned the Last Century. Dick clark got it right  when he gave MJ the Award as Artist of the Last century. nobody before or since captured the whole World's Musical  Complete Attention as the soul Brother from  the Dirty of Gary Indiana. these songs showcases His Greatness for  Decades upon Decades. His Vocal Range&ability to adapt to Musical changes highlights a Genius without Limits.  Michael Jackson is the "DON OF MUSIC" period. Michael back in the day was a Event all unto Himself.  there aren't too many artists who cover as much Ground as MJ past or Present.  He changed the game of Popular Music.  these songs made me go and get Penny Loafers and get my dance on.  these Songs reprensent a wonderful time in Music.  without Michael Jackson I wouldn't even really care about Music. he was that Cat that Made a Brother truly appreciate the Art form to the Highest form.	1
Isn't this unbelievable? Another Michael Jackson compilation! Many of Jackson's fans own HISTORY-PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK I,NUMBER ONES and the ultimate 4 disc(3 CD and 1 DVD) compilation. This collection,like the latter aforementioned one,features many of Jackson's all-time hits(his solo recordings,Jackson 5 recordings and Jacksons recordings). So put these CD's in your player,turn up the volume and get down and funky! You'll be glad you did!	1
Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the "Off The Wall" & "Thriller" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the "Bad" singles..the only one that was missing is "Liberian Girl" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from "Dangerous" are here besides "Jam". I am not sure why the title cut "Dangerous" included. That should of been where "Jam" should of been. Also the final single from the "Dangerous" album is not included "Gone Too Soon". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song "History" & One song from "Invincible"? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single "One More Chance"? All of these titles are missing. Hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore greatest hits album.	1
This is just as strong and vibrant as the box set that came 8 months before it! I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, "But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?"  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!	1
Truth is, Michael Jackson needed a 2-disc collection as much as anybody. Those single discs didn't quite do it for somebody who's still often called the "King Of Pop". So, the pros and cons. I personally don't need the Jackson 5 material myself, but some might. I also think this is a bit shy on his most recent work. I do miss "Earth Song" and the duet "Scream" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from "Thriller" and "Bad", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original "Thriller" album, and even more from "Bad". Plus we get the best of "Off The Wall", and again some of his earliest stuff. The fact is, after listening to this collection of Michael Jackson, you almost can't not like him. It's just "Human Nature".	1
Despite all the controversy that has occured with Michael Jackson, he is truly the king of pop and he truly has one of the best recording voices ever.  You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.  This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including "I'll Be There", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.  It is wonderful reliving hits such as "I Want You Back", "Billie Jean", "Thriller", "Wanna Be Startin' Something", "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough", and etc... 4 stars.	1
When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their "The Essential..." series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his "not guilty" verdict.  If this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc "The Essential Michael Jackson" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and "Thriller" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.  If you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though "I'll Be There" and "Dancing Machine" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: "Off The Wall", "Thriller", "Bad" and "Dangerous". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit "You Are Not Alone" and the 2001 Top Ten single "You Rock My World".  As with most if not all entries in the "Essential" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that "Thriller" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as "I'll Be There", "I Wanna Be Where You Are", "Dancing Machine", "Ease On Down The Road", the Paul McCartney "Say, Say, Say" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), "State Of Shock" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.	1
...But not so because of it's lack of completion. As in the past Greatest Hits compilations by Michael and The Jacksons, there has always been filler...but no thriller, hits with pits! So this compilation IS the best so far!! Pictures included are his best photos showing off a talented singer/songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess. The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.    But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD. Granted he has had more #1 hits and more top 40 hits than most!! Over 4 decades here, from 1970 - 2000!  But where is the # 1 Essential I'll Be There or Dancing Machine?  They could have left out Dangerous which never charted and Leave Me Alone which is an essential, but not a hit as well. The video was a bigger hit!    OK now what's next?  Maybe Volume 2 Essential ...and!	1
Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released "The Essential Michael Jackson" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.  CD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the "Thriller" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as "ABC" and "I Want You Back", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include "State of Shock" or "Lovely One" instead of "Enjoy Yourself". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 "Thriller" album tracks (the other 2 being "Baby Be Mine" and "The Lady in My Life"; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when "radio tracks" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.  CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from "Bad" and 7 from "Dangerous", and finishes off with "You Are Not Alone" from HIStory and "You Rock My World" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is "Scream", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.  In the end, this "essential" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!	1
Classic!	1
One of the best thrash albums from any band.  This whole record set a standard for others to try and reach.  Few would ever come close.	1
C'mon, it's classic Metallica	1
These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end. They didn't even bother to paint the disc. The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.  The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess. I just expected some kind of decent booklet with this remaster.	1
This album sounds great on vinyl, no crackling at all, the new Blackened Records pressing is great.	1
Who doesn't have ride the lighting? Sounds awesome remastered and the packaging is better than those jewel cases. Best 5 bucks you ever spent.	1
For those wondering, this CD is indeed remastered. Both this album and Kill 'Em All (with April 2016 release dates) are remastered versions, not just simple reissues.  It sounds improved versus the original CD release, although not drastically so. Enjoy!	1
You'll love it after you get it but in the mean time check out rollingbaby.com for all your baby stroller info!	1
Great stuff. I had the album years ago, and I wanted to get it on CD!	1
I already had one of the finest versions of Ride the Lightning on CD as a basis for comparison. I hadn't been able to find many reviews on the new $18.99 vinyl.  I purchased this at B&N with a coupon in-store today, but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95% of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on.  I have decent mid-fi equipment, not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording. 1978 Japanese Technics SL-220 with AT95e > TC750 > Yamaha RX-V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP-S300  I prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.  It may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.  So yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO. Very happy with the price/quality. Would recommend. Kill EM All is my favorite Thrash era Metallica and this album bridges the gab between that album and puppets.	1
Classic Metallica	1
Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.	1
AWESOME ALBUM !	1
Missing out of my collection.	1
A true classic for metal fans, solid album with no clunkers	1
I think this one of their best albums.  The sound is incredible as a whole, but the bass work is awesome.  Another must have to add to the collection.  You won't be disappointed if you pick this up.	1
TY	1
One of the best.	1
great	1
Just got it today-8/8/2015!! I love it!! Awesome!! Fantastic!! Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!! I will be doing all of my shopping here!! Great music store!! Great!! Amazon has everything you could ever imagine or want!! :o)	1
This album is fantastic. The playing and attitude along with great lyrics make this one of their finest records just behind MOP and the Black album.	1
No Problem	1
Like with a handful of the albums I own in my now far larger CD collection, this album has been in my possession since I was about 14, so needless to say, I should have done this review a very long time ago. Straight to the point: I really have to say that this is my absolute favorite Metallica album of all time. As a perfect follow-up to "Kill 'Em All" the sophomore album "Ride the Lighting" marks a point in their career when they were in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal, making a name for themselves as a band, and further rising to prominence in the '80s metal scene.  With a dark and eerie atmosphere, coupled with massive, thundering guitars, skull-crushing drums and raspy vocals, no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfied upon even the first listen, and will never want to skip over any songs. Every one of the songs on this album is a perfect illustration of what defined the true sound of Metallica and what made them such a great band. From the high-speed, neck-breaking insanity from songs such as "Fight Fire With Fire," "Trapped Under Ice" & "Creeping Death" to the more steady, yet eerily menacing "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "Fade To Black," this is the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any true Metallica fan.  Honestly, there is so much more I could say about this album that other have said before, I could go on all day about it! This, my friends, is the TRUE Metallica in their prime, and the defining sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it. Sadly, this period of their career in which they valued their art and staying true to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the '80s. We all know how they started to care more about money and sold out to the mainstream by going in a more alternative direction, ultimately destroying their own legitimacy as a metal band (See my review of their self-titled "Black Album"), but at least we still have this album, along with "Kill 'Em All," "Master Of Puppets," and "...And Justice For All" to remind us of how awesome of a band they used to be.  All in all, this is definitely one album that makes no sense not to own, if you consider yourself a true Metallica fan, or a true metalhead in general. Just buy this album already! You know you want to. HORNS UP!!! \M/\M/	1
awesome	1
thrash metal classic	1
The songs on this album are great. They all rip.	1
Makes me angry when I listen to it.............good stuff!	1
This is how Metallica was meant to be played and enjoyed: loud and clear! It's a great album, 4.5 stars.	1
I recently got into Metallica, and so I'm obsessed with finding everything they have done. This is an older album, but it's amazing. I watched some documentaries about them and had no idea that they were an underground band which makes their success even cooler. Every song is great. The Call of Ktulu is insane. They are all extremely talented and this shows why people like their music so much.	1
I love this album!  I still have the original vinyl picture disk but wanted to add the CD to my collection.  In my very humble opinion this is their best album with Garage Days a close second.	1
METALLICA create a THRASH masterpiece with RIDE THE LIGHTNING.....After their glorious debut KILL EN ALL, METALLICA refined their raw punk THRASH into something more meaningful...While KILL EN ALL is a hallucinated young raw THRASH petard, RIDE show a mature side in METALLICA, with introspective lyrics and even a powerful ballad(FADE TO BLACK)....well, in my opinion is a COMPLETE MASTERPIECE with gens like the title track, FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS and CREEPING DEATH!!!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!	1
Ride the Lightning is another example of good metal music done by a great metal rock band.  The album itself is just like And Justice and All dealing with death in certain songs like Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death.  The album had a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time I bought it I was dealing with thoughts of death and the Metallica music infulence my release threw my poems I wrote and really help me get threw a dark period in my life.  But the actual music has some amazing metal music within it and deep powerful lyrics in it.  So if your looking for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you threw a dark period your going threw just like it help me threw mine as I wrote my poems and other items I write.	1
Sometimes you just need to blow off steam! And when I get tired of my boss at work or I can't find a date I like to rock and/or roll!  Metallica has been rocking the free world for big time and I am one of their most passionate fans. I love the way the guitars sound like a garbage truck going over the side of a cliff!  Sometimes, I'll be driving and I'll pull up to some ying-yang playing hip hop way too loud out of their Ford Focus and then I flip the switch on my stereo to "Ride the Lightning" and it blows their high school BS off the road!  If my parents let me I'm going to get a "Freedom" tattoo on my neck and one of Lars Ulrich's face on my right hand. That way, if my parents go out for the night it'll be me and Lars alone and there's not a court in the land that can stop us from doing ANYTHING we want.	1
This is an awesome CD! From start to finish. I love the way the CD starts off with a slow guitar intro on Fight Fire With Fire,then all of a sudden it gets up in your face with hard metal! I love it. My favorite song on here is,Fade To Black,which is my favorite Metallica song of all time. But every song on this album rocks. Just a shame there is only eight tracks on here though. I wish there was a re-release of this,with bonus tracks,such as outtakes or something cool like that.	1
Ride the Lightning is one of my favorite Metallica album. It presents a fast and harsh music and lyrics, respectively, similar to that style of Slayer. I often state that Ride the Lightning and Kill'em All are two progenitors of thrash and death metal albums.	1
If you're new to Metallica, this and the follow up, Master Of Puppets, are the albums to get, if you're a metal fan anyways. these 2 are hands down their best.  For an, at the time, little known metal band, the production is really good. Everyone is in top form. James's vocals are a little higher than they'd be after this album, which adds to the charm of this album. The band was driven. they had some good material, partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan's attention.  Fight Fire With Fire 10/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in. All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever. This is a perfect opener with great guitar work, and vocals. this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica, which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on.  Ride The Lightning 9/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses. Plus a catchy chorus. Overall a very good song.  For Whom The Bell Tolls 10/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever. Granted it has stiff competition, but it might be. This one has a nice groove to it. This one's still fairly heavy, but not as heavy as the past 2 songs. There are some good melodies, and the guitar playing is really good. I hate to give credit to Lars, but his drums really add power to this song.  Fade To Black 9/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.  Trapped Under Ice 9/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.  Escape 9/10 is kind of the pop song of the album. Odd it gets no recognition. This is probably the catchiest song on the album. This one's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning. It has a really good chorus, and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here.  Creeping Death 10/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song. It's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus. It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album.  Then there's an instrumental which I won't rate because I'm not really into instrumentals. It's played just fine, so I'm sure for fans of them it'll do.  Overall if you're a metal fan new to Metallica, which would be surprising, this is a good place to start. You won't be disappointed.	1
Ride the Lightning is a lot better in my opinion but both are still great albums. RTL has the best of early thrash/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite.	1
This is a piece of metal magic. All the songs are glorious one, all the songs are classics. Metallica really creates metal magic on Ride the Lightning. The lyrics are truly amazing and the sound is the finest thrash metal. If you like metal, you reeeeeeally have to listen to this absolutely classic.	1
Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.  The opening song "Fight Fire With Fire" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. "For Whom The Bell Tolls" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James ("take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will", sounds nice doesn't it?). "Fade to Black" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day."Trapped Under Ice", "Escape" and "Creeping Death" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live."The Call of Ktulu" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.  Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental "The Call of Ktulu". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.  Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this "Ride" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.	1
When fans talk about Metallica, many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics, grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre.  What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.  When Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.  The album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music.	1
first of all if you don't know about Metallica you probably be very young. Just buy it for the beginning . All the songs are master-super-heavy metal songs. I remember how many times i have heard this album. Fade to blcak - For whom the bell tolls - Creeping Death - The call of Ktullu - and the other songs are just amazing . there is a strong feeling by hearing this songs .	1
It seems like Metallica is turning into a band that you either love or hate as years go by. That's pretty sad, because the band is essentially one of the all-time great metal bands of all time. Some people will say that they're overrated. Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like "Fade to Black" and "Creeping Death" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. "The Call of Ktulu" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.  Grade: 9.8/10	1
I bought this album for the song "For Whom The Bell Tolls" after watching Zombieland several times and realizing this was one of the few Metallica albums I didn't have. Great addition to my Metallica collection.	1
Ride the Lightning being Metallica's 2nd studio album and their 1984 release is truly an incredible album. The album has produced some of the best thrash metal that I have ever listened to. The songs that I especially like are "For Whom The Bell Tolls " and "Fade To Black". All the lyrics are included in the book along with some photos of the band. We also get a list over whom plays what. The album was met with rave reviews by the critics. Allmusic and Kerrang! both giving the album very high marks in their reviews. 5/5.	1
Metallica's second album is nothing short of amazing, the riffs are amazing, the solo's are epic, the vox are stellar and the songs are second to none.  With classics like Ride The Lightning, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Trapped under Ice, Call of ktulu etc this album is a fine example of thrash at it's best.  Metallica's second best album mostly due once again to Mustaines amazing songs.	1
This is one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it's just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general. But I can't put this ahead of Master Of Puppets.	1
Talk of Metallica albums usually passes over "Ride the Lightning"; you hear how great "Master of Puppets" is, the transition that was "the black album" and general disgust at "St. Anger." The truth is, without "Ride the Lightning," we never would have seen any of the others.  "Ride the Lightning" was Metallica's sophomore album, and it represents a quantum leap forward over "Kill 'Em All," setting the sound that has come to be known as "Metallica" to us. The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into "Master of Puppets," arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing "Fade to Black" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track "The Call of Ktulu."  Definitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you're just getting into the band.	1
Metallica's sophomore album, "Ride The Lightning" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering "Kill 'Em All" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, "Master of Puppets" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and "...And Justice For All" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for "One". Regardless of whether or not "Ride The Lightning" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think "The Four Horsemen" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of "Ride The Lightning", simply read on. "Fight Fire With Fire" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, "Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!". Great way to start off the album. "Ride The Lightning", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment. "For Whom The Bell Tolls" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out. "Fade To Black" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out. "Trapped Under Ice" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album. "Escape" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song. "Creeping Death" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos. "The Call of Ktulu" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer "Orion" off "Master of Puppets", but this song is definitely a great one, too. So as you can see, "Ride The Lightning" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even "The Black Album" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.	1
This just gets better every year.fade to black, trapped under ice, just 2 reasons to have this cd.no metal fan in the world should be without this. This album was also themed in a way - all the songs are about ways of dying. Fight Fire With Fire - Nuclear War Ride The Lightning - Electrocution For Whom The Bell Tolls - On the battlefield Fade To Black - Suicide Trapped Under Ice - Drowning Escape - Difficult to explain, listen and make your mind up about it Creeping Death - Murder All these songs are classics with great big crunchy guitar riffs, thick, heavy drumming, powerful bass, and to top it off great lyrics.	1
4 stars for what it is in the history of metal, 3 stars for how it now compares to what it was back in the day.  In short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a "tune" or two). I love true heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.  But Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.    That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.    This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it? Who says life is always unfair?	1
After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.  After that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.  But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.  All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.	1
Ride the Lightning is the one Metallica album that seriously has a lot of aggressive power and remains a classic to this day.  While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.  Fight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff, and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes.  The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent.  Ride the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15-second guitar intro.  I love that.  Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it's played.  Great guitar solo as well.  Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70's Rainbow song called "Light in the Black".  For Whom the Bell Tolls- let's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way "Iron Man" is Black Sabbath's classic.  Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's "Snowblind".  Trapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.  Escape- really good song, though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80's with that dated sound.  I like the way the verse melody chugs along.  Great lyrics by their standards too.  Creeping Death- another memorable heavy/speed metal track.  These guys were clearly more talented than most.  The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time.  Call of Ktulu- a very slow, rocking build up.  It's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people.  You need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection, and none of them are better than this one.  Get it.	1
RIDE THE LIGHTENING, Metallica's second album, is notable for its musical direction, combining thrash metal with more symphonic, and much more complex, songwriting than previously seen in metal music.  When Metallica recorded their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kill-Em-All/dp/B000002H5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kill 'Em All</a>, the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM ("New Wave of British Heavy Metal") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/On-Through-the-Night/dp/B000001F7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">On Through the Night</a>, their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..  Beginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Master-of-Puppets/dp/B000002H33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Master of Puppets</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/And-Justice-For-All/dp/B000002H6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">...And Justice For All</a>&nbsp;sounds like.  Those three records are what I call their progressive metal trilogy; with each album their song writing got more complex and more symphonic.  As much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record. All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.  "Fire with Fire": The soft intro to "Battery" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, "Fire for Fire".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.  "Ride the Lightening" is one of Metallica's more epic compositions.  Lyrically the song sets up themes of being powerless in a hostile situation, a theme Hetfield would often return too.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls" deals with the futility of war, another theme the and would revisit on both MASTER and JUSTICE, and is titled after the Earnest Hemingway novel.  One of the band's more famous early songs.  The intro is pretty long, at over two minutes before Hetfield starts singing.  "Fade to Black" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a "suicide classic".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.  "Trapped Under Ice" has some killer chorus work and interesting lyrics.  Musically it's very solid as well.  The song has some absolutely intense guitar work.  Probably the second weakest song though, next to "Escape."  Metallica has only performed the song four times live.  "Escape" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is true that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.  "Creeping Death", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.  And last, but definitely not least, is "The Call of Ktula".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled "When Hell Freezes Over", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song "Hanger 18". Discounting the two covers "Tuesday's Gone" and "Mercyful Fate" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental "Orion".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.  Overall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for "Escape", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of "Escape".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads.	1
This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, "thinking man's" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better.	1
Metallica's second album, and their first for a major record label Elektra, entitled Ride the Lightning is also arguably their best album ever. First released in August of 1984, Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release. After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette. The album starts off with "Fight Fire With Fire" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track "For Whom the Bell Tolls" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with "Fade to Black" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale. The album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called "Trapped Under Ice" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number "Escape". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks "Creeping Death" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called "The Call of Ktulu" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively. While Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support, the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today. Most Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably don't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you. Highly recommended!	1
There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!	1
The division between Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning is huge.  The albums sound like two different bands.  Amazing.  Where KEA was juvenile and garage-bandish, Ride The Lightning was the polished effort.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of great songs came from KEA, but Ride The Lightning is better.  Fight Fire With Fire opens up the album (back when it was an actual album) and never looks back!  Absolute pure shred!  Ride The Lightning, Creeping Death, Fade To Black, & For Whom The Bell Tolls!  All Classics!  Their first really professional effort for Electra, with the final batch of Dave Mustaine co-written tunes. Clearly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  Dig it!	1
Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are true, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The true Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.  1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion.  This one is about Nuclear Warfare  2. Ride the Lightning 10/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you'll be happy to have stuck in your head.  This one is about the Electric Chair.  3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10/10: slower, but one of the most important tracks here.  It's about the Spanish Civil war and also has something to do with H.P. Lovecraft, an author whom Kirk has a fascination with.  4. Fade to Black 9/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.  It is about Suicide, and from what I understand this song was also controversial because a man killed himself while listening to it back in the 80's.  5. Trapped Under Ice 8/10: Great song, the solos are great, the atmosphere is great.  It's about, well, being trapped under ice.  6. Escape 8/10: the only song not about death, more so about escaping from a town that wants you to be a certain way, and therefore rebelling.  Remember, 8/10 still means good, it's just that track 1-4 are classics.  7. Creeping Death 9/10: It's told through the eyes of the Grim Reaper.  An all around great song.  I love the middle part.  8. The Call of Ktulu 10/10: A beautiful instrumental, once again about an H.P. lovecraft story. I actually read this one and it's a good read, very strange.  In my opinion, this is far better than Orion from Master of Puppets, but that's just my opinion.  There is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped.	1
Metallica's second album, 1984's "Ride the Lightning," was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.  With 1983's "Kill `Em All," Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel "Ride the Lightning" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was "Master of Puppets."  "Ride the Lightning" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than "Kill `Em All." James' voice is somewhat lower than it was, and his lyrics are improved. As the above Amazon editorial review mentions, James discusses several different ways to die: Armageddon, capitol punishment, suicide, being trapped under ice, etc.  "Fight Fire with Fire" has the aforementioned acoustic intro, but it's just a tease-it doesn't last. The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed, with rip-roaring, almost Slayer-esque guitar work. Lyrically, this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse.  "Ride the Lightning" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. "Ride the Lightning" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is slower paced, but still loud and heavy. The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental, beginning with a bell ringing, then the heavy, repetitive, churning guitars kick in. This song has another good, winding solo near the end.  "Fade to Black" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.  "Trapped Under Ice" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle.  "Escape" has vocals which make it radio ready (it has good vocal hooks). Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming, but the choruses are slower.  "Creeping Death" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming, before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead. And, of course, there's another stellar solo near the end.  "The Call of KTULU" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as "Orion" (from Metallica's next album, "Master of Puppets,") and it's a very good way to end the album. It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes, but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster. This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work.  So, this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it's still one of the best C.D.'s of the past two decades. All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here: long songs (about 6 minutes per song), rapid fire riffs, ripping solos, an instrumental track, and even some acoustic guitar licks. In conclusion, if you want a complete metal collection, or if you just like heavy metal, you need this album more than you need your next breath.	1
In 1984, Metallica had released their sophmore album entitled, RIDE THE LIGHTNING. This album turned out to be even better than KILL 'EM ALL. This album was definite in proving Metallica to be the best Heavy Metal act out there. This album has all the sound you could ever want from a Heavy Metal band.  FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE  This song is just astonishing. Any self-respecting Metallica fan would love this song. I sure as hell love this song.  RIDE THE LIGHTNING  Ah. The album's incredible title track. Can't get enough of this song and it sure can't get any better than this.  FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS  When I said it couldn't get any better than "Ride The Lightning", I was wrong. This album just keeps getting better, especially on this tune. Damn, this frigging guys can rock.  FADE TO BLACK  This song is my favorite off of the album. All I do is listen to this song a first time, then I start again for an encore presentation. If you listen carefully, you'll notice the song is talking about suicide. Gotta love this song.  TRAPPED UNDER ICE  Incredible.  ESCAPE  A great song with great lyrics and a rockin' sound.  CREEPING DEATH  As much as I love hearing this one, it creeps me out because of the title. But I can't help it when I just sing along with James on this one.  THE CALL OF KTULU  Instrumental song.  What an album! These guys know what fans want in a Heavy Metal album. This band is definitely going to be here for a long a** time. So get up off your a** and buy this album if you don't have it already.	1
This is Metallica's second album Ride The Lighting which was released in 1984. Although it's not as good as Master Of Puppets, but it's still a classic gem. Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton  themetalbeast's ratings:  1. Fight Fire With Fire: 5/5  2. Ride The Lightning: 5/5  3. For Whom The Bell Tolls: 5/5  4. Fade To Black: 5/5  5. Trapped Under Ice: 4/5  6. Escape: 4/5  7. Creeping Death: 5/5  8. The Call Of Ktulu: 5/5	1
Is it me, or was just about everything a lot cooler in the past? For instance, back in the '80s, Metallica was known for pounding, crushing, headbanging METAL, and now they're known for ripping fans off and liking money. It's a sad state of affairs.  But I digress. "Ride The Lightning" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener "Fight Fire With Fire", to the epic "For Whom The Bell Tolls", the beautifully written semi-ballad "Fade To Black", and, of course, the metal classic "Creeping Death", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!  Anyway, yeah, this one's a classic. Buy it, and steer clear of emo!	1
If Metallica's 1983 "Kill 'Em All" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release "Ride The Lightning" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since "Kill 'Em All", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from "Kill 'Em All" out of the water. Tracks such as "Fade To Black" and "The Call of Ktulu" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on "Ride The Lightning", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include "Fight Fire with Fire," and "For Whom the Bell Tolls". This album rocks in epic proportions.  Overall, Metallica ruled the world at this point in time. There was no limits to their re-invention of raw, hardcore thrash metal. I was a huge Metallica fan growing up, and this one got spun the most. This is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a Metallica fan.	1
THE 2ND ALBUM FROM METALLICA IS ANOTHER HEAVY METAL MASTERPIECE. AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLY EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING THAN ''KILL EM ALL''! AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CD ARE ''TRAPPED UNDER ICE'', ''THE CALL OF KTULU'', ''FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE'' AND ''FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS''. BETWEEN THE MONSTROUS GUITAR RIFFS AMD JAMES HETFIELD'S INTENSE VOCALS, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT! FOR METALHADS, THIS IS NONSTOP EXCITEMENT. OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN CHECK THIS OUT.	1
This is one of Metallica's pure best. Classic songs, good lyrics, adrenaline, and youth. The band was really coming together with this one. No MTV to sell to, little real radio support, this was the boys pounding out some of their best songs. Some of them are a little rough around the edges, production quality and musicianship reached its best with the next album, but this one is very good.	1
Metallica's ride the lightning is a great cd. It is tied foe my favorite Metallica cd. The best four songs on the cd were "Ride the Lightning" "Fade to Black" "For whom the bell tolls" and "Creeping Death". My favorite two songs from those four are creeping death and ride the lightning. The other four songs are still very good. Overall, Ride the Lightning is a great cd, and one of the best of Metallica.	1
This album is just plain good and very well worth owning. Ride the lightning is not as raw or fast as kill em all was,but its heavier and the production is better. It's a step up from their previous album. GO OUT AND BUY THIS TODAY!!!	1
Ride The Lightning is one of the best albums of the thrash/speed metal genre and along with their next album Master of Puppets is Metallica's best work. While their first album Kill 'Em All relied more on speed metal, Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities, which would lead to their breakthrough in America. Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of "Fight Fire With Fire" and "Trapped Under Ice" or the longer epics "The Call Of Ktulu", the title track, and the awesome "Creeping Death." The menacing "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "Escape" are also very strong tracks. Then there's "Fade To Black", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what "Stairway To Heaven" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal. Highly recommended.	1
Although many people say that The Black Album or Master of Puppets are Metallica's best albums, don't get me wrong they're great albums and they're in the 5 star worthy material but Ride the Lightning is my favorite Metallica and quite possibly my favorite thrash metal album, I think that 5 stars is not enough for Ride the Lightning, I easily give this album an 11. 'Fight Fire With Fire' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead's heaven and it's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song. 10/10 'Ride the Lightning' is the title track and it's another Metallica classic although it isn't nearly as fast as the previous song but it's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead's mind. 8/10 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' starts off with the tolling bell and although I didn't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome. 10/10 'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10/10 'Trapped Under Ice' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it's still a good song especially compared to their post-Black Album era. 7/10 'Escape' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot, and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans. 9/10 'Creeping Death' is another standout for this album and it's one of their heaviest songs off of this album. 10/10 'The Call of Ktulu' is the closing track and believe it or not, I actually didn't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a row and never get tired of it, Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal's best instrumentals of all time. 10/10 If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons.	1

Do you remember when Metallica used to rock? I mean, they still rock(well, sort of), but do you remember when they used to ROCK? If you don't, I suggest you get Ride The Lightning ,not now, but right now! If you aren't convinced, check out this imaginary conversation between me and a potential customer: hiphopforlife(ME): Welcome to my review of Metallica's second album, Ride The Lightning. before I start, let me give you some background on the band...... Average Joe:Whoa, hold on. If your name is hiphopforlife, what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album? hiphopforlife: Be patient, homeboy. Yes I am black and the biggest lover of hip hop alive, but I am no joke as far as hard rock and metal go, since my taste ranges from Tool(LOVE EM!), Dream Theater(very underrated),Creed(very overrated),Limp Bizkit, Testament,Nirvana,Pantera,Slayer, Korn and Metallica;my first album was And Justice For All ten years ago (anotheralbum you should pick up). I am more than qualified to review this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a "power ballad"... Average Joe:Hold on ,hiphop;this has a ballad? Don't tell me that Metallica's gone Barbra Striesand or worse,Bon Jovi on us? hiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner. Average Joe: Thanks hiphop; you sold me. You are the greatest reviewer ever. And you, dear reader, will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica. Get Ride The Lightning, as well as their whole 80's catalog(and the Black album ,if you must).	1
Contrary to just about everyone else saying "Master of Puppets" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt "Ride the Lightning" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with "Fight Fire With Fire", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is "Fade to Black", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  "Trapped Under Ice" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  "Escape" is hte only song that could be classified as "filler material", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is "Creeping Death", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental "Call of Ktulu" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, "Ride the Lightning" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.	1
I bought Ride the Lightening upon its release in 1984 when I was in 8th grade. My friends practically laughed me out of school for liking such "[junk]". Motley Crue and Ratt were the real metal bands back then. Well, I never have been one to be affected by peer pressure so I stuck to my guns. By the time we graduated in 1988 everyone of those guys who made fun of me in junior high were Metallica fans and they were the biggest metal band of the 80s. Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made, even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since.	1
This is one of the best metal albums ever! I think most would agree that Master Of Puppets is better and I think I go against most people when I say that I prefer Kill Em All, but still this is fantastic. After releasing the killer (and at the time - original) debut, Metallica they release an even better album! Fight Fire With Fire sounds a bit cliched today with the quiet intro but it is one excellent song. Ride The Lightning is another great song and For Whom The Bell Tolls is quite sludgy and very good. They don't make riffs like that anymore! Then comes one of the best Metallica songs ever: Fade To Black. This is a quieter song which builds up progressively and is excellent. Trapped Under Ice and Escape are not so good but are listenable and they don't have me reaching for the skip button. Creeping Death is another excellent Metallica song and along with Fade To Black is one of the albums highlights. Then comes The Call Of The Ktulu. This is probably THE best metal instrumental I've ever heard! And to think that Lars was the only member of the band who was over 20 at the time - you won't find musical maturity like that in most bands - never mind that young - and certainly no nu-metal band will have it today. This belongs in any true Metalheads collection - there aren't many albums that are better than this.	1
I have the very original release of the LP on the metal indie Megaforce, released just before Elektra here signed them and reissued the LP only a few months later, making the Megaforce original a collector's item.  Just total kick@$s metal all the way! The bonus CD could be "Jump in the Fire", but I aine sure.  On Vertigo or Sony (Japan).	1
It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.) Anyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, "Fade to Black." It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is! "Call of Ktulu", the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M). "Creeping Death" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. "Fire Fire with Fire" is mindless thrash with lots of kick. "Trapped under Ice" is tight speed metal. Ride the Lightning isn't as ambitious or complex as Metallica's follow-ups, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. However, most of the songs are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album.	1
THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitars), Kirk Hammett (lead guitars), Cliff Burton (bass guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion).  THE DISC: (1984) 8 songs clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet with black & white band pictures, song credits/lyrics and thank you's. All music written by Metallica. Recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Label - Elecktra.  COMMENTS: I grew up with this album. Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out (thank God for compact discs). This is still a classic Metallica album. However, decades later, I go back and forth with "Ride The Lightning". Thinking it totally shreds one week, and then the next week thinking it's so hard to get into. This album takes an acquired taste, and perhaps 'mood' is the better word. "Lightning" is Metallica finding their roots. Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance; atom splitting; rapid-fire assaults on the senses. The lightning quick songs are important in the band's library of songs. They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later. The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album. The two slower songs - "For Whom The Bells Toll" and "Fade To Black" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog. I can still listen to these songs anywhere, any time, any day. Both feature some amazing guitar work (both electric and acoustic). "Call Of Ktulu" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their 'live' version on "S&M" simply blew me away. Decades after this release, it's still a classic in my book, but I have to be in the mood for it. Just a notch below "Master Of Puppets". Still a great disc.	1
Right up until last year, I was never really much of a Metallica fan.  Then for some reason, I decided to get Garage Inc..  That in turn was followed by Justice, Black, Load, Reload, S&M, Puppets, and now, Ride.  Before buying S&M, I deciding to get the Cunning Stunts DVD.  And  believe me, I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed,  particularly, "Creeping Death" (probably the best song on the  DVD), "For Whom The Bell Tolls", and especially "Kill/Ride  Medley".  Those performances (along with the tracks on S&M) were  what prompted me to buy this CD. I was especially interested in hearing the  original versions of "Fight Fire With Fire" and "Ride The  Lightning" from the Medley.  And let me tell you, they are definitely  killer!  The machine-gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this  CD popular in the first place.  IMHO, Metallica help create speed/thrash  metal in the early/mid-80's.  Not only do you get the killer riffs, but you  also get the popular "Fade To Black" which is similar to  "One" in that it starts out really slow, then gradually picks up  speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo.  And then you have "The  Call Of Ktulu" which is an excellent instrumental by itself (however,  I prefer the S&M version; it sounds SO much better with the  orchestra!). Being a new Metallica fan, so to speak, I can start to see  why many of the longtime fans out there don't prefer the newer stuff  they've put out (I personally like both of the Loads).  Ride (along with  Puppets and Justice) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the  guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day.  Even though I've heard it only a few times, I'm starting to appreciate it  already!	1
This is one of the best Metallica albums, behind only Master of Puppets and the self-titled "Black" album. "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and "Fade to Black" are two of their best songs, and there isn't a bad one. The songwriting is a HUGE leap over their debut, with some of their best lyrics, not to mention countless classic riffs and solos. This is a must-have.	1
After amazing albuns "OPERATION MINDCRIME" and "EMPIRE", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein.	-1
Queensryche has evolved considerably over the past 20 years of their prolific careers. They've gone from fiery heavy metal in the days of their EP to the lush rock-opera of Operation: Mindcrime, to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful Empire, to their current status as a generic rock band. In the middle of these last two phases comes Promised Land. Compared to the remarkable accessibility of Empire, Promised Land is a little more difficult to appreciate. Living up to the amazing success and quality of Empire is nearly impossible, and I do not envy Promised Land for what it tried to do. The problem lies in the fact that Promised Land's excellent songs are not as densely packed as those on Empire. Most of the songs are good, but not all the songs are excellent. There are moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from levels of excellence. The superlative production alleviates some of the boredom associated with the passable tracks, as do the thick wall-of-sound arrangements. However, interspersed amonst the middling pieces are some of the best tracks they've ever recorded, including some of the finest lyrics. The acoustic balladry of "Bridge" made for a lucrative single that deserved all its enjoined success. The sad, thoughtful "Out of Mind," the ominous "Lady Jane," and the hard rock trappings of "Disconnected" are all great. The true standouts are the stormy title track, with those monstrous arrangements and the harrowing tone, and the moving closer, "Someone Else?" The latter is the most un-Ryche song they've ever done, consisting only of piano and Geoff Tate's emotive vocals. The memorable piano riffs, thoughtful lyrics and Tate's passion are what makes this one special. Tate even strains on a note...guess he's human after all! Without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness, the production helps. A good Queensryche, almost a great one. Still, it can't touch the monolithic status of Mindcrime and Empire. In terms of songcraft, those albums are the band's best.	1
Though not a true concept album like Operation: Mindcrime, Promised Land is an engaging conceptual-esque song cycle unified by simarily themed songs and myriad sound effects. From the opening collage of 9:28 AM we get right into the "story" with I Am I, which, along with The Bridge, was a minor album rock radio hit. Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it's arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate's world-class vocals. This is possibly the band's best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it's conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department. The music and overall arrangements are also the best and most dense that Queensryche has ever put together. Though not their top album (that honor still belings to Mindcrime) this is one of their most interesting, and certainly one of their best.	1
A friend said I would love this band.  Well... it was good.  Rock, some nice songs, but not too memorable. I like tecnho, nice beats, good poetic lyrics.  This wasn't' quite that.	1
One of the best trip hop albums ever.  Still terrific two decades later.	1
I like most of the songs, but I find I can't listen to it over and over.  But great stuff to turn on in the background when I'm working.	1
Great songs!	1
Oddly this album leaves you in a state of highness and in a good way.  The beats along with the oddly transfixing voice of the artist leave me wanting and needing more, just like a drug.	1
I purchase few complete CD's but this was one that I had to get. Most of the songs are really good and I love the smooth sound. I'm glad I've been introduced to trip hop.	1
MEZZANINE is another masterpiece from MASSIVE ATTACK!!!! This is just the perfect music to relax and reflect about life...Its either great in a party!!!! It's amazing!!! The mix of REGGAE, HIP HOP, eletronic and ROCK are worderful on MEZZANINE!!! A MUSIC MASTERPIECE!!!! Try BLUE LINES and PROTECTION too....WELL DONE, MASSIVE ATTACK!!!!!	1
This is simply the best Massive Attack album. If you only get one of their albums, make it this one. It's hard to explain the vibe of this album but it's very cool indeed, more so than their other albums. I guess I would say it's a real smart album.	1
With a solid set of cold embraces, this massively influential trip-hop unit's most mature construct to date can fizzle off slightly in overly pseudo-cool but remains a must own for anyone interested in electronic music.	1
There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic "Mezzanine" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.  What I love about "Mezzanine" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as "Mezzanine" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs "Angel" and "Risingon" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to "Teardrop" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. "Mezzanine" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.	1
Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very "listenable" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead.	-1
This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  "Angel," "Risingson," "Teardrop," and "Inertia Creeps". "Angel" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. "Risingson" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. "Teardrop" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. "Inertia Creeps" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection.	1
Massive Attack were one of the first gasps of trip-hop noticed outside of Bristol, and sadly they will be one of the last, it seems.  They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.  Mezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.  It is dark on the bright side, more a 4 a.m. flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort.  Its power is in a balance of rhythm, drive and deep-seated anxiety that begs for further listen.	1
"Mezzanine" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, "Mezzanine" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to "Blue Lines" that "Protection" failed to be. Like "Blue Lines", "Mezzanine" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic ("Blue Lines" suffered from the track "One Love" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on "Blue Lines", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than "Blue Lines" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album "Blue Lines" and Portishead's "Portishead" (though this one isn't as good).  Highlights include: the entire album!	1
You've heard their music in commercials and movies and may not have realized it. I didn't until I picked this album up within the past six months. Of it, Blue Lines, and 100th Window (only ones I have), it's the best, and that is clearly in consensus with other MA fans. This is a very good album...just really interesting and exceptional musically.  If you're at all interested in this kind of music, you cannot go wrong with Mezzanine.  EDIT: I've actually been listening to this album more over the last 24 hours and am now of the opinion that it's more masterful than I originally thought. It's easily listenable from start to finish. There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.  As others have alluded to, or stated, this is the kind of CD that holds a constant spot near the top of one's music collection. I knew it was good, but only now do I fully understand that fact. Isn't it a breath of fresh air when a single album is full of such greatness and not just one or two songs, as with 99% of the music out there?	1
It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening "Angel" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!	1
I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than "Mezzanine". You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from "The Cocteau Twins" singer, and a cool sample of "The Cure" on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. "Teardrop" was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your "Portishead" and "Sneaker Pimps" cd's.	1
I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. "Mezzanine" was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums ["Blue Lines", "Protection", and "100th Window"]. I think of all the MA albums I own, "Mezzanine" resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of "Angel". I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off "Mezzanine" has to be "Man Next Door" and "Teardrop". Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in "Mezzanine" into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that "Mezzanine" set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two.	1
Mezzanine is one of my all time favourite albums. It's just that good. the arrangements, the production and the wibe on the album. It's dark and beautiful and the musicianship is also top notch. the Album has many guest appearences and the lads from Massive are geniuses to find the right people to sing the right songs. Teardrop is now a classic and many other songs are also brilliant. I recomend everyone who claims to be a music fan to buy Mezzanine. It is indded one of the best albums of the late 90's and probably of all time.	1
...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  "Mezzanine" perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include "Angel" where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about "Teardrop" (w/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.  Heck, I bought it just before Christmas last year and wondered what took me so long in doing so.  In any case, I'll definitely look into buying their other stuff including the DVD!  And I look forward to their new record which should be coming out sometime this fall!	1
What struck me first after hearing Mezzanine was its sheer weight. The sound, with its low beats and (in a first for Massive Attack) thrashing guitars, succeeds in actually oppressing the listener....and that's very  much a good thing, because the music in this album is just so very novel  and smooth you want to feel every part of it. As usual with Massive  releases, "Mezzanine" features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  "Teardrop" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky "Dissolved Girl,"  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica. Horace  Andy, the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack's albums, has  three songs here, the industrial "Angel," and the almost-retro  Massive Attack "Man Next Door" and "(Exchange)". The  songs featuring the vocals of Massive's members 3D and Daddy G are also  well-done, and 3D's threatening whispers on "Risingson" do a lot  to make it one of my favourite songs. Although certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse.	1
I remember when this came out on lp in the early 70's.  Thank God it has been re-issued on cd.  This is what Philly sould is all about!	1
The Stylistics make moody soul music, atmospheric. There's also a hint of Warrick - Bacharach  in their music, well, after all they did cover "You'll never get to if you break my heart", and the joyous "Make it last" carries on in that vein.  Other than that song, in my opinion this album doesn't really get going until the second half - the jazzy slow burn of "Love comes easy", the off-hand rock 'n' roll title track, the soul classic "You make me feel brand new" and the exuberant "I won't give you up".  But, the highlight for me is undoubtedly "There's no reason" with it's off-kilter melody, interesting arrangement and rolling chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies. Along with most of the other songs, the gentle, understated sound adds to the whole atmosphere.  Songs like "Only for the children" and "Could this be the end" - I don't know. I've always thought Russell Thompkins Jr is at his best singing love songs, because it suits his vocal style than angrier songs. Overall I would give this album a 7, or three and a half.	1
1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics.  Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor.  The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here.  "Make It Last" has the same lushness of songs like "You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)" from Round 2.  "Payback Is A Dog" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony.  "Love Comes Easy" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love.  "Rockin' Roll Baby" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk.  Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively.  A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo "I Won't Give You Up."  Then we have a great jam with the slower "Let Them Work It Out," which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying.  The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties.  A somber joint is "Could This Be The End."  It is another slower joint with perfect harmony.  Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue.  Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others.  The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever.	1
I'm a life long Blue Oyster Cult fan from way back, in 1988 they released "Imaginos" #122, at the time I thought this was a tremendous record, but after 22 years of reflection, it's a 4 star release at best.  This is a upgrade after "Club Ninja", but that wasn't very hard to do.  The thing about "Imaginos", it has too many special guests and the recording was 5 or 6 years in the making. (I didn't know that at the time I bought it in '88).  I still like these songs after 22 years, "I Am The One You Warned Me Of", "Les Invisibles", "Magna Of Illusion", with some fine piano by Allen Lanier, the remake of their own "Astronomy" #9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune is the classic "Blue Oyster Cult", just a great track, Buck and Eric at there best.	1
OK, it may have started out as a great "concept album" in the mind of Sandy Pearlman. It may have grown into a Joe Bouchard solo album, which stretched out over multiple recording dates. It may have ended up as the "final" BOC album in 1988 because of the fact that Joe Bouchard was joined in sessions by Eric Bloom, Allen Lanier, Buck Dharma and Albert Bouchard.  So WHAT?  It's got the bone-rattling, truly unique "The Siege and Investiture of Baron von Frankenstein's Castle At Weisseria," featuring Joey Cerisano and Jon Rogers on additional lead vocals and the unforgettable shout/chant/refrain "CARPE DIEM" followed by doomsday crashing riff-heavy guitars, and the opening track "I Am the One You Warned Me Of," which is easily as good as any of the tracks on the early BOC albums.  There's also a remake of two songs from the second album ("Tyranny & Mutation"), "Astronomy" and "Subhuman" (which is retitled "Blue Oyster Cult" here).  Sometimes it pays to focus on what an album IS as opposed to what it ISN'T.  This one will shake the fillings loose from your teeth. It may be a patchwork quilt but it rocks like a mother, and the fact that it's back on CD is worth celebrating.	1
Back in the day BOC was Huge. I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE, Imaginos. I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment, SO when it came out I was busy and just didn't get around to getting it. when I did go to get it it was gone. Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I don't know but nowhere to be found. No big deal right? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out,  becoming Nostalgic and Nundane. Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good. Some of the best BOC has ever done many say. Hmmmm. better get it. NOT, everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy. Anyway when I saw it here re-released I jumped all over it. Damn glad I did. When I first listened to this and keep in mind, for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD, it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks. As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done. Those songs get a solid 10. Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive. ie the title Imaginos. These are Blockbuster, Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him. A shame really. BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to, well, cult following status. I am a member of that BOC Cult. I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me. I know it came out in 1978 or 79, and it is now 2008. But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time. It sounds like so much of BOC's greates work. Classic and Timeless. If like me you are a BOC fan and you don't have this. You already know from the years that you gotta have it. If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC, let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he wasn't there already.  Kev.	1
An album that has always seemed to divide BOC fans.  "Imaginos" is a concept album concocted by Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman whose origins go almost back to the beginning of the band.  Two of the tracks on this album appear on "Secret Treaties" which serves as somewhat of a companion piece to "Imaginos".  The original BOC lineup re-united for this one along with a host of guests.  The concept is the story of Imaginos a time traveler of sorts who appears at different times in the world's history to influence historical events.  The problem is that the story is not told in a linear fashion and it ends up being completely confusing.  I have read essays on the story behind the story and still haven't really figured it all out.  This is a weird album for me, I think most of the songs on this disc are outstanding to the point of being some of the best stuff BOC has ever done, but looking at the album as a whole it is not quite as good as I think it should have been.  Being a big progressive rock fan maybe I set my expectations too high when I found out BOC was doing a true concept piece, but on this one the sum is not greater than it's parts.  That being said there is some really great material here.  The remakes of "Astronomy" and "Blue Oyster Cult" (formerly "The Subhuman") are better than the originals.  "I Am The One You Warned Me Of", "Les Invisibles", "In The Presence Of Another World", "Del Rios Song", "The Siege.....", "Magna Of Illusion" are all awesome.  The title track is a bit of a letdown, but still ok.  Still......even with all this great stuff, I think the album could have been put together better and re-worked to an extent.  Anyway this is a minor quibble as this album really is a must for any fans of BOC.  I believe it is currently out of print and hard to find.	1
Classic!!! One of his best albums!	1
great cd run out and buy this!!	1
his first and one of his best albums other than the first Marshal Mathers lp in my opinion	1
I wanted an album so rugged, nobody could touch it, Eminem proclaims. If hes referring to rap albums, this LP might just be that. Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard. No popular rapper you can think of, alive or dead, even comes close. I mightve been saying the same about guest Royce Da 5-9 if he weren't upstaged by a rapper whose comedic wit, clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius.  There is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects. The beats are also impressive, so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty choruses and silly skits.  marcellee.com	1

Cum On Everybody 14. Rock Bottom 15. Just Don't Give A 18. I'm Shady 19. Bad Meets Evil 20. Still Don't Give A  if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do	1
Before the Slim Shady LP, a no-name emcee named Eminem was probably ripping the mic at the Lyricist Lounge or other underground hiphop spots...back when he was an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scaring you sh**less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battling ability.  Back when he was able to step into a rhyme cypher with Canibus, Mos Def, Last Emperor, and Chino XL and dominate...  To a hiphop standpoint, by focusing on his lyrics and comparing with his earlier efforts, this CD is the beginning of his downfall...  But with the variety of ideas it saves the CD.  And by being so creative brings it up to 5 stars... Unfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas... ARTIST - one that can use their imaginative ability to create something... But, none the less, an excellent debut CD by a good artist who's stuck with a bad label...  Hopefully one day Slim will wake up and leave DRE in his footprints and join a true HIPHOP label 'RAWKUS' ... plus he's not the only white rapper out there today: Evidence (Dilated Peoples), The High and Mighty, Smut Peddlers, Everlast/Whitey Ford, El-P (Company Flow), and RA Rugged Man... I'm Out ... Mind Power!	1
Now this is what you call some quality recording by a quality artist.  Ledisi is a good definition of "grown folk" music. The songs were well written and I can about imagine what her performance was like. She seems to really be into her music.  There is nothing scripted about it.  You can feel the passion coming from her voice as well as the creativity that was put into the music, which is somewhat of an lost art in today's world of music.  I highly recommend this cd to any fan of real soul music.	1
Now I have just finished my reviewing Ms Ledisi's major debut:<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lost and Found</a>, which, whilst being a nice safe release, is nothing like this. Now this is a album, and I can well understand why this is an in demand CD. I like the live feel to this CD, and the excellent choice of songs on offer: from the excellent 'Get Outta My Kitchen' 'Coffee', and the controversial 'Papa Love to Love me' I think what this CD has that her:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lost and Found</a>&nbsp;CD lacks is, apart from edgier songs selection, is a jazz influence that runs through this CD. It's sad that with an independence like this, the freedom that an artist has is lost when dealing with the majors. As Ms Ledisi owns the master for this I do hope it sees a re-lease on her new label, because the masses need to hear this.	1
Ledisi - Soulsinger (2000) Word has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is true, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in "Take Time" and "Coffee". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in "Groove On", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to "Free Again" and the very revealing "Poppa Loved to Love Me", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR	1
Ledisi is less than average...there, it had to be said! if hating on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong. being a good poet doesn't always equate to being a good recording artist. she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i'll always give an artist props for originality, but i'm just jaded and expect more for my money. this just doesn't move me, sorry.	-1
I REALLY ONLY BOUGHT THIS CD FOR TWO SONGS, AT FIRST THEN I LISTENED TO THE WHOLE CD AND IT IS REALLY NOT BAD	1
The Left Banke is one of those bands from the 60s that kinda fell through the cracks as the years went on.  Pretty much looked at as a "two hit wonder", they were much more than that(as One and Two Hit Wonders tend to be sometimes). They're classified as "Baroque Rock".  What the hell is that, you ask?  Oddly, it sounds exactly like it's description.  The band members of The Left Banke weren't the most technically savvy of musicians, so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member, Michael Brown.  Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord, both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke's sound.  Add to that, the smooth Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, and you have.....Baroque Rock!!  One song, Evening Gown, almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song! I'm surprised I like this album as much as I do.  Though I'm big on vintage rock music, this seemed a little too different than what I normally listen to, which is rockabilly and surf. I initially bought it because I've always had a soft spot for Pretty Ballerina, but much to my surprise I found this whole album to be great! I am very glad I picked this one up!  If you like the late 60s stuff, The Left Banke deserves a resurrection.  If you like Justin Bieber, you're a schmuck!	1
This is a very special cd. It is a tribute to Debby's mother-in-law Rosemary Clooney so that makes it special in itself. But whats really special is this womans' voice - so perfectly suited for this material. As a fan from the start of her career I know how versatile she is. Here she sings with authority and with the technique of a jazz legend. For us fans who have been waiting for new material from Debby for years this is just what the doctor ordered. This cd is perfect for a night of romance with fine wine and Boones' beautiful vocals washing over you. The production has class written all over it from the players to Debby Boone. Looking forward to the live show - it will rock! Congratulations Debby and thanks for keeping your music and your life real. God Knows :).....postscript - i was lucky enough to catch Debbys' live show at Scullers in Boston 6/22/05 and she truly charmed and dazzled her audience. Debby - thanks for being such an inspiration and a true lady...as I said "keep the good music coming!". :)	1
This is a very moving collection of Debbys' Christian music as is the recent "You Light Up My Life - Greatest Inspirational Songs" - if you like this you'll like that too. Boone has a dramatic soaring voice that comforts the soul. Can't wait to get her latest on Concord Records "Reflections of Rosemary" a tribute to mother in law Rosemary Clooney. She may finally get the props she deserves.	1
I would have liked a dance band with at least 15 pieces or more to accompany Debby. She has the "chops" & I believe that this would enhance her sound. The band was still good but it could be a fuller sound.	1
The songs in this album "Reflections of Rosemary" from "Blue Skies" and  "Mood Indigo" to "In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning" and "Time After Time" are some of the nicest popular standards identified with Rosemary Clooney, one of the best female vocalists of all-time. And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother-in-law. This album promises the listeners an unforgettably, wholesomely beautiful listening experience. There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today: Rosemary Clooney's arranger/pianist for twenty years, John Oddo, arranger Earl Brown, guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox, bassist Chuck Berghofer, drummer Gregg Field, percussionist Daniel Greco, saxophonists Gary Foster, Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton, trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian.  I have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably "Sweet Adoration," "Can You Reach My Friend?" "Sincerely Yours" and "You Light Up My Life." Her father's music, Pat Boone, has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up. He was one of my late parents' favorite singers and mine, too and I was especially fond of his hit song, "Love Letters In The Sand."  On this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication,  Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting  Irving Berlin classic, "Blue Skies," which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan, whenever he was "sad, when he took a fall and was crying, or anytime he needed his spirits lifted." It's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney's A Capella version. Ms. Boone stated that, like her son Jordan, she would always find comfort in this beautiful song, which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo.  While all the tracks are so enjoyable, I really love the way she sang "Mood Indigo," which features a vocal quartet - herself and her sisters Cheryl, Lindy and Laury with vocal chart arrangement written by Earl Brown. With its vintage-sounding arrangement and its nostalgic rendition, this classic from Duke Ellington/Barney Bigard/Irving Mills evokes a sentimental feeling that will flood your eyes with an ocean of tears as the sisters sing...  Little sister, you ain't been blue No, no, no You ain't been blue Not till you've had that mood indigo That feelin' goes stealin' down to your shoes Then you cry, you just sit there and cry Go long, so long blues...  Always get that mood indigo Since my baby said goodbye In the evenin' when lights are low I'm so lonesome I could cry  The wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in "I've Grown Accustomed To His Face" while Dan Higgin's flute plays beautifully in "It Might As Well Be Spring" complementing Ms. Boone's gorgeous vocals. The Van Heusen/Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning "But Beautiful," "Moonlight Becomes You" and "Like Someone In Love." One of my all-time favorites "The Music That Makes Me Dance" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded. And she dedicated it to her hubby, Gabri. The delicate medley of "It Never Entered My Mind" and "In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra, whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past. The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on "The Best Is Yet To Come" is so pleasing to the ears.  An all-time top favorite, Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's "Time After Time" is also a highlight and one of the singer's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called "Chet Baker Sings." According to her, "she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl's crush on Chet. She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice, not to mention his picture." She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely "love the way this guy sang." And to her surprise, Rosemary told her; "Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day?" In other words, they had a crush on the same guy! Co-incidentally,  "Chet Baker Sings" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago. It's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style.  Listen to Debby Boone at her utmost best as she pays homage to one of the best female singers of all-time, Rosemary Clooney. You'll also be delighted with the Liner Notes, which include in great detail Ms. Boone's heartfelt sentiments for each and every song she selected for this great tribute album.  An album of sheer beauty, elegance and perfection.	1
very positive cd	1
It is a very good album and of high quality output.  I listen to it on my way to work and it energizes my spirit!  I choose 5 stars because it is 5 stars.  Every song is great and unique in itself!	1
Great praise and worship music! Praise is what I do is my fave song of choice. HIghly recommend this cd.	1
William Murphy does a great job in delivering his gospel message to gospel lovers such a myself. His presentation is unique and his style can not be confused with anyone else like some artist. He stands out as a great gospel artist and I am pleased with this particular CD.	1
If you can only purchase 1 CD, it should be this one. William Murphy is Gospels greatest hidden talents. His work will inspire you.	1
First off, thanks to Jeff Feezle for listing the album content. All the songs are first rate by original artist.  Perry, Les, Eddie, Tony, and the rest are excellent and their version has been the definitive this past fifty years. Not a groner in the bunch.  Arrangement and accompaniment is beyond compare.  Technically excellent.  While it takes awhile to get me in dance mode, each song foretells the coming rock n rock era. Never fails to put me in a good mode. I usually get in the mode along about Dragnet.  Bought it used, and was as advertized; like new.  Arrived on time, well packaged.	1
I bought several of the "Your Hit Parade" CDs for my dad, who liked to listen to the songs on them in the 40s and 50s on the radio.  I don't know much of the music of the period, but they seem a good representation of the hit songs of each year.  I remember hearing several of the songs as old favorites when I was growing up in the 60s.  I ended up buying one CD for myself.	1

works great	1
great music	1
I have enjoyed this immensely!	1
Nice Patriotic music performed in a professional manner.  Good music that reminds you of great background for 4th of July firework or to just listen to.  I enjoy the 101 Strings Orchestra performances (especially for the price)	1
I play this cd at night to go to sleep with, it's relaxing and soothing.  I am patriotic so these songs appeal to me.  I also recognize many of the singers voices throughout the recording.  Superb job by all of them.	1
The spirit of America in music.  Just a great collection that you wil love to listen to time and again.	1
Sexyback is superwack to me. this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day. makes me think of Trent Rezinor's "closer" Meets Laidback's "White horse". Timberlake is trying to channel so much,but ends up forgetting the most important person in the song&that is himself.  a really flat track.	-1
The alumnus of the previously-manufactured and now-defunct N'Sync has returned with a follow-up to his hugely successful debut of 2003, Justified. While that effort shows promise, its slight disarray is sometimes jarring.  Now forward to 2006, the golden boy of music returns with first single Sexyback off FutureSex/LoveSounds. The single is an incredible piece of sweet funk, combining the sensuality of yesteryear's Prince and the deft execution of pre-scandal Michael jackson. With a hot salacious video to boot, the song is sure pop ecstasy.  At the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits. Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb, beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90's recycled house mix.  The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat. The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves.	1
When I first heard the title of this song, I thought he was singing about someone having a sexy backside. I didn't know he was singing about himself bringing sexy back, as if 'sexy' was ever gone! For real, this song is awful. It has no melody and is just plain emotionless. Justin Timberfake stated in an interview he was trying to bring back the sexiness of the 1980s. Well, he failed big time with this one.	-1
Love this band they rock little like winger!!!! Very strong no compromise Christianity or musically ether very talented musiction and strong Christian which i aplod in this day of compromise fake Christian or c.f. compromising Christian musicians and Christian people to can't wait to get all there cds ps a nother good band sancracy i recommended this band for winger fans thay theocracy rocks	1
The self-titled release by the Atlanta based band, Theocracy first appeared in 2007 but has been out of circulation since that time.  For several months, fans have long-awaited for the release of Theocracy's original album - an album that has been remastered and remixed.  On November 19, fans around the were were thrilled to listen in to Matt Smith and the boys hammer out their unique style of Stryper meets Dream Theater heavy metal music.  Track by Track:  After a 80's-like keyboard intro the album begins with a double-base drum anthem that celebrates victory in Christ.  Here's a few lines from Ichthrus.  Forced into the catacombs unite to praise the King of kings they fear a revolution and the power that He brings heaven's sons stand as one, as believers in the blood of Christ even in death we have true life  CENTURIES FLY BUT THE FLAME IS STILL ALIVE THE MAY HIDE IT, BUT IT WILL NEVER DIE CARVED IN OUR SOULS, SEE THE TWO HALVES OF THE SIGN THROUGH THE AGES HIS GLORY WILL ARISE FOR ALL TIME  The Serpent's Kiss begins as a ballad and speaks candidly about the curse of sin that has been inflicted on the cosmos.  Born into the darkness thrown into the viper's den the serpent in the cradle takes the child into its nest of sin slowly suffocating the souls of victims it has found into the vicious cycle on the path that only leads us down  Rat-race-fueled machinery this system of corruption have we become so cold and numb we're blind to its destruction? We're forging in the fires made of greed Our idols made of gold then bowing down before them with corrupt, adulterous souls opened eyes, realize...  WHAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR LIVES CORRUPTED OUR DREAMS WHAT WE HAVE LOST AND WHAT REMAINS PARALYZED BY THE VENOM THAT RUNS THROUGH OUR VEINS THERE'S GOT TO BE MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS THE WORLD'S CARESS IS JUST THE SERPENT'S KISS  But the venom that has plagued mankind has been defeated by the power of the cross.  So the song continues ...  I stand before you as a child by this world I've been defiled stained and poisoned, burned and beaten bruised and wounded, sick and vile with hands reaching out to you, I run realizing what I've done you take me in your arms, a reunited father and son...  The song is not only a powerful reminder of the gospel but also leaves listeners with a permanent and painful warning:  And all illusion ceases to exist the world's caress is just a serpent's kiss  Mountain paints a vivid portrait of the journey that every Christ-follower faces.  Step by step the climb gets harder my being weakens as I struggle farther and farther flesh is weakness, darkness, sickness my dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled my will defeated, my spirit humbled once more I am hopeless, helpless without you  The tune resembles John Bunyan's classic work, Pilgrim's Progress and leaves listeners with hope as they plod their way through the Christian life:  Take me to the places I can't go Transcending I'm sick of living in the status quo New Beginning And when it seems I've given up On eagle' wings you life me up again and this time I know, in the end ...You carried me  The title track, Theocracy is a metal dream that challenges every listener with the direct claims of Christ's lordship:  At the center of my heart there sits a throne That the rightful occupant's not always free to call His own For how can I give the King His place of worth above all else When I spend my time striving to place the crown upon myself?  The chorus hammers the lordship theme with a holy vengeance:  I TAKE MY CROWN AND CAST IT DOWN CASTLES BURNING CASTLES BURNING LEARN TO GROW, GROW TO BE A FLESH AND BLOOD THEOCRACY TO TAKE THE LOSS AND BEAR THE CROSS RAISE THE KINGDOM RAISE THE KINGDOM BURN AWAY ALL IVE BEEN TO RESURRECT THEOCRACY WITHIN  2 Corinthians 10:5 is employed to remind Christians to submit every thought to the lordship of Christ:  and the would-be rulers of my heart that I place upon the throne each lead the kingdom of my life to ruin to bring every though into submission to tear the idols down is to break the chains, to rearrange, to give the king his crown  The Healing Hand is a powerful five-part masterpiece that begins with the prophecy of the Messiah - the hope of nations.  The tune leads listeners from the cradle to the Cross of Christ where the "healing hand becomes the bleeding hand."  His kingdom forever, the Lion of Judah in strength everlasting redemption, atonement complete resurrected in power, as King now he stands FOR THE BLEEDING HAND HAS BECOME THE RULING HAND  Faith-born forever, a part of His kingdom become Or reject him, stand back and watch his kingdom come Alpha and omega almighty is he Christ reigns victorious for eternity Eternity  Several more songs grace this stunning album.  There is simply too much to share in a short review in this format.  But suffice it to say, this piece of work by Theocracy is about as good as it gets.  The music is tight, the production is crisp, and the vocals are spot on.  Again, as I have noted elsewhere, Matt Smith is one of the premier songwriters of this day.  For whatever reason, he has gone largely unnoticed - a tragedy in its own right.  This young man should be commended for his God-given gifts.  But as every God-fearing man recognizes, all the glory goes back to the Giver of every good gift.  Thanks to Matt Smith and the band for writing such God-honoring music; heavy metal music that truly honors the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifies his gospel!	1
For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums). Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print. Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece.	1
Bonnie Pointer's First Solo Album is a classic waiting to be rediscovered. A varied album of different styles, all produced & performed so amazingly, it holds up well today. There is funk, Motown oldies, acoustic tracks, & a great orchestrated ballad. The music, the musicianship, and the vocals are all very creative and of the highest calibre.   Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style. They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them. This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle. This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to #11 on the charts. Bonnie redid it as a single, and I much prefer the album version , with it's homage to classic Motown. The other 2 tracks are both stellar, with inventive arrangements, singing & playing. The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing. Pop/funk with Bonnie singing all the background vocals herself, and in the middle there is a banjo solo! That's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie, the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album. And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT, I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone's THANK YOU. This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it, blazingly funky horns a/la James Brown, Bonnie's muti-faceted  vocals & just sheer musical genius at it's height. Outkast must have heard this track. It's just waiting to be sampled. The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging, playing & co-writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL, Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN, original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON, NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John's band on one track, and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER.   And Side Two illustrates another side to Bonnie Pointer, with 4 acoustic rhythmically driven & played songs MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], and the beautiful ballad MY EVERYTHING that closes this unique, diverse album of sheer musical pleasure. These 4 numbers all co-written by DONALD BALDWIN are amazing - filled with hooks, catchy choruses, and pure musicianship. Remember Bonnie's solo on BLACK COFFEE from The Pointer Sisters 2nd album THAT'S A PLENTY. That is just a taste of what Bonnie can do with a ballad.   Also of note is that this self-titled album is the one with a RED COVER. For some unknown reason, Motown released Bonnie's 2nd album with the same self-titled name, and that has a purple cover. Also it's not as great as this one. Released in Dec. 1978, the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album, this is a classic that has to be heard. It is by far the best of Bonnie's 3 solo albums. Catalog number is MOTOWN M7-911R1.   Tracks: WHEN I'M GONE, FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [HANDCUFF ME ], HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, AH SHOOT, MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], MY EVERYTHING.   Released on MOTOWN M7-911RI, December 1978, Red Cover.	1
I was all of 14 years old when I had this project on vinal, and I swan ... I wore the grooves off the album! It captured my musical mind back then and finding it on CD at last has been almost more than I can hadle! Every song is Motown production at it's best! While each song is perfection and I cannot pick out a 'best' I am partial to AH SHOOT; funky and bass driven ... it gets this white boy to dancin' like no white boy should!! Then there's I LOVE TO SING TO YOU ... a wonderful love song in itself, but Bonnie sings it so sweetly and simply that it amazes me. The original line up of songs ends with MY EVERYTHING ... another love song sung with total honesty ~ pure magic! The bonus tracks are the icing on an all ready perfect cake, and I am thrilled to have this back in my collection.	1
I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonnie Pointer to be released on CD. It is such a highly unique album. The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic " MY EVERYTHING " with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of " AH SHOOT ", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly true! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, " AH SHOOT " is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear " AH SHOOT " the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn't the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I'd give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star. Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before you make it on CD.	-1
It's encouraging to see that a batch of late-'70's and early-'80's albums have been newly (circa 2012) reissued on CD--by a label called BBR (Big Break Records).  "Bonnie Pointer" is the first one of them I've bought, because it contains one of my all-time favorite disco songs, "Heaven Must Have Sent You".  The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a #11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit, but this reissue cures that by including both the 7" and 12" versions of it.  The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record's first single, "Free Me From My Freedom/Tie Me To a Tree (Handcuff Me)".  The latter, which is not a medley by the way, has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid-chart, at least on the pop side.  Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference, or as the liner notes say, "a step back for the feminist movement."  It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's--that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love, not literally, after finding independence to be disappointing.  "Put love's chains back on me..."  The rest of the record covers a wide range of styles.  I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on "More And More" and I'm hearing some Billie Holliday in "My Everything".  Another Motown remake (besides "Heaven Must Have Sent You", originally a hit for the Elgins) begins the album:  "When I'm Gone" is a (literally) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic.  I wouldn't say the sound is "muddy" as another reviewer put it, but I can't say it leaps out of the speakers either.  I'd be curious to hear/read what other buyers think about this.  On the plus side, the packaging is excellent, with great photos and an extensive essay by Christian John Wikane.  The notes give a brief history of the Pointer Sisters before (thoroughly) discussing the making of this album.  More about "Heaven":  it opens with a machine gun drum blast, has the guitar jangling all the way through, features a 2-minute wild string-and-drum break, and ends with Ms. Pointer channeling Louis Armstrong.  One of the most amazing disco productions ever!	1
For those who grew up during the 70s like me or those who are just fans of the period The Pointer Sisters are infamous.  Bonnie Pointer was the creative force behind the original quartet and after years of huge success she broke from the group in 1976 and joined Motown.  Her first release was this gorgeous recording with the glorious red cover, her beautiful face and simply titled BONNIE POINTER.  Side one had the uptempo tracks and side two was more reflective.  There are glorious covers of WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. The Motown sound was again loud and strong.  But Bonnie also brought FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM a disco track with much funk and AH SHOOT.  The second side totally shined with emotional standouts MORE AND MORE and MY EVERYTHING.  Raw and emotional, Bonnie gave her all.  The album was a huge success and then HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was released as a disco track and it roared up all the charts and became a disco/dance/soul/r&b classic.  It also brought even more attention to the amazing album.  Here BBR has done their magic and brought this superb release to life with beautiful and glorious remastering.  The sound is amazing.  What a gift.  And then we get 5 bonus tracks and a huge booklet of pictures and extensive liner notes.  If this release brings back memories it has never sounded better.  I highly recommend it to fans of soul/disco/r&b as well as fans of the 70s.  And a huge thanks to BBR.  You are reuniting listeners to the true music classics the way they were meant to be heard.  Don't hesitate to purchase this.  The crystal clear sound of Bonnie's pure vocals will pull you in from beginning to end.	1
I was living in a small apartment in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, the year this album hit the shelves. Heaven Must Have Sent You, both in English and Spanish, rocked every juke box on the island. Radio Mart, broadcasting from Cuba, had the Caribbean airways poppin'.	1
The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.   As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.   So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.   Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover. Songs: I CAN'T HELP MYSELF, JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN.	-1
This 2 CD set contains 61 tracks many released for the first time and others only found on very limited edition vinyl. The producer, Bob Celli together with Bobby Vee's family have done an absolutely exceptional job in remastering the various tracks - Bobby Vee never sounded so good! The stereo is lush, the definition superb. "Party Doll" with the Crickets, an unreleased track from the 1962 album and "Gone" (which was apparently an atrociously sounding 45 due to a mastering problem) are wonderful. If, as gas prices top $4.00 and the economy flounders you need a trip back to the 60s in technicolor stereo - this is a must have set. One issue, Amazon lists a digital download in addition to the 2CDs - there is no info on this in the package.	1

Good ole rock and roll	1
Good	1
Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).  And most of these won't get much play 30 years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality songs not heard much today.	1
Great music	1
Wanted music to exercise to. This is a good album for that.	1
love his music and I will be purchasing more in the near future as long as my wife lets me order	1
Another great song by Charley Pride.  I love the song, it has such a good upbeat message and he has a good voice.	1
Charley's voice is incredible, he is truly a country legend though he doesn't get as much recognition as he should! This is his biggest hit, take a listen and you'll be an instant fan.	1
I like this song and love Allison's voice. It is haunting and moving and powerful. She sings the song as though she is trying to convey a serious message and I am on the verge of understanding the message. I recommend this song.	1
This is a great song and I have downloaded several copies.  It has been done by practically everybody from rock bands to opera singers and there is something to say for all.  The lyrics are stunning - it is a very sad love song.  The singer or chorus who does it needs quite a range.  It needs to be belted out, not whispered with the help of electronic equipment.  I liked Allison Crowe's renditon.  Bon Jovi does a good job, as does Jason Castro,the Canadian Tenors, and Brandi Carlile.	1
Crow does a decent job on this song, my recent favorite lyrics.  Gives it a strong clear sound and image.	1
THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.	1
This is one of those songs that takes you back to a really talented period in Popular music. The singing and bass line in this song really are amazing and incredible! A great, timeless classic that I like to listen to using the Amazon cloud player.	1
The lyrics and melody to this song mean as much in 2013 as they did in the 70's when it was released.	1
Excellent song. Love It much!!  Would recommend it to R&B lovers everywhere.  Really good price for for one great song.	1
another classic song	1
Nice voice, nice group. One of the best of all time. Miss them so much. I wish they were here now singing all of the hits.	1
Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you	1
This song is one of the greatest songs ever. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music that will live on forever at weddings and many other places. I love the sitar sounding guitar.	1
This song brought back memories from when I was a teenager. Definetly a great song and they sing it well.	1
Latoya Luckette sampled this song in one of hers and I just wanted the original. I like the vibe of this song.	1
I do not write revews for single mp3's  I do not I do not write revews for single mp3'swrite revews for single mp3's	1
The Stylistics  are one of my favorite groups. There is so much feeling in their music, and it brings out the best of your feelings.	1
This song is a sweet song. I have no complaints. I just like it. It makes you feel good when you hear it.	1
Love this style of music	1
Growing up, I was raised on all kinds of music, none of it Motown. But secretly, I loved the stuff, and would listen to it and sing to it all the time. And now, today, I sing at various bars and restaurants with a predominantly country audience (simply because that's the area where I live -- out in the country!) And whenever I sing a Motown classic, like Stevie Wonder's "Superstition," I see feet and hands a tappin' to the beat! But when I do "You Make Me Feel Brand New" by the Stylistics (because, yes. I can sing both the low and the high parts myself,) people start slow dancing. And I get all kinds of compliments. If you can pull it off vocally, then you really owe it to your audience, and to yourself, to share this wonderful love ballad with the world.	1
Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you	1
This is the best a collection of their greatest hits Many great songs brings back lots of memories. If you love the 70s youll love this	1
The Stylistics music will always be excellent music to do just about everything to. They have a style that is both unique and unforgettable.	1
If you ever want to make out with a chick put this on. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music from a  simpler time.	1

This is the version of Betcha By Golly, Wow that I heard as a kid back in the late 1960's and very early 1970's. This song brings back many memories for me of the girls that I really liked back then. I like nearly all of the songs that were done by the Stylistics. If you like mellow music then you would like this song.  Mike Serovey, MA, MISM Owner of Mike Serovey Reviews	1
Another classic by the stylistics.  I love their music and in one way or another you can relate to the songs	1
The Stylistics music will always be excellent music to do just about everything to. They have a style that is both unique and unforgettable.	1
I know the artist Prince has done this song but it's nothing like hearing the original from time to time.	1
I do not write revews for single mp3's  I do not write revews for single mp3's I do not write revews for single mp3's	1
With the music out there now its nice to listen to words that aren't bleeped out  on TV or screamed or rapped  to some weird beat. Im tired of not being able to understand or having to turn things down all the time. The Stylistics are smooth and easy  without being boring. Its my kind of music	1
Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you	1
Who hasn't broke up to eventually make up just to break up again?  The Stylistics hit the nail on the head with this song	1
The Stylistics music will always be excellent music to do just about everything to. They have a style that is both unique and unforgettable.	1
Beautiful song, nostalgic, puts me right back in the 1970's.  Very easy to sing along with, if you need to cheer up about your quarrel with your loved one, this is your song!	1
I had forgotten JAVA but I downloaded it anyway and I'm glad I did. It's a simple tune but it's lots of fun.	1
A great song that I heard at a friends house a couple of time and had to add it to my collection.	1
I used this to help familiarize myself with this great composition. I love it, and would buy it again if I lost it.	1
This is the song that I walked in to during my wedding... On the video I can hear him respond when he saw me.... Priceless....  Now when I hear this song, it brings back the smile that I have held on to since the day that I married my wonderful husband!	1
Listening to this piece is relaxing an allows you to be at easy not being all stressed out, great song.	1
:)	1
Rocking 80's must-have tune!	1
Great tune	1
I've been thru a lot and this song sums up my life's travels.	1
Awesome	1
I first heard it on Charter's Music Choice dance channel.  Cool dance song and love the Howard Jones sample.  On my dance and party songs playlists.	1
Always loved this song and the new spin with Cedric Gervais makes it fun to listen to all over again!	1
Tracked this song down finally.  I'm collecting all my favorite oldies as well as some newer songs.  The list is over 100 already!	1
One thing you have to give Howard Jones, even his most depressing break-up songs are penned with sunshine.  Things Can Only Get Better (1985) is one of those forgotten mid-80's gems you throw in a mix and everybody loves.  It has a very 80's synth-vibe and an "oh-wow-wow" that is highly reminiscent of the following year's Bon Jovi smash&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Livin-On-A-Prayer/dp/B000V66VYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Livin' On A Prayer</a>.	1

Like this song one of my favorites..	1
Great old school song	1
This was a story telling song about a man wanting to be next to a beautiful woman. From the movie Car Wash. Great film and song.	1
A great song from a classic movie. The only song I really liked from the movie, so I had to have it.	1
The movie, the music all classic, for the lover in you.  Spending my dimes wasting my time, talking till I am black and blue, I wanna get next to you.  No disrespect just love and music.	1
This song is so strange and the innuendos would make most hair metal bands blush but this damn thing sticks in your head for the rest of the day.	1
This is a very nice song. Well performed by Nancy and Lee. It was one of my favorites for the year 1966. I love it. The sound is good.	1
Great songs. Originals. No re-records.	1
Great 60's song by the artists who originally made it great.	1
Played at our wedding, it was a hit with everyone.	1
Good	1
Really loved this so nice	1
I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.	1
I can listen to this song repeatedly and not get tired of it.  This is a fantastic song written by Lee Hazlewood that is perfectly sung by him and Nancy Sinatra.  He has the classic cowboy voice and Nancy Sinatra has that smooth and silky voice.	1
I had not heard this song before, and just happened to stumble across it on Youtube.  It's very pretty and I love listening to it.  Once again, I'm learning to play it on my ukulele.	1
I was watching a movie the other day, can't remember the name of the movie, and a couple was in the living room kinda making eyes at each other and all that.  Anyway this song was playing in the back ground of the scene.  And then I remembered what a great song.  Some Velvet Morning is also a great song.  You have the soft voice of Nancy...and the deep gravely voice of Lee.	1
I love music, downloads great, nice song and have a lot of  other songs by this artist, am a music lover.	1
This song caught me off-guard when I heard it in the soundtrack for the movie "Stoker."  The film had plenty of good songs, but this old cover song is my favorite. Very sexy.	1
"This is the song for people who are the workers and not the employees." Everytime I listened to this music, I am proud to be a worker. This song is now part of my music library.	1
In this classic rocker we are treated to a driving beat intertwined with soaring lyrics. Musically it is a fusion of early 70s rock with strong Motown flourishes such as ample use of fuzz and wa-wa on the guitars with lively choral back-up on the vocals. The lyrics are upbeat as was typical of the era. It makes you smile and wish more music of today could impart such a good feeling. There is some really great drumming throughout.	1
Great song	1
Great party music!!	1
Wouldn't have got it if I didn't like it, right?	1
This is my favorite song from Rare Earth. In my view it captures the best in Rare Earth's unique sound and energy.	1
OK	1
OK	1
It was so fun to hear this song at our 40th Class reunion.  Being able to download song to iPhone was easy.	1
I have always liked this song. Love the beat and the lirics! It's one of my favorites forever! Super jam!!	1
Oldie from the old days	1
The  fact that songs such as this are still available confers a degree of merit, I suppose.  I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them.	1
. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great	1
song from my Flower child days and still better than 98% of the cr*p that is being dumped on today's music market	1
I remember loving this song as a kid. I didn't know it was her that sang it. I would recommend it.	1
love love love this song gald to have it back and on my mp3 player listen to it all the time	1
It's a decent song with a good beat.  I like music with a good, fast rhythm and good lyrics.  This fits.	1
I couldn't find this song in other website but found it in amazon.com. It was for my wife and she liked it. So I'm happy with it too.	1
I really miss great groups like Santo & Johnny, they took the sound of music to another level which all of us back than just couldn't get enough of.	1
I really love the harmonization Frank and Nancy did on this too. It is clear and a very good song. I thank the person who put this up.	1
Recommend to all my friends. I like it but don't have 12 words for it so I am really babbling.	1
Do you guys remember Art Bell when he hosted the radio show "Coast to Coast"?  He had some great bumper music and this song was one of them.  Very Haunting.	1
What got me caught on this song was hearing a remake from the Webb Brothers. The remake took the best aspects of the song and gave it a updated polish. All that means is the original, while sounding dated, still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it. The song has two different parts to it. These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things. The feel, groove and even time signature are different. The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films. The other part switches to a 3/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature. Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other. Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine.  Much has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics. The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra, and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about. Is it all about romance? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being? Is it just about sex? I found no definitive answers out there. I like to think it's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings.  It's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well. It's been covered many times, but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones. If you like 60's psychedelic music they don't get much better than this.	1
Like most folks I heard this song in Kill Bill and was very curious who sung it and the like. I really like the guitar on this and how it accents with the lyrics. Its a good one for 99 cents.	1
Love this Music	1
Good	1
Classic	1
Nancy Sinatra at her best. Slow, sultry song with memorable lyrics, what more could one ask for? Typically of 60s songs and more ballad than rock. A must have for any Nancy fan.	1
Good tunes, did I mention I dislike writing reviews ??	1
Good Memories :)	1
One of the many songs that affected my life in a positive manner.	1
I never get tired of listening to this music, reminiscent of a more innocent time. Wish I was back there	1
This edition is just as I heard it on the radio growing up.  The lyrics are still powerful and well-phrased, the vocals still include harmonizing falsetto (which I cannot stand normally, but these guys did it perfectly), and the guitar work still has the slightly metallic electric guitar sound of classic rock.  Have to love it.	1
This was one of many that made it through the 70's and touched peoples hearts as they were growing up. I've loved this group all through school. Giving away my age but music is not the same anymore!	1
great song from a great era of music brings back lots of memories of my childhood great band who had some good songs	1
this was a hard rockin song and the band that did it was one i had to get used to but it was a nice add on to my player .	1
excellent	1
Great Song. An anthem, This song is the meaning of heavy metal.	1
great song	1
Great band and Awesome song....	1
Great Rock N Roll!!!	1
I like this song and wanted it for my Kindle	1
I like it	1
This was one of my favorite tunes, back in 1966. Nancy does a real good job performing this peppy song. I just love it. The MP3 sound is quite satisfactory.	1
I've always liked this tune but its really a short run-time  Reminds me of the movie Full Metal Jacket, this tune is played about midway thru the video.	1
Music of my ear an dlove it	1
Nancy Sinatra's most notable song is one of my favorites.	1
These Boots Are Made For Walkin by Nancy Sinatra is a bold pop song about a singer expressing in an assertive way of what she plans on doing with her boots. The music to the song is also well-timed with when she expresses with the lyrics how one of these days her boots are going to etc. etc.	1
Exactly what I was looking for.  This is the version I remembered.	1
I heard Jessica Simpson (I think) sing this and really wanted to hear the Nancy Sinatra version I heard as a kid, which I think sounds better.	1
WHAT'Z TO SAY. IT'Z A SONG D/LOAD AND IT PLAYED FINE, FULL LENGTH...	1
This song brings back such memories. I actually think this is the first song I ever paid attention too as a very young kid! Nice to find these old gems on Amazon!	1
SUPER	1
A+++	1
Good	1
LOVE OLD TIME MUSIC I AM WHAT IS CALLED A BABY BOOMER ,GOOD SOUND QUALITY USED TO MAKE SOME FAMILY MOVIES WITH FOR MEMORIES	1
The only song with a real beat.  Still hooks me every time.	1
This is a much better copy you have in store! The first one I had shared online years ago either went viral or no longer fits well in my iTunes library. But now I have this copy in my iPod! Thanks so much!	1
SATISFIED	1
I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.	1
I loved the 1960's the songs were so strong and almost militant by standards of the day.  In the backdrop of the times These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was one of the rallying cries of women fed up with the traditional roles of homemaker and mommy.  These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was more than a song it was a metaphor that spoke to empowerment of the so called weaker sex.  More than just a woman's rallying cry this was a darn good song too.  This song like so many others is a joyful part of my 1960's era childhood.  In 2014 its fun to look back into the world now long gone.  Sometimes when I listen to these songs like These Boots Are Made For Walkin' I remember listening to the car radio, the memory is sometimes so vivid can almost smell the Ford Fairlane 500 that was our family car.	1
When Frank Sinatra have kids, they all follow in his footsteps and make it in the entertainment business.  Nancy Sinatra is talented in her singing style of telling a story of  what is going to happen.  The song have great melody and lyrics!	1
Four stars because it is 60s ballad music. Though this is an iconic classic and has much more rock and roll sounds than many of her other songs, it still is a Sinatra ballad. A must have for any Sinatra collection.	1
Love the music great beat. Sometimes I Sing along. I would recommend this to anyone and I hope they like it like I do	1
This song never ever ever gets old.  One of the best old songs to listen to even now in 2013.	1
. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great	1
This is one of the songs that I like the most of Nancy Sinatra; quality never desapoints doesn't matter how many years ago the song was recorded	1
Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.	1
Classic psychedelic song, by an eventual country artist.  Great song.	1
My dad was feeling nostalgic and wanted me to download this song, who knew country Kenny Rogers sang trippy music	1
Good song.	1
Another of my favorite Kenny Rogers & The First Edition songs.	1
For folks who only know K. Rogers as a "Country" artist...Take a listen to his foray into Psychedelic Rock in the 60's!  Great Stuff!	1
All i have to say is "DUUUUDE"	1
It brings back memories of my youth.  I'm 59 years old.  Rogers had quite a range back then.  Who knew that he would become such a huge country star.	1
A lot of people don't realize before Kenny Rogers went country he was one of the 60's Hippy movement. This is a really great album and the song is a favorite of all those that dropped out and tuned in.	1
to believe that this song was done by Kenny Rogers about a bad trip that he and the First Edition had. At least that is what he said in a Playboy interview shortly after they did this song but it still is a Great song from a bygone era.	1
I grew up listening to these guys, not realizing back then what a great set of vocals the Kenny Rogers had. A great song and a timeless classic!!	1
Iris DeMent has a really great voice, she does a very haunting rendition of Leaning On The Everlasting Arms	1
This song made the movie, True Grit.  I hope the audience truly gave this great hymn some thought.  The everlasting arms of God are always there is reach us and take us to a secure place with Christ.	1
i love this, i was really affected on how they used this in the theme music for true grit, a story about a girl who is brave and lives by leaning on the Everlasting Arms even in danger....	1
was experimenting with music downloads to my kindle, don't plan to download too many songs there, did a few old favorites	1
They showed me	1
Great song from 1968 by the Turtles. This has a popular hit on the radio and it holds up well after all these years.	1
Great American 60's teen sound!	1
downloaded to my kindle, sounds ok on the kindle, but prefer it on my MP3 to take with me ..	1
Loved this song first time I heard it decades ago and still love it. 5 stars from me, but since music tastes are so subjective, make sure you listen to the audio clip before you buy it.	1
It's the music and artist I wanted... so of course it's a good review.	1
The best as advertised.	1
Legendary song.	1
Good tunes, did I mention I dislike writing reviews ??	1
awesome	1
This song in some cities was banned by the right wing Nazi's in the 60's	1
Everybody's favorite!!	1
I had to include this in a CD I made as a 60's woman.	1
I had to download this song. It brings back so many memories	1
oldie goodie very good	1
Great song, many memories, it's a classic!  Just love the tune, and I realized I should opt to buy it, hot wait to chance hearing it again, on the oldies station!	1
I love this song and use it as a ring tone for someone named...You got it, Louie.  The beginning of the song fits perfectly where it needs to.	1
I've always loved this song since i was a kid.  It's timeless.  Play it for your honey, or sing it to her!	1
I don't even bother to listen to anyone else do this song. It will forever be etched into happy memories of my younger days.  Yes, the lyrics are simple and repetitive and the music, well, kinda silly, but I love the sentiment and the joy it brings.	1
I loved this back in the 60's,and still love in today."I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life." Can it be any clearer or dearer?? No. It can't. So put the top down,hook up your iPod,set it to this song,and you and your honey sing away like the kids you used to be,and still are. Thankfully.	1
Enjoyable	1
The most beautiful love song I've ever heard. Pleasant and easy to listen to. I've added it to several play lists.	1
Excellent	1
It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive.	1
love this song	1
xlint	1
Good song. Video is really good. Cute	1
Heard this song on the Michael Berry Radio Show, and had to buy it! It's kinda a redneck love song.	1
Flo and Eddie may have had a dark side when the played with Zappa, but this ain't it. This is a classic song remastered to sound good in the digital age.	1
Easy to purchase and download with Amazon software.	1
This is a definitive '60s song with one of the more memorable vocal chorus/harmonies from that era. A great song with that  classic '60s sound and feel :)	1
This song brings back great memories of my younger days when making a public phone call only cost a dime.	1
I really like this song a lot.  It's got just the right blend of a catchy tune with good music.  Like this one a lot!  And there's a hilarious video with this piece on YouTube.	1
...sing along...	1
This is a great song.  The lyrics are super, and the tune is one of those that is going to stay in your mind for a while.  If you want to feel happy and carefree, this is a song that will probably work in that wonderful way for you.  It's a beautiful song with great vocal, great lyrics, and a wonderfully happy tune.	1
Good song.	1
love it	1
Brought back memories. Loved it.	1
Way back when..nice..	1
awesome. Love it.	1
A great 60's teen love song! Well done, with good sound production. Great band.	1
People who work are expected to take part in the kind of mechanism without magic that avoids anything that is going on in this song. As personalities in a fog, we always sense an iceberg approaching at ramming speed. The key for me is she thinks crossing her legs is funny. This song works with a man and a woman singing about each other. The combination is a big door prize. There are ups and downs:  He ain't been laid in a month of Sundays. I caught him once and he was sniffing my undies.  Intellectual involution is only aroused when magic makes whatever comes next far more interesting than what we have observed so far. The secrets that work for circus stunts, religion, philosophy, and the usual cosmic pogo stick ups keep our scrambled eggs all runny.	1
Great music A+++	1
I purchased this and many other love songs from Amazon for a romantic mix CD I made for my husband.	1
Great Song, what can I say... I needed that song for a party and it was easy to get, just downloaded it.	1
It was played at my Sister Wedding and at mine. It is one of the best songs that the Turtles did.	1
I grew up in the 60's & 70's so this is the kind of music I enjoy.  Good Memories here	1
Sounds great.  A classic tune and aside from choosing "how is the weather" as the rhyme for "so happy together" a great song.	1
This song takes me back to my listening youth. They are great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.	1
Grew up listening to my Dad sing this song to my Mom. Always makes me smile. It's a sweet, upbeat song you can dance to.	1
Just as good as when I listened to the song in the 60's. If you are from the 60's, you will love this song.	1
It is really nice to hear a song that you can sing along with.  A song that has words that make since.  A song that isn't vulgar.  If you like that kind of music, this is for you.	1
Amazing!  Absolutely amazing...they nailed it.  Worth every penny (although I'm not suggesting in ANY way that any of the companies that sell music online should start charging more)!!	1
I like a lot of the songs the Turtles did back then but this one is border line bubble gum. Not that it's bad, it isn't. Actually a good tune.	1
I grew up with Turtles music, I never tired of it, I will always enjoy their music, every song. Great!	1
Another Master of entertainment we shall never ever forget. Inspiring and delightful. Makes you smile every time you hear him and ashamed of how you concern yourself with your own meager problems when you remember how he overcame so much at that time.	1
Once again, I heard this song in the film "Ray" and remembered my parents playing it at home. 2 thumbs up!	1
Great oldie classic that is sure to remind you of when you were young(er)!  This is the shorter version of his recording.  I recommend it.	1
I agree with James - the sound quality is not up to par, though a great song. However, the master tape was found at a NJ flea-mart and stored in a basement, so it's understandable about the sound quality. The original 45 or album will sound better.	1
Rock, Funk maybe? If you're +/- 40-years old, and don't recognize the title, you'll recognize the melody.	1
I love this song	1
This immediately went intro my favorites collection and will get many plays! Not a big follower of the rest of their stuff.	1
This was one of those unexpected songs from the 70's, from a band that we didn't know much about.  They had a great style which comes through very clearly in this song.  It's great to find songs like this to listen to again.	1
Great Song, helps to worship you into praise and worship	1
Terrible it won't play on my divice	-1
Funny thing is... I fell in love with this song courtesy of Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad By Myself movie. Yip. This is definitely a pick me up song.	1
My cousin was singing this song so I had to get plus I heard this song on "I could do bad all by myself" but I wish the sound track was out but I love this song.	1
Who doesn't know this song? If you are a rocker and you haven't heard it, you need to get more education. MP were one of the forerunners and should be in every collection	1
This is an updated version of the song that defined Mason Proffit in the early 1970s. It is still musically beautiful, and the changed lyrics reflect less of the conflict between the counter-culture and the "straight" world, but rather, somewhat more universal concepts of justice and truth (and at what price they can be achieved).	1
Mr. Desmond's voice was just so unusual and so unforgettable.  This was just a great song, no matter what kind of music you like.	1
combo of Reggae with a bit of hip hop - makes you happy to listen to it;  course its not a new song but there are so many that remain current and classic and this is one	1
The great thing about the internet is that it allows me to rediscover songs from my past.  I never knew who sang this song until I found it on You Tube.	1
Christmas jeer -- I mean cheer -- is all the rage!  I figured I would do my part for the retail industry and their obsession for Christmas in July and do a review on this tune appropriately -- in July. This sketch ranks up their with "A Christmas Story" and Ralphie along with his Red Rider BB gun with the Compass in the Stock/Stalk (who knows???) as being American classics.  This song is an undying testimony to America's obsessive nature with parody and an unrelenting need to kick back and say "to hell with being up-tight" and with good reason - stress is the killer (Fantasia and a white bat or something, anyway...) and life is not all that serious as it is irony based. It doesn't come as a surprise as to why the fine line between becoming productive or postal rests somewhere in letting go for a moment. Unfortunately, I know these things.  Enjoy!	1
"Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer" is Dr. Emo's (yes, he really is a doctor) signature hit, that has gone down in history as becoming one of the most ludicrous modern X-Mas songs in recent history. The reason why I listen to this song almost everyday during Christmastime is because it's so funny and over-the-top. It's really a very tragic song (at least the lyrics are) but it's sung to sound funny and even rather screwballish. I remember there was a music-video made for it that VH1 used to show during Christmastime. My favorite part of the song is when Dr. Elmo asks deadpan: should we open up her gifts or send them back? It can't get more theatrical than that	1
for a children's song, a little dark	1
It's a classic.	1
Always like that song at Christmas. It puts so much fun in this time of year. You just sit and laugh all through the song.	1
Classic	1
great oldie	1
Came on time and as expected. Love this song during Christmas! Worked great.	1
fun song	1
Love the music. Thanks.	1
I was missing the old christmas carrols I grew up on.  These brought back so many delightful childhood memories for me.  I was lucky to find them by the original recording artists	1
I played this song on Piano for a Christmas concert one year in High School and when I heard it on the radio one day it brought back memories.  My 6 year old son loves it and wants it played over and over. He thinks its hilarious!	1
Awesome. Loved it. What would Christmas be without this hilarious song??? I always catch myself singing it starting in early November.	1
Very nice job on this song ! Love the horn lines !	1
Great song, don't listen to when going through a breakup could induce temporary drinking...lol. I would recommend a listen though.	1
I had never heard of this singer prior to seeing this free MP3.  I am a fan of blues-style music so the preview sounded good to me and I am glad I downloaded it.  It features some nice guitar playing and singing, but the lyrics are rather simple.  I admit I like the kind of lyrics that break your heart (probably why I like the blues so much) and this isn't telling that kind of a story - the lyrics are a little too simple for that, but it does have a very nice sound with nice guitar riffs.	1
Having served in the Marines I've heard this done by bands all over the country and world.  This was free on Veterans day, so I grabbed it.	1
great	1

Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1
I was looking for the actual version of this song that was used in the movie, HOP.  I have nothing against this version...it's just not that version.  If it was, the rating would be higher.	-1
family member downloaded for their mp3	-1
Like it	-1
The people who bought this song must've had poopy inside their ears. This song epitomizes early 80's FM cheese. Don't buy it! it'll make yer ears bleed. it's so bad they don't even play it in elevators anymore!	-1
i like george nut didn't order this one	-1
I'm sure everyone was curious to hear this album with "Ordinary World."  This song debuted in the late 90's.  Beforehand, all their stuff was from the 80's.  "...ours is just a little trouble at all..." I'm sure is a fav lyric by most of their fans. It's not your traditional slow song.  You will also like "Come Undone."  I also have the trance version of "Ordinary  World."	-1
I wanted the one sang by the female hippy.  This is not it, but my fault for not reading more closely.	-1
everytime I play it, it cuts off the end...Not sure, was that how it was recorded? or did my download mess up?	-1
I remember when the album with this tune dropped.  I recall this tune did well on the Billboards.  It's not a slow song but it does go pretty slow, making it a well put together tune.	-1
i didn't purchase this	-1
never ordered it	-1
If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since "Hypocrisy". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own "Bells and Whistles" to stand out from the rest. So on to "Stabbing the Drama" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of "Stabbing the Drama" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.	-1
I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity ("Character" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.  After all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, "Soundtrack to Your Escape" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.  The main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to "Weapon of Vanity" and "Nerve" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.	-1
Ok song, but too much nonsinging during the song. Not very danceable.	-1
this was a purchase for my boyfriend so i can't really say but its ok to hear it ever once and a while	-1
Buy instead the version offered here on the album "In the Heat of the Night" or "Best Shots".  They sound much closer to what early '80s rugrats like me grew up on! :)	-1
There is Native American chanting present in this piece.  The instrumentals give it a bombastic aura while listening to this track.  I always thought the title of it important because the narrator repeats "Your return to innocence."	-1
This version is not what you would expect.  I am sorry I purchased it.  Stick with the Verge.  If you order this item, get a refund.	-1
How can I review this when it didn't download? I was told to call here and there-now THAT'S too much trouble. I have learned to NEVER download a single song for my MP3 player again from Amazon or iTunes.	-1
I will no longer purchase downloadable music from Amazon or its associated vendors. Even on a brand spanking new computer they won't download, or on the opposite end, download 3 or 5 times. If I can't count on getting what I want, what's the use in trying to purchase it here?	-1
Never cared so much for the original, but, Billy Idol's late eighties remake is about as pleasant as smelling a wet fart. How did this song become so popular?? hmm...Leave it to these robotic, zombie like, program directors/puppets working for the large radio- owning conglomerates. anyway, enough of my ranting, this song is horrible and has dated horribly.	-1
Some how ended up paying for 2 downloads...	-1
Waste of money, up loaded the song to an MP3 player, when played can hardly hear the song. Paid for the song and had to delete from MP3....	-1
Not my type of music. Downloaded by mistake	-1
i didn't purchase this	-1
I would not even download it for free.  This is another example of why "country" music is so horrible today.  It is no longer "country" music, it is just pop with slide guitars.  Johny Cash is rolling over in his grave, Willie Nelson is smoking more and more to drown out this junk, and Hank Williams is yodeling louder and louder to not have to hear this.	-1
Refused to download but they took my $$ anyhow.	-1
The last 1:20 of the song is cut off. This is one of my favorite songs from 2001 and I cannot get a clean copy of it from my favorite resource. This is terrible shame, I should have known something was wrong when I couldn't find the Duets soundtrack.	-1
Was looking for the version from Belly soundtrack...not it, but my mom likes it.	-1
not the version I thought it was I can understand all the lyrics in this version but way to slow	-1
never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-  had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!  close to $100 worth of music never received!!	-1
My memories were fonder than reality.  After listnening to it for 2 times I was already sick of it again and annoyed with the repetitiveness.	-1
this is overproduced syrupy schmaltz. hey, i dig a ballad here and there but this is too much schmaltzy cheesecake for me!	-1
Bad download!!!	-1
Vanilla Ice came to the forefront of rap with a great song. Too bad he didn't stay there with later offerings not up to par with this.	-1
I bought this track because every minute I'd hear it in the 80's.  There's that ever present whimsical sound, I don't know what instrument produces that particular sound.  This tune commands finding out the name of the group, OMD!	-1
Yeah, daddy's girls could sing but the late eighties/early nineties sterile overproduction mars the track significantly. Although they had a hit with it, it hasn't aged well, like a lot of the music from that era (you know the era, back when people walked around looking like arsenio hall or will smith in the fresh prince) They migth've really produced a timeless track if Brian Wilson had produced. Never got the lyrics for the song either. Something about a change and breakin free from the change.	-1
I like His Guitar Playing&His Versatility.but the songs themselves are pretty much there&Vocally He reminds me of Brian Mcknight,Babyface,etc.. with the Acoustic Guitar. Been there down that&better in most instances. He is Talented but I don't hear a Knock out song as much as I Hear tight Music.when He gets Words&Music as One then He will escape being labeled in a box with others. He is a Talented Cat though&the Future Looks Promising but a Song like "Crazy" is cool for now but with Artistic Growth he pass that by Leaps&Bounds over time.	-1

I have no idea, I don't know what it is	-1
Did not purchase this book either or whatever it is - did not purchase this one.  Cannot rate it.  Sorry.	-1
Do NOT remember ordering this, at all.  Don't even know where it may be at this time.  But if I DID order, I must've liked it at the time.	-1
Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!	-1
i did not buy this so not sure why i'm asked to rate it.. Can someone explain why i have to rate it as a purchase I made?	-1
This is a song, I listened to it, and it played, I don't rate music, it is a matter of taste.	-1
I had to do several clicks just to figure out what this was, I was informed by the site that I had downloaded this way back in 2009, it cost me 0.00. Good thing, too, because I don't like it. I still have no idea how it got in my order file, but I do believe it is a horrible mistake by the site. It sucks. That's the best I can say about it.	-1
It's free, hey what can you say. Unfortunately my music doesn't fall under the free category.	-1
every time i try to buy a new mp3 i always get this song forced on me by amazon	-1

Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.	-1
AC/DC fans will love to rock out with the Masters of Rock. The recordings are great, the hits keep coming song after song.	-1
I have not bought this cd but just from the sample songs i can tell they are not the original recordings. I'm from Philly i remember her 1st song Girls have feelings too (1964) followed by Are you ready her number #1 smash hit later on Sad sad girl etc....... These songs on this anthology c.d. have been rearranged and they SUCK!   The  original songs could have been remastered through digital technology to enhance the vocal quality  (the back up crew especially the guys  singers were thorwing down accapella).  These remasterd back up singers are young inexperiend singers  who just ain't kicking it.  Amazon does offer  the  original  "Are you ready Barbara Mason" colletion  .....but it's going for $199.00 and no m3p or ipod downlads are  availible	-1
an ok album.....has a few tunes on it that were popular in my day so I purchased it.  Great songs for reunions.	-1
This is terrible. Anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever. Its so overplayed & way overrated.	-1

there is no need to listen to music because it sucks and not wrth listening to. no music is better	-1
i rememba back in da nineties when "i am just a girl" from No Doubt appeared on the airwaves. cool song. The Sweet Escape just stinks. I remember when college radio stations were playing No Dout. These days, any respectable college radio station would never play this turd nugget	-1
don't like this one with the horns playing	-1
You cannot get the songs you purchase. What a rip off. There is no way to download them. That is the second time Amazon rips me off and the last.	-1
I like their earlier music, but this sucks! I couldn't wait for it to end. I would not recommend this to anyone.	-1
This was as bad as Run Around. I will not get any of their other music. In the beginning they were great. I don't know what happened.	-1
this sucked back in 1984 and it does now I will always hate this song.	-1
i didn't purchase this	-1

I bought this to compare to Fergie's "London Bridge". According to my husband, this song has been around for ever (I just never heard it--I must have been living under a rock). I like gwen stefani, I find that she has an interesting vocal range that a lot of her contemporaries do not (ie Fergie, Pink). She has a distinct voice and I really like that. But this song is so high school football that it makes me shudder.	-1
I like to hear "Rick Janes bitch!"	-1
Songs like this should be played on pop stations not on a rock station ! Way to go guys , your ruining metal , nice going and way overplayed.	-1

Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
music was the worst thing  that was ever invented and it has no need to be listened to at all.	-1
this was not the song i was looking for but it was not a total bad pick its ok i guess i should have a sample before i brought it	-1
"I got this Album when it first came out because I dug "Say You Do"&."Young Love"this Album though on a whole had some moments&interestingly has a More Grown Up vibe that alot of the stale stuff She has done in recent Years IMHO.the Sound&Production was good for the time period. I like this Album better than Her "Dream Street" AlbumThe "All 4 U" Album. Janet wasn't too bad on Here Vocally it was passable.....	-1
That is exactally what every album by this no talent hack sounds like but I Sure iron mike could write better lyrics.	-1
When 50 First came on the scene, I was a little skeptic of what he was all about. I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didn't think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened? NO, but I am more then 99.9% sure that this is how it went down. Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD, then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless.	-1
This whole "gangsta rap" craze is a major disgrace. As much as I hate Eminem, at least his lyrics sometimes mean something. 50's don't mean nothin'. Okay, you're gangsta, we understand, we've had this whole "I'm a Gangsta" thing shoved down our throats for the past decade, and frankly, it's CRAP. Gangsta rap is worthless - I wouldn't touch it.	-1
No Wonder 2 Quarter has been shot nine times.  He sucks.  Period.  He can (c)rap all he wants about being in the club and money.  Its all hype, soon he'll be just as relevant as M.C. Hammer and doing commercials for insurance.  His plans are clearly obvious, look at the title!  Get Rich or Die Tryin', thus meaning, trying all the easy shots at getting fame and money.  Act tough, look tough, become the biggest hype, rap idiotically cause its something that they'll play at the clubs or raves because everybody will like it cause they are tripped out on PCP or something, and then they'll start using 50 Cent as a code word for drugs, because in time that's all anybody will remember him or at least the slogan for.  No body will care about the "music", only about this cool little code word that will pop up in time.  I may be wrong, but don't be surprised if it comes true.....or maybe its already in affect right now.... *gasps*  You got to hand it to 2 Quarter, his wildest dreams came true.  He got rich at the expense of the masses.  His reign of annoyance is almost at its end as apparently, his new CD flat out sucks even more.  Well, now its time of his career to die.  Don't be surprised if he puts out a CD titled "Stay Rich or Die Tryin'", when he runs out of ideas to avoid doing commercials with M.C. Hammer by his side.  P.S. Check out my review for the massacre as well.  If you liked this, then you'll enjoy that too.	-1
Alright Ill admit 50 cent can rap; But he's with Eminem! If 50 choose to go a different route then sign with a white boy who is more stale then a box of crackers open for a week. This guy couldn't get a contract or was it about the money? Em cant think of anything so he acts all cool and gobbles up all this bad ass talent, tames them, then the public eats them up and Em makes money off black men. When will someone actully realize what im saying?	-1
Total garbage.  I've never heard such trash.	-1
The 2004 Grammy's voters proved what I have always thought....50 Cents is not talented!! For the first time (in a long time), the Grammy voters did the right by not giving an imposter an award. This cd sold hot, but it is not respected. 50 Cents even lost "Best New Artist" and had the nerve to get on stage to "protest". He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's "Get Rich Or Die Tryin" which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even "gangsta". Its corporate mindless rap, meant only to make money. I hope 50 realizes that his time is almost up.	-1
His rapping is so corny! Don't believe the hype on 50.. get a good album from Biggy instead.	-1
ok i like every kind of music but come on 50 cent cd is only worth 50 cent may i say anymore will not cuz this cd really sucks its so stupid theres only 1 good song in that song ''in da club '' sucks big time plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz don't buy this cd ant worth the money	-1
This cd is not even worth 50 cents because its just like every other trendy and commercial garbage out today. The beats are too simple and the lyrics are full of the same old gangster nonsense. This guy is so over rated and talentless that I cant even begin to descibe. Many of the mindless mtv sheep will be buying this,but if your original and like good music you will skip this trash. DO NOT BUY THIS CD.	-1
People are TRYING to make 50 Cents to be the next 2Pac or Biggie. But in my opinion, he can only be compared to JaRule. People are in love with the fact that he has been shot # of times, but if people really pay attention to the music....they will realize that his music is nothing to crow about. There are only 4 songs that sound decent and they are:  PIMP  Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)  In Da Club  21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg) That's it. But its not enough to make you buy the entire cd. As I stated before, got change?	-1
it seems like every day has been "shorties" birthday ever since the song "in da club" was released. i hate 50 cent. i hate rap music. People these days will like anything that is on the joke now known as MTV. i could go on mtv with a bandana on my head and an apple in my hand and rap about the food chain, and my albums would sell millions of copies. do not by this garbage.	-1
Honestly, I like 50 Cent as a rapper; he has a certain honesty to him that is lacking in most rappers today. When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects.	-1
Another generic illiterate rapper lisping over headache-inducing "beeeeeeeeetz", for the brainless, trendy, superficial teenagers nationwide. Whoopee. When will people realize this by NO means even remotely qualifies for music? When will people stop buying this and spew like it and pick up albums that actually take time, talent, and effort? To quote the Offspring, "I have a feeling it'll be a long time". Hit me with the Not Helpful vote!	-1
Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwn. What's the difference between this guy, Ja Rule and Puffy? Well, this guy has been shot more times, that's about it. In terms of what you get when you press play, they are xerox copies of each other. Hey, let's go ahead and do a couple of tribute albums to this guy!! He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr. J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing. If these are the idols of today's youth, we are doomed. People who think this is music have no idea whatsoever about what music is. None at all. Zero. Nada. Actually, less than zero. But, ignorance is bliss.  Hitting the "no" icon beneath this review because you are 50 fan and you THINK I am wrong is a stamp of approval - admitting that everything I have said are absolute truths. Go ahead, show us your ignorance. Those who vote in favor are rare glimmers of hope left in this world of musical ignorance. The facts speak for themselves, but only to those who have at least a basic level of musical knowledge. Now, excuse me. I have to get back to my Death Metal, Jazz, Blues, Funk, and Afro-Cuban CD's...REAL MUSIC.	-1
Unfortunately, I never received my download of this song though i was charged for it. I was disappointed to say the least about the situation.  I am not sure why this occurs	-1
This song sucks....so does Fergie.  Just another over produced, manufactured, no-talent, annoying auto-tuned, polished turd.  That;s it.	-1
thought I liked it but it gets old quickly. oh, this is an old song. Dah. I have it on my oldies list.	-1
This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.  All sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.  Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself. Like drugs, JUST SAY NO!	-1
Need to say Stevie Wonder is wonderful however there is talking at the end of the product.  It just randomly bleeds over the music.  Someone needs to review this version and correct it.	-1
It is a great song but I do not remember the extra sound effect features that are in the biginning of the song and through out the song.  I tried to order from another album, but had the same effects.  Not like the original I remember.	-1
The song had noises that were not in the original hit for Stevie Wonder.  I tried ordering from another album - same results.  Not good	-1
Yeah, there's some crying and whining noises, so I had to edit them out so that I could use the song. But overall, it worked for what I needed it for, and the song is nice.	-1
Ok	-1
Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.	-1
Do not read any other review I,am by many terms the nicest reviewer on items here on Amazon,But this is by far the worst cd I have ever ordered and demanded my money back from Amazon,which they gave me and hope they will remove this seller from there site. This is defiately a bootleg,you only have to google there record company and duh no such company. Save your money and buy something else on Amazon. Its companies like this that give wonderful sites like Amazon a bad name.	-1
These guys stink, just like any so called "punk" rock today. Don't buy this.	-1
.....yeah right!....well,you want a review for this album........ok........this is the worst band in the world..is music for 5 years old brats who think they're cool listening to whining sorry lyrics and boring rappings......if you're into punk listen to real punk bands........what about some wizo.....they are young neither.......or bad religion...they're gods.........don't be a sucka my friend and if you bought this album gave it to your little cousins,......but I don't think they're dumb enough to take it.........	-1
If you have had enough of corporate punk acts like Green Day and Blink 182, then Sum 41 is sure to tick you off even more.  If all the nu-metal garbage around now wasn't making me mad allready, this new corporate punk is ticking me off even more.  The same old three cord progression on every song, stupid uninspired lyrics, and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package.  And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they're on MTV, well kids, this ain't real punk.  Real punk is Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Black Flag, and dare I say it, even NoFX.  Then again, there are kids scratching their heads wondering "who are they, they're not on MTV, they're no good".  But what do I know?, I'm just some guy who listens to the above bands and other stuff outside the mainstream, so my opinion doesn't matter at all.  Now go listen to your Linkin Park CD.	-1
For the love of god WAKE UP AND SMELL THE AIR YOU SPOILED BRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is exactly what's wrong with America today. Cheap music that I could surpass in artistic and equality in twenty minutes and dumb, childish lyrics are a testament to the continuing decline of American intelligence today. This isn't punk or metal at all. This is a horrible travesty to both genres. Metal is ultraheavy guitar riffs with extremenly loud melody and pounding drums. Punk is real rebelism against trends in society. Sum 41 aren't that either. They are nothing but a bunch if talentless clowns who are cashing in on TRL to make a buck [...]. Don't call me an old fogie who listens to Frank Sinatra or Mozart because I am 19 years old but I have stuck with the moral values that garbage like this encourages youth to dismiss. I feel ashamed that people in my age group are more worried about being cool by cussing that than being intelligent. Well I hope this will change in the next five years and laugh at bands like Sum 41, Limp Bizkit, and all those dumb poser metal groups.	-1
Overplayed and overrated song by Aerosmith. To me their last great one was the Permanent Vacation album. Pump, the album this came from was so-so and this song has just been played to death and it's not that good.	-1

"A Single Man" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.  "Return to Paradise" might just be; what with those beautiful falsetto vocals, "Georgia" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up "Tumbleweed Connection". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs "Madness", "Reverie" and "Song for Guy", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; "Madness" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; "Reverie" is brief but effective, and "Song for Guy" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.  The other songs aren't bad. "I don't care" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. "Part-time love" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1/4 or 2.25	-1
I was a little girl when LL was at the top of his game, and yes I had a crush on him.  Can you believe this guy still made hits when I got to high school?  I realize whenever I see this music video, it makes me feel good, and so does this song.  Therefore, I will say it takes me back to the old days and good memories.  The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  "Merry-go-round,"  "Around" the way.."  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.  Flirting with ladies while they do everyday things like sucking on a "blow pop."  I bought that brand lollipop all the time where I went to elementary and junior high school in Crown Heights.  The rhythm and harmonies in this song are soft, and not too hard.	-1
Disgusting song!	-1
I do not care for live	-1

I can't figure out why this song was so popular in the first place? Only thing I can tell you is stay away from this one. worst song in the 90's period.	-1

this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.	-1
I bought this CD for the one song "Blurry", the only way to describe the meaning behind it is to "Listen" and hopefully get the meaning.	-1

When you call Enterprise now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight! i have nothing against Rusted Root but, this is a prime example of how overplaying a song can totally ruin it for you! I guess the guys in Rusted Root had to wedge their bets and use the money they're making off of this for their kids' college funds. Who can blame em?	-1
Dont get me wrong its hard to get or hear a bad performance of Soundgarden, but I was displeased with this live version. But I guess bands cant be perfect all the time. Still love Soundgarden though.	-1
this is actually a horrible remake of a much better song by them called Walking In The Sun	-1

I think CeCe Peniston's material represents the 90's decade well.  I like that black turtle neck outfit she wears in "Finally."  I guess "Keep on Walking" is funky as far as rhythm, instruments, and beats go, culminating into a well put together song from the 90's.  "I thought that what we had would never end.."  is obviously a song about a romantic relationship.  Beyonce's "De Ja Vu" and Teena Marie's "Square Biz" are similar to this song's style.	-1
I downloaded this one but to tell you the truth most of the times I just fastforward past this one...I really have to be in a certain mood to sit and listen to this one.	-1
If you ever go to a country music bar, you'll probably hear this song, a real classic!  Love this song!	-1
Easy to use no mus no fuss. I would recommend this product to anyone. A great value for the money.	-1
i don't listen to music at all. i rather be in a quiet room than listen to music at all.	-1
It is a really anointing repetitive song that says the same thing over and over again  the beat is terrible	-1
Johnny Gill is One of the Best Vocalists I've heard over the past 20 plus Years but alot of the time the Words&Music don't match His overall presentation. I dig the cut with Him&Roger Troutman&also R.Kelly's "Someone to Love".but the up-tempo cuts don't move me at all.this Album though isn't balanced out with much else that matches some of the better material&this set suffers from that.but if Johnny Gill ever got the right Stuff to work with He would Be scary.	-1
After the multiplatinum success of "Acoustic Soul", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup "Voyage To India". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on "Voyage" as this album is severely so-so. First off the production is weaker than on "Acoustic" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either. Tired duds like "Little Things" and the predictably titled "God Is Love" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for "deep" when they come off like Hallmark card messages. Bland "folk"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead "Voyage" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. "Good Man" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record. Fortunately, "Voyage" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. "The Truth" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. "Headed In The Right Direction" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired "love yourself" retreads.  Look, "Voyage To India" makes India to be more of a "Black-girl" version of bland, "folk" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being "bootylicious" or partying or "her man" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on "Voyage" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not "deep". India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.	-1
I admired them so much when they debuted.  Courtney Love is the frontwoman.  It's pretty fast for grunge, yet hard.  My favorite parts are when the bass completely stops and she sings.  Ultimately, I think she's really cool.	-1
i don't listen to music because music sucks and i don't like it. music doent appeal to me at all	-1
I was disappointed in the music.  I had never heard some the songs on the album and most of these weren't very good.  I only recognized 5 of the songs.	-1
I am a Lucinda Williams fan and have been for a long time, but this CD is not her best.  Many of the songs sound the same to me -- sad, slow, boring.  Buy it if you're a long time fan and want to follow her career, otherwise I'd skip it.	-1
This would have been a GREAT song if this idiot didn't overstep the bounds of decency and have the unmitigated GALL to mention the name of Jesus in this song in such a horrible manner. This was completely unnecessary and completely ruins what would otherwise be a really hot song. Makes you wonder why someone talented enough to record this can be so callus and stupid as to WAY overstep the bounds of decency.	-1
I have analyzed the Rush track "Subdivisions" with digital audio workstation software and have determined that this version has been altered from its original sound.  Hold on to your original "Signals" CD for the best sound!	-1
2 1/2  It was nice to see SY expanded their limitedly frenzied vocabulary a little further with some experimenting, but the sum still equals a mighty uneven album with very few songs that will end up standing the test of time.	-1
This was a replacement CD and made the same error at the same time.  This time asking for a refund. Bad stack of CDs was made.	-1
My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies. The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects. After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent. Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.	-1
I love the band and the music so much that I had to download this song. However, like so many times in the past, Amazon can't deliver good/quality mp3's to me. Half (about 20) of the mp3's I've downloaded from Amazon have audio artifacts/defects and glitches. I report them to Amazon and they refund money to me and say they will fix the problem. Weeks later I'll attempt to download the song again and it will still be defective. I've grown tired of this and have decided to avoid Amazon mp3's all together and will take my business to Itunes instead. Also, I thought it might be my system, but it hasn't failed with any other mp3 provider or download service - plus I recently installed a new, state of the art router. FIX YOUR PROBLEMS AMAZON!	-1
This is the song from the movie FEAR with Reese Witherspoon in case you were looking it up for that reason.	-1
Evil satanic garbage.	-1
Ever wonder what Sting is singing about at the end of the song? ("Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo") The spanish translation of the word "Piojo" is  " flea" or may refer to  a pain, a bothersome person. So, every little thing she did may have been magic but A. Either this chick had fleas in her hair or B: she may have been considered a bothersome person...or C: Maybe this wasn't about a girl at all and Sting wrote it for his Cocker Spaniel. So the story behind the song is even more intruiging than the song itself, no thanks to the stereotypical FM playlists put together by the unimaginitive program directors at the 'so-called' classic rock stations.	-1
I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?  To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.  After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.  On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.  A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):  I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.  If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as "You're just jealous!" or "I'd like to see you do better!" or "How is it in your parents' basement?" or "You must jerk off to your computer!" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:  "Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!"  FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!  If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me "pretentious" or "music snob" or "self-righteous" or "self-absorbed," you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "simple," (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  "Devil's Night Out" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones "Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols" by The Sex Pistols "The Essential Heart" by Heart "Highway To Hell" by AC/DC "Meat Is Murder" by The Smiths "The Strange Case Of..." by Halestorm "Greatest Hits" by Tom Petty "Complete Greatest Hits" by The Cars "Ugly" by Life of Agony "Remain In Light" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as "Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!" or "You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)	-1
disappointed. Waste of my money as I only like it the way Sixpence does it.  Why so many versions of the same song?	-1
this is not original recording. very disapointed. should tell you that before you buy the song, not happy at all	-1
This song was an anthem to all them cool ass white chicks in the early 2000s (in fact, it was played in the Wayans Brothers classic movie White Chicks. I originally gave it one star but bumped it up to two for comedic value. I picture a bunch of really white chicks snap dancing Carlton Banks style to this tune!	-1
What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?  She's all over the place.  I think everyone is kinda over it.  She has a great career - nothing to be dissapointed with.  It's just time to retire.  For example - I dind't even know this was released.  Never heard anything about it.  It was never promoted - probably because there's nothing to promote.	-1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
this Club Nouveau/Timex Social Club greatest hits on Thump records is all rerecorded vocals by a different front man. Sounds awful. AVOID.	-1
Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average.  "I'll Make Love to You" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions "On Bended Knee."  Only on "Water Runs Dry" do things get a bit interesting.  It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality?  Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more.  Is that supposed to be progress?	-1
It was ok.	-1
I thought it couldn't get any worse when I heard some of Lil Waynes stuff, but then I listened to Soulja Boy. My god what garbage. Can you imagine if the collaborated? Horrible horrible song.	-1
About half of the songs were either remakes or by the wrong artists, one of the songs I wanted the most Sleep walk sucked big time, it just barely resembled the original. Stupid Cupid was by Connie Francis not Wanda Jackson . If you want the original versions forget this album only about half are the originals.	-1
ChaCha question and answer puts it in the  "Pop" category.  Definitely not a lazy tune.  Pretty up and peppy.  Articulated words are present which is excellent.  ...."if I could just crash here tonight?"...cool lyrics.	-1
Wow, talk about zero originality! What do you do when you can't come up with anything original to save your life? Ripoff an old surf instrumental~ what else!	-1

This song is meant for the trash of the world and I'm so sorry I purchased this. It was a dare from a friend; a dumb friend.  If you listen to the lyrics, 'Chris' just repeats the same trite theme over and over again. In his 'acting' debut, he sounded like a high school play. Stop 'reading your lines Chris'.	-1
Too slow, I didn't like it.	-1
This album is horrid.  When we have lyrics like "life can be just like a game boy, full of frustration and joy, pressing A or B make a choice....Game over game over...". Yeah no kidding GAME OVER. That portly written song also has the best opening riff sadly.  Once again the songs are so poorly written is ruins the whole thing and not a decent riff here or there can save this.	-1
Has that garage/grunge band sound.  Just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s I have collected, and forgettable.  Nice cover though.	-1
Love the old traditional Christmas carols!  This one wasn't as good as I was hoping for.  I do enjoy the band, but thought they could have done better.	-1
I am a big Marie fan (since 1976!) but this christmas album is just plain BAD. She scoops the notes all over the place and well, YUK. She's never sounded more like Kathie Lee Gifford than on this CD. I want my $ back because I'll never listen to this again.	-1
I was very disappointed with this release.  The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.  The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie "Wedding Singer". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.  Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.  The Dream really is dead.	-1
Not my style but that's okay.  M-I-L loves Anne Murray.	-1

How I expected this double cd!!! but I should have known that tributes  these days are three a penny and very rarely they seem to convince. It  seems that many famous people were invited to this party and when they came  not really dressed as they should and not really in the mood nobody could  tell them to leave. Such is the cover of Springsteen, almost to make you  weep. A bizarre reggae song by Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt (Did Seeger  write that?) and many etcetera. Not all is lost, Greg Brown, John Gorka and  Anni difranco give some good songs, but even these songs would be  considered fillers in any of their albums. Before you buy this cd try to  listen to it at a friends. I consider it the disappointement of the year.	-1
I got this album last year because I used to like Mary J. Blige in the early 90's when she was at the height of her popularity.  Her albums from the early 90's a lot better than her most recent albums.  The only album by her I somewhat liked from recent years is "No More Drama" and even still it wasn't a perfect album.  Mary's first three albums are her best and her best being "What's The 411?"  For long time Mary J. Blige fans you may be disappointed.  If I were you I would just stick to her earlier albums.	-1
My kid love this song	-1
The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought "Cool...this just might work!" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's "I'm Not In Love." I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the "Big boys don't cry" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the "I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with "Under The Milky Way", "Life In A Northern Town" and "Broken Wings." Oh, sure, "Under...." has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on "....Town" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for "Town", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for "Wing"). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal "Human." Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. "Holding On To Yesterday" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. "Baker Street" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! "Waiting For A Girl Like You" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. "Let's Go Out Tonight" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on "For The One." Much like "Human", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to "Miss You Nights" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! "Blue Rose" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. "Cry" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics ("You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb"), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with "Imagine", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).	-1
I truly did not want to believe that this was one of my beloved favorites, Rick Springfield murdering each and every song on this album, but a person can only go so far on denial. In my case delusion didn't even make it through the first track, and by the time I trudged on through to the end I only got really, really sad.  I didn't know that Rick could suck.  This album is a massacre. It should be taken away, hidden, and hopefully forgotten.	-1
This is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said. The only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80s CD. It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.	-1
i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.. they were not good of line dancing.	-1

when the Bangles first came out in the 80's that had a cool vibe about them.they were if you will a Poor Maid's version of the Go-Go Girls.and over time they never quite shook that tag.the Bangles never wrote songs that took off was the big knock against them then&still.some of the Instrumentation is alright in spots but Vocally not much has changed.	-1
NOTHING LIKE iTunes reliability	-1
I didn't like the explicit version at all, the song didn't have the same smooth flow as the non explicit verion did, seemed kind of herky jerky to me.	-1
Not only did this track have a lot of static but it plays with a drag, in other word its like playing an old-fashioned 45 record and the speed is too slow.	-1
Have you ever thought what would happen if you told your parrot to write a song, that sounded like a love song, but actually had a dark meaning, then told the parrot to sing the song, put it on an album? Neither have I, but that logic is what drives this song. Really folks, this song has all the quality of you're parrot doing. Especially the singing, oh gosh the singing...  Overall, a pathetic effort, from a guy that doesn't deserve to see the light of the music world day.	-1
The four letter words were terrible, ruined the whole song for me. I bought the wrong version.	-1

Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.  Overall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.	-1

I was a cashier on Junior's 4th floor shoes at Macy's Herald Square in Manhattan.  I had mad fun, actually working at my favorite department store.  There was this playlist that played nonstop.  This was one of the tunes on it. Sean Paul is mad fine.  A spanish guy from Jamaica.  Dancehall had come in style since I was a high school student.  One of the names mentioned in the song is "Rebekah," that's me, which is why I love it.  "Rebekah, Joanna, Donna, Annabella, and Jodi."  These are the names of the sexy women he mentions in "Get Busy."  I don't know if "Kana Kana" counts as a name. The beats in "Get Busy" are pretty fast, terribly abrupt, and choppy. There is that syncopated constant short clap beat throughout the song in addition to that daydream um....sound.  He rhymes pretty fast.  Jamaican patwa is quick.  He says, "it's all good girl," making it a feel good song.  Sean Paul is good peoples!	-1
Great song, but after downloading this song I noticed that there was background noise on this particular download.

Stone Sour really surprised me when they did their own version for this song.it just doesn't feel like stone sour,because they are a hard rock band and this is a pop song. Its a decent cover,but wicked game doesn't need to be redone by stone sour. Stone sour isn't good with acoustic songs in my opinion.they should stick to their guns and make good hard rock. I wouldn't waste my money on this single.it really has nothing to offer to fans of stone sour.	-1
This is a song I could kill someone too, it's so annoying, stupid, pathetic and repeats!!!!  This sucks so badly.	-1

I never liked this song. I never understood how the boy was just like the dad. He related to his dad with the same lack of attention his dad had shown him. But he sounded attentive and concerned about his own kids (they had the flu), so to me the boy turned out better that the dad, not just like him. This song is just one big blah.	-1
Yuk...	-1
This mp3 sounds great so my complaint is not about sound quality. However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other.	-1

A few months ago I went to a Tantric concert in Louisville, KY because my friend likes them. A band called Silvertide was opening for them, and let me just say Tantric was pahetic compared to them. The crowd sucked, that's why I hate modern alternative rock bands like this...the fan base is as boring as the music. All the people did was stand and watch. At the beginning of one song the Tantric's singer said "This is for all you headbangers and moshers out there" as if he expected someone to actually make a big movement like that, and I hope he didn't, 'cause if he did, he was disappointed. Simply put: the opening band blow the headliners away. How sad is that?	-1

I like the song. Something changed at the store and as I bought this song, I "continued shopping". I got one of the 3 songs I was charged for. I did not get this song. I'll try again at some point. I bought another song a few days ago, so it seems to me that as long as you buy 1 song at a time there isn't a problem.	-1

I don't see what people see in this album. I couldn't rate it a 3 even. There are about 3 songs toward the end that are worth having. It's a long way from Olias or Change We Must.

Alice was far too lost by this point to make a comeback record, and it shows. Aside from "We Are The Future," there really isn't a decent song here. Since you can get "Future" on the Box Set, you can take a pass on this one.	-1
That this song downloads as a separate from 'The Load Out'. Your promoter don't mind, the union don't mind, the roadies don't mind. The verses are specific for this 'Stay' version and is part of 'The Load Out/Stay' compile. Its one song!	-1
Why were they so many late fifties early sixties covers during this period? And how come these lackluster cover versions charted so high? This cover of an early sixties tune reeks of "I am so coked out that I can't think of anything original to record" Syndrome- alot of artists suffered from this in the late seventies, with the advent of cocaine as the drug of choice. Coke hampers creativity, but , i guess a lot of these Laurel Canyon artists bought the hype peddled by Jann Wenner in his music rag, Rolling Stone, which by this time had become more mainstream. Jackson Browne has written some great songs (These Days comes to mind) but this Stay cover, with it's overtly "white cracker" falsetto by some female singer, is a disgrace! This God-forsaken cover gets played more frequently than any of the better JB songs out there...blame it on the lame-arsed playlists on these "classic rock" format stations out there these days, boy do they suck huevos!	-1
This is one of those "let's all get up and dance, because he's telling us what to do" type songs like The Electric Slide or Cotton-Eyed Joe. It's annoying and stupid but everyone wants to get up and dance to it. It's a gateway song. So I have to appreciate it for that, but otherwise it's absolutely terrible.	-1
When Uncle Kracker decided to go solo after a long association with rap/rocker, Kid Rock, you would have expected some of the same edginess that characterized Rock's music.  Instead, "Follow Me" resulted.  This is a piece of soft-rock swill that belongs as a track on one of those laughable "AM Gold" albums that used to be sold in informercials late at night, instead of on the top of the pop/rock charts.  However, this sappy love song no doubt appealed to fans who are suckers for this type of music.  In addition, I think there was another group of fans who were wary of another Kid Rock-style singer and embraced Uncle Kracker when they realized exactly how soft his music was.  Really not a fan of this song and I change the radio whenever it comes on.	-1
Not at all my type of music, so take my review from that Perspective. I do the occasional DJ party , and needed ( tripe like this to suit the younger crowd. Normally I wouldnt DARE, waste my money on this Juvenile, Pop, Garbage. But There MANY out there that Like it.	-1
Because it is important to help companys know that there product is good,and that the people than will enjoy it and buy it.	-1
My bad I guess but when I ordered this song from Amazon either I didn't read the info correctly or mistook it as the live version that Jackson Browne did with "Stay" as part of the medley. So, if  you're looking for that live cut this ain't it. Otherwise the song is part of one of Browne's best albums.	-1
At the End when he sings well be scheduled to appear 1000 miles away from here, the song stops. But other than that it's ok, Amazon Gave me my money back.	-1
Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice, problem is the lyrical content and the fact he doesn't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys. he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass/Luther Vandross, Johnny Gill  of his Generation, but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range,but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks. I like the R.Kelly Produced "Hush" and a Jaheim vocally brings it, but the material he gets is hurting him and he seems to be headed toward the same path as Dave Holister another strong Voice Soul Brother who never got the right songs to compliment his overall range.	-1
I mean, doesn't Savatage as a band name and members ONLY deserve the credit! Why does it have to be TSO under the spot lights and Savatage left in the dark? Is it fair?  Don't get me wrong but hey whats fair is fair, i mean i know Savatage members are still in TSO. But let's review; 1. Al petrilli left Savatage in the middle of Poets and Madmen album to join Megadeth then Dave Mustaine kicked him out, why take him back Paul O'neil? 2. Zak stevens (Sang only in Beethoven's last night) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help! Come on!  Overall, I say since Savatage members are happy we should be happy that at least they got the attention they deserve even under TSO name.	-1
It's okay if artists want to change their sound sometimes, if they didn't they might get bored. But this album is awful. Notice how she never did pop again?	-1
Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.	-1
poor mis-guided jewel...she had it all. the looks, the voice, the songs, and the money.  i guess she decided she had enough when she put together this crap all album.  the only good song on it is "Run to You"  and a couple others but VERY few.  this cd might be good if she stuck with her original sound. if u wanna check out the real Jewel check out Pieces of You, Spirit, or This Way.  they're better than this cd in sooooo many ways.  but this cd DOES have potential.  if she kept away from the techno and dance sh** than this woulda  been a really good cd probly.  she's still got the writing ability.  but anyways.  hopefully this phase of hers won't last too long.	-1
I am mainly a fan of non-commercial types of music: heavy metal, bluegrass, western, rockabilly, etc. But when I am in the car with my wife I am stuck listening to the dreaded top 40. How a station can be profitable by spinning the 40 newest rancid pieces of excrement I will never know. So it was to my surprise about six years ago when I finally heard somebody different: a unique voice singing intelligent lyrics with acoustic accompanyment. The first thing I thought was how did this get through the commercial radio filter system that strains out quality and lets only contaminated by-product through? The second thing was - who is this? It was Jewel of the Pieces of You era. Fast forward five years. "Intuition" is on the radio. I can understand selling out if you are pushing 40, working temp office jobs for $9.00 an hour, and playing the coffee house circuit every weekend. But if you have made it big doing what you like to do, why do you sell out to the vacuous fads of today's fleeting pop scene? I guess once you get money, all you want is more money and you forget what the ultimate purpose of making music was. What a pity.	-1
so i read the reviews on here, which i rarely trust anyways, and i decided to get the cd.  (even though i HATE intuition) Lyrically, this IS a bit like her previous albums.  They COMPLETELY butchured her voice though, and made most of it a Dance album...that's what REALLY pissed me off about this album.  Jewel was PERFECT the way she was. and she sounds WAY better on her previous albums, and live.  what was ORIGINAL about her was how u could hear her putting feel into her songs with her vocal capacity.  this all sounds the same and no vocal range at all.  PLEASE all you newcomer jewel fans, pick up one of her EARLIER albums and you will see why us REAL jewel fans hate this cd so much.  she's throwing away good talent, and good looks.  i liked her look before, now she just looks like a hooker. but all in all let's pray that jewel went through a phase, and will go back to her original stuff on her next album.  She is still the same old Jewel in concert though, which is good. so maybe there's hope after all!	-1
this cd is PURE garbage.  stand was an ok song, so i thought i'd download the album, even though i hate Intuition.  there are only about 3 or 4 cuts that are GOOD on this album. the rest sounds like the latest britney spears album!! URGH! i can't believe it!! WHY JEWEL WHY. even the songs that sound like her older stuff, her voice still sounds more computerish. maybe her next album will be better	-1
liked her better before she discovered the wonderful world of hip hop.	-1
It's not so much Jewel sold out but Jewel shows on this CD that she has aristically sold-out.  This is simply a dull, lukewarm collection of machine generated songs that offer no reason to listen to again.  Where's that edgy young artist who said Bukowski was one of her major influences?  Her and Liz Phair should start a support group for aging thirty-something female pop stars who think they should be Avril.(Oh, Jewel isn't that old?  She sure acts like it...)  I have to re-evaluate her old stuff.   "If I could tell the world just one thing...that you're okay...."   I think Jewel proves on this CD the true depth of her previous stuff.	-1
Let me just get this out of the way: I was never really a fan of Jewel. I never went out and bought her albums. Still, though, I gave her credit for playing her own instrument and writing her own songs, and being individualistic (at least more so than most of what has been plaguing the radio since the mid-1990's). BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE??? This really depresses me. And this is coming from someone who was never into Jewel in the first place. Has the music industry really come to this? Where a fairly original artist has to sacrifice all integrity and brains he/she ever had and make meaningless pop drivel just to sell RECORDS!?!?! Talk about a sad state of affairs. I hate to throw around the word "sellout", but... SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! If you must hear this album, just download it and burn it. Yes, it is possible - we're living in the future, my friends! Remember, we, the consumers, speak with our money. Don't waste it on this, and perhaps, just perhaps, the record companies will wise up. (*scoff* yeah, like that will ever happen...)	-1
I loved "Intuition" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan!  So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this.  Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop.  It's mostly folk with a rock edge.  Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences.  Really, "Intuition" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!	-1
I've never been that Big on Jewel&sure didn't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set. Vocally She is still the same. I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now.but the Music here&vibe feels like it passed Her by. Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound&Vibe just ain't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance.but, Usher style Album titles just ain't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul.	-1
For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304. I have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include "Run 2 U" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish "Intuition". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example. And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. "Becoming" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with "Haunted". "2 Find U" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called "Standing Still" (or the second time, when it was called "This Way"). Another problem here is the lyrics. Songs like "Fragile Heart" and especially "U & Me = Love" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but "Yes U Can" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of "Stand"? I don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album.	-1
never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-  had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!  close to $100 worth of music never received!!	-1
While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B.	-1
Cher is back with "Living Proof", after the highly successful "Believe" which catapulted Cher into superstardom once again with the single "Believe" going all the way to No. 1 in 1998 and making it the biggest single of 1998 according to Billboard. So Cher shows in "Living Proof" that you don't mess with success and use the same formula as "Believe".  Though "Believe" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does "Living Proof". The songs are good dance songs my favorite is "A Different Kind of Love Song" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before "Song for the Lonely". However all the songs sound like the same vain of "Believe", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over. I don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, "Living Proof" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs. The other strong cuts include "Rain, Rain" and "Love One Another" which sounds a lot like "A Different Kind of Love Song" which is a faster version of "Song for the Lonely" which is a slower version of "Believe"....Get the picture? There is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however "Living Proof" is just the same old "Beliefs". Cher does dance good, however if you want a really good dance album get Kylie Minoques "Fever" which is sizzling hot.	-1
Cher is at it again.  Now nearly 56 years of age, Cher is still fighting the inevitable tide of time.  This time, as with her last "effort" "Believe", Cher (with platinum hair--will it translate to platinum sales?  I doubt it) continues her foray into the world of trippy dance beats and nuevo-disco stylings as the listener is bombarded with studio wizardry and up-to-date technology (and Cher's unique voice).  The songs (as is usually the case with Cher) are penned by songwriters (i.e., not Cher herself although she did have a hand (ha!) in writing the first "tune") and Cher is backed by a slew of competent studio musicians and masterful, clinical, overproduction.  To me, this sounds like technology for technology sake and not for the sake of the music.  On the bright side, it does tend to obscure Cher's questionable "talent" somewhat and that can't be all bad.  If you go for dance music, stick with the experts and not some "artist" trying to stave off irrelevance.  If you're someone who digs Cher, you'll buy this anyway (and maybe even dance to it--ha ha ha!!!).  The bottom line:  Overproduced dance music that's been done better by many others.  Hippity Hop Dop!!!	-1

For such a "much anticipated" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic "90 Degrees and Freezing", a Motown-inspired, horn driven "Come to Me Do" and a catchy and powerful pop gem "Feel" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears. I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite "King of Might Have Been" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range. I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on "XXX". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on "XXX". Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance. "Chicago XXX" "could have been a contender" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for "Chicago XXXI".	-1
I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song "Caroline" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.	-1
It won't play this song on my mp3 player! frustrating! I never would have bought it anyway, at least it was free. but still it is frustrating. I ended up just deleting it from my player, it simply wouldn't work. :(	-1
(2 & 1/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like "Questions 67 and 68."  I even enjoyed their more "lite rock" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new "XXX" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, "King of Might Have Been."  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of "You're The Inspiration."  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  "Inspiration" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); "King" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); "Inspiration" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  "King" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; "Inspiration" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.  A couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., "Chicago Love Songs") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of "XXX" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.	-1
Great  song great band love their music cant say enough bout chicago wish there were more bands with this type music today.	-1
I haven't seen "Rhythm of the Rain" in the oldies collections hawked on TV and this CD seemed the only way to get that song. The rest of the music on this CD is forgettable.	-1
Should have only downloaded the song one time.  Don't like it that you couldn't sample the music first.	-1
This was a second song that I wasted my money on because there was too much static on this mp3 track.	-1
It's terrible when FM radio plays out a song that was average to begin with. it makes it even more lackluster to the discerning listener	-1
It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.	-1
I understand the urge of trying to make kids music into classical music but this kinda takes away the kid friendliness. My two year old daughter gets bored by this music very quickly.	-1
It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.	-1
This has to be one of the worst versions of the song I have ever heard. Even my two year old Wheels on the bus expert had issues signing along	-1
It's alright	-1
I think I got this album for free. I thought my nephew would enjoy, but he doesn't listen to it much. Now it just sits around on my computer....  This is my least favourite track on the disk...	-1
even as a freebie, this was a total & complete waste of my time to listen to. fit only for the trash.	-1
It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.	-1
good concept however the song turned out rather boring and my kids do not enjoy listening to it at all.	-1
My two year old was very unimpressed with this song. I think they could have made the songs more child friendly	-1
This is the worst sleep music I have purchased from Amazon. It is just the same 5 minutes of music, cycled a dozen times. And the music is too intense for a sleep aid.	-1
this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.	-1
There are a lot of versions of this song out there. This is not the right one to download. It's taken from a compilation album and starts and ends ubruptly because it was very sloply hacked from the original album.	-1
I assumed this would have some variance in it, but it is the same bowl being tapped over and over, no overlapping or changes throughout the whole, very long piece. I wonder if they just recorded one gap, then repeated it again and again. There must be better meditational "music" (and I use the term loosely there as it is nothing but the ringing of the bowl -- no other instruments, no melody, no chanting, ... nada) than this. I was very disappointed.	-1
Okay song	-1
Where have all the flowers gone? Hmm I would say they wilted and died from this boring song. Why I purchased this one will always amaze me? I guess it was just a blue day and this song certainly did not lift my spirits.	-1
I just don't like this song. She sings weird in a few parts where she gets real loud and when you're getting into it, she scares you with her loud parts.	-1
What were they smoking when they wrote this? Probably the same thing I was smoking when I bought it.! This song should have been put out before it started. The only thing I liked about it was... nothing.	-1
500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles. Didn't take a rocket scientist to write this song. I'm just happy I was not with her on the 500 mile journey. I think I would have been forced to stick my fingers in my ears so I could not hear her singing, otherwise she would have put me to sleep. Depressing song.	-1
Yeah give me a hammer so I can smash this song. Oiy Vey! I use to listen to this song when I was a punk but now I am an old lady and this song just nauseated me...	-1
Madonna's "Who's That Girl" sets a much faster pace than her "La Isla Bonita" which goes at a slow pace.  The song is marked by spanish motifs and words, obviously her favorite culture.  This song makes me feel good to be a girl.  This song has intrinsic value in my life.	-1
This was some useless version with a bunch of crap that had nothing to do with the original song. Frankly I was cheated!	-1
When I was 11 years old(1967) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour,and certainly,these 4 concerts are true to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes,I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4-track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile,Alabama recorded by one of the group's roadies. The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen. Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass,electric piano.organ) & Davy Jones(tambourine) had been better players,they were in a no-win situation,trying to play songs from the first 2 albums,which featured up to 10 instruments per song. Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's "Live 1967" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on "Live 1967".I suspect that on "Live 1967",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub/correct the recordings. What you'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable!) ragged/amateur/garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade. But "Live 1967" is much more listenable.	-1
Ambrosia Anthology had the same songs plus many more so it was a far better deal. I thought I might get a better quality sound but it was the same.	-1
This is supposed to be an accompaniment track (no voices).  However, it's the original song.  I previously purchased the original, and was looking for the version without voices for a memorial DVD.  Ended up with an adequate version from another company (Christian Rock, the Best of. . .).	-1
i don't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of Dolly Parton's song. She oversang and it's just kind of an annoying song to sit through...what a drag...	-1
I can not download this music to my Media player.  Had I known I could download, I would not have purchased.	-1
I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off. No; I would not recommend this to my friend.	-1
I remember this song be a lot better then it actually is. Maybe because I was pretty young when it came out.	-1
dont listen to music because music bores me and i don't even listen to music at all to begin with	-1
song was great BUT Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again. IF YOUR gonna download this song do it but not from AMAZON.	-1
What a con, I should have looked harder, but Amazon shows an Ablum cover, and expecting to get it all for .69 cents, you get one song.  Its deceptive, but  probably not illegal. But I don't like it, and probably will never use this site angain.	-1
I know 'It's Five O'clock Somewhere' is a good song because I've heard it done well at many square dances.  But I was very disappointed with this version.  I know a local square dance caller who does it much, much better.	-1
I downloaded the CD and still haven't been able to listen to the whole CD so I deleted it from my Library	-1
I'm sorry, but I cannot extend any tolerance towards a blatantly ripped off song. This song's verses sound EXACTLY like that Dobie Gray song "Drift Away". I don't ever want to hear this song in a store, or anywhere, ever again. I don't like writing negative reviews on this website anymore, but I'm sorry, this song is garbage, and I need to say something about it. It is one of those pieces of music that is every negative term I can think of. It's unoriginal, generic, and has a lackadaisical reason for existing. I like this style of music, but this is a song that infuriates me because it is so terrible.	-1
I bought this song to add to a road trip playlist. I personally hate country music, but my buddy is a huge fan so I added it for him	-1
bought this song a on accident thinking it was a different one. it's ok but kinda slow	-1

heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping. it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review. i guess it's perfect for a furniture store: bland, generic, and soporific	-1
If I was having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in Anytown, USA and this came on mid movement, i'd committ Hari Kari. it's that terrible. this makes Shania Twain sound like Mozart.	-1
I will be completely honest with you, I am not a Kelly Clarkson fan!  This was a purchase for my wife who loves this song so...	-1
Alright, listen to the lyrics for this one. First of all, I can't tell whether this is about a boy she has serious anger issues with, or whether this is about a child-abuser. The latter would make the song more powerful in a lyrical sense, the former on the other hand, would just make the song wrong all the world around. But, in either case, Clarkson does a poor vocal performance here, and somebody totally messed up on giving this song a tune. It's so bad, it verges on mind-numbing, and annoying. And after you've heard the song ten times on radio, in the same morning, you'll verge on convulsions and other serious medical and mental issues. Yes, it's that bad.  Oh by the way, Reba didn't help the song any. In fact, she just made it worse, as if that was even possible. In fact, that version could be the worst excuse for a duet I've ever heard. In either case, with either song, don't buy it. Keep your sanity, and keep your ears.	-1
This song is boring, unenergetic, and as generic as you can get. Just overproduced crap made to cater to boring-a$$ FM radio easy-listening for doctor's offices format.	-1
The only solid foundation with you!!!	-1
Where is Pressure?  You kidding me?  Only my favorite Billy Joel song ever!  Can't believe they left that off - glaring omission.  I'll pass.	-1
Awful. I think this is the worse wiil smith song ever.	-1
Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.	-1
"Oh Sherrie" was Journey lead singer Steve Perry's first solo release.  No one can deny the strength of Mr. Perry's voice, but he is too bombastic on this track.  He goes for the sledgehammer right over your head, when a little more subtleness would have better for a love song written for his girlfriend at the time.  The guitar work sounds a little too much like a knock off of Neal Schoen.  The song was a massive hit in early 1984, peaking at number 3.  It would be his only solo song to crack the top ten.	-1
After listening to our choir sing it, I rushed to purchase the original, Big mistake.  Oh well.	-1
How should I put this song? Painful, as in whenever it's on the radio, you have the sudden urge to bash your head into something. The song is one we've heard a million times before, when your lover is gone, you're sad, yes, we know, we get the picture. Stick to being in love with the boyfriend, or hating him, or being jealous over him, or losing him, just not, pining over him being more than ten feet away from you. And good gosh, can this song be any more overplayed on the radio? I mean, if this and "Keep Holding On" were the only songs you knew of her, you'd think she's the worst artist since SoljaBoy.  And read my review of "Keep Holding On," most of it also applies here. So overall, Avril needs to stick to "Girlfriend" and "Sk8tr Boi." Stick with the punk, not the ballads and uplifting inspiration garbage, please.	-1
this song is soooo played out!! it wasn't all that to begin with! but it only annoys me more b/c it is played tirelessly	-1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
I gave this download only one star because, even though it did download into iTunes on my p.c., I could not get it to sync into my mp3 player as I did with two other songs I purchased from Amazon.com:  'I Can Only Imagine' by MercyMe, and 'All of Creation', also by MercyMe.  If your tech support team can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.	-1
I cannot like it even less.  It is not a good rendition of the beautiful song that we are used to.  Awful	-1
It's a great song sung by one of my favorite country gentleman singers. Reminds me of all my good memories.	-1
I think I out grew babyface, hes a good singer but the songs just don't hit me like they once did.	-1
There was only one decent song on the "Greatest Hits" Maybe I'm not a "Earth Wind & Fire" fan	-1

I couldn't open the file the first time so I even downloaded twice and it still wouldn't  open.  Left me frustrated and unsatisfied.	-1
First of all, can we get over the craze of inspirational and uplifting music, quickly? Thank you. The song has great lyrics, but the musical and vocal elements to the song all seem overdone, overcooked, and trying too hard. In fact, somebody tried too hard to make this song a hit, which never really caught on, but you hear it on radio constantly, to the point where you cringe every time you hear this song.  And by the way, does anybody else think that an inspirational song from somebody like Avril Lavigne, who is not the best of role models, is just plain wrong? In either case, the song doesn't work, except on a lyrical level, and even that's been done before.	-1
this is an overproduced piece of dung. just cos u can wail & sing real good don't mean u don't have to b original. Originality still accounts for a lot & u just playin Kneegrowz like chumps when u release overproduced pablum like dis	-1

Sony Music shortchanges Lauper by only giving her one disc (and 14 tracks only!!!!) She deserves much better, and this is what it should look like:  Disc One:  1. Money Changes Everything  2. Girls Just Want To Have Fun  3. When You Were Mine  4. Time After Time  5. She Bop  6. All Through The Night  7. Witness  8. The Goonies 'R' Good Enough  9. Change Of Heart  10. Boy Blue  11. True Colors  12. What's Going On  13. Iko Iko  14. The Faraway Nearby  15. Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)  16. I Drove All Night  17. Like A Cat  18. A Night To Remember  19. I Don't Want To Be Your Friend  Disc Two:  1. That's What I Think  2. Who Let In The Rain  3. Sally's Pigeons  4. A Part Hate  5. Hat Full Of Stars  6. Come On Home  7. Sisters Of Avalon  8. Ballad Of Cleo + Joe  9. You Don't Know  10. Fearless  11. Brimstone And Fire  12. Shine  13. Madonna Whore  14. This Kind Of Love  15. Waters Edge  16. I Miss My Baby  17. Stay  18. Makin' Whoopee (Duet With Tony Bennett)  19. You've Really Got A Hold On Me  They took 6 tracks from her debut, then they strangely take two from her second album, one from her third, two from her fourth, two from her fifth and none from her sixth! What?!! Sure it's nice to have Goonies, but no Hole In My Heart???!! Don't buy this, make your own compilation or wait until they get it right.	-1
Tell me, what doctor's office or elevator hasn't been playing this overrated turd constantly. as if we weren't tortured enough with it in the eighties. WHY OH WHY? won't this sucky-azz song, overplayed song  just die a dignified death already!!	-1
This probably isn't the version of this song you want. You want the one with the wierd picture of George with the funky mustache/soul patch thing.	-1
My band decided to start covering this ridiculous pseudo disco excuse for a song so I bought the long version. Big mistake, I should have bought the radio edit and prevented myself from having to sing the whole thing.	-1

I remember first hearing this song on American Idol by the contestant that sang it and I heard wrote it, Bo Bice.  I remember first hearing it on the radio, it just debuted or something.  I guess it was too new for me to get the singers name, because later on that week, Bo Bice sang it, and I thought oh, he's singing that new song on the radio.  Then American Idol said Bo Bice wrote the song.  Now Gavin Degraw sings it, but that is way after hearing it on Season 4 of American Idol, with Bo Bice, Constatine, and Carrie Underwood, who won American Idol season 4. Ok, Bo Bice sang the song, which had a much harder edge.  Gavin Degraw actually did pretty well with it!	-1

It's a song, how much can you say about that?	-1
Doesn't play after download. Waste of money. Shame because I like to workout to this song.	-1
I didn't screen the lyrics carefully enough before I bought it.  I like the reggae rhythm and the instrumentation is fairly good.  Wyclef Jean's vocals are good; Shakira's are a little week.  The lyrics are sexually suggestive, so I have to be careful not to play this song for younger audiences.	-1
It was an odd song...	-1
the song is good but the picture is inappropriate and i don't really know spanish but it is still a good song	-1
I don't like this song.	-1

The song is great. However the post mastering of the song left a high pitch screech in certain areas of the song starting with "Miami beach..." then "I've seen....", fancy, limousines, etc. Too many places to list. I tried a new download and it still is wrong. This would make me hate a song I so enjoy.	-1
this song is horrible! how is this chick so famous?? it's a big corporate push & a lot of money and financial interests @ stake, invested in her career. The suits who are pushing this would sell ya a turd sandwich if it would make them  a lot of moolah!	-1

Last year's American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks, really hasn't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her debut. While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.  Song: D+	-1
This seems to be a remix and not the original song, which was what I was trying to download. That's why I gave it the low rank.	-1

This song is very aggressive and not easy on my ears.  I absolutely adore Jennifer Lopez, but when I was buying this song, I did not get to hear preview - my bad.  There is another super-wonderful song on this album "Di me porque lloras... De felicidad" - I wish I purchased that one, instead.  That other song is brilliant, sensual and touching.  I love Jennifer Lopez.  I am very much like her, just not Puerto Rican :)	-1
Aerosmith hired songsmith-for-hire Diane Warren (she was like the Max Martin of the late eighties/early nineties and wrote songs for a lot of chart topping pop crap. I mean, you hire DW to write song poop drivel, you might as well hire Michael Bolton as your singer.	-1
There is an old-fashioned album advertisement for the band at the end of the song. It is very annoying.	-1
song was great Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again.	-1
Well I love this song, and it was my husband's and my song "OUR SONG" but this particular version is UBER long.  It has all that extra on and on forever ending that feels like it will NEVER end.  The radio version cuts all of that out.  Get the radio edit version.	-1
How annoying is this song? He says shake about 50x and it gets so damn repetitive.  2 stars.	-1
i bought but it never download to my kindle.. very upset about that.. and i really want this sone to listen to	-1
this is not only a horrible song. it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the advent of recorded music. what a wretched piece of dung! i have about 274 different downloads on my special download wishlist on amazon, so there's about 274 things i could recommend you download before downloading this piece of crap song. i can't stand these record industry manufactured pop princess garbage. she doesn't even write her own songs for chrissakes! the pitbull song 'give me everything' probably comes close to this as far as 'worst song' but this is indisputably the worst	-1
early nineties pop cheese hasn't dated well b/c the arrangements and the production sounds like that overproduced, cold sounding late eighties early nineties sound that hasn't dated too well. Whitney was looking fine in the video though, back when everyone thought she was a wholesome role model type.	-1
rerst in peace whit nevber liked your bubblegum material but you had a cool voice anyway since everybody wanna think abouit the good times this tune brought this will make you remember the voice and remember kids crack is wack.	-1

When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.  While her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.  Overall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.	-1
And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).  Altogether, I just don't appreciate either of them ripping the Irreplaceable beat off though.  Come on! We heard it ENOUGH in 2006/2007!!!  Second. I will never forget you/You're in everything I do/  (Later)  Just like a tattoo/I'll always have you  blah, blah, blah, blah, Jordin. Start writing your own songs and maybe you'll get some attention!  2.25 stars.  End note: Beautiful voice but get a new producer who isn't afraid to try something new and different! I know it can be hard being original these days in the studio because it seems like everyone has nearly tried everything BUT (and that's a B I G but) copying a song's beat that has previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do! The lyrics are trite and super-elementary and nothing (I mean NOTHING) besides the vocal work stands out!!	-1

Maudlin, and trite.  It is manipulative in it's emotionalism and it to wrap it in the guise of a Christmas song is inappropriate and in one sense cruel.  Christmas is a time of birth and new beginnings.	-1

Sara Groves is a great singer-songwriter, and has written some absolutely fabulous songs.  Unfortunately, this CD misses the mark, and is by far the weakest of her releases.  The CD is lacking the lyrical and melodic depth of her better songs, and, as noted in other reviews, has a mass-produced CCM sound that does not serve her well.  For Sara's best, check out "Other Side of Something", "Conversations", and her most recent release, "Fireflies and Songs".  Each of these CD's include songs that are as good as any music produced in the last 10 years.  Nobody's perfect . . .	-1
THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.  Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.  There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.  This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.  To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.  John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.  It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.  The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.  But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.  The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.  If you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.	-1
Starts off great, gets bad real quick. Some of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her "Mama's Gun" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, "Don't You Forget It", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track. The only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, "Butterfly"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough. The rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy. The tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on her next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.	-1
So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on. Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI).	-1

If you are a fan of those great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to get these, the 1993 Razor & Tie versions and not the recent re-masters of 2000 and 2003. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie CD's sound like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!	-1
After "Getz/Gilberto" the second best selling Jazz album of all time behind "Kind of Blue", the record companies were anxious for another golden egg.  However this is one of the worst periods in Stan Getz life, the 70's. Personal problems, and he was locked in the the bitterest divorce case in history, went to the Supreme Court! Things added to his orange juice...  Joao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.  For better Getz, pick any other decade or his life. For some reason all of the Getz Columia recordings are really bass thin and harsh. This one is less so, but no exception.  See my list for many better Getz recordings.	-1
This is the most God-awful piece of dung i have ever heard. How in tarnation was this song so popular?? I'll tell ya how...The general public has bad musical taste! No...wait...it's the God-forsaken mainstream media...they control what gets played on the radio and provide their puppet/dj with a "playlist" of whatever the powers that be want them to play. Production-wise, the dreadful,un-original horn sample used in this song sounds like a Puff Daddy ripoff sample. It's very 1996 and sound like a Kool and the Gang wanna be horn riff.	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03. It isn't a good song, because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband. Still, there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love.  Song: D+	-1
If this is the best song in the 2000's you are sadly mistaken. Anything from this "artist" should not be bought. Avoid beyonce at all cost. Instead buy my albums on itunes you'll thank me later.	-1
It's got a very familiar sound throughout and if your cool w it...you'll survive. For me, there was a moment of "okay, it's done playing." I didn't want to re listen. Price, bargain though.	-1
If you liked simple plan's last two records, prepare to be disappointed. There are only two songs here that sound anything like what the band has done in the past, and one of them is a JP bonus track. So really, there's only one good song on the whole 12 track effort! Pop-punk is supposed to be fun, and simple plan used to do it as well if not better than everyone else, but there's nothing fun about waiting three plus years for such a terrible record.	-1
Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not "punk." And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls "unchartered musical territory." Perhaps "UnCHARTED" musical territory is more like it. This one is headed to a bargain bin near you, right next to all those old LFO albums.	-1

First off, what is the point of this "duet?" Because from my viewpoint it is at best a vehicle for Beyonce, and a god-awful one at that. How bad is this song? In the original version, where the song was treated like art, not a marketing tool, Justin Timberlake gave his best vocal performance yet with a 5-star croon. Here, with the shoving of Timberlake, and the addition of Beyonce, she sounds more like the cat whose tail has just been stepped on. To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a "duet," but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.  Overall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song. It's one of the flat-out worst quality of song in 2007, Period.	-1
I'll admit I am Beyonce fan and somewhat of a Justin fan but this remix, yes REMIX is terrible. Now, While Beyonce's Vocals are great and on point, Justin's remain the same as his original which for me, throws me off since they called it a "Duet". My opinion : if it was really a duet, Justin's vocals would be new, also. So, it's more of a remix than a duet. I Think if Justin had new vocals for the song, it would be more enjoyable.  This would have been a lot better, in my opinion had it contained new vocals from JT	-1

I love the two singles, Spin and Out of Breath, so I thought I'd download this first and give it a try.  As much as I hate to give an album with meaningful lyrics such a low rating, I have no other choice.  Sorry to all you hardcore fans, but this didn't cut it!  I tried to like this album and I still couldn't get into a lot of these songs!  There's too many slow, sleep  inducing tracks!  I can get the same thing from my relaxation CD!!  Not even the bonus track How Long is worth the extra money!  I gave this two stars for the five songs I like:  Spin, Sky Is Falling, Am I Ever Gonna Find Out, Out Of Breath, and Take Me Away.  My advice:  Go ahead, if you're a hardcore fan!  If you're just a casual fan like me, just download it or borrow it from a friend!  And while you're at it, try No Name Face instead!  So far, I've only heard sound clips, but it still seems like a better album than this!	-1
oh the Guest Album's how they have changed the Game? Quincy Jones did this Concept for many a Moon but it was Carlos Santana that has gotten all the Juice from it in Big term sales.so Willie Nelson is next in line for the Big Cash Out.but like with Santana the Best Material here just as there to me was when the Artist themselves were showcased.overall you don't get the guest adding anything to the mix instead just a cool Pressence&very Little overall Substance to me. Willie Nelson has created some Great Stuff but this Set is basically going thru the Motions for a Album as to adding any depth to it.	-1

Alright, Daughtry is definitely not as good as I thought he was. In fact, he might be the most unoriginal guy in modern rock to come around in quite awhile, and that's saying something. However, this time he doesn't sound like another artist, he sounds like his bad self, or more specifically, "Over You" which was his previous single. Anybody else see something wrong with this picture? And yet, he rules rock radio.  The verses are mediocre at best, and the chorus on its short run on radio is already annoying the heck out of me. It just doesn't seem real, like it's a half-hearted effort or something; something to please the record labels. Chris's vocals are stellar as always, but contrary to popular belief, the song itself makes for most of its success, and this one is made, but it's in pieces taped together in a quick effort to please a record executive.  So overall, on if, if not Daughtry's worse in a rather short career so far. Hopefully he'll come out his sophomore album rather soon, so the rest of the musical skeletons in his compact disc closet will stay where they belong: hidden.	-1
Song does not sound anything like the original recording. Had to find and download the original. Can not recommend this version of the song at all.	-1
This version is quiet different from the original.  Not as good, in my opinion.  Wish I purchase the original.  I recommend that you pass on this version.	-1
I had to buy this giant album to get a few songs that weren't available on other albums. Some of the songs are worth it, but most are just repetitive and annoying.	-1

This song sucks.	-1
It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting "Fourteen" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's "Fall For You."  This piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.  So overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.	-1

I'M A BIG 8BALL & MJG FAN. BUT THIS ALBUM DIDN'T REALLY IMPRESS ME THAT MUCH. THE ONLY SONGS THAT I REALLY LIKED WERE ''YOU DON'T WANT DRAMA'', ''FOREVER'', ''MEMPHIS CITY BLUES'', AND ''TRYING TO GET AT YOU''. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE. I REALLY THINK THESE GUYS SHOULDN'VE WENT TO BAD BOY. CAUSE AFTER ALL, THESE GUYS DON'T FIT IN AT BAD BOY! THEY SHOULD'VE STAYED WITH SUAVE HOUSE. HIP HOP SEEMS TO BE HAVING ANOTHER MEDIOCRE YEAR. RAP HAS BEEN TOTALLY F***ED UP SINCE 2002, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANY BETTER.	-1
I swear, the beat is Irreplaceable Pt. 2, with the extra, "Hey's" thrown in there. We just can't be original anymore. It's like we'd rather bite someone else's style, and saying it's our own!!  The voice saves the song though. Nothing else. The lyrics are stale, "I'll always have you." Whatever, Jordin. Can we have a little depth, please?!!!!  The music industry is wrong in so many ways.  This is one of them!!  2.4 stars and nothing more for this "music". Melinda or Lakisha could've mopped the floor with her, if only America voted for talent, instead of a pretty face and an overrated beat-boxing wannabe!!!	-1

Highly indulgent release of ambient industrial instrumentals prove that not everyone should be completely free from label restraints. Reznor completely plays into the fanbase with this one, rarely constructing a track out of 36 that rises above mere NIN production exercise.	-1
I have been loyal to Trent Reznor and his NIN projects, but this is by far a big dissapointment.  Thank goodness it was reasonably priced. I just don't find this groundbreaking at all. More canned music.  If your strapped for cash, skip this album.  Get a good one like the downward spital, or broken	-1
Trina as ran the last course of her career and this album made me not listen to anymore of the past to now present Trina music. Just like Lil'Kim, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, Nicki Trashji, Khia, Jacki-O, and all those played out wack rappers the music doesn't last for long.	-1
Believe it or not, this was my first time purchasing a Trina album. It's not that I haven't liked any of her songs in the past, because I have. I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists. I immediately took notice of her, though, with her 2000 (or maybe 1999) debut single, "Da Baddest Chick." I actually liked the song initially--although it sounds a bit dated today--and the video, which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat, was pretty amusing, too. The next single was the summer-anthem, "Pull Over," which had my head bobbing for quite awhile. I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles, including "Told Y'All," the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott, and of course "Single Again." I've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out, but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples. They just didn't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub-par. However, the samples for this album sounded much better, and with her initial success with this album--debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever--I decided to finally give one of Trina's album a try.  The album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro, which is just here to take up an extra minute. The smarter choice would've been to just begin the album with the first full-length track, "Still Da Baddest." The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant, a perfect canvas for Trina's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business. (Believe it or not, this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade). The first single, "Single Again," is also one of the best tracks from this set; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies' anthem. I really can't understand why the song wasn't very successful. "Look Back At Me" should definitely be a future single, with its simplistic, dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals. "I Got A Bottle," which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott, is a fun and playful club song. On "Clear It Out," Trina gives us a piece of her mind, stating how she is fed up with haters, critics, and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy. And "Hot Commodity" is a great closing track; it's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song. Unfortunately, those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with. The rest are pretty unexciting. "I Got A Thang For You" and "Wish I Never Met You" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date, "Here We Go Again." (Which I didn't think was that great in the first place). The production isn't great, and Trina's rhymes are way too laid-back and lazy. "Killing You..." is bland and very repetitve and "Phone" is simply here for shock value, nothing more. Last, "Stop Traffic" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook. (Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know green means "go" and red means "stop." That's not clever!)  The bottom line: So... I've finally bought a Trina album. While it's a bit better than I was expectting, Still Da Baddest is far from flawless. It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is no medium on here. It's either really good, or really bad, and there are just as many bad songs as there are good. Most of the time Trina's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great (except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads). What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production, hooks, or song ideas. If you're a Trina fan, buy it. If not, I wouldn't really recommend it. Sure there are some good tracks here, but they are barely worth it for me.  Key tracks: Single Again, Look Back At Me, Still Da Baddest, Hot Commodity.	-1

By adding Daughtry to an album you are asking for some radio airplay,why???a band that for more than 10 years hasn't cared for that has had album go platinum,gold etc. and now going radio????I DON'T GET IT!!!,this album is by far their worst. Such songs as Inside and Prodigal Son take charge and show how they have been on every album,then all other songs start slow and have like this interlude of sorts that pretty much stink the album and even adding Tremonti and Kennedy from Alter Bridge can't help either,hopefully they put this album behind them,they are much better than what this album made out to be.	-1
This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones "Coming Down Again" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.  This album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. "Hot Stuff" is funky; reggae is evident with "Cherry Oh Baby"; and "Melody" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).  No, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say  "I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!"  The resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being "Bad Boys."  One last thing....  Just wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment "Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording"  Technically incorrect.  -- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., "Revolution" from the White Album).  -- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune "Yer Blues" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.  More technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:  -- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single "Let it Be." The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called "You Know My Name (look up the number)." Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.  -- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune "Yer Blues" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.  -- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release "All You Need is Love."  -- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release "Sing This All Together."	-1
This song has the same problem as "Who Says You Can't Go Home" by Bon Jovi has. It is an already terrible song that overplayed on the radio way too much. "Who Says You Can't Go Home" and this song aren't different from bad lyric placement. The reason why THIS song is bad because of the line "Two days in hell just ain't gonna do". Like I said in the Bon Jovi/Jennifer Nettles song review, songs AREN'T good when they do this. A descent song that does this becomes horrible, and this song was actually already horrible. James Otto isn't a bad artist at all, in fact, he does better with anything other than this song. "Sunset Man", which is the album that features this song, is actually not at all bad. Reviewed, the album would get a 3/5. This song isn't good at all, in fact it is very bad, but at least James Otto's other songs have passion.	-1

This band must have grown up on New York Dolls, or Buster Poindexter music. Nothing really new here, but then, what is?	-1
not good	-1
This version is quiet different from the original.  Not as good, in my opinion.  Wish I purchase the original.  I recommend that you pass on this version.	-1
very disappointed in this version and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song	-1
This is really awful.  Really I can't understand the acclaim this band gets.  In truth the only people that like this are critics that champion stuff like this that no one will care for so that they can feel important within  their little club of like-minded associates.  Sad.  Husker Don't!!!	-1
This artist is apparently very popular in the Christian world, but he just seems to be on some superstar stuff to me.  Most covers for Christian singers are reverent and less flashy.  He is all about the bling. I don't know about this dude.	-1
there is no reason for me to listen to music. it just sucks really bad and has no love in it.	-1
I didn't want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase.	-1
This is one of my favorite songs, but the sound quality is HORRIBLE!!!  Save your money & buy this song from another source.	-1
Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.	-1
Do not read any other review I,am by many terms the nicest reviewer on items here on Amazon,But this is by far the worst cd I have ever ordered and demanded my money back from Amazon,which they gave me and hope they will remove this seller from there site. This is defiately a bootleg,you only have to google there record company and duh no such company. Save your money and buy something else on Amazon. Its companies like this that give wonderful sites like Amazon a bad name.	-1
These guys stink, just like any so called "punk" rock today. Don't buy this.	-1
.....yeah right!....well,you want a review for this album........ok........this is the worst band in the world..is music for 5 years old brats who think they're cool listening to whining sorry lyrics and boring rappings......if you're into punk listen to real punk bands........what about some wizo.....they are young neither.......or bad religion...they're gods.........don't be a sucka my friend and if you bought this album gave it to your little cousins,......but I don't think they're dumb enough to take it.........	-1
If you have had enough of corporate punk acts like Green Day and Blink 182, then Sum 41 is sure to tick you off even more.  If all the nu-metal garbage around now wasn't making me mad allready, this new corporate punk is ticking me off even more.  The same old three cord progression on every song, stupid uninspired lyrics, and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package.  And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they're on MTV, well kids, this ain't real punk.  Real punk is Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Black Flag, and dare I say it, even NoFX.  Then again, there are kids scratching their heads wondering "who are they, they're not on MTV, they're no good".  But what do I know?, I'm just some guy who listens to the above bands and other stuff outside the mainstream, so my opinion doesn't matter at all.  Now go listen to your Linkin Park CD.	-1
For the love of god WAKE UP AND SMELL THE AIR YOU SPOILED BRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is exactly what's wrong with America today. Cheap music that I could surpass in artistic and equality in twenty minutes and dumb, childish lyrics are a testament to the continuing decline of American intelligence today. This isn't punk or metal at all. This is a horrible travesty to both genres. Metal is ultraheavy guitar riffs with extremenly loud melody and pounding drums. Punk is real rebelism against trends in society. Sum 41 aren't that either. They are nothing but a bunch if talentless clowns who are cashing in on TRL to make a buck [...]. Don't call me an old fogie who listens to Frank Sinatra or Mozart because I am 19 years old but I have stuck with the moral values that garbage like this encourages youth to dismiss. I feel ashamed that people in my age group are more worried about being cool by cussing that than being intelligent. Well I hope this will change in the next five years and laugh at bands like Sum 41, Limp Bizkit, and all those dumb poser metal groups.	-1
Overplayed and overrated song by Aerosmith. To me their last great one was the Permanent Vacation album. Pump, the album this came from was so-so and this song has just been played to death and it's not that good.	-1
NOt your problem, maybe my computer is to old.  Use to be able to download, but no more.  Thanks to your customer service for all the help.	-1
