The stained glass pages are pretty cool. And it is nice how the black outlines are super dark and thick. And that the dragons aren't all fighting with the wizards.	1
My 11 y.o. loved this...and so do I (you know I really bought this because I wanted to see the pictures myself...I'm just lucky enough to have someone I could justify buying it as a present for.) Dragons and Wizards...says it all!  With the wonderful see-through vellum like pages, that make it "stained glass."  Color it with marker, or anything else really (colored pencil, watercolors maybe), and the light shining through the page makes it look luminous and gorgeous!  Even the perfectionist that gets intimidated with art and drawing tends to find these stained glass books easy to get results they are happy with, so it tends to be an enjoyable and confidence building experience. :)	1
The pictures are great , I've done one and gave it to a friend of mine who likes dragons.	1
I absolutely love this book! Its translucent paper make it super fun to use. I have been using Paint Brush Markers and Sakura Gel Pens on it with excellent quality. The only thing that I would recommend is a blank white sheet of paper to make the lines easier to see.	1
I love it!	1
MY HUSBAND LOVED IT. HE IS IN TO DRAGONS.	1
love it	1
cool	1
Exactly as described, nice pictures, great transaction, thank you!	1
Sometimes you need something new and special that gives you 30 minutes of piece. I used these waiting at the dentist or a graduation or something. They are small so they slip into a bag and cheap enough, especially with the 3 for 4 price on amazon.com . The robots and funny faces are a lot of fun. Probably best at 3-4-5 rather than 2 because the stickers are small.  I love all of the great not-licensed-character stuff by Dover.	1
These little books are great! They are small, but perfect for birthday party favors, which is what we used them for! There is a blank page after each page of stickers, so that's where my kids made their robots. They were a huge hit!	1
This is indeed a small book. This particular ROBOT sticker book was at best, OK. Why? Well, there's really no space to create multiple robots. Stickers are not easy to remove. Not recommended unless you just gotta have it to entertain a child. But this may only last ten minutes. Plus side, small enough to stick in purse for travel.	-1
I bought several of these as party favors at a robot themed birthday party.  My son really seemed to like it and made a series of different robots.  The only issue is that most of the pages are not such that they stickers can be re-stuck so we really only used most of the configurations once as we made them on regular pages rather than taking pieces on and off the robot at the back of the book.	1
total waste of money. the stickers do not stick down even once it is just a tiny amount of stickers which do not work, and that is basically it. I thought the backgrounds would make this special but it just is tiny and does not work. much better to simply buy packs of stickers and use paper the activity books in this series are better	-1
Nephew, age 5 loved the booker.	1
Very Cute!	1
AGE APPROPIATE. G'SON LOVED	1
its a cute little book, but it's a tiny little guy.	1
They were ok but not really considered it a book. Really small disappointed!	-1
Good product	1
Great fun for my grandson who loves robots.	1
This was a stocking stuffer for my son.  It was cute and he enjoyed using it a couple of times.  For the price of a little over a dollars didn't mind that he only used it a few times.  It is hard to tell from the picture but this is small.	1
Fun gift	1
great book	1
Grandson loved it	1
This is a small book	1
a wonderful little sticker book that i put with the robot two sided puzzle in a busy bag for a 3 year old.	1
The book is only 4 pages and it's about the size of a 3x5 note card... not much fun at all.	-1
Very nice product.	1
Most of the Dover Little Books are high quality. I use them to get those few more dollars for free shipping. My grandsons enjoy looking to find one.  They will play with duplicates of ones  they received before.	1
My four year old robot lover had fun with this.  His five year old brother loved it, too.  It didn't provide hours of entertainment, more like minutes, but it was a fun stocking stuffer and they really appreciated it.	1
I added this to a birthday present for my 3-year old nephew. He loved it, but I was surprised at how small this was. In the back, there is a picture of a robot, and you "dress" him using the stickers.	1
If you have a child interested in robots this is a fun activity for them.  It allows the child to build a robot with colorful stickers.	1
This was a great little book for my Robot "Boy's Night" Party. Loved the robot craft in the back of the book:) Great price!	1
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Its a sticker book. So how can I go wrong with this gift.	1
Not sure why there are so many rave reviews for this product. It is literally the size of an index card and only about 4 pages long (some activity book!) The stickers are bright and colorful but there are only enough to make about 3-4 sticker robots. You could probably find something similar at the dollar store.	-1
but definitly NOT...  tiny book..  make robot with stickers that comes inside... whoo whoo big deal wow faint wow...  thats how bad	-1
We bought this to give to young children that attended our wedding. Kid's ranged from 4-10 years old. It would have been to have multiple robots to decorate, but the price of the book and actually the small size came in handy for us - perfect to give out to kids and fit nicely in a little treat box for them. This is great for a little gift to make a child feel special - and to keep them occupied for a bit!	1
This book is small in size and probably best for 4 to 5 years old due to having to piece the robots together without knowing what a robot is.  My 3.5 year old didn't show much interest in it other than them being stickers.  However, I saved it and he will more than likely go for it in a year or two.	1
Nice book but it was so small.  I should have read the size of the book.  It's about as big as my palms.  The activities looks fun for little ones, good for the car.  It will keep him busy for a few minutes.	1
My 5 year old son loves robots, and he really loved creating his own robots with this little Dover book. As always, these are high quality for the price. The Little Activity Books are small, and will get you through a waiting room visit, or a restaurant sitting, but not longer than that. They are worth their small cost though! Love it!	1
love this little book for an extra little fun stocking stuffer or reward item. Bots are a big thing with little boys!	1
Sticker Activity Book my arse. This "book" is 2 pages of stickers, folded in half and stapled inside a cover jacket. It's not a book, and there are no activities to speak of, except for peeling off the stickers (robot parts) and affixing them to the back page.  Oh, and did I mention this is TINY?  The whole book is about the size of a passport (but with less pages) and there is about 4 robots total on the little pages (parts are parts, but I counted 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 feet, and a body on each of the 4 pages).  So that works out to $1.00 per assembled robot - total ripoff.	-1
This occupied my almost-3 year old for nearly an hour.  Stickers were durable and easy to peel.  Afterwards, he kept going back to the box to see if there were more robot stickers to assemble in there.  I'll probably drop another dollar and buy it again for his Christmas stocking.  Three cheers for the short memory of a preschooler!	1
This little Dover book is like the others of the series - fun and entertaining.  I was not happy to see that the price on the back was $1.50 and I paid $2.51 with Amazon.  I am used to getting a better deal than the stores, but this certainly was not!	1
My 4 year old loves this robot sticker book! Yes, it is small, but its priced right for the size.  This provided lots of entertainment for my son, as he got to create his own robots.  He loves to intermix the parts and mis-matched robots. Definatly worth 1.50.	1
My Grandson adores robots, I think Buzz Lightyear started it all ;-)  These he has had great fun with. I didn't give it 5 stars only because like other reusable stickers they really aren't very reusable. They only stay 'sticky' for the first few uses then they kept falling off which frustrated him. But the price wasn't bad so as long as you consider them consumable and don't plan on them lasting forever you'll be getting a pretty neat product. He really did enjoy them a lot, he is age 3 1/2 (does 100pc puzzles, builds with regular Legos, very mechanically inclined.)	1
Perfect for that long airplane ride for my almost 6 year old son. Small enough to fit into my handbag. The stickers can be re-used over and over again to make new robots. A must for any busy mom!	1
I'm 37 years old and I just took up drawing again for the first time since high school.  I wasn't that great at it then so I'm not all that advanced of an artist.  This book is the perfect skill level for someone like me.  I mostly can copy things right now, but if I draw something from memory, my lack of skill is apparent. That was my motivation behind buying this book.  I needed to build on my skills and this book looked like the perfect thing to help with that.  The book starts out with having you trace some pictures just to get your hand and eye used to drawing different lines.  I have to say that this may have been one of the most interesting pieces of advice that I have learned from this book so far.  I would have never even considered tracing something in the past, but now I want to go buy some tracing paper and try a little more tracing.  As you move through the lessons they become more difficult.  After tracing, you work on stick figure frames for the characters, next you practice "piping" which is where you draw guides for the outside lines, and then finally you move on to the detailing that really makes your drawings come alive.  The book is set up so that you can draw in the book itself.  This is a great idea as well, but this is also where I ran into my issues with the book.  1. It's too small.  At 8.5 x 8.6 inches the book isn't even as big as a standard piece of paper.  It's tough to practice drawing details when you don't have much room to fit those details into.  2. The book doesn't lay flat  The book has a traditional binding so the pages have and arch to them when you try to lay it out flat to draw in it.  You need to press down on the pages to flatten them and even then there is still a little curve to them.  It makes it tough to draw straight lines at times and since I, and the target audience of this book, aren't that great of artists at this point, it really makes it frustrating to do some of the lessons.  If this book had spiral binding, like a notebook, and was larger I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.  As it stand now, it's 4 stars for me.  I am still glad I bought it because I really feel like it gave me some good things to practice.	1
Our little artist loves this kit.	1
love this delivered on time	1
I'm 32 and really need a hobby, so I bought this kit. The instructions were easy to follow, my only tips are to have more yarn (I ran out of black on the first puppy) and use a hot glue gun. I did this based on other reviews, didn't even mess with the glue that was included.	1
At age 31 I found these very difficult to make, I can't imagine how an 8 year old would do it by themselves.	-1
We had a great time with this craft set.	1
Great product. Took a little practice and time, but after you get the hang of it. It turns into a cute cuddly little friend. Mine didn't turn out exactly like the picture, but it adds a taste of your own sense of style. They are super cute and comes with everything it says it will.	1
I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it very much.	1
Soooo cute and so much fun!  My non crafty husband made a puppy with each of my children (4 and 5) at Christmas and they turned out to be adorable and are still holding up!	1
My niece has had so much fun with this.  She loves it.	1
Really cute!!! My 9yr old and I have made lots of pom poms. Best of all, theres no mess to clean up and it could be done in the car, etc too.  Love it!	1
Cute idea, and the basic steps make sense are are easy to follow if a parent works with the kid. I gave a low review because although my child was excited to take part in this, they get bored when you are doing the work ( trust me you will have to, my kid is in first grade) and the glue provided SUCKS. It's basically Elmers glue and it's just not enough to keep everything together. I can't keep the ears or anything to dry and stay on without falling off. I would recommend hot glue.	-1
BOOO  UNLES YOU ARE PATIENT KNOW HOW TO MEASURE I DIDN'T HAVE THE PATIENCE NEITHER DID MY DAUGHTER.  BORING UNLESS YOU ARE A CRAFT PERSON WHICH I AM NOT.	-1
Good stocking stuffer.	1
I purchased this so my kids could make gifts for others - and it turned out awesome.  So adorable, the brown puppy turned out the best for us.  It took a bit to get the hang of it, but went fast after they knew what they were doing.	1
this was a gift for my daughter.  I found it difficult to use	-1
AWWWW, so cute	1
Once you get the hang of this, even a non-crafty person can make these.  Fun craft to do with a 5 year old!	1
This was a present for my 11 year old daughter.  So far we made one puppy.  And yes, Klutz did not include enough yarn.  We can easily buy more yarn, so this isn't a problem, more an annoyance.  Instructions are decent.  Our puppy came out cute.  I don't think she could have done it all alone.  I enjoy crafting, so it was fun to do together.  I am looking forward to making another one with her.	1
Really cute, REALLY time consuming and makes a mess. Daughter loves making these but would be better suited for ages 12+	1
My daughter loves this kit, definitely worth every penny as she has quit an assortment of puppies to play with. Also make cute gifts.	1
brings very little wool	1
My daughter thought it was really easy to put these together!  She had fun!	1
As advertised.	1
Girls love this kit, would buy this again	1
Bought as a gift & the 11 year old loved it!	1
Kid like it	1
8 yr. old grandaughter loved it along with the ideas it gave.  Perfect project for her.	1
Cool craft but is a lot of work and quite messy. The puppies are cute but there is a lot to clean up when you're done!	1
wonderful product , keeps my kids busy . My daughter made a YODA for her dad :)	1
Very cute. A bit difficult for my 10 yr old daughter but with a little help she is getting the hang of it. Had to show her how to make the pom poms first and now she is doing okay. Product is very cute but I will say they don't provide enough yarn so be sure to have some extra on hand.	1
A Christmas gift for my 8 y/o niece & totally by surprise her 11 y/o sister got the same exact one & she told me she had picked it out for herself.  On Christmas day she sat on the couch & began making a white fluffy poodle  I could tell she was really into it & enjoyed showing us what she did before we sat down for dinner. It was purely a coincidence that both of my grandnieces now have them.  They make really cute & cuddly dogs, they are soft & not difficult to construct. I would purchase it again & highly recommend it to anyone who has a young girl who enjoys doing crafts.	1
Fast shipment and great product.  So cute!	1
If you're patient, they come out really cute!!! Not something a young child can do, so you definitely have to help if your child is under 8 or so.	1
Book is nice but Pom poms never come out right. Either book gives wrong measurements of string length or the Pom Pom make it come with doesn't do proper job. I've made many pompous before and this is a first time I couldn't make Pom poms. So disappointing, paid too much just for the book pretty much	-1
I had a set similar to this many, many years ago and spent a lot of time enjoying making the pom-pom animals.  I ordered these for two little girls who I think will love them.  Has instruction book on box. Gifts, so not opened yet. Rated 4 because I have not seen contents yet. May rate 5 when opened. (Already rates 5 in my book just because it gave me some good memories of some old-fashioned fun.)  I may buy this item again, but not from Total Books.  My shipping experience with them on this order was not good.	1
Came book only. If it's just the book, it should be listed as a different listing entirely.	-1
My niece loves this! Her little puppies were so cute! It is very time consuming though. She's 8 and needed lots of adult assistance. The package only comes with enough yarn to make 4 puppies and only enough glue for one. So be prepared to buy more supplies.	1
Great birthday gift, very cute. Since we gave it away, I cant speak to how easy or hard it is to use but birthday girl was delighted	1
My 9 year old got this as a gift and loved the adorable puppies we made together.  I think it might be too difficult for her to do on her own at least at first.  My only complaint is that is didn't include enough yarn or eyes, ears etc. to make each of the 8 or 9 dogs pictured.  Of course, yarn, felt, and buttons can be purchased and more dogs can then be made, but she wasn't able to make her favorite dogs right away because there was only enough for 1 tan dog.  (black and white are also included in small quantities).	1
A gift, packaging and product is good!	1
This is much harder than it looks especially when you have to make the legs and trim the face. To make a good Pom Pom puppy you need an old movie an awesome mama and last allot of coffee. I made a Pomeranian and it was so cute (I did this with my mom and we were watching singing in the rain with a good conversation topic) the next one looked like a mess ( I did this one by myself ) so if you like a good challenge than this is for you but if you switch from making bracelets too writing reviews ( like me ) than you just might need more help than you think. You can make up to 2-4 . You have to use thick yarn thin won't work ( it comes with 4 things of yarn ) . So if you can handle hours of trimming and cutting than get your scissors out, if you have to have a partner than pull 2 pairs out just remember it's hard work and it's so long.	1
As an adult crafter who likes simple projects to relieve stress, I enjoyed this product very much, even though there are a few minor flaws. I'll list some pros, cons, and suggestions below.  Pros: The book provides detailed directions for seven different dog breeds in addition to abbreviated suggestions for how to create an unlimited number of breeds on your own. Book directions are clear and detailed with large, accurate pictures. The pompom maker is sturdy and easy to use. I had no problem creating pompoms easily my first try. The kit comes with enough basic supplies to make four adorable puppies, provided you take yarn measurements into account I was very satisfied with how cute my puppies turned out!  Cons: The basic school glue provided was not strong enough to hold the heads to the bodies or the felt ears to the heads. The punch-out dog carriers were too small for all of my pups. The kit is probably a bit too challenging for most eight-year-olds. I'd recommend it for ages ten and up. While there is enough yarn provided to make four dogs, there is not enough to make any four you want. Some dogs require too much yarn if you want to create four dogs total. The measuring tape on the back of the book measures in inches and centimeters, while the book directions are in yards.  Suggestions: Use a hot glue gun to hold the dog together. I used superglue, but my puppies are a little fragile. Take yarn measurements into account when choosing pups or just buy more yarn at a craft store. If you wrap the yarn around the height of the book, you'll have half a yard of yarn. Use this cheat mentioned in the book instead of the confusing ruler. When the book says to cut the yarn short, be sure to cut it quite short or your pup might look a little messy and shaggy.  Overall I really liked this kit and would definitely recommend it.	1
Item delivered on time, was as described.	1
These are cute and the instructions are relatively easy to follow on most although I would have preferred a little more concise verbiage when doing legs or multiple colors. I feel a mom should have edited the instructions to find the weak areas that would clearly be cause for pause for little ones trying this on their own. One weird part too is when you finally start to cut the yarn the instructions indicate something like "you might find the yarn falls to the middle when you are cutting...don't worry! it won't fall out" when in fact OH HECK YEAH its gonna fall out...unless you position your other hand to hold the middle of the donut appliance firmly to hold the shreds in place.  Not a step for young ones for sure. This kits realistically seems to make 4 solid color pups and perhaps one leftover mutt but you only get 3 noses (in my case.) Overally, my child loves it and while I love it less so since I'm actually the one stuck making them.....you do get cute doggies and its something that you will improve on with each dog you make.	1
It's a hit!  Love Klutz products.  Great company.	1
This is really a fun craft and fairly easy to do.  The kit includes everything you need to make cute puppies!	1
how cute	1
A nice craft - for my 6 year old would've been impossible for her to do on her own - but we enjoyed doing it together.	1
I loved it. I don't know if the gift recipient liked it or not since I never received a thank-you note. Oh well.	1
I bought this for my daughter and I to do together. She is five and a little young for some parts but we have had a great time making cute puppies. My only suggestion would be to buy a lot of extra super glue because the one that comes with it doesn't hold and you'll probably need extra yarn. One of my kits was missing eyes, noses and tongues but after a call to the manufacturer they sent me two entire replacements so I can't complain about that.	1
This was a gift for my niece, because she loves dogs.  There are a lot of great ideas.  I am going to add a few more supplies so that she can continue to add more.	1
I'm a mental health therapist that works with kids, many of whom have anger control issues. All kids love playing Uno and this is essentially Uno with anger control tips to learn along the way. Although I felt that 20.00 was a little expensive for a card game, it's gotten more than its fair share of use. It's great to start conversation with kids who just want to play a game and aren't super interested in talking. I even had one of my clients ask his mom to buy the game so they could play at home. My one complaint is that the cards are very big! It's hard for a lot of my kids to actually hold the cards since they're like supersized playing cards.	1
This game is basically UNO, but with fun "how to control emotions" suggestions on about half of the cards. It's a great way to have fun and relax with your kiddo and occasionally bring up anger-management ideas in a non-stressful way.	1
Clients enjoy it!  The card questions have brought up good discussions and insight.	1
Wonderful tool for use when working with children with anger management symptoms/diagnoses.	1
I'm a child therapist, and I love this game. Engaging, fun, and simple to play.	1
A little expensive, but a helpful therapy tool for working with the younger kids.  It plays just like Uno and has questions on half the cards, which is more than enough.  I'm satisfied with this purchase.	1
It's ok. But loses it's luster quickly.	1
I really like this game, it helps kids recognize anger and talk about difficult emotions.	1
The game is basically Uno with discussion cues on some of the cards. It can take a long time for someone to win the game too...  Our daughter has been having anxiety and getting angry easily lately. We noticed she's been going to the red zone of anger so quickly that there isn't time to calm down and talk through what's been upsetting her. Even after she calmed down she didn't want to talk about it. The day Mad Dragon arrived, we all sat down and played it before bed. She started opening up about all the things that have been bothering her and we get to tell her about similar instances when we were growing up. We love that it also reminds her about ways to keep calm and why it's better than getting angry. Once in a while she'll tell us how she didn't get mad at school like the Mad Dragon! She asks to play it every night- so she clearly enjoys the game.	1
Good game--like Uno but with meaningful (therapy) content.	1
Good game for helping kids deal with anger.  I'm using both one on one and in group therapy.  I think the price is high for a card game, but the game itself is a helpful tool to teach anger management.	1
love it	1
kids LOVE this !	1
Good game for helping kids learn to control emotions.	1
This game is a hit with everyone whoever created this gold star! Not only is it fun it's also educational.	1
This game is more fun and easier to understand than I had anticipated. (Rules are basically the same as Uno) I thought I would have to 'sell it to my students in 1st/2nd grade Resource, but they really enjoyed it and everyone had an answer for the questions posed along the way. It also encouraged my better readers to help others and share examples when they needed help 'getting it'.  I would recommend to any resource/ SpEd teacher working with social skills or behavior modifications.	1
Really better than expected!  Thank you so much for your speedy professional service	1
I like this game for reinforcing previously learned anger management techniques. It will not stand only as the only thing that will teach children anger management skills but kids seem to have fun with it. And since it's played like Uno most are familiar with the rules already. I have used this for lower functioning adults as well.	1
Game is fun, but can be very long	1
This is working great and it arrived on time.	1
This is a good game to use even up into middle school.  The kids hardly know they are even doing more than playing the game.  The game can be slow or fast depending on how often you read the cards and do what they say.  It offers the opportunity to do a lot of processing about anger and think about potential situations where you may be dealing with anger and what you should do.  In a group, it leads to a lot of discussions.	1
My husband is a therapist and I came across these cards and suggested he give them a try in some of his sessions. I can't answer first hand since I'm not actually the one that uses them, but he said they really grasp the kids attention and makes his therapy sessions easier. He has group sessions with high school kids, and he said the kids that normally won't talk during his sessions really opened up with these cards. He is amazed at how well they work.	1
My kids love love love this game. Wonderful anger tools & self awareness of their anger as well. It's played like bingo with questions in the cards. I find it's great for my clients ages 6-12.	1
As described, very colorful. My kids like.	1
Very good therapy game. Also, because it's played like Uno, I play it with my 7 year old granddaughter, who thinks it's interesting.	1
I like them, but the kids get bored with all of the questions.  The secret is to do every third one.	1
Very popular game in my therapy work with kids! Love how they can relate it to playing traditional "UNO" game.	1
This is a favorite activity to use with children and their parents in my therapy office.	1
Its really UNO type game but anger control stuff...I don't like it due to younger children really don't respond well to anger management techniques...they do better with EXPECTATION management instead.  These are ok, but i wouldn't buy them again.	-1
I am a school social worker and I LOVE this game. My students also love it.  Great for elementary aged kids and some early Jr High also enjoy it	1
Great therapy tool!	1
I use this every so often with kids who could use help with anger.  They like it and see it as a fun game.	1
This is a fun card game for helping youth talk about anger and coping... played similar to UNO, some of the cards have questions which the players answer when they play the card.	1
My 12 year old son enjoyed the game - but it is hard convincing him to play. Time will tell if some of the excellent skills portrayed in this game transfer to real life.	1
This game is great!  It has lots of ideas to help kids control their anger and understand the potential consequences of their anger.  It plays like Uno but requires the kids to answer questions.  I use it in my counseling practice.  I wish there were more great games like this for kids.  They get to play a fun game and learn some valuable skills.	1
This was irresistible because my granddaughter loves this pigeon. It was fairly pricey for what it is, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and buy the toy.	1
The grandkids favorite book. We read it every visit.	1
My 4 year old loves this series. I wish it was a priced a little lower though.	1
This is a bit smaller than I'd like. It's about the size of a beanie baby but not as floppy. My daughter loves it and it seems to be holding up well.	1
His leg came off within a month, but still a cute little thing.	1
We love Pigeon!	1
My kids love it. It is smaller than I imagined. I think it's a little overpriced for what you get. The 6" height includes the spindly, floppy pigeon legs, which I didn't realize. I assumed the 6" was just for the body.	1
l Recommended......It's a great plush toy for kid's or collection....	1
So adorable and perfect with the book!  Can't wait to gift this!	1
If I could give this egg zero stars I would. It is poorly made and rudiculously hard to open. What should be a tender moment spent with your children is a huge headache. I had to use a knife to open it and the knife literally broke off. That is how difficult it is. Horrible product. Dont buy.	-1
A beautiful story, wonderfully written.  A classic tradition for Easter.	1
great easter message in a world that is just full of easter bunnies!! Kids love it	1
The grands loved this book and nesting toy!	1
I was pleasantly surprised the quality of the eggs. They are durable and will be a valuable spiritual and educational tool for my grandchildren.	1
Larger than I expected and absolutely beautiful!  I will be using it this week with my students at school.  I know they will love it, and then I plan to enjoy it at home.  Thank you!  Beautifully made, and I appreciate the instructions about how to gently open it the first time.	1
I bought this for my 3 year old (and some of the pieces would be too small for any child under that age), and she loves it...but entertainingly, so did I and quite a few people at work (all of us 30+), as we had no self control and had to open it up and play with it for a little bit before I gave it to her (uh, to "test" it out).  It is a lot of fun to play with either on your own or with someone else - trying to architect the house together.  This one and the cupcake/bakery set are really both adorable - and my daughter has sustained an interest in both for a long time.  We've had the bakery one for over a year, and although we've lost many of the magnets, she returns to it all the time.  (I just bought this house one recently, but I assume it will be a similar fascination).  One thing I will say - having had the cupcake one for a while - the box did eventually dent, and with both of the sets, I've found it a little frustrating trying to get the cards out of the box (as they stick in there really well)... my daughter is actually better at removing them than I am (!!!), and I'll note the company who made it was very thoughtful in scalloping the bottom to make it easier.  The magnets are pretty strong.  I really do recommend this - especially to bring to restaurants or on a plane (or maybe for an older kid, the car - but I know we would lose the pieces if I gave it to my 3 year old while driving!).  This would be fun for both girls and boys.	1
This set is in a convenient box and has many many little detailed pieces. My 4 year old loves designing different types of houses! There are even great little pets that hang out in the windows and on the porches! My kiddo loves letting the pets roam around the yard and check out all the features she places, which leads me to think she'd really love more living creatures to inhabit these places. This would be a great travel toy because you can't play with it unless it's in the box. Everything sticks in there. The one gripe I have is that it looks like there are 4 different cards to play with, but there are only 2 cards front and back, and they all fit inside the box, so you can only really look at one at a time, 2 cards max if you spread it out on another magnetic surface like a fridge. Not a big deal, but just a little crowded when trying to play.	1
We have several different sets of these magnetic toys.  They are self contained--no small parts all over the floor, very portabke and giid for many	1
This is a very cute puzzle and I love the zipper bag for storage.  Our puzzles in boxes always seem to get destroyed and pieces get lost, but these bags make cleaning up and storage easier.	1
If your little one loves puzzles and this is in her age level, these pouch puzzles are the best thing I have found to take along. Flat, fairly small, light and uses a good amount of time to put together.	1
Again, a great price for a puzzle.  The best part is the carrying case.  You can take it with you without worrying about losing pieces.	1
A great puzzle for my 3.5 year old. I have bought a few of the puzzles in this series, and they are a great jigsaw starter puzzle. The pieces are easy to manipulate, and there aren't too many. It is easy for them to finish (with a bit of help). The pictures are vibrant (and non-commercial, which is a plus). The zippered pouches work well too.	1
Love the Mudpuppy pouch puzzles! My children keep up with the puzzle since there is a pouch. It's very easy to take along in a bag or backpack. Very good quality, will buy more.	1
LOVE these puzzles!!  This one is a gift but we have several and my now three year old loves them.  We've had one for just over a year and it has held up very well!	1
Great puzzle for a 3 year old. Pouch makes it easy to t a me on trips. Good for development.	1
i am a customer from china , today i had received this toy for my lovely girl . it is very nice and my taughter is very like it .	1
My daughter got these as a gift and she loves them. Shes one and will play with these on the fridge or dishwasher for 10-15 minutes. The design is very cute on them. Perfect size for little hands as well!	1
Love these magnets, they are adorable! Just a little pricey and not a good assortment of the alphabet; came with one of every letter but gave doubles of not most commonly used letters. Had to come back and by more sets to have all the letters I needed. Would still recommend these.	1
These are really cute and my two year old loves to see her named spelled on our fridge. It's a cute way to teach them the alphabet. They sell these at pottery barn kids too but are cheaper on amazon! If you are looking for cute letter magnets then these are them!	1
Even though my grandson is not ready to learn the alphabet, he loved moving them around on the fridge.  Someday soon that familiarity with the shapes will help him learn his letter names more quickly.	1
My daughter who is 22 months loves these...she plays with them for 20-30 minutes at a time which is huge. Be careful though, there are periods in there, so make sure to pick those out first .	1
These were smaller than I expected, but they are cute.  I ordered letters and animals.  I will have to wait until my daughter is a little older to use them.	1
Wonderful, beautiful letters!!  Added this as a second set, so we'd have enough letters for names, etc. Gorgeous and fun!!	1
These are great!	1
So cute!	1
Smaller than I expected but very cute and works well with steels.	1
My 9 month old daughter loves these. I put them on my dishwasher and she stands there and plays with them.  They are a very pretty soft pastel pattern which I love because they don't stand out as an eye sore.	1
great for my 5 yr old	1
I was hesitant to purchase these because some reviews said they were basically paper and fell apart easily. This was not the case with the magnets I received. They are really hard embossed wood/cardboard type material. My toddler has used these for a month, chewing on them, scattering them around the house, and they are still going strong. I'm really happy with these magnets and i will probably purchase the matching number too. Oh, and the colors are super cute!	1
Quality little swimming fish.	1
Love love love them, so much nicer than the traditional plastic letters.	1
Really cute & my daughter loves them. The quality is pretty good for what it is- some of the letters had some issues with the wood. Do wish it was laminated or something because I can see the top layer coming off after awhile.	1
These are super cute!!	1
Love these!	1
I absolutely love these letters, I bought 2 sets since the box only came with 40 letters and I needed more to spell out little messages on my daughter's magnetic board.  The colors are so sweet and girly!	1
I was looking for letters to accompany my daughter's wooden easel. I am not a fan of plastic toys and wanted to find magnetic letters that were more attractive than the cheap plastic ones I've seen everywhere. These were perfect. I ended up getting a set of uppercase and a set of lowercase. We've had them for over a year and they've stood up fine to my toddler's use.	1
Grandkids love solving these bright and colorful puzzles!	1
This puzzle was so much fun to do.  Really liked the vibrant colors.	1
Colorful, fun, modern jigsaw puzzle. We love jigsaw puzzles and nearly always hate the art. This is a chic, cool puzzle!	1
Loved working on this puzzle as colors were bright and liked melted areas.	1
Great puzzle and size, our 2 and 4 year olds love it.	1
So adorable. The kid loves it. Also bought one as a gift.	1
My toddler loves these puzzles!  This one has a lot of great animals for him to point out and it's colorful.	1
This little puppet goes perfectly with t he book Stellaluna.  My 4 month old granddaughter thought it was great (and delicious).	1
This puzzle went top a 3 year old boy.  He loved the size on the floor and enjoyed finding with his Mom's help, the pieces to create the total picture.  Very good quality	1
This is 54 cards; 6 shapes by 9 different colors.  I was hoping this set was going to include 2-D and 3-D shapes; was looking to expand my 2 year olds shape knowledge beyond the basic shapes.  All in all using these cards I was able to teach him to specify the color first.  Saying 'Red Circle' rather than 'Circle Red'.  Good buy was just hoping for something else.....	1
My kids love these cards and there are so many color/shape combinations that they don't become easily memorizable. Great purchase for the price!	1
Great product, but it is cardboard. Not as durable as I thought it would be, but it's portable because of it's small size. It works well, and serves its purpose.	1
perfect tool for learning how to tell time one on one with your child. straight forward, wipes easy, love that dry erase marker is included.	1
Has really helped with learning to tell time	1
This isn't a high price item but it is sturdy and really helps in teaching children how to tell time. It is also a great item to bring along when going to the Doctor since it is all together (not a bunch of little pieces that can get lost) and will keep them busy while waiting. The pen writes and wipes right off the board. The hands turn easily enough for little fingers but with use (I admit it was a lot of use) they do get a little floppy so if you hold the board up, the hands fall to the 6:30 or thereabouts. Even so, for the price, it can't be beat!	1
We really love the 1999 version. this version lacks the looks and feel of the 1999 version. It looks a bit cheap. As far as rules and game is concerned it is entertaining. I would still trade this in for a 1999 version.	-1
This is a business strategy game where the player has to decide when to buy into a company, represented tiles that turn-by-turn get spread across the playing board. Sound dry? Well, it is a little dry. But it does tell a pretty good story. It is fun to see a little startup company grow into a giant that gobbles up its rivals. There is also a neat mechanic at work where the game doesn't end until a player formally announces that the end conditions have been met, by either announcing that four companies are a set size of tiles, or one company has become too big.  I understand the rating is lower because previous versions of this had a higher quality of components. To me the component quality is alright for the $30 price tag, and overlooked in these complaints is the quality of the stock cards which are of good print. I honestly would not pay for a more expensive version of this game because while I enjoy playing it as a basic game of economics, there are a few problems. The tile draws can be quite random, there is no player elimination but a bad bet early on can eliminate a player from making meaningful plays due to him/her having his money tied up in a company that doesn't get bought out.  Overall, it's a pretty simple yet engaging little game that worth a buy at its $30 price tag. If you're interested in a startup sim with a stock element, then you really cannot go belly up with this purchase.	1
Perfect!	1
all good.	1
Awesome game, family loves playing this.  Get to see who the future capitalists will be in the family!	1
Let me get the bias out of the way first: my undergrad is in finance.  If you are a finance major, or interested in fiance, stop reading and buy this game immediately.  Background: Remake of the game from the 1960's by 3M of the same name. The object of the game is to profit by connecting two or more squares to form a hotel. If two (or more) hotels end up touching, they merge, with the larger hotel (the one with the most squares) acquiring the smaller one. Money is made by buying shares in hotels and having them grow. Bonuses are paid out to the majority and minority shareholders, and the process is repeated until the squares are all used, or no legal moves are left.  Great strategy game with a enough chance built in to frustrate the best-laid plans. (Invest in large hotels and be cash-poor, or invest in small hotels and hope for a pay-day--lots of ways to play).  Don't let words like finance, shareholders, stock, or merger scare you away. The game is so easy, my six year-old daughter is able to play (with help)--and do well! A great, original game. My friends (who aren't finance majors) love it.  Only four stars due to cardboard construction, and smooth board (which allows pieces to "meander"--your OCD friends may go nuts). The older versions of this game had a raised grid to keep pieces in place.	1
we still play it. people seem to be pretty polarized about this game. some people really like it and some people really don't.	1
Sid Sackson's classic has been on my shelf since the early 80's. Still is, but I had to pick up a second copy for our cabin! ;D	1
I bought this for my son.  He loves this game.	1
The classic Acquire doesn't get old, and it packs quite a punch for its price tag. It's a shame that Monopoly and Life have become synonymous with mainstream boardgames when this title was still around.  The newest version isn't the most preferred since some older prints had a different set of components that could lock in place, but ultimately it's the same game.	1
Well thought up game.  Challenging and satisfying.	1
Fun game. A little complicated, but fun once you understand how it works.	1
Love this game, makes you think, but not too much.  We have owned this game for years and purchased it for a friend because he liked it so much.	1
Buying and selling hotels sounds kind of boring on the surface.  But if you went for that knee jerk reaction, you would completely miss this fantastic game.  The game is simple to play, but requires a lot of hard decisions and some memory involved too. Now some people would complain that this game involves a lot of luck.  It can indeed trip you up.  Because you might get stuck and invested in a hotel chain that never goes down and you are broke for most of the game.  That does happen every now and then.  And it sucks when it does.  But don't let that turn you off to the game.  There is a lot of serious strategy going on here.  Since a person lays a tile down each turn, you need to buy stock in each hotel according to how soon you think it will go down. So if I love the game so much how come I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars?  Because this version of it is hands down weaker than the old version.  The older versions of the game came with a plastic board where you could snap the tiles into place.  This new version is a flat board that with one bump leads to it being messed up.  Ugh Still, this game is fantastic.  If you are a fan of Monopoly and want to branch out onto the next level, I recommend this classic game.	1
i love this game one of my favorite by fare	1
I don't know if Ive ever taken more delight realizing how the tiles available to me assured my victory.  I couldn't contain my maniacal laughter.  You see, I was the majority shareholder of the corporation that was poised to gobble up all the little people- all the corporations that the other players had invested their hopes of success and they were about to be heart-broken.  Notice though, the key to victory was that tiles were available to me.  I recently played again against a very capable friend and others- who were probably also capable- but the randomly drawn tiles he needed went to someone else who may have hoarded them in spite (I know I did some of that) and his power plays that would have propelled his ambitions were always pre-empted and spoiled.  While usually opposed to games that involve heavy elements of luck, I am apparently making an exception for this game perhaps for so shallow a reason as Ive been so often on the better side of luck.  That said, this game does involve a lot of card counting and positioning, even baiting other players, so frustration can be keen when your carefully laid plans flop.  It leads to a terribly tense game that will keep you from getting to sleep as your mind keeps spinning around what actions brought fruit and which did not.  This is how it works:  Game Play Youve got a board with plain-Jane grid of numbers and letters, and a stack of tiles for each square.  You randomly draw tiles and can place one each turn and buy up to 3 shares.  If- when you place a tile- you connect previously unconnected tiles you get to start a new corporation- and you get a share- for free!  You still get to buy three more.  Sometimes when you place a tile, you will connect two separate corporations, this triggers a merger where the smaller of the two- or if its a tie, the person to placed the merging tile gets to choose which corporation is bought out.  Now the person who holds the most shares gets a payout, and the person who holds the second largest gets a smaller payout.  Now you can do one of three things:   Trade your shares two for one into the new parent corporation   Sell your shares   Keep your shares in hopes that the corporation will be resurrected on the board later Shares get more expensive as corporations get larger and corporations can get large enough that they become safe and cannot be merged.  I hate to tell you what to do but While you can buy shares from any and all open corporations on the board, you would profit from focusing your effort on only three or four.  Because it is difficult to keep track- at least for me- of how many of each your opponents have purchased.  Its especially relieving when the other players are spending their money on shares of corporations you don't care about.  While some hotel chains are higher-rent than others, don't think that you can put all your eggs in one basket.  Even if you are at one time the majority stock holder in the ritziest corporation, you will quickly be bankrupt and others will be able to outspend and pass you.  Ignore participating in small corporations at your peril.  Players who get payouts get money.  Bankrupt is not a place you want to be in for very long in this game.  Theme Im especially pleased- as someone who cant afford to become even a minority share holder in a real corporation- to get sucked into the world where individual jobs don't exist to me (they are conveniently outside the scope of this game) when I consider merging companies because I need that gross severance for selling out so that I can uh create more jobs with a new corporation, yeah thats it.  Its not about me getting the most money at the end at all.  This teaches nothing about the harsh realities of capitalism, and gives me no insight whatsoever into the minds of corporate giants.  But I have to admit that I love it all the same.  Balance There are no catch up mechanisms in place in this game, so someone can run away with it, but its a game where you can always claw for second place.  That is, you're personal economy will never be destroyed beyond repair leaving you sitting watching everyone else at the table rejoice in spoils.  I find a lot of satisfaction being able to claw for second place myself.  This is because I, like you have the ability to synthesis happiness.  Interaction Interaction is high in this game.  Nothing inspires audible grumbling like someone overtaking your position as majority share holder.  And the table is abuzz when mergers happen.  Learning Curve Very low, The manual is very small.  The vast majority of the rules were explained above and they have a handy little lookup sheet which tells the share prices and payouts for each corporation and for what size.  Downtime While you do have to wait your turn while others take theirs, and you can annoy people by not paying attention to what others do and when its your turn suddenly the board has changed- youll likely lose because you spent too much money buying shares when no one was competing with you and youll have no one to blame but yourself.  This never happened to me mind you, but I have a friend that  Any downtime you take during this game will be at your expense.  Whats not to Like? The new edition that I bought is made a little cheaply.  The trays that hold the drawn tiles are cardboard that you put together- well I put mine together, not you.  Its not beautiful to look at, but whats gorgeous about corporate greed?  Dare I say the plainness is part of the theme?  That said, the share cards are easy on the eyes.  Collateral Endorsements It gets requested by my gaming groups and my wife, who hates Monopoly, loves the game.  I can get my 5 year old to play with me with some simplified rules- we don't deal with money.  Just grow and gobble corporations.	1
Hall of Fame board game. The game is easy to learn and fantastic for 3, 4 or 5 players. Games go very quickly.  This edition is a little cheap, but then that is the case for all games. If you like board games like Cataan, Axis and Allies, Risk, Monopoly or Scrabble, you'll probably really like this.	1
It's a fun game. A lot of strategy and every game is different so it has great replay value. It's a classic.	1
I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:  THEME The game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.  COMPONENTS This is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.  GAMEPLAY You have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central "bingo board."  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.  SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL? Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:  1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.  2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.  3) After a company gets so large, it becomes "safe" in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.  SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLY A few reasons:  1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.  2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.  3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.  4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is "safe."  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.  5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication ("I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?"), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).  6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.  FINAL THOUGHTS Acquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.	1
not that great a game. have only played like once or twice and don't even know where it is now.	-1
We were thrilled to find Acquire finally; my husband grew up loving this game. Ordered it for my brother.  The game requires strategy, planning, and never ends the same way.  It is a classic, must-have addition for any game closet.  It's a little more time intensive, and the board isn't as flashy as newer games, but hey -- it is exciting to play.  It's all about the acquisitions.	1
great game, not stale... kept us busy and entertained. No two games is ever the same... We enjoyed it for sure.	1
Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.  Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes  *Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.  Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.  Version & Components  The version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.  I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.  Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.  Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.  Game Mechanics  The game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.  In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.  When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.  Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.  1) The larger corporation acquires or "eats up" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered "safe."  2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.  3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.  - They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.  - They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.  - They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.  The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.  At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.  The Review  All three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.  I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming "safe" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.  It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.  Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.  The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.  I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.	1
A crappy cardboard ghost of the original.  Hard to believe they did this, but they did.  Shame on Hasbro.  Disgusting.	-1
Acquire may not be as old as Monopoly, but it is older than me and I can see why it's a classic.  Finally, an economic game that is far better than monopoly could ever hope to be!  I know a lot of people who have owned older versions are upset at the quality of the components compared to earlier versions and rightly so, but really, the game just rocks!  Buy this cheaper version to play, and then go buy an older expensive version to store in your closet, so you can be an Acquire snob saying you have version 19xx something:-)  Acquire is a game about investing in hotel chains and getting the most money in the end, similar to Monopoly, but that is about where the similarity ends.  The game does a wonderful job of creating the experience of investing in stock, simulating growth in value as the hotel chain grows, merging, and fighting to be primary stockholder for huge payouts on mergers.  The gameplay is brilliantly simple, but the strategy and decision making can go way deep!  It is done in such a way that the word elegance comes to mind. Even though there is luck involved in the way you draw tiles for this game, I at least get to choose where I want to move by placing a tile. Whereas in Monopoly, you have to move where the die tells you (roll 'n move) which aggravates me.  In this game you perform 3 simple actions: place a tile, buy up to three stocks, and then draw another tile. When I place a tile, I can decide if I want help grow a hotel chain(don't have to own it), create a hotel chain, or merge a hotel chain.  After that, I have to decide on which hotel chain on the board I want to buy stock.  This is where things get interesting, because you know that if you own the most stock in a hotel chain that gets gobbled up in a merger, you'll get some major moolah.  Of course the bigger the chain is when it gets gobbled, the bigger the payout is. So, you may finding yourself trying to weigh out when you should merge the hotel chain if someone doesn't do it first and whether or not you grow it.  Again, there's a risk involved, because if a hotel chain gets beyond 11 tiles, it is safe from acquisition.  If that happens and you're a major stockholder, then you'll keep growing that "safe" hotel chain for the big payout at the end of the game.  When mergers happen, you also have to decide if you should trade your stock in for the new hotel, sell your old stock, or keep it for when you decide to start the old chain back up again.  The game has a lot of subtle strategy as you try to weigh out how you grow a hotel chain or merge it, based on how much stock you own in it or how much someone else has invested in it.  Acquire is just a beautifully designed game and is a lot of fun to play.  This is a great way to teach your kids about investing in stock too!	1
Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended.	1
If you have never played, don't let the reviews turn you off. This is a wonderful, mind working game.  Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.  I personally have been waiting for a "flat"version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better "locking system" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.  So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.  Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).	1
Wrath of Ashardalon is a fun game.  If you like dungeon style board games that use cooperative play mechanics, then you'll really enjoy this.  Unlike many other games in the genre, this game is fully cooperative.  There's no solo player controlling the dungeon and the monsters.  Because of that however, there is going to be a bit of reading involved in any play session.  Players end up controlling monsters on their turns as well as acting for their hero character.  The monsters however follow a set of instructions located on each of their cards, sort of like a simple AI computer program.  It works out fairly easily and is a lot of fun.  There's an adventure book which outlines the different scenarios for the game and it can combine with the other game(s) in the D&D Boardgame series for more play options.  There are many unpainted miniatures in the game along with a ton of cardboard chits.	1
Wrath of Ashardalon gets everything right for a dungeon crawl board game. I'll break down all of the great highlights:  Set-Up ------ You divide out cards and characters. You put a start tile down, then you're ready to go. Super easy and fast.  Rules ----- If you are familiar with playing Dungeons and Dragons, then you'll know that an encounter can often take more than an hour. Not so here.  The rules have been laid out to make encounters very brief. And you won't feel cheated. All of the rolls are with 20-sided dice. Damage is 1, 2 or 3 hit points. Almost everything has between 1-12 hit points. So creature die fast.  Each player adds more of a challenge. So if you solo, it's just as hard as with 5 people (more or less -- I think it's just a tad harder with more people). So as you add more people, their ability to play their role becomes crucial (fighters fight, clerics heal, wizards blast from afar, etc).  The rules roughly follow the 4.0 version of the Dungeons and Dragons rules. You have daily, utility and at-will powers. Swinging a sword is at-will, blasting something with a powerful fireball is daily.  You collect experience as you kill creatures. If you kill something with a roll of 20 and you have 5 experience points in monsters, then you can level up your character to gain more hit points, less chance of being hit and more powers.  Quests are found in a quest book that tells you how to set up the game and who the boss is. The end of most quests have a boss that will take a lot to kill.  Durability ---------- The game is very well made. The plastic is hard enough to not break after thorough use. The cardboard pieces are very dense and thick.  Our cards warped a little one a humid night, but it wasn't horrible.  Nerd-Factor ----------- This game had far less nerdness than regular D&D. But it also doesn't have some of the fun aspects of role-playing (like a long, emmersive and interactive storyline). You can feel safe to invite people over to play who are not Dungeons & Dragons addicts.  Minitaures ---------- All of the pieces are very detailed. Some look identical to the D&D 4.0 creatures and characters that are sold for the miniatures game. However, none of these pieces are painted. They are all one solid (or translucent) color.  Fun Factor ---------- Since the game has no need for a Dungeon Master or someone to play the enemy, everyone can enjoy playing on the same team. And you'll rarely have mathematical discussions of how to absolutely maximize every turn in order to survive (a common occurance in many other dungeon crawls, e.g. Descent:  Journey into the Darkness).  So, overall, it's just a good time with a bunch of friends. Win or lose, you'll enjoy the comraderie of tearing through baddies and collecting treasure.  Replayability ------------- The game offers tons of quests and there's practically in infinite number more online. You could also just make up your own quests. The randomization of encounter and treasure cards keeps things changing. And you can add more heroes, treasure cards, encounter cards and quests by purchasing Ravenloft or the coming Legends of Drizzt board game.  Overall ------- This is the best dungeon crawl game I've ever played. I find it difficult to imagine something working out better.  Admittedly, I enjoyed this game even more when I played with the cards from Ravenloft added into it. Some of the skills in this game don't synergize very well together, but they do with the Ravenloft game. I have a feeling that Wizards of the Coast did that on purpose.	1
Great games with awesome minis to compliment your collection	1
Lots of awesome miniatures and dungeon tiles included.  Very high quality.  I would like to get the other games in the series	1
A must have for beginning D&D players! My sons love using this as a stand alone and will be adding more to it.	1
I'm a huge fan of the traditional pen and paper style RPG'S but as an adult man is it hard to get a group together and make time to play. This is a great little (well... the box is far from small) intermediate. It lacks the story depth and such but it's fun, and fairly easy. Heck, my wife even likes playing it	1
Bought this because I wanted it. All these D&D games are great.	1
Great game, but very difficult to learn.  It took us two hours just to read through the manual, so like other reviews said, you have to be patient.  My son wanted this game, and he's 10.  I wasn't sure it would be good for him, but he's smart as a whip and helped the rest of the family figure it out!	1
We have collected all of the D&D board games, and this is among our favorites. Stand alone games can be a few hours or you can do campaign mode which can last several sessions, much like a standard D&D campaign. Highly recommend for groups who never seem to want to DM but still want to play. The minis can be painted or left plain. They are excellently detailed, as are the player cards and other components. There are so many components we ended up having to use ziploc bags to keep everything organized. Great addition to a group who doesn't mind long winded games like Risk. We did end up having to implement our own house rules for things like traps which can sometimes bring the game to a grinding hault. Groups who are used to house rules will have no problem adapting the game to fit their group dynamic.	1
Great Game	1
We have Drizzt and enjoy playing it. Even our younger kids are able to join in. (They are ages 7 & 5). We haven't cracked this one open yet (Father's Day gift), but expect nothing less than an amazing fun time.	1
Be careful ordering this. My disk 5 was corrupted and scan disk couldn't fix it! Had to get Wizards to send another, which they did right away.  Graphics: excellent VGA graphics. Make sure you have at least 8mb of ram, because when Ashardalon appears during the final chapter it WILL freeze up your system!  Sound: will not work. Have the latest SoundBlaster card. Can't get any help on this one.  Gameplay: as long as you got the system requirement you'll have a great time. Light dnd gameplay that certainly satisfies the itch, especially if you can't get your dnd group together. Much better game than Menzoberranzan	1
With tons of replay value, this tense, cooperative adventure has quickly became one of my favorite casual games. You would think that, without a DM, the pacing wouldn't flow, but the designers were clever in forcing you to keep exploring to avoid hazards and traps. You never know what could be slithering around the corner.  What I love is how customizable it is. Yes, you should follow the rules to a T, but you can also shuffle in pieces from other D&D board games like Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt. Doing so can create massive mazes of randomized monsters. If you're getting even more invested, create your own heroes and villains from scratch by rolling in Reaper or other mini figures. You also get a horde of miniature figurines that would otherwise cost $50 so the value is well worth it.  I only wish I'd found out about these games sooner.	1
I haven't actually played the game, I bought it just for the minis, so this review pertains to the minis only...  They are very nice, and you get a lot of them for the price: 1 red dragon 1 otyugh (big tentacle guy in back) 1 rage drake 1 gauth (like a small beholder) 3 bears 3 gibbering mouthers (blob monsters) 3 grell (brain monsters) 3 kobold warriors 1 larger kobold warrior 3 devil warriors 3 cultists 3 orc archers 3 orc warriors 1 orc shaman 3 duergar (dark dwarf) guards 1 duergar captain 3 snakes 1 female dwarf fighter 1 female elf paladin 1 male human cleric 1 male dragonborn wizard (could probably pass as female) 1 male half-orc rogue	1
The game isn't nearly as fun as D&D, but it has lots of items that can be added to your current D&D game.	1
Finally played it with my wife and kids. We had hours of fun. Took a bit to figure out the rules, but, seriously, and entire saturday afternoon and night dissapeared. Id want those hours back, but who cares, we were slaying grell and kobolds.	1
This is by far my favorite out of the D&D Board Games. Fun and easy to learn. I even got my family to play it with me.	1
VERY HARD TO WIN	1
Great! Thank you.	1
great figure booster for normal dnd haven't played the game yet.	1
This game is very fun and all of the materials in the game are nicely made. It isn't just cheap toys. I also loved the shipping, came very quickly.	1
I would have given it a 4 if my Cleric didn't fall into a pit on the first turn. I couldn't roll my way out of it... damn.	1
Great game if you like dungeon crawlers. My biggest complaint is that the rules are not very clear on many aspects especially monster movement and placement. Do these monsters walk right into our caltrops?! Of course they do there is nothing specially stating how they move. The game also could be a tad harder as we usually have little to no trouble beating it so I decided to include a picture were we were smashed into the ground by our enemies!	1
As a disclaimer, one of my villain cards came with a factory defect where the machine burned into it but that should be a rarity. As far as the rest, these are the BEST miniatures I've ever had. The Cave Bears are my wife's favorite, while I LOVE the Otyugh! The insane number of Orcs, Duergar, extra Kobolds and devils is frickin' AWESOME!!! Seriously, this is more well balanced with even more new game features that stand to be even better than the previous Castle Ravenloft game.	1
A simpler take on Dungeons and Dragons. No need for a DM, the game plays it out for you. Do you just want to dungeon crawl? Hack and slash your way to victory! Solo missions are available and this game can be mixed easily with other editions of the games! Tons of cards and miniatures. Worth every cent.	1
My husband and I have been playing RPGs since, yes, the late 70s. I stole my brother's Basic D&D set, when he left it on his shelf and didn't touch it for over six months. He never missed it. I state this to let the reader know that I do, indeed, have a hefty background in Dungeons and Dragons. My son just turned 11. He's been gaming with us since last summer, so he's getting the hang of this cooperative roleplaying thing. Last night, we sat down to play this, with our partner, so we were a group of 4. It took some head-scratching, and re-reviewing the rules, and on-the-spot house-rule-making, but we had a blast. We had a BLAST. We won the first scenario, but lost the second one (ran out of Surge markers). We'll be painting up the miniatures over the next few weeks, and definitely going into our Family Game Night rotation, with Talisman, Ticket to Ride, Risk, Monopoly, and Fluxx.	1
gave it four stars because of the total increase in difficulty, if you are just starting out with these boxes...get legend of DRIZZT, its easier to grasp. i combined this box with drizzt because i enjoyed the monsters as well as the very cool treasure cards!! however the encounter cards in this box are crazy ridiculous!	1
This was given as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. The game play is perfect for both advanced players of D&D and those who are just beginning. Gameplay can be incorporated with other game systems. The 'minis' are awesome and are capable to be utilized in other games. The cards and puzzle board pieces are sturdy and are of a good quality. Highly recommended.	1
Item arrived on time, packaged well, undamaged, no complaints of any kind with purchase.  I have enjoyed playing the other two D&D board games with my kids, I am sure we will enjoy adding this one to the mix.  I don't feel obligated to stick to every last detail of the official rules, the wonderful thing about D&D is the flexibility it gives you to streamline things as you see fit and add in other things for variety.	1
Great game having much fun with it.	1
Fun and Enjoyable.	1
good product and delivery times	1
In a nutshell, it is 4th edition DnD with tabletop miniatures and maps included.  it has the "core rules" incorporated for a board game edition of DnD and allows for mixing and matching between this game and the other two titles of this genre.  I have a few friends over  once in a while to play, and it's nice because we can geek out without having to go through all the headaches of keeping up with full blown DnD "stuff" (character sheets, and special rules, and new books, and edition changes, etc).  Not quite as much fun as I used to have playing first edition rules when I was a kid, but it fits the bill for what I need at this age.  This is by far my favorite of the 3 titles...  I think a game called dungeons and dragons should have you entering a dungeon and fighting a dragon.  This one DELIVERS and then some.	1
My son loves these games, this is his third one and the boys play for hours! I like the fact that it gets them off the computer and using their minds!	1
If you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons or other adventure/exploration games, you should definitely give WoA a try.  My two kids (13 & 15) and  I have not been able to stop playing since we got this.  The game requires no "Dungeon Master" and it pits you and your friends against the dungeon beasts.  Several scenarios can be chosen to launch the game, and these varying in difficulty and duration.  We found that the first two scenarios were more about learning the flow of the game, but things really got fun in the third scenario (first one that used the chamber tiles).  The game comes with predetermined heroes, from which each player chooses.  Each has unique abilities, with cards to remind you of the damage, healing or characteristic of abilities.  The dungeon is created from tiles that are randomly selected as the game progresses.  Each dungeon tile explored has either a random monster, random encounter, or both.  Monsters are "handled" by the player that drew them, but they come with an attack strategy.  While the monster cards are not that great to look at, they do give a fairly detailed attack strategy that allows the player to determine which hero the monster attacks or other actions a monster may do (ex. Kobolds love to go looking for help from their friends).  The monster and hero figures are high quality, but are unpainted.  If you desire to paint the figures, do some web searching and you will quickly find a vast community of gamers willing to help you.  My kids and I were ecstatic to find that our monsters from the Dungeon Command series were compatible with WoA.  Mixing our monster cards from Dungeon Command into the monster deck from WoA makes things even more challenging.  There's nothing more intimidating than revealing you chamber monsters and realizing you have to face an Ogre and a Dracolich, along with the baddies already in play.  I do have a few minor complaints.  The box is IMPRESSIVE and high quality.  The choice of heroes is a bit strange, and I wish they'd included male and female version of both.  The instructions manuals are printed on thin paper, and given the extremely high quality of the other components, they definitely should have made the manuals more durable.  The artwork on the monster cards is boring compared to those from the Dungeon Command series.  I wish they would have made the treasures that Increase Armor Class or Attack "stackable", so that they were easier to keep track of (as in Dungeon Command).  I may mark my cards along the bottom edge to serve this purpose.  Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).  Although there is no true character design, as the heroes are a predetermined group, with some imagination, there is no reason that you could not design your own hero cards.  Buy this game!	1
I bought the game expecting that if I didn't enjoy the game, it was still a good price for a box full of mini's to use with other games.  But the game if a riot to play.  It's a random draw system based around a few key structures to provide a point to each dungeon crawl.  You could play the same run over and over and it'd probably be a few hundred times before it came up exactly the same.  A sense of desperation, but still not to tough.  It can combine with Castle Ravenloft and The Legend of Drizzt board games, each a stand alone set as well as this one.  A lot of online game modifications if you ever get tired of the main rules.  A few rules to learn, then most of the rules are given on the cards that are used in play.  One nice feature, 1-5 players.  If combined with the other titles, you could potentially play 1-15 players, though that's a lot people for this type of game.  Each player is partially running the game and playing at the same time.  The more players, the more monsters and traps and such, so it scales nicely in difficulty with however many players you have.  The mini's are unpainted, but still really nice looking.	1
I got this for my nephews because all they do is play video games.  This is something a little more social and creative than shooting people in the head over and over again.	1
Probably the best of the three D&D board games (Ravenloft, Ashardalon, Drizzt).  The game itself is a big box of stuff (miniatures, maps tile, game pieces, rulebooks), so its a lot of fun to open.  The quality of everything is VERY good, so this game is going to last a long time.  Very replayable, and even supports playing solitaire (for those nights when everyone is out of town).	1
Once I opened the box and unpacked everything I was ecstatic. The tiles are nice and thick so they should hold up well to countless replays. The mini's are great and as far as I can tell, it's all compatible with the RPG game. I foresee me running encounters and campaigns using the components from all 3 boxes. Great buy.	1
This is in my opinion the best dungeon crawler out there. It can be setup, played and tore down all in under 2 hours. It makes a fun ride, and is fun with your kids too (mine are 5 and 7).	1
With this set, I now own all three D&D adventure system products,  (WOA, Castle Ravenloft, Legend of Drizzt) as well as two Dungeon Command sets. I first bought Legend of Drizzt (easiest of the three) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp. Castle Ravenloft is brutal, a meatgrinder. WOA takes the middle ground, for the most part. There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time. If you are playing two-player or solo, this will wear you down. One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters. Sounds simple, right? It would be simple, except that Ashardalon's card is in that deck, too. EVERY time we play this scenario, Ashardalon's card shows up late in the game, usually when the healing surges are already used up. Still, this game is quite a bit easier than Castle Ravenloft, tougher than Legend of Drizzt.  AS with all of these Adventure series boardgames, the miniatures are the cheapest RPG miniatures you will find. The dungeon floor tiles are nice and can also be used to generate random dungeons for tabletop AD&D. Also, the Dungeon Command game sets can be integrated into these adventure series games. Simply take the cards provided, shuffle them into your game monster deck. BAM! New monsters to torment you. (With painted miniatures) I take Two different Dungeon Command card sets, shuffle one of them into these games to add an extra flavor to the game. For example, shuffle Blood of Gruumsh into WOA to fight a lot of Orcs and their homies. The game will have a decidedly Orc-centric flavor. Shuffle Tyranny of Goblins into Legend of Drizzt, for a strong goblin aroma.  Buy any or all of these Adventure System games, they are simple, fast-playing, co-op (mostly) and above all, FUN!	1
I own this and Castle Ravenloft, which are the two I would always put together. WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it's difficulty is average (unlike CR which is cruel) and the heroes are good. These D&D games are so much fun because it truly is a "system" of sorts. You will end up having a ton of little figurines (sadly not painted the way some other games have them, but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense!), a bajillion little tokens, and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook, along with a really good collection of scenarios to play (a lot of 'em!).  This game, when you have the 1-2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends, just plays so well with the whole group. It's truly cooperative, every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun.  I do suggest that if you buy this game, play it for a bit w/ the base rules, and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it "a bit mechanically repetitive" then pause, go to boardgamegeek and find the variants (one I published in fact) that allow for an "Initiative" system - it will change everything and you'll be back to enjoy this game in no time!  Absolutely worth every penny when it is ~ $40.	1
I bought this game as a cheap introduction to what D&D world would be, and to introduce my GF and some friends to a boardgame with a  little more RPG Elements than just rolling dice and killing stuff, the game was a real success the gameplay is easy to learn and the game may seem to be very straight forward but it will depends of the people playing it how fun can it be  I really recommend it, I'm 100% buying the other 2 games	1
I haven't played any type of Dungeons and Dragons games since I was a boy. With work and family duties it would be hard to find the time to play in a real D&D group, so I decide to do the next best thing and pick up this cooperative D&D board game, so I can play myself or with my family.  First off this is not close to the book version of D&D that I used to play years ago, it's a simplify board game version, your character can only level up to two, and go on short adventures.  The board game has many cards, tokens, figures and tiles.  So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands like getting into stuff. You get an easy to follow user hand book and an adventure book.  Gameplay can take over an hour plus, it all depends on how many players you have and what adventure you are playing.  This is pretty much a pure dungeon crawler so if you looking for something else like a storyline or true roleplaying this isn't the game for you. Many part of this dungeon crawler is random, like placing down the tiles and picking monster to fight, so difficulty depends on luck of the draw than anything else. Combat is very easy, just role a 20 sided dice and add any hit modifier to your role to hit, if the total is higher than the monster AC then you hit. You should be able to learn the rule after the first adventure. If you never played D&D games, this is a great place to start.  I would recommend around 3-4 players.	1
Hated this product.  Predictable.  Not fun.  It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.  Often times I thought "this seems like d&d battle....  Just kidding".  We never played it again after one play through.  Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.  F	-1
This game has grat mechanics. I think many get it expecting to have the kind of experience you have within the standard D&D RPG, but this IS a BOARD GAME! Albeit; the play is great, but there is just so much you can do with randomization. That's randomizing tiles, treasures, etc.  All these cards are not as awful as several people have said in negative comments. It uses actual 4th Edition D&D and it plays well for people who just want a casual night of gaming with family and/or friends. It's nothing extravagant but it will keep you in D&D without having to be a DM(Dungeon master). That is plus for me, since I have been a DM all of my life and never had others who could DM but once or twice.  So yea, if you love good boardgames that the family can enjoy or just to have a casual night of gaming, this is the game for you.  I would suggest watching Rodney Smith's "Watch it Played" series on this game which he has on Youtube.com You can see it taken out of the box, set up and played and make a more accurate decision on whether to buy it, it helped me a lot!  [...]	1
I had high hopes for this game, as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D (though if you like 3e, enjoy it! I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.  Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.  The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work. Extremely disappointing.	-1
The short, short, version: Wrath of Ashardalon is exactly what it says on the box--a D&D boardgame. If that seems too obvious to be worth stating, read on.  Like probably millions of other aging geeks, I have fond memories of loooong nights at the game table with friends in high school and college, roleplaying until our eyes bled. But now I have a real job and a family and I'd be lucky to get a group together monthly for half an evening. So I was pretty excited when I saw Wrath of Ashardalon, because I was hoping that it would deliver the sugar high of a good dungeon crawl without the prep work or running time of the RPGs I used to play.  Now, in its defense, the game does pretty well. The bits are very nice, the rules are mostly clear, and the DM-less play works okay. It's not perfect. Occasionally you may run into situations you have to house-rule. I'm okay with that, but YMMV.  This game is sort of the epitome of Ameritrash (and I say this fondly, as someone contemplating buying a 3rd version of Risk): loads of theme, loads of violence, and loads--LOADS--of randomness. I realize that's part and parcel here, but it really sucks to work your way into a great (or at least survivable) tactical position and then watch your carefully hoarded powers and hit points disappear in a flurry of bad rolls (come to think of it, that sucks in Risk, too).  One thing I did not expect is that the game can drag on for hours. Except for a few special powers, no-one can kill more than one monster per turn, but you often get one monster per turn. Several of the encounter cards grow the dungeon for you whether you want them to or not, which keeps adding monsters. Then there are sentry monsters, which can open up new areas and thereby bring more monsters into the game. More than once we've had to retreat to a narrow hallway, bottleneck the ghastlies, and just pray we could mow 'em down before we got Walls of Magma. But if you're careful, and a bit lucky, you can just barely stay alive by clever use of powers, especially if you have the cleric and the paladin in play to keep healing folks. Again, part and parcel--"stay alive until you just barely win (or just barely lose)" ought to be the definition of suspenseful, dungeon-crawly satisfaction. But in actual practice it feels more like, "stay alive until the dice finally kill you (or fail to)".  At which point you may think, "why am I playing this instead of an actual RPG? I could use all the same bits, do all the same stuff, take just as much time, and have more options and more fun?"  So, in the end, that's what I did. This game drove me back to roleplaying games, first by tricking me into feeling like I was playing one for a while, and then by grossly running over its stated duration of play on more than one occasion. WoA is just what it says on the tin, a boardgame rather than a roleplaying game, and it is certainly cleverly done and has high production values. I like it. But I don't love it.	1
Versatile and somewhat convenient, you will likely have to spend some time beforehand to set-up your dungeon scene or you may have some interruption to game play.  Still, I prefer them to dry erase at this point because I am terrible at drawing/sketching anything forget about to scale.  These tiles also work quite well with 25mm miniatures so I feel they are a great value since you can usually get them under $20 a box.	1
awesome set!	1
I DIG THIS! It's a shame that 5-6 years ago I wasn't running any RPGs. I probably would have had these tiles already. This set is very versatile and will really enhance my battle mats for my players. I'm glad they are still reasonably priced and I'll be getting the other 2 master sets I've found here on Amazon. The box they come in are even wilderness tiled so you can potentially have multi-leveled terrain. It also cuts down a bit on setting up a random or story encounter. I will usuallydraw out the battle maps on a large grid map before it happens, but now I'll be able to just drop terrain where I might need it.	1
Tons of tile selections and look great on the table.	1
Great tile set! I use them a lot in my games. Many pieces with endless dungeon making possibilities. You do wanna make sure to have a non slick surface under the tiles or them will move around. I flip one of my rubber game mats over and it works. Some times ill but a clear plastic board on top to hold everything in place. That's mainly if its a large dungeon and I want to have it all ready to go before my group comes over. Definitely worth the money to had a little color and visuals to your rpg game.	1
absolutely worth every penny	1
The tiles are just as i hoped they would be. The graphics are very nice and the board is sturdy and should hold up well.	1
before this I hated running any RPG campaign dealing with towns because it kills the momentum and just becomes 2 hours of haggling for magic items. This helps open up story ideas and plot hooks.	1
My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Dungeon Command games.  We now have all of the faction packs including this release, which is the newest.  It is definitely noteworthy that ALL of the miniatures included in this pack are completely NEW, not re-releases from the old D&D 3.5-era miniatures booster packs.  The previous Dungeon Command faction packs (Cormyr, Lolth, Goblins and Undead) all featured old miniatures, although many of those creatures have new color schemes.  To some tabletop RPG enthusiasts, the miniatures alone will be well worth buying this pack.  They are EXTREMELY well designed models with VERY nice paint.  We spent about 10 minutes marveling at the figures before we even thought about checking out their matching game cards.  Dungeon Command Veterans: The creatures/order cards from this pack add lots of fun new elements to gameplay and strategy and match well with any of the other faction packs.  In our first game, we pitted the Orcs of this set versus the Undead.  There seemed to be a very nice balance between the power of both factions, playing them right out of the box without customizing warbands.  Now that we have all of the faction packs, I think we'll probably start doing some customization.  If you are new to the Dungeon Command game, this is a very fun strategy board game / Trading card game hybrid where you essentially battle your army versus your opponents creatures until one warband proves victorious.  You draw cards in to your hand during your turn to bolster your creatures basic attacks/abilities.  The game takes about 2-3 minutes to set up, once you know how to play and a match can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on how serious you get (kind of like chess.)  One of the best things about Dungeon Command is that you can easily put it away/set it back up if you need to take a break in the middle of a game.  My boyfriend and I usually play an entire match in two sittings during the weekdays.  If you are in to the D&D world and/or role-playing, you can definitely add as much RP and dialogue as you'd like.  If RPing isn't your thing, don't worry-- there's no dice rolling or paper and pencil requirement for Dungeon  Command, just lay out the board, draw your hand and you're ready to play!	1
Great tiles	1
good set	1
Great start for any Wargamer looking for Orcs to add. and just perfect for everyone else looking for bad guy miniatures in general.	1
Satisfied!	1
Honestly, the game itself is not for me (it's a tactical game, and I prefer dungeon crawlers) but it is fun to play and it allows me to expand my DnD board games and my Descent: Journeys into the dark bard games.  Bonus... the minis are pre-painted, so one less step to be able to use them and the map tiles fit with descent and DnD.  OK game... better when used as a DnD or Descent expansion pack	1
I love this game and recommend it highly. Its easy enough to learn and has very clear rules and a cheat sheet that keeps the game flowing. One of the best things is that although each army is customizable most people just play the premade as they are well thought out and it really simplifies and speeds the game up because you do not have to go through the tedium of picking and trying to figure out synergy and which card works best with which. I just wish they would produce some more sets.	1
Note that my review is identical for the three packs we own.  This is another pack for the Dungeon Command skirmish battle system.  For the most fun and balanced battles, you should have a minimum of two of the Dungeon Command packs.  Don't buy two of the same pack though, because half of the fun is making the most of your army with all of their different skills and special attacks.  The game is easy to setup.  This game is more about proper usage of cards than it is about lucky dice rolls.  That is a good thing.  The cards are beautiful and the prepainted miniatures are fantastic.  Fans of Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, and Castle Ravenloft will recognize a few of the miniatures, as some of the molds have been "recycled" for this game.  My family has Lolth, Undeath, and Gruumsh, but usually only play one-on-one battles.  You can play up to four players, but you would need four, preferably different, Dungeon Command Packs.  As a bonus, the packs contain cards for each miniature, so that they can be used as monsters in Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, or Castle Ravenloft.  I really appreciated that extra option for using the miniatures.  The Gruumsh command pack is Orc themed and includes the deadly ogre.  I always hate facing this beast on the battlefield, because he is extremely lethal when combined with Vorpal Blade card.  YIKES!  My son owns this pack and battle my undead warriors.  It's always a good match!  As long as I can do enough damage to the Ogre before my Dracolith is killed, I usually prevail.  However, if his Ogre sticks around too long, the undead tend to go to their second graves!  The price on Amazon is fantastic.  Buy it!	1
I ordered this as a "what the heck" buy, since I've never had tiles before, I wasn't sure if I wanted to dive into them and the price was irresistible.  This tile set is an amazing set for the price (I got it for just over $12!). The tiles are extremely well printed on very heavy card stock (2mm thick). Just poring over them and looking at the details has got me thinking about how I can use them. Others here have given excellent descriptions as to what you're getting, so I'm not going to repeat them and my set came exactly as all the others described. I am very pleased with what I got. So far I'm having fun just playing around with layouts!	1
This a perfect must have set! It really helps my group better plane fights and helps add a lot of eye candy to your gaming.	1
Useful if you don't have a grid to draw on or if you want to add something to your grid.	1
I bought these because I play D&D and it's a great price for the minis. I'm very pleased with the quality of the minis. I haven't even played the Dungeon Command game yet, and I'm already satisfied with the quality of the minis for playing D&D. I'll write an update once I have a chance to play the Dungeon Command game to give a review of it too.	1
However, the game was actually in better shape than some I've ordered that came in boxes, as there was no damage whatsoever.  So possibly this is a good way to send games, but I was a bit puzzled by it when it arrived.  Either way, it worked this time, and the game arrived well within the expected time frame for delivery.	1
These just make the game come alive. Battles go much more quickly and smoothly. Very nicely designed, and a great way to give detail and depth to battles.	1
It floats!!!!	1
I use these all the time. They are perfect for creating your own dungeon or copying one that has already been published. I have not had a single time when I wished I had a new tile. I use this in combination with the Shattered Keeps Map Pack and I have run 3 quests using only these. They're great	1
This is easily one of the most usable tile sets i have purchased, its got a lot of heavy duty tiles and great artwork. Some of the pieces are a bit obscure and do not have the versatility while others can be fit into many situations. I would recommend it to any DM/GM (screw you wizards and copy writing that term).	1
I have recently gotten my sons involved in D&D.  As a newly minted Dungeon Master with a full time job, it's tough to be able to construct new maps/locations for our quests.  This allows me to toss together many different scenes in a little amount of time.  Each tile is mad of sturdy cardboard with semi-gloss printing, much like a cardboard puzzle.  They are two-sided, so one side might be a road, the other a grassy knoll.  I could see having a few more of these for larger campaigns.	1
Lots to like here, Good variety, outstanding artwork, good heavy cardstock, You won't create massive dungeons, but the ones you lay out will be very nice. I recommend using this along with one or two of the smaller tile sets, maybe Caves of Carnage and Urban Underdark.	1
makes map making easier when creating and adventure for your party. and is easy to set up.  and take down.  I would recommend it to any D&D fan	1
This is one of the most versaTILE (pun entirely intended) things that I have gotten as a DM.  The tiles can be used over and over in different combinations without seeming familiar.  There are a good variety of generic tiles that will not make a person think "Oh, I've seen that rock formation in the last encounter."  However, there are also some unique tiles that give players a sense of importance when they see it.  With the right settings and plot, you could run an entire campaign with just this kit.  It should be noted, however, that this works great in conjunction with the other Master Sets (I personally use the dungeon set as well) to expand your settings.	1
Excellent set of tiles with a good variety of rooms and hallways. A little skimpy on "furniture" and dungeon dressing, IMO, but for the price I'm satisfied.	1
Pros:  Durable, attractive, useful for almost any constructed dungeon (not caves), can be built into semi-3D structures by putting books under them etc.  Great value!  Box is two big tiles!  Cons:  Take longer to set up than drawing out a map on a Chessex battlemat.  That's my only complaint.	1
We set our campagin in the Woods so these worked well. We use them for other settings too, just have to use some imagination.	1
They are what they are supposed to be. The cardboard is rugged the artwork is good and they get the job done. All in all a good product.	1
If you want something other than a large battlemat, this set of tiles is a good starting spot for a DM.  Problem is 80% of the pre-printed modules you have will not use the majority of the tiles in here, and you will need 2 for most dungeons of descent size. Still if you are looking for a way to laydown a map instead of drawing it, you can't go too wrong here.	1
I was not a huge 4th Edition D&D game fan when it came out.  That confession done, Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro have won me over with their fantastic gaming props.  The entire set of essential tiles are fantastic!  The quality is top-notch.  The tiles are two-sided, and each of the sets contains numerous add-ons that allow nearly endless varieties of terrain for encounters.  Since all of the tiles are done with symetric, equal squares for the grid, everyone of the sets is geomorphic.  You can use the wilderness set with the city set to create a park in a city.  You can use the dungeon set with the wilderness set to create a gothic, evil clearing.  The only limit is your imagination.  Truth be told, I use this tile set with all of my fantasy role-playing table-top games.  For the price, it would be hard to imagine a better deal.  Well done Hasbro!  In service,  Rich [...]	1
Just got my box in the mail. This set contains over a dozen thick card-stock dungeon tiles and rooms for the D&D4 game. Some are reprints of previous dungeon tiles but no matter, this is meant to be a core-set. If you are new to D&D 4 then you should pick this up, it has enough tiles for a modest sized dungeon crawl game. I'll probably pick up a second box set to expand my tile sets. What is excellent about this set is that the box itself is a large sized dungeon room (both lid and box). While I still use a battlemat this is great for adding more atmosphere for specific dungeon encounters. Wizards D&D are really putting out good quality products with this Essentials line. While touted for D&D this set could easily be used for other fantasy RPG games like Warhammer or Pathfinder too.	1
Lords of Waterdeep is by far one of my favorite board games. It's a worker placement type game, that is great for 2-5 players. This game is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, and while knowledge of the history is nice in that it would will let you recognize more of the land marks, it is not at all necessary to enjoy the game. I've played lots of worker placement games, and this remains one of my favorites as it's a solid middle ground, between rules heavy, and rules light. I highly recommend this board game.	1
My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests, intrigue, and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords, the new game play is fun!	1
Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.  This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.  Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from "analysis paralysis" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.  Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.  If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.  Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!  UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.  UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.	1
Fun expansion. Adds a lot to the game.	1
Great expansion to Lords of Waterdeep.  This expansion adds three different levels of play so you get a lot out of it.	1
Awesome worker placement game.	1
If you love Lords of Waterdeep, you MUST have this.	1
This is an AMAZING add on.  The first time I played Lords of Waterdeep, we played with this, so I thought the skulls and different things were all part of the game.  I was actually a bit disappointed when I played again and it wasn't part of the game.  Lords of Waterdeep is my favorite board game, and this just makes it all the better!	1
If you love Lords of Waterdeep, you will probably love this expansion.  Lords of Waterdeep is easily in my top 5 favorite games.  The base game plays very well and I will happily play it once or twice a week and don't get tired of it.  In other words - you don't *need* this expansion to enjoy the base game.  (Which bodes well for the game, but not necessarily the expansion.)  So why did I get the expansion?  I mainly got this because I wanted to add in the option to play with a 6th player.  When my sister and her sons come over to play, we're sometimes in the 6 player range and it's unfortunate to make anyone sit out.  Scoundrels of Skullport adds a 6th player as well as two new modules to the game.  You are required (per the rules) to use at least one module any time you are playing with 6 players.  If you're playing with new players, this is easily done by using the Undermountain module.  It adds 3 new buildings to assign your agent to without adding a ton of extra complexity.  There are new buildings, Lord cards, quests, and intrigue cards - but you can simply tack on the extra board and forego all of those.  If you want to use the cards/buildings that come with Undermountain, there will be nothing unfamiliar.  It introduces no new complexities other than some quests which require a ton of "resources" for a huge payoff in VP.  This may seem overpowered - but the sheer fact that you're doing those quests means you'll be doing less overall quests.  It really does balance out just as well as the big 25 point quests balanced in the base game.  If you want to add complexity to your game, add the Skullport module.  It introduces a new resource - Corruption.  It, too, comes with new cards and a couple of new boards to sit beside the main board.  I haven't played with this one yet, but definitely think it will add fun dynamics for when we want a slightly heavier 2-3p game.  I won't introduce it to new players until they've played the base game a few times, but at that point I think it could work with 5-6p too.	1
Adds so much more of the best parts of waterdeep to the game, and turns the 2d chess game of quest completion into a 3d game of corruption and deciet!	1
Got this for a friend to go with the first one.  I can't say enough good things about this addition.  It adds a whole new level of challenge and complexity to its companion.  It's a must buy!	1
Makes an awesome game even better, and opens up more space for a sixth player to join in.	1
Love the expansion of skulls and more abundant spaces to put my "agents" on.	1
Must have expansion	1
Scoundrels of Skullport is a double expansion where one or both parts can be added to the base game to add more worker placement spots.  My group always plays w/ both. Pros: -New boards w/ more worker placement areas. -New Lords, buildings, quests, etc. -New twist w/ "corruption".  Cons: -Set up and break down of the game is a chore.  For best balance, when playing w/ both expansions, some of the cards are removed from the game.  This means everything has to be sorted before the correct number of random cards can be removed.  You could get around this if you picked your least favorite of these to leave out permanently, but otherwise, these are supposed to be random. -The Xanathar Lord sucks.  He seems to be a bit handicapped.	1
This is great if you want to play with 5-6 people as it opens up the game more.  Skullport makes the game a bit more confusing, and our playing group usually doesn't play it.  But we love Undermountain.  Big thumbs up from our group!	1
Good job.	1
Fantastic game! good strategy and lots of fun.	1
thx	1
Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport is an expansion for the original Lords of Waterdeep and requires the base set to play. The game was designed by Chris Dupuis, Peter Lee and Rodney Thompson and it expands the core experience to support up to 6 players.  Scoundrels of Skullport is actually two separate expansions in a set, as represented by two new locations added to the game. One is The Undermountain that includes new spots for your Agents to use and a good number of Quest cards and Intrigue cards that really up the ante. Undermountain is a realm that offers great riches for warriors who are brave enough to risk all. Then there's the titular Skullport, which offers new ways to gain power quite quickly but at the cost of corruption.  Skullport is the module that has the most obvious impact to the game given the introduction of the blue skull-shaped tokens called Corruption counters. Skullport-related effects tend to give you a lot of benefits (i.e. a spot that gives 2 adventures of any type) but at the cost of a Corruption token added to your tavern. Corruption counters count as penalty points at the end of the game and the more Corruption people give into, the more penalty points all players with such counters will have to deal with at the end of the game. Skullport-related locations. Quest Cards and Intrique Cards are designed to tempt you with great rewards in exchange for adding Corruption. And once the board is without Corruption counters, future Corruption penalties mean an instant 10 point deduction from that player's score.  Undermountain really shines in terms of the many quests that it adds into the mix of things with rather challenging requirements but also significant rewards. The quests include those that require a good number of adventurers but the card can also allow for players to use any types of adventurers to complete the quest. Of course there are additional requirements that trigger depending on the sorts of adventurers you send into the mix. And there are some card and building effects that allow you to seed the board with various rewards like adventurers or money in order to entire players to go to that spot.  What I really appreciate about Undermountain is the space it adds that allows a player to draw a quest from Cliffwatch Inn, then play an Intrigue Card. And we all know that Waterdeep Harbor used to have the virtual monopoly when it comes to playing Intrigue Cards. It's a tempting offer that allows one to further advance his goals, but without the benefit of the second action that players get from Waterdeep Harbor.  When you put the two sets together, it makes for a far more challenging Lords of Waterdeep game, especially when you max out the game at 6 players. Gameplay does get a little long at this point and it does require a bit of a commitment to see things through. But it's still not crazy long enough to consume your entire game night with just a single game.  I also liked how they tried to vary the sorts of Lord cards in the game. The original mix was mostly an effort to create every single possible combination of Quest Types per Lord apart from the "builder" as she's called in gaming circles. This time one can get points for completing quests of a particular expansion or even get a smaller penalty from corruption tokens in your tavern. Of course how things play out is a completely different story especially with cards that even allow you to reveal your Lord card early in exchange for protection from future Intrigue effects.  Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport adds an interesting new set of rules to the core game that should keep things pretty interesting. Not everyone will want to play with both expansion modules at the same time, I expect, but the flexibility of the option certainly helps one tailor things.	1
an Awesome Tabletop game, great for intrigue and a little sabotage of the other players	1
It took everything that made the original Lords of Waterdeep awesome and improved upon it.  The quests, intrigue, buildings, all the new component simply adds to the depth of the game without complicating it.  This is by far my wife and my favorite game and expansion.	1
My favorite game made better!	1
This expansion makes a great game perfect.	1
This expansion allows you to add players to Lords of Waterdeep. It's our favorite game with groups of 3-5. It adds an additional character, buildings and a few new elements of game play.	1
One of the best expansions ever!  Well worth getting.  I will not play the base game without this expansion.  Get it now	1
Bought it as a Christmas gift	1
my full video review - http://www.gameboygeek.com/#!scoundrels-of-skullport/c202a	1
One of the best and frankly necessary add on's. If you like waterdeep you need this, its a perfect expansion non-convoluted adds a great deal and well designed.	1
Outstanding	1
Love it	1
Everything was as promised.  Thanks!	1
Great addition to the game!  The expansion is actually two expansions in one and allows for 6 players.  I feel that in order to play both expansions at the same time 5 or 6 is the number to play with or the buildings don't really come into play.  The new spaces are quite powerful but do come with some drawbacks to discourage players from using them exclusively.  I lost 81 points the first time I played this expansion, be warned.  The dividers for the pieces isn't as robust as the original and in fact mine came broken.  The color of the cards is slightly different on the back, not too different that they would be noticed from a distance.  The Lords for the expansion are very difficult to get the bonus points with.  Pros: Extra player new spaces leading to new strategies  Cons: Inferior dividers for storage	1
This is a must have expansion. The boon of euro style games has brought expansions to base games to the US. Many expansions really aren't that necessary but this is one that really adds a lot of variation to your game play. The base game is fairly basic and is a great entry level worker placement game. With this expansion you add several new gaming elements into the game and make it more of an intermediate game. I highly recommend it.	1
Lords of Waterdeep is an awesome game and so are the two expansions included in Scoundrels of Skullport.  While I think that the game becomes 'crowded' when trying to use both expansions at the same time, they are great additions whether used separately or together.  The corruption influence adds a nice mechanic to the game that tends to bite greedy players in the end.  The only minor issue that we have with the entire system has to deal with inadequate scoring and building tokens.  We regularly exceed 200 points before the end game (and >300 rarely) and have had several occasions where there were not enough building owner counters.  Neither are deterrents for such an excellent game however.	1
I'm usually quite skeptical of expansions. But, being a fanboy of the Lords of Waterdeep core game (it's one of the best games out there to be honest - if you like worker placement/euro style games) I kind of felt I "had" to buy the expansion. Guess what? You HAVE to buy this expansion. It's absolutely essential. It brings an intelligent and logical series of additional rules/mechanics that make an already good game, great. I never really felt anything was lacking from the core game in the sense that, "oh boy, this is only mildly playable but lacks a lot...guess an expansion will be coming soon..." Which is my main complaint about a lot of expansions (play Lord of the Rings:LCG to understand how a core game lacks key components to fully flesh it out). However, this expansion will make you wonder how you ever got along without it (it's that good - but doesn't feel like "a fix" to the core game). Buy it.	1
A great expansion to a very fun game	1
Adds a great dynamic to the base game.	1
Amazing expansion to Lords of Waterdeep. I love the bigger reward missions, but the best part of the expansion is undoubtedly the addition of corruption. Must have expansion.	1
A must-have for fans of the base game, Lords of Waterdeep. This expansion comes with two "Modules", or ways to augment the base game. Each module comes with its own set of buildings, intrigue cards, quests, and lords. There are symbols on the cards to distinguish between "Base Cards/Buildings", "Undermountain Cards/Buildings", and "Skullport Cards/Buildings". Players can choose to play with both modules as well.  The Undermountain module adds a mini-board which provides 3 new locations. The quests involved with Undermountain usually take more resources to complete, but the rewards are greater.  The Skullport module contains 2 mini-boards, one with new locations, and one corruption tracker. Corruption is a new resource with this module. It can help, but it can also hurt.  The expansion comes in a nice box (unlike the base game) and if you remove the insert and put everything in baggies/containers, you can fit everything in the nice new sturdy box.	1
The base game is extremely fun and easy to learn, even to teach to non gamers. I usually don't include expansions when introducing a base game to someone new on a first playthrough, but with this game I absolutely make an exception. This expansion does SO much to enrich the already great experience of the base game, that I would say it is completely necessary to play with the main game. If you have never played lords of waterdeep, you need to, so go buy the main game now! If you have lords of waterdeep, then you probably already have this in your collection.	1
This is a very well designed and balanced set of expansions to the original Lords Of Waterdeep board game.  Highly recommended add-on for anyone that already has it (and to state the obvious, the base game is required).  This expansion expands the maximum number of players by one and also provides two actual expansions to the base game.  You can use one or both at the same time, however you prefer.  I recommend trying out each expansion separately before using them both at the same time, though.  Both expansions provide additional buildings upon which you can use your agents, most of which are good alternatives to buildings from the base game that tended to be in high demand.  They aren't exact duplicates, however, so there is some give and take as to which may be the best to make use of.  Overall, these lessen the impact that "blocked buildings" cause and lets you obtain some resources, especially in the early rounds, that might otherwise by more limited.  The second expansion, which we don't always use, also adds in a sort of "sell your soul" dynamic where the buildings provide resources as even greater rates than the base game buildings, but can potentially cost victory points at the end of game.  Both expansions provide new Lords, buildings, Intrigue and Quests cards, and additional agent tokens for not just the extra player, but each of the original colored player tokens.  As with the original board game, the molded plastic is designed to hold all of the items in a specific manner for well organized storage.  Again, I can't recommend this enough to those that have the original board game.	1
Yes Quick, wonderful and accurate	1
makes the game better	1
This expansion was fantastic. The new mechanics add a great new set of options to utilize during play and really made games alot closer, as you can utilize the new mechanics to make interesting plays and comebacks. Well worth it for existing players.	1
As expected	1
An excellent expansion to Lords of Waterdeep and most importantly it adds a sixth player option to the game.	1
I love these expansions. Undermountain contains many big epic quests with high rewards, and encourages generosity when it requires you to place pieces around the board.  Skullport is so lovingly tempting with its corruption. Allowing the big plays to come easy with just a small sidenote of a corruption, it can get out of hand depending on how badly you want some stuff.  The only downsides are the flipped backs of cards and the differences in card sizes. Not a dealbreaker, but I wish they would modify it match and it would just be more seamless in looking better together with the main game.  All in all, each expansion is fun and exciting.	1
Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well, as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion, Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game, adding more challenging but more rewarding quests, new lord cards, and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun, and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game, this is a must have expansion, and a great value for the price.	1
The Expansions (2 in this bundle), can be played individually or concurrently allowing players a wider range of options. The inclusion of corruption tokens on one expansion board increase agents advantage but reduce overall points means game scores can be a lot higher than with the base game. While the other is just a mix-up of standard board choices. Added buildings and lords add more variables to the game as well, and can bring new life into what might be getting to be a dull game if played too often. As with the base game, good strategy is needed to take most advantage of the added possibilities.	1
Me and my wife play Lords of Waterdeep more than any other game.  The expansions have only made it better.  We've enjoyed both expansions and then have played with both combined.  Playing with both at once with two people is crazy...it's hard to determine a solid strategy...but it's a lot of fun.  We are so looking forward to playing the expansions with larger groups of people.  I've played a lot of euro-type board games and this is my favorite.	1
LoW the base game has been the *most* popular and replayable board game. It's good enough to play /w 2 people or 5 people.  This expansion (which is really two expansions) makes EVERYTHING BETTER.  You get Skullport (new resource in the form of corruption/-points) and Undermountain (more intrigue, bigger quests) and new lords, intrigue, and buildings appropriate to the new mechanics. You also get a new color to add a new player.  We've primarily played Undermountain and it makes the game MUCH more forgiving when there's more players b/c it's harder to 'lock' a single player out of a key resource. My wife and mother in law don't like the idea of corruption (mom's a little religious/goody goody) so we haven't played it much, but based on reading through the buildings, cards, etc., it adds a lot more volatility to determining who wins in the end.  There's extra agents to play a 'long game' variant, which is nice (broke 200 points once o. O).  Some folks have mentioned issues with the first run (which I think i have). The quest cards are printed 'upside down' compared to the base game. Makes it easier to sort for us afterwards b/c we just sort based on orientation of the back of the card. There are icons on everything so you can easily see which expansion it belongs to.  There's a game mode that lets you play with both expansions, but then you remove cards and buildings from the original expansion, which can give you a lot of different synergies/combos compared to just playing with one expansion.  There are some really cool synergies/combos around certain quests, intrigue cards, and buildings. For example, mom completed a quest that allowed her to draw an intrigue card after she plays one and then there's another building that allows you to play multiple intrigue cards (I think 3) and another quest? I think that gives you victory points for intrigue cards. She literally couldn't use all the intrigue cards she accumulated, but it was pretty fun and cool since we had to change our strategy to try to prevent her from playing intrigue cards.  Finally, there's a intrigue card that allows you to 'steal' resources from an opponent, but then that player gets the intrigue card (so they can 'attack' you back later). The flavor text is: Cue Evil Laugh. So we made mom do an evil laugh everytime she used it, which is hilarious in and of itself.	1
This expansion pack is a great addition because not only do you get to play with 6 people now if you want you also get new quests that go up to 50 VP in value.  I would say it would be nice if the graphics on the cards were easier to distinguish for when you separate them back out, but that is a minor concern compared to the fun it adds.	1
This is a really fun expansion to the great Lords of the Water Deep game. I gave it 4 stars because it can get a bit boring after about 7-8 games.  But it does add to the play in different and fun ways.  I find the cards that came with it more entertaining then anything on the board.  the concept of skulls (and negative points) and derivatives of this is quite interesting particularly at first.  You can incorporate this in.  I will say though that if you are a savvy group of players you can learn to master this rather fast.	1
I have many of the new games that have come out. In fact, a whole wall top to bottom. Out of all those games, my family and friends have played this one more than many of the games we have. I really really love this game! It is my first pick when people come over to play and they ask what should they play. I recommend this game.	1
Big hit for my great nephew!  Fun playing with him every though every turn was "HIS" turn.... LOL	1
Purchased as a gift for my great nephew who is fascinated by equipment/trucks/tractors.  He just turned 3 and seemed to be excited by the gift at his party.  My grandson has enjoyed similar games, and the quality of this one and variety of matches is great and leaves "room to grow" mentally as children age since you can add or take away the numbers of cards/equipment you play with depending on the child's ability. .  Good quality and includes some unusual pieces beyond the typical bulldozer and dump trucks.  I would recommend.	1
Great memory game for boys who love construction.  My grandson (3 years) is a little to young to play the memory game yet, but he loves to look at the cards, sort them etc.  The game comes in a nice sturdy box and the cards are good quality too.  I play with with only with 10 card sets right now which is more than his ability.	1
Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game is a quality game that provides far more challenges than conventional matching games.  The pictures to be matched consist of various Cat trucks and diggers, as well as construction signs and equipment/tools used during heavy construction.  The Cat trucks and heavy equipment drawings may be somewhat confusing for those not specifically interested in construction machinery.  However, that was not the case for my grandson who is fascinated by machinery and heavy equipment.  He was thrilled with this matching game and regularly beats the adults in our family who are not as conversant with the subtle differences between various machines.  The particular trucks, diggers, signs or construction tools name is printed on each card of the pair.  The backs of the cards are printed in a black and yellow diagonal stripe design that makes remembering the locations of already revealed items even more difficult.  If you do not concentrate on remembering the position of previously revealed cards, the diagonal-stripe pattern can be even more distracting.  Most matching games feature a maximum of 48 cards (24 matches).  Those cards are flimsy and are not likely to survive childrens enthustic play.  Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game features 72 cards (36 matches); these cards are made of heavy card stock that is approximately 1/16 thick.  The number of matches you choose to use when playing this game can vary depending on the childs age and memory skills.  The box is also very sturdy; it closes using a magnetic flap rather than being a conventional two-piece unit.  Plastic dividers keep the cards organized inside the box.  I appreciate these details since they can add to the games durability.  The card division of Chronicle Books produces Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game.  That company produces a number of different-themed matching games; you should be able to find one that is of interest to your children.  If you are looking for a matching game, you should consider one of Chronicle Books games.  Amazons price is the best I have been able to find for these fine matching games.	1
I have a three year old son and 18 month daughter. Lots of different trucks, even some new ones for my son (which is saying a lot since he has at least 20+ different books about trucks). Cards are board and sturdy so my 18 month can handle them without causing damage. We have to start with 1/2 the pack as there are so many.	1
I was looking for a memory game for my 3 year old grandson and tripped across this.  I can't wait to play it with him on Christmas day. He loves earth moving vehicles. The game pieces are sturdy and the items are labeled-- which is great because I wouldn't want to confuse a backhoe with a front end loader!	1
My son is 2 so a little young for the full game. I pull out 10 or 15 o the tiles and we either play memory which some times he figures it out and other times he doesn't.. Which is to be expected. Or else we lay them face up and match that way. I also have him find certain tiles like where is the hard hat. This game is great for expanding their vocabulary! We talk about what each tile is and he repeats what it is. This game will last many many years and I love how many tiles it comes with. You really can make it a challenging game of memory by using all of the tiles. Great game!	1
Okay, I babysit young boys a lot and bring this along. They love to play it, it's sturdy and has a great box that doesn't collapse. I usually end up playing with about 24 to 30 pieces for the 4 year olds and IF I get to select I pick the items that aren't construction vehicles, like the cone, boots, stop sign, gloves etc. Too many kinds of excavators, shovels, rollers etc for me! But I guess it helps keep the peace since the kids almost always win!	1
They r better that I expect it,they r pretty big ,an very colorful,and we got then before my daughter's bday,she love them,thank u	1
They're nice, big, colorful stickers.  You don't get very many for the price, but it's hard to find Peppa stickers anywhere else.  Shipping took a few weeks as expected.	1
The stickers themselves are great.  The package comes with 5 sheets that I separated for goody bags.  However, each sheet is adhered to a thin piece of cardstock with double sided tape making it time consuming to take off.  If not careful you could easily rip the sheet of stickers while removing from packaging.  Removed a star simply because of the packaging; again the stickers themselves are great.	1
They are cute, but definitely not worth the $6 that I paid for them.	-1
Easter success	1
Excellent stickers.  My grand daughter loves Peppa Pig.	1
ok	1
very cute!	1
Even bigger than expected my kids and their friends love them	1
My daughter loves her stickers! Awesome seller! Thank You! :)	1
Neice and her birthday guests loved these.	1
This says it is 5 SHEETS when in fact it is 5 strips of paper.  Definately NOT worth the money.  The stickers were hard for the child to remove from the backing as the backing came off of the sheet with the sticker.	-1
Great version, 9th through 12th Doctor are there.	1
Great gift for our wedding party at our Dr. Who Themed wedding.  Everyone loved their gift!  Reasonably priced, and so much fun :-)	1
This is a great game for serious game people! Easy to play and quick to pick up!	1
Bought this to play with my 11-yr old Dr. Who fan. Style of play is similar to Pokemon but much easier to learn. Although it says it is for 2 or more players, in my opinion game play is much better with more than 2 players. We got stuck at times with only two of us playing, although  it was still enjoyable. Certainly all of the Dr. Who associations add to the fun for fans of the series.	1
My 12 year old daughter's favorite game. She is a fan of the show but you don't have to be a fan to play. We like the mechanics of passing cards you don't use to the another player which is an interesting dynamic. Great game	1
Oh this is just so fun for child and story teller.  I bought the paperback book, the old lady, and the bean bag animals.  I liked this story as a child and remember it making me laugh, and now I can read it to my 2 year old and laugh with her.  The doll is just like the book and her mouth is wide and stomach deep enough to fit all the bean bags.  The mouth is the only opening so you'll have to remove the animals through there as well.  Although I wish the doll had a velcro opening in her belly to remove the animals.  The bean bag animals aren't very creative, just a picture on a piece of cloth that's cut in near shape of the picture, filled with beans.  Overall I'm very happy and for me it was worth the expense, for everything it came out to $34.77	1
This is a very cute, well-made doll.  Just be advised that you need to purchase the animals (and book if you want that) separately.	1
Great product! My students loved it! Thank you!	1
So much fun!	1
It's a cute doll. I thought she would be bigger and that her "stomach " would be bigger too. It isn't easy to remove animals from the dolls' mouth.	-1
I bought this doll for my 4 year old boy and for my class as I am a preschool teacher. It is perfect! The children love it, you have to by the animals separately and also the book but this trio will last for years and it is always the favorite hands on story for preschoolers. I used to have one in my previous school but it belonged to the school so This time I bought my own set.	1
A good addition to my reading area.	1
love this doll and all the stuff she can stuff in her mouth! ha ha  We bought the book that has the image of this particular doll on the front of it and my 3 year old is just mezmerized by how the images match. As we read the story she picks out and stuffs the corresponding item into the lady's mouth, which just tickles her??! lol  The doll comes with every item in the story: fly, spider, bird, cat, etc... they do all fit and my daughter thinks it's fun to put these items in her mouth while counting and then take them out to make sure they are all still there.  It's a nice little before bed treat for us both.	1
Really cute doll, fairly good size too.  You have to buy the bean filled animals separately, Also bought book to go along with it.	1
this was perfect to go with the 7 bean bags , I just wish they were not separate orders.	1
I bought this, along with the 7 bean-filled animals that go with it, to go with the book that I bought for my sister-in-law's baby shower.  She loved getting one of my favorite childhood books along with the doll and animals to make it even more fun.  A unique gift that no one else thought of.  The packaging it came in could have been a little nicer since I was giving it as a gift, but it wasn't that big of a concern.	1
I love the old lady doll.  My granddaughter loves this story and with the book, the animals and the old lady, we will have lots of fun!  I would recommend this doll to anyone.	1
My grandsons have enjoyed this during their younger years. 3-4  Big pieces make it easy to play with for young hands.  Numbers are a an addl feature helping them learn the order up to twenty.	1
I am devasted!! Got this for Christmas for a grandchild just received it and the box it completely ripped in back!!! NOW what I am not rating for the puzzle but for the packaging! Will you replace it or send a new one..........	-1
I'm very pleased with this puzzle.  First each train car is 98% complete on each piece.  It leaves just a small part of the animal(s) "missing" which helps the child locate the next piece (for example, part of the 5th seal is missing on the #5 train car -- my nephew looked for the seal's face in order to find the #6 car as he doesn't yet recognize the numerals.  The pieces are thick and will last a long time.  The pictures are attractive without being too busy although the pics on the higher numbers are not placed for easy counting.	1
5 and 3 year old boys love this puzzle.  They do it on the floor several times and count the numbers.  It's cute, they also love trains so the perfect puzzle for them.	1
Great puzzle to help a little one learn their numbers! So helpful that each number is a separate piece. Highly recommended by this K/1 teacher!	1
The Alphabet Train was a big hit in our house, and useful for working with letters, so we got this one.  My kid hasn't picked up all the numbers yet, but so far its been fun.	1
My son loves to put this together and take it apart.  He loves that he can count the animals or objects on each car to see which one comes next.  Only downfall is that its really long and take up a lot of space.  We use on a wood floor, I imagine that it would be difficult to keep together on carpet.	1
Great for educating	1
My 5 year old loves playing with this!!	1
My daughter loves this toy. She makes all kinds of cool tings with it. Its good quality and has a nice heavy feel to it.	1
Creative gadget ! Purchased for our 19 year old son and he loves it.  He keeps it at his desk and will fidget with it every now and then.  Great quality, helpful booklet enclosed.  Highly recommend.	1
Great Christmas gift.  Fun for all.	1
hours of fun for the whole family.	1
Very fun.  The whole family loves this one.  Even my 3 year old can put it together and has learned all about magnets because of it.  My husband loved it as a stocking stuffer	1
Fine	1
Excellent toy.  Endless creativity potential.  Smart purchase for any age.  I mean, it's a ball made of trianguloid magnets.  You simply cannot go wrong.	1
This is a weird toy (is it a toy?) My child saw this somewhere and wanted it. Santa obliged him. Now the rest of the kids want one too. he magnetic ball can be taken apart and reassembled into different patterns. Surprisingly to me they have a fun time with it. There isn't much to it, but it is unique and still gets played with 6+ months later.	1
my 4 year old grandson loves making different things with it. A GREAT learning tool/toy for hands on puzzle solving.	1
A great creation tool. It helps me concentrate.	1
Liked it.	1
Entertaining	1
If you liked geometry than you might note that this Ball of Whacks is a rhombic triacontahedron . "This is a ball shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red."  Wiki  My grandson has always had an ability to see shapes and develop them into something original. He has always liked Legos and moved on to more difficult shapes and products to satisfy his artistic and scientific self. For his birthday, he asked for this Ball of Whacks. Well, this has turned into one of his more interesting projects. I think he needs another two or three. He has created such diverse objects as dinosaurs, animals, turtles, sun, stars, fruits, and more artistic objects he has his own names for.  To say he likes this Ball of Whacks is a misnomer. He brings it with him, the car, park, friends, wherever. Everyone who sees him with it wants one of their own. He really should get a percentage from the owner.  He tells me he is fascinated with the shapes, to see what he can build. He has the kind of mind that can explore any possibility.  The Ball of Whacks Is made up of 30 magnetic design blocks that can be taken apart and rearranged. There does not seem to be any end to the shapes you can make. Accompanying the Ball Of Whacks is a 96 page booklet. This gives you Ideas of what kind of shapes you can make, and how to open your mind. For creative people this is a windfall, and for us, regular folks, it can open our minds from the most concrete manner of thinking to go and explore the possibilities.

My second one, this one for my grandsons. I keep one in my office (I'm a therapist). It's very soothing and challenging at the same time.	1
This contraption is fantastic.  The book has some great ideas and such but my son loves to just take it all apart and make different shapes with it.  Each piece is outfitted with a positive or negative magnet so they don't all fit together but it's fun to get a few and mess around with.  It's been thrown on the floor just in an attempt to reassemble.  Truly a fun toy that keeps his hands entertained when he's thinking.	1
Excellent toy to simulate thought!	1
I decided that there was no way this would stay together if it were at home around my kids, even though one wanted to get it for another as a birthday present. I talked them into something else, and took this to work. They play with it when they are at the office with me, and I like it when I am on conference calls and things. I don't get a lot out of the book, but it is entertaining.	1
Bought this and the Y-ball for our grandson who likes mazes and puzzles.  He absolutely loved them!  Played with them "constantly" for the whole two days he stayed at our house.  At first enjoyed trying to build different designs with them but then got the most enjoyment out of rolling the balls across the floor and over and under objects and watching them crash and explode. Never seemed to tire in putting them back together.	1
Good product. You can construct a lot of shapes with this product. Good for educational purposes!! The only complain is the magnets are slightly weak.	1
Our family really enjoyed spending hours competing with each other with this toy. I couldn't imagine why they thought it was so fascinating because I don't do well with these kinds of things, but the others did. In fact, the larger, more expensive Christmas gifts were ignored quite a bit of the time because they couldn't stop playing with this.	1
The first thing anyone who sees this for the first time is going to say is "WHAT IS IT ?" You'll quickly come to the conclusion that's a question much easier to ask than to answer. I guess the answer really is,"It's what ever you want it to be."   I went to my Synonym Finder and here are just a few of the names I came up with. They are all names we have used,most aren't even in the dictionary,and any one of them could be used to describe this "thing". Doohickie,dojigger,gizmo,whachamacallit,thingumajig,flumadiddle,widget, thingumabob,are all pretty good names;but the inventor chooses to call it a "Ball Of Whacks";so I guess that's what it is.  The pictures and descriptions describe it as well as anything But what to do with it is the question. It comes with a small book of 96 pages that describes how and why Roger von Oech invented it and what you can do with it. He describes the very interesting mathematics that is the basis of the shapes of the pieces or "whacks".To mathematicians,the Golden Ratio,the 30 sided rhombic triacontahedron ,and such have always fascinated scientists and are found many places in art and nature,and in this ball.  The inventor also explains what great creative qualities can be found with the ball. The book shows the inventor with a young Buddist monk creating a sun sculpture. This ball will fascinate anyone who picks it up,be they young,old, inquisitive or simply someone who likes to hold,handle and play with things. As soon as one realizes that reassembling it is not nearly as difficult as one might imagine;then the creative juices start to flow and they try to see what they can form. The book gives a lot of sculptures or forms to make;but in no time ,one wants to try their own ideas.  My ball has all the same colored "Whacks",(red) ;but it comes in several colors and even in multi colors,where the various colors would add a whole other dimension to the creativeness of "Ball Of Whacks".This product is excellently made,will provide endless hours of enjoyment,relaxation and creativeness for anyone who picks it up.	1
I'm a tacto-phile, as well as a magno-phile, and this 'toy' is an excellent blend of creativity, simplicity and fun! The look and feel of the individual pyramids is very pleasant, and the fun of being able to take it apart and see what you can create is a blast! I wish I had two (or three!)  One word of warning to parents: Kids will want to play with this. I make it a point to never let my kids play with mine unless I am watching them closely, because the pieces would fit in a mouth, and are pointy enough that they could cause pain if applied incorrectly.	1
My kids love this toy.  There are so many ways to play with it -- the magnets add an extra dimension to the creativity.	1
This is just a fun, creative toy.  It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini "pyramid-like" pieces.  From here, you can use your imagination and create new objects (animals, stars, etc.).  It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together.  The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip.  However, overall this is a really cool toy.  Good for kids and adults.	1
Monopoly is fun, but it takes FOREVER to play, those trivia games are too hard for the kids, Dad can't even draw a stick figure, let alone play Pictionary, and you don't want to spend an hour just setting up an elaborate game and reading the instructions. So what's the solution?  Play QUIDDLER!!  Our family loves this game - you can complete a whole game in an hour or less (or you could stop half-way through and finish the game the next evening).  In Quiddler, you create words, but unlike Scrabble, it's not always the one with the best vocabulary who gets the most points.  You try to make words out of all your letters - there might be a long word which gets lots of points, but it might be little brother over there who is able to make several short words who gets the "most words" bonus and jumps ahead of everyone else! We played this game last night and were surprised how fast things change - someone who is way ahead after the 3rd round can be behind after the 4th.  Just one round can dramatically change things! Pick a dictionary and let that be your judge on whether or not something is a word.  Be sure to find the dictionary BEFORE you start playing because you'll need it! We've played this game with 4, 5, and 6 people.  Anywhere from 1 to 8 people can play -  now that's a versatile game! This is one game where a child isn't necessarily at a disadvantage when playing with adults. The cards are beautiful - be sure to take time during your fun family evening to notice them! After loving this game, I bought Set for Christmas and we're going to play this one tonight! ... .	1
This game is a lot of fun. My wife and I play with our 11 year old and despite my superior intellect (kidding), everyone has won a couple games. Beyond that, however, these cards can be used for literacy-building and team-building games in the classroom! You get 118 cards with individual letters or common two-letter combinations (QU, IN, ER, TH & CL) with a point value reflecting its use in English words. Ive come up with three other ways to use this deck and I hope to have more to share with my AVID teachers!	1
Scrabble in a card game!	1
Fun Family Game!	1
good product	1
Prompt service, and a great product.	1
This is a GREAT game for 2 players or more.  I ordered it, because I played it and loved it at a friend's house.  If you like Scrabble, you'll like this game!	1
This game is a lot of fun and the price was amazing.  I've seen the same game in stores with a little fancier packaging for three times the price.  Great deal	1
Good quality cards. Very fun game. Great for all ages over about 8. We play without scoring with kids, and it's pretty cut throat for the adult scrabble and boggle fanatics. Really love this game and we play it as a family about 2-3 times each week - probably 10 times as much as all our other games. Highly recommend of you like words, spelling, and the strategy of points.	1
Goes good with the game.	1
I love word games, and this is one of my favorites.  It's easy to play with people of all ages!	1
A very nice...and useful book...for making Quiddler an even more educational card game than it already was...	1
super for playing quiddler!	1
fun game	1
Great game for new spellers or struggling ones to build up confidence. Great game for mixed ages. Love it. We bought the original first and it was too hard, then saw this and tried it and the kids love it. All their games are amazing!	1
good	1
Great family game. Good for a fun night together.  Got this for my Scrabble loving brother. He loves this even more.	1
This is such a fun game!	1
My wife and I love this game, which lasts about 20 minutes to a half hour, and isn't as concentration-intensive or as long in duration as Scrabble. The rules are easy to pick up, and it's a fun game for those who love words. If you're not a good speller, pass this one up.	1
this is a great game for kids. the adults enjoyed it too!	1
Fun game.  You can make it quick and easy for younger children or make it more complex for older children and adults.	1
Nice easy game, fun for all	1
Love playing Quiddler and this dictionary helps with the words!  A little different to use but had two dictionaries going at last card party.  I bought 2 more as gifts as we are all Quiddler players.	1
not as much fun as I had hoped	-1
Gift	1
good fun. makes you think	1
Gift	1
Delighted to have this game, which we have enjoyed playing with friends.	1
I bought this for my sixth grade class. They love it! Is a fun family game for kids around 8 up to adults. Similar to Gin Rummy but with letters instead of suits. Bigger words = more points.	1
bought for my grandson who really loves to play this game	1
Our family absolutely love this game! We play it one on one or as a family, sometimes with extended family as well (aunts, grandparents) and everyone love it! Your goal is to create words from your letter cards. Each card is worth a different amount of points and you try to create words that worth the most points. You write down the score of each player and add it at the end to see who won by getting the highest amount of points. It's easy to understand the rules, so you can get in the game quickly even if it's the first time you're playing it. The game can be as short or as long as you want and the kids (and some adults too) learn a lot of new words from it. Very enjoyable and highly recommended from ages 8 and up.	1
This has been a really fun family game!  We all enjoy word games.  This is light enough you can keep the TV on in the background, and chat when not playing, but requires thought and planning - and then some luck!  It doesn't take too long either - you can do a quick round and move on to other things if you like.	1
Fantastic game!	1
Love this game. It's a family favorite. Bought 2 as a gift for my son and daughter who have their own houses now.	1
Quiddler was a surprise game gift that everyone loved to play.	1
Just got mine and super happy about it.  Quiddler is my family's favorite game!	1
I love regular Quiddler and have bought this for my great niece and nephew.  Great for reading and thinking skills.  I think they will enjoy playing this with their mom!	1
lot's a fun in a small box	1
Great game to play as a family. We try to have family night once a week. I will be sad when my kids grow up and there won't be anymore game night.	1
I really enjoyed this game. It's fun, and different. It can even be played as a one player, which I like	1
I had played this game before so I knew what I was buying.  The game belonged to my ex-boyfriend so I decided to buy my own deck.  You don't have to have a huge vocabulary to play this.....although I am sure it would help.	1
We enjoy playing Quiddler very much.  The game from Amazon was easy to get and met all of our expectations.	1
Great game. We played this game with 4 adults and 4 children ages 7-12. Everyone loved it. We helped the children make works when necessary but I love that this fun game can be educational too.	1
A fun game for adults and older children	1
The kids and parents loved it. A good learning tool.	1
Fun game for the entire family!!	1
My husband and myself love this game. I am not a good speller and I can play this game and win. It can be a pain at times because of some of the rules but we bend them from time to time!  You can build any where from 2 letter words to 10 depending on the stage of the game you are on. Some times the smaller words will bring the most points! We have 2 sets now! I keep one at work to play at lunch. Yes you can play solitaire! But I play like it's 4 people playing and I don't cheat to win a hand. Love it love it love it!	1
Haven't played with other people, but I've been enjoying the solitaire mode of play.	1
GREAT family game.	1
Received in timely manner and product as described.  Grandkids had never played this game but think they will enjoy it.	1
I love word games.	1
Our family loves card and board games, and are always on the lookout for more offbeat games to add to our collection.  I can't remember how we acquired Quiddler, a word game, but given that we enjoy other word games such as Scrabble, Boggle, and UpWords, we figured Quiddler would be right up our alley.  Our first time playing it didn't go so well -- probably because we had a couple of younger kids trying to play -- but a second go-round with just adults turned out to be very fun and enjoyable.  The rules of Quiddler are simple -- everyone's dealt three cards, then someone draws a card, then discards another.  The play continues around the table until someone is able to assemble all three cards in their hand into a word, then goes out.  Everyone else gets one more turn to draw and discard and try to make words from their hands, then points are tallied up (with any remaining cards resulting in deducted points).  The next round is the same but with four cards, then five, all the way up to ten.  High score wins!  The game is similar to other draw-and-discard games, such as Phase 10, but with a dash of Scrabble thrown in for good measure.  We've discovered some interesting new words, and the game certainly challenges you to find unique words to use up what's in your hand... as well as some shocking but hilarious times when some dirty mind comes up with a raunchy but perfectly legitimate word on their turn.  XD  As an added bonus, the letters on the cards are modeled after Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Kells.  This makes the cards a treat to look at as you play.  If you like Phase 10 and/or Scrabble, you'll enjoy this game.  It's a lot of fun, and relatively quick as well.	1
Can't wait to play this!  Brand new.  We played it at a friend's house and stretched our minds and laughed a lot.	1
Again, another game I purchased based off the reviews here at Amazon.com!  This game does not disappoint!  It's like Scrabble meets Rummy!  Love it.  I play this game with all three of my kids (ages 11, 9, 8) and we have fun.  Now, there are times they need help spelling a word here and there so I assist when needed.  (would be better to play with all adults - but this is reinforcing their vocabulary and spelling) I just love this game.	1
This company makes a number of games. The first one I got was Set. That was great, and so is this. It is sort of like Scrabble with cards, but easier for younger kids to play. I highly recommend it.	1
Super fun game!  Our family loves it.  Great for 2+ players!	1
It is a very fun spelling/vocabulary game.	1
fun	1
Fun game!  Took my 8 yr old a little time to accept it, since it's not as flashy as Mille Bournes Racing Game or even Zeus on the Loose, but now he loves it.	1
real learning tool for kids to have fun at the same time	1
on time as described, Iam happy with it and would recommend it to others	1
fun game	1
My husband, my 7 1/2 yr old daughter and I LOVE to play this game!	1
Teaches your kids a fun way to read. My kids have never had so much fun learning!!!!	1
A wonderful and fun game and could be so helpful with today's generation and their poor spelling skills.  I HIGHLY recommend.  Young and old alike.  As young as a smart 8 year old can participate.  :-)	1
Fun family game. Gets you thinking. Maybe harder gor younger children. Has instructions on how to play solitare too.	1
This game is a lot of fun. I like it better than Scrabble because you can make any word you have the letters for, whereas Scrabble only allows you to play a word if there is a place on the board to put it. I've learned some new words from playing this game so much. The only annoyance is the need to shuffle the discard pile 3/4 of the way though a game because there are no more cards left in the deck.	1
If you like Scrabble, you'll love this game.	1
I purchased this junior version to use as a fun learning tool while homeschooling kindergarten. It is terrific! We play almost every day, often at my son's request. I do help him a lot but the more we play, the more words he is able to construct on his own. The cards are colorful and bright, and they have pictures and word suggestions that we have found to be very helpful. I highly recommend it.	1
This is a fun way to play a less intensive game of Scrabble and it travels well. We are going to play it with our grandkids as it is good practice for constructing three letter words.  Of course by the end of the game you have 10 letters to use so that some words may be longer than 3 letters, but still can be if that is the measure of your vocabulary.  A great game for kids and adults alike.	1
Fun and addictive word game. I recommend.	1
Relative to the number of cards it came with, the box was huge and had a lot of wasted space. Not sure what the reason is for designing it that way, but the game is really fun!	1
My family really enjoy this card game. It's a card version of Scrabble and is a faster playing game then Scrabble. All-in-all a great family game!	1
Fun for all ages...at the same time.	1
On vacation my husband and I played Quiddler with friends. It was so much fun we decided we wanted to have it. I ordered the game on Amazon and after not playing it for a couple of months we opened the game with our neighbors a couple of days ago. We quickly remembered how to play and 2 hours later had played 2 games and laughed a lot. We anticipate our next game.	1
This game was a blast. We had tried Quiddler Jr,, and had a blast with that, so moving up to the next version only made sense. We found that the game was a ton of fun and that you were definitely challenged to think on your feet and come up with words that will bring you to victory.  This is a game that you will bring out over and over again. You will find that it will bring you closer together, encourage a broader vocabulary and spend some true quality time together!  *I received this for review - all opinions are my own*	1
My students have a great time with this game and love it. It is good for students needing help with English as well as students who are fluent. This is the first time my students happily look up words in the dictionary. Good for math too since they have to add up points on each card for the word them make. Fun game	1
My grandson is in kindergarten so this turned out to be just a bit premature for him - the hint words on the cards were just confusing to him - but he loved keeping score with the "coins" .  I think I'll put the game away until he's in 1st grade and knows how to spell more words - and am sure it'll be a hit then.	1
Great fun and addictive - can play for hours or just a bit.  Enjoyed with two other players as much as with three other players - which made it much more difficult.	1
I am always looking for a great family game, and while I have tried other Set Games in the past, I had heard great things about Quiddler. This is the Junior version of Quiddler and it intrigued me, as I was wondering whether my seven year old would be able to play this by herself or not. In playing this, the cards are wonderfully made with great imagery and graphics and many colors that truly drew my youngest daughter in from the beginning. I came to find that she did need some help at first as only being in first grade had some limitations in regards to the breadth of her vocabulary. As we played though she got better and better and after a few rounds she had the hang of it. By the end of the game she was asking to play it again. This game really challenges you to think and be creative with your words as well as encourages your kids to learn more and more words in the end. This is a great game that I would encourage for all families!  *I received this for review - all opinions are my own*	1
I love this game. If you are a word game person, this is a wonderful game for a small group. At least six can play together. You make words with your letter cards. First three cards, then 4, 5, 6, 7 with each round of cards dealt. You can earn bonuses for longest word, most words per hand. Tricky letters such as the QU combination have higher point value. It is a fairly fast moving game and lots of fun for word geeks like me. There is also a way to play it ala solitaire, but I have not tried that.	1
THIS IS A FUN CARD GAME FOR KIDS AND ADULTS.	1
got this for my family as a gift and they seem to be enjoying it, I have not played it myself.	1
love this game! super fun	1
Super fun game, even better if you know more words than your opponents	1
If you love words and forming letters into combinations of words this is a wonderful game. Not only is it fun in a group, but I have played the solitaire version with the instructions they provide inside. It is just like solving the daily Quiddler word sets they provide in some newspapers. They suggest that you are allowed to use a dictionary if it is not your turn. This is not allowed in Scrabble and I am not sure it should be allowed here. Nevertheless, use a Scrabble dictionary if you decide to play this way. fact that you start out small with only three cards in first round and increase a card each round gives younger children a chance to play as a family game. Cards are colorful and durable . In fact I would recommend you use a card shuffler with this game since the cards are quite stiff and number 108 in number. If you are a fan of jumble words this also gives you an edge in this game. Instructions provided are very concise yet clear.	1
We have had this game for over 4 years now and we absolutely love it!  We are a family of 6 and play this game at least once a week.  At first only the older kids could play, the younger kids played with an adult on a "team".  Now we are all readers and everyone is able to play!  This game is a lot of fun, such a small amount of money for so many years of fun!	1
This game is a blast if you enjoy word puzzles and such. Competitive gameplay that's great for just two or for larger groups. The basic goal is to use up all of your cards in each hand to spell words of three or more letters each--the catch being that each round you add another card to your hand, so you have that many more letters both to use and to puzzle over how to use. My wife and I love this for date nights at home.	1
My husband and I LOVE this game.  It's easier and less intense than Scrabble.  We wore out the first deck of cards and we're busy using a second deck.  We actually play 20 rounds - the first 10 have no bonuses and then the 11-20 rounds have bonuses.  By the end of the game, with 20 cards in our hands, we often use the chair next to us to keep track of everything!	1
Fun easy game to play.  We did find that the rounds went really fast, so my family altered the rules to make it more like a Phase-10 game with words.  So, overall a good game to have on hand--can be really easy or made more difficult.	1
Very Happy	1
Nice card game variation of Scrabble and Bookworm Adventures. Family age ranges from 30s to 80s. Game plays longer than expected with them as the forced draws and math can add time, which is fine. Took me a while to read the instructions, but everything made sense once I dealt the cards. Fantastic gameplay and it's very fun. Unlike Scattergories, random chance plays a huge part, but there is strategy with the bonuses.	1
interesting game	1
We love "SET" and were excited to play "Quiddler."  We found the rules to be absurdly complex.  We also found that playing by the rules was not much fun.  Just to explain - Quiddler is just a deck of cards with letters and point values on them (and they are beautifully illustrated) - it's a no brainer that you can just deal out cards and see who can make the most words, or the highest point words - it's basically like a deck of Scrabble cards.  And, the game is fun if you play this way.  For us, the problem was trying to follow the written directions/rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun.  We wound up just playing by our own rules.  We enjoyed it mildly, but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble.  This was only our first time playing so, if our opinion changes, I'll update this review.  For now though, it's a weak 2 stars.	-1
The only interaction is that during your play/turn you get to chance to choose from the discard pile and only the card that the person before discarded.  It's also too easy to make words and go out, two rounds is the norm; and the larger the word made means nothing extra.  The high review average for this game says something about the people posting reviews in general.	-1
eh.....	-1
very small print.  can hardly read the cards  not very fun.  i don't suggest you buy it.  wish it was better	-1
One of my students said he loved this game, so I bought it for my son.  I didn't realize that there were two versions of it - one for 7+ and this one for ages 12+.  The 12+ game has a LOT of pretty gross questions in it. None that I would use with a student or want my children exposed to.  There are a lot of other games out there that are a LOT more "mature" and are also very fun.  the 7+ version is o.k. still a few gross questions but not as many nor as detailed as the 12+ version.  The "tag suggestions" state "good fun", "family game" and "silly" - none of which I would categorize this game.	-1
Some of these questions were very disgusting and not appropriate. i bought these for vactaion with a 46 year old, two 9 year olds, two 11 year olds, a 76 year old, a 51 year old, a 47 year old and a 45 year old. overall really didn't like it	-1
Horrible card game, wasn't fun.  Highly predictable.  Don't waste your money.	-1
This game sounds fun but my teenager hated it and the preteens who played with us got bored of it quickly. The questions are appropriate for kids but really dull for anyone ages 10+.	-1
Sadly, this game had questions that were actually too gross to answer, so we were unable to play the game after about five minutes. And I thought my kids had an ultra silly sense of humor, but this game took it farther than even they thought was funny.	-1
Disappointment	-1
This is a counterfeit game. When you try to register it the serial number doesn't work. The board doesn't lay flat and it has cracks in it. My friends had the same thing happen to them. If you want this game go and buy it from a store where they are more likely to have a real one that you can actually play. In case you are wondering I bought directly from Amazon not from a third party.	-1
Loved the game the few times we got to play it. However, the board fell apart and it's less than a month old!	-1
Great game. But the board is so severely warped that it's practically unplayable.	-1
Ordered for my sons birthday, opened it up today to play and the board is damaged.  Before we even take it out of the box the game is already falling apart.  Very disappointed...	-1
Pretty complicated for 8 year olds.  I'd raise the min age to 9 or 10.	-1
Very complicated and too hard for my family to learn. We returned it.	-1
Many of the cities on the gameboard are in the wrong place. For instance, Duluth, MN is drawn where Minneapolis and St. Paul are located. Annoying.	-1
orderd game by mistake	-1
Bought this game based on all the good reviews.  Just sold it for cheap at a yard sale. Hard to figure out and nobody in our family liked it.	-1
I am not a huge board game player so I am not speaking from a place of master knowledge however, I am totally dumbfounded by the amount of reviews  of this game let alone the high stars of this game. Can you say, "boring?"  Seriously --- are people starving for stimulation in a board game since othello or risk that they would rate this 5 stars?  This game is so boring that it will put a 2 year old to sleep.  Yeah...yeah...yeah you have to look at your train cards and destination cards and figure out how do I get the most points from "A" city to "B" city but what a snore!  We did not even finish the game.  My kids love board games like monopoly, clue, life, and risk so I purchased this game for us to play over Christmas Break... We quit after playing 15 minutes---so stupid.	-1
It needs changes in four of its rules, and reminds me of Risk, where I could potentially lose friends.  The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board.  Since I stopped playing this game, I bought Seven Wonders, which is WAY more interesting, and has no possible avenues for irritation. I did make one mistake in my review.  This game deserves ZERO stars instead of 1!!  I gave this game away, and couldn't get it out of my house fast enough!	-1
This game is ok for what it is. It is a simple game where you try and get multiple cards of the same color, to match up with the corresponding colors on the routes on the map. You score points for going from one city to another, scoring more for larger routes. You draw "destination cards" that have 2 cities on them, and if you connect them you score bonus points. The game consists of players making their own routes longer, or blocking other players. Not very much to it, and it is really annoying when 5 turns go by and you never get the cards you need. There is a decent amount of strategy in this game, but it is nowhere near as fun as Power Grid, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, or 7 Wonders. I have tried to enjoy this game, because the hype must come from somewhere, but to no avail. If you want to begin getting into fun board games that are not too difficult, but better than monopoly or sorry that you grew up with, I would recommend 7 Wonders or Carcassonne.	-1
I got this game as a present and the reaction was not so great even after playing it..too much luck involved	-1
I didn't like this game because you can make your strategy at the beginning of the game and one person can make a move that will totally stop you from succeeding. I don't like games where you cant follow your strategy through the game or that each player has one movement per turn. This was just a frustrating game for me, even when I won.	-1
I bought this product at Bed Bath and Beyond, but it's the same exact thing (just clarifying why I'm not a "Verified Purchase" reviewer for this specific product).  In terms of quality, I have no issues. It's well made, the quality of the book is really good. The illustrations seem like they could use a little more color and a little more skill, but they're fine overall. This book and the box it comes in along with the Elf are made to last few years.  With all that being said, I have a really big concern about the whole idea behind this "tradition." We did it at our house last year, and unfortunately, we're doing it again this year, although I'm trying to figure out now how to get out of it without crashing my daughter's feelings and destroying the trust that she currently has in us.  So you might want to know what my issue with this Elf is.... Well, I have a regular kid at home (to me, she is perfect, but to the outside world she is most likely just a regular kid). She misbehaves sometimes, she doesn't always follow my directions or requests (don't we all hate asking our little people in the house to brush their teeth multiple times just to discover that it was never done?!). She sometimes throws tamper tantrums, but overall, I love her just the way she is. Which is why I keep asking myself, why on earth did I ever lie to her about an Elf who tells on her everyday to Santa?! I read somewhere that it's just lazy parenting, and it really is. It feels like it. I don't like threatening my child. I like teaching her about consequences of her behavior, which is absolutely necessary, but threatening her with a toy who creepily comes alive at night and tells Santa that she was "bad?" That feels just cruel, and stressful to her, which brings me to my second point.  Even though my kid absolutely adores this Elf (she couldn't wait for her to come!), she is also very stressed out about it. I don't ever even say anything to her about the Elf watching or the Elf reporting bad behavior to Santa. I try to give it as little significance as I can, but she still is stressed (she is 6). Ever since the Elf came, she has trouble sleeping through the night. She tries her best to behave well for most of the day, but it's followed by a temper tantrum in the evening, because it's probably emotionally just too difficult to handle to have to be "perfect" all day long. Whether it's because of excitement or stress, or maybe it's just too much stimulation for her imagination (believing that objects come to life at night is a little creepy and unsettling when you think about it). She is not herself, and her sleep (and mine) is interrupted because of that. The home should be a relaxing, safe place; not a place where she is constantly watched and judged by her beloved little Elf.  And then, I already feel bad about lying about Santa. Now I'm lying about the Elf. Will this kid ever trust me when she finds out? Will she think that we lied about other things as well?  For us, adults, the elf is simply a fun toy, but to the kids, he is REAL. And that can be very unsettling for them. Just don't do it to your kid. It's not worth it, it's mean, and as a parent who has done it I can tell you that it doesn't feel good to me to have to lie to my child on daily basis and make her be so excited about something that I know is one big lie.	-1
Im pretty excited to start this tradition. Im not sure what happened but my book box is a little damaged. I know it shouldnt be a big deal, but Ill be saving it for hopefully the next decade and it stinks that it will not be perfect to start.  The amazon box was not damaged so it makes me believe it didn't happen during shipping.	-1
I am a teacher, and I bought this for my students and I to enjoy during the holiday season. I've found that the little elf isn't made well enough to withstand 40 little hands trying to see it. The head is heavy and the rest of the body is lanky, which I understand the point of but it's still difficult. I didn't find the book to be cute as much as creepy. It was a fun tradition for the kids, but for this adult, it was hard to remember to change it every day, lol. I think it should come with a list of fun places for the elf to go.	-1
For this much money, I'd expect the legs/arms to be wired.  The arms are sewn together - and the legs are unpositionable.  There's no way you can pose this elf.  He has one position.  That's it.	-1
Book came damaged! Tha back part was unattached (hence the 1 star), anyhow the story is beautiful and the elf is great, my daughters are super excited about it!	-1
What Happened To Santa?	-1
Lame tool to get kids to behave	-1
I was almost going to buy one for my daughter, since she was kept asking one for the house.  Thank god I saw one at Costco that only cost you $15 VS Amazon $29-39. I am very pleased I bought one from Costco and quality is way much better compare to Amazon ones is plastic.  Costco ones are nice quality made and looked great.  Totally worth it.	-1
We received it as a gift from my sister in law (considered to be a verrry smart woman by the way). I decided to open it when my child was 2 y.o. So my child took it "to play", and I never saw the elf until Easter. I asked where is the elf? My child answered : He is far away, you will not find him! Another time I said to my child : That bad elf will take all of your toys if you will keep misbehaving! And my child said: No he will not! Ha-ha! He is a simple toy! And started to laugh! I never read to her that stupid "book" of course. And the toy elf is still somewhere in her toy chest I think.	-1
I was so disappointed to find that the design of this elf has changed since we got ours in 2009. Unfortunately, ours had a mishap this year (got too close to a lightbulb), and I needed to quickly replace him. I was impressed with Amazon at the speed with which he arrived. However, the new one looked NOTHING like the old one!! The quality of the painting was sub-par and messy, and the face shape, paint colors, eye shape, and hair were not as colorful or cute as our original one. The felt used for the body and hat on the new one is cheaper and rougher, more of a thick, scratchy felt than the soft one we had. He just seemed so dull and cheap, comparatively. Sadly, it seems they have let the quality go in favor of mass production. Luckily, only the body of ours had been damaged, so I was able to do a full head transplant, and my kids were none the wiser. When my kids noticed these new ones in the stores this year, they actually commented on how different they looked from theirs at home! Additionally, I looked for just the elf without the book, but found that I had to repurchase the entire set, so now I have an extra book and box. I wish I could find another of the older design elf- I would pick it up now and save it, just in case I need it in the future.	-1
Someone is laughing all the way to the bank and retiring early, and it's not me.  I hated the book.  The illustrations are ugly, and worse, the words are pathetic.  In a desperate attempt to rhyme, there are some really lame lines and bad choices of words in there.  I find myself paraphrasing every time I read it.  You don't need the book.  You can just explain to your child that  there is a magical elf that helps Santa by reporting who's been naughty and who's been nice, every night.  Every morning he comes back and hangs out in a new spot.  Just one rule: "You can't touch this - Hammertime!" or he might lose his magic.  The elf isn't bendy or velcroed or anything, so it was difficult to pose him anywhere except a shelf.  For this amount of money, couldn't you at least make his hands velcro together?  Lastly, my kids were not into it (Age 2 and 3).  Maybe they were too young, or too spoiled.  The elf brought them occasional gifts (advent calendar, chocolate, diecast car, pajamas) - still, the elf got no love.  I will try again next year, but will make our own elf book together with our kids.	-1
Stupid elf. Everyone has to have one, right. And they're all named Chippy. This elf looks like something I made in 7th grade home ec. Not worth the money. Make one yourself.	-1
Packaging and book is nice. Elf is of low quality. Made of stiff cheap rough felt. The hands are sewn together not Velcro or magnetized and the limbs do not have wire as the older knee hugger characters have thus making it impossible to keep in a pose or hang on most things that you would need to separate the hands to get his arms around. Mine also came with a rub mark on the cheek where paint had been rubbed off. My 17 month old does love to look at it and make him sit up, but it won't last long if I let him play with it. I was really hoping to be able to pose him more easily as that is the main reason I bought him.	-1
DO NOT BUY!!! Read the story of the elf carefully. Notice that on Christmas Eve the elf has to leave the house and go back to the North Pole to return next year. Many kids will find the elf amusing and will get attached to him and will cry and miss the elf on Christmas morning! Poof, your Christmas will become a tragedy and not a happy event. Your child will cry because they will miss their funny elf friend. DONT START THIS TRADITION!!! Don't say I didn't warn you!	-1
My Grandson got this and because of the movie, he got this one, but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable. However, my Grandson (9 yrs old) loved this elf and his Mom and Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays.	-1
amazing that this sells for $30.  the elf is the cheapest toy I've ever bought- it's not positionable, and the arms don't open.  good marketing!! my son believes he's real, but it didn't stop him from being bad!	-1
Here's a creepy little elf and a book.  If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity. Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00. This is awful quality too.  I would not recommend thistle anyone.  Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar!	-1
I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is "naughty". We will encourage striving for the "nice" behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic...	-1
I thought the doll would talk or something.  But it doesn't even sit up by itself. It's a rip. my 3 year old son said "it does what??" Like yeah right...	-1
The story is cute, well written and has great graphics.  The Elf though is poorly made.  I can not see this guy lasting more than a couple of years.  His hat is already falling apart.  The whole thing seems poorly constructed and not worth $30.  I would buy the book without the elf and then find an elf somewhere else.  Probably save half the money!	-1
My 4 year old who is not easily scared was just creeped out by the concept and literally told me that the elf looked "creepy". He wouldn't have anything to do with it after that so for us it was useless. I agree the doll is kinda creepy just chilling around your house and "leaving in the night to report to santa".	-1
Not to be a scrooge, because the kids do have fun getting look for the Elf every morning. But as a parent, I have to warn other parents. Think of how much magic has to be conjured for this Elf to move every single night! Poor, hard-working Elf. It's a delicate house of cards to have Santa's magic tied with this guy. Resist!	-1
I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.  This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other.	-1
When I broke out Party Gras for the first time, it seemed like it could be a fun addition to a party.  Just as quickly, people didn't care about the game and it broke up the flow.  The "game" is simple, you try to do tasks on cards and when you do, you get more Mardi Gras style beads.  Sadly, the game doesn't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party, it simply becomes a hassle.  Essentially there will be one person really into it, going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else's attempt to enjoy the party.  It is a fine idea in theory, but the reality of playing it is rather painful.	-1
It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it. I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game.  Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt.  I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the "rules" no one was really engaged in the "play" aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an "icebreaker"/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly, not that much fun.  As I mentioned previously, this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators. I belive that would make this game much more of a "party".	-1
Blech. No fun. Too complicated. Scoring ridiculous	-1
It is not fun. It is a game of chance. We played it once, and got bored immediately.	-1
I am a Speech-Language Pathologist.  I personally love these cards.  They are fun and well made.  But I do not have one patient that likes these.  I'm not sure why.  But the kids set the pace on my choices.  It is unusual for not one kiddo to like something.  But sadly these sit on my toy shelf.  However I will say I live in rural Alaska and that maybe why they lack appeal.  But I don't usually have this problem.  I would be cautious with this one.	-1
This book is horrific!!! I wonder if it was even proof-read or edited prior to being published. Boring, lacks any type of stimulating plot that would capture a child's interest, and has bizarre illustrations to capture the pathetic storyline. Please do yourself a favor and get an elf on the shelf. The elf is tacky looking	-1
He's fine. I love that his limbs are bendable. That's important. He's cute, but if you're going to make your elf do silly or mischievious things, the look on his face doesn't really match up. Also, I wasn't impressed with the storybook it came with. Not bad, just not very compelling. We'll keep him and use him again, however.	-1
As the picture shows the doll and the book you would think that both would be included in the set.  I read the reviews and a few said that they received both and a few said that they did not.  I received only the book and will be returning it.	-1
Very flimsy board is very weak	-1
Small, cheap and a waste of money. This is maybe good for a dorm room or a car ride or any other place that you are very limited on space. The quality was very disappointing. The rules are light, cheap and despite the "tile lock," the tiles still do not fall into place very easily. You get what you pay for. If you want a nice game, spend more money and don't buy this one.	-1
Very small board. Maybe 8"X8"	-1
I can't believe how CHEAP this thing is. So disappointed...and it's SO overpriced. And the tiles don't even "lock"...its so poorly designed...doesnt even accomplish what I bought it for.	-1
Scrabble it is... locking tiles it isn't.  I guess I didn't catch the other review(s) saying the same thing.  Essentially it's good if you're playing on the couch or some unstable surface... but I don't know that it would qualify as a "travel" version.  The description clearly states it's ideal for playing scrabble in the car, plane, train, etc. -- if the tiles were magnetic and the board folded, yes it would be perfect travel edition.  If the tiles actually locked in place, it would be an ideal travel board.  As it is -- the locking tiles allow you to tilt the board at various angles (but not far past 45 lest the tiles start falling out).  Only other minor gripe is the drawstring bag is a little skimpy if you also plan to put the tile holders (red long rectangles) in with the tiles.... it's literally 1/4" too short to safely secure everything.  I wouldn't trust it with my kids packing it up... unless they put the pouch in a ziplock.	-1
This is a tiny board! It should be advertised as travel size. There are four red posts that separate each tile, and many of mine arrived on the board crooked. It's flimsy, too. I should have looked at the dimensions. I liked that it was 'tile lock,' but this is really nothing special. The plastic tiles are super, super cheap looking. Look elsewhere.	-1
I purchased this thinking it would do as the box states and hold the tiles in place. It doesn't. Every time you attempt to lay down a new word the existing tiles on the board "buckle" up and pop around making every move tedious and time consuming as it takes small fingers to places the tiles back perfectly. Please see pictures I have included. The tiles are plastic and the letters aren't centered which is not a big deal to me. However when playing the first word,  Gone as soon as I laid down the O the G popped up. When fixing the G the O popped out. The pictures will show what I mean. I wish I hadn't been cheap and would have ordered the Deluxe Scrabble with wooden tiles and the elevated plastic tile lock board. This isn't worth the money. It's not even a step up from the flat board that doesn't hold the tiles, as this is a constant game of popping tiles back in that have already been played.	-1
Board is tiny and made with light plastic parts and a thin board, suitable for travel I guess but not for regular play. Pieces are tiny - board measures only 10.25", 14" on the diagonal. What saves this from 1 start s that the board is printed correctly, unlike another reviewers board.	-1
I am sorry I purchased the Tile Lock Scrabble game.  The differences between the original game board and this one are:  the board is a lot smaller, the letters are plastic, the letter holders are plastic and if you have medium to large fingers you will have difficulty placing the letters onto the board.  Not only did I pay for the game, I also paid S & H.  Shame on me.  I am glad I still have my original game.  I will not return the product since I would have to pay the S & H again.  Janet	-1
Not what I expected. The pieces are flimsy and move around too easily. Instead of channels, there are dots on all the corners of the spaces to keep the tiles in place. Flimsy.	-1
Very small. I was hoping it would swivel. Guess I should have done my homework??	-1
Based on the name "Tile Lock Scrabble" I thought the tiles would actually lock in place, perhaps lightly snap on to the board, but these tiles don't lock on at all.  Instead there are little raised dots on the corners of each square on the board.  Each tile has indentations molded into the corners.  You place a tile on the board and it rests between the dots.  The deluxe edition scrabble board has bezels between the squares that serve pretty much the same purpose as the dots do on this one (but it's twice as much as this one.)  The instructions say that the tiles will stay in place even if the board is tilted, which is absolutely true, but they will not stay in place if the board is bumped or jostled even a little.  The slightest bump and the tiles dance right off their squares.  It says on the box that it's perfect for travel, but I can't think of travel situation where the board might get tilted, but not bumped: certainly not a plane, or a car, or a boat, or on the beach, or on the grass.  And the board is bigger than a laptop and doesn't fold, so it's not exactly compact.  I don't think they should bill this as being good for travel and they should definitely lose the "tile lock" nonsense.  This is a good basic, inexpensive, scrabble board for kids or for someone who wants a scrabble board but doesn't want a full sized one.  It is better than just the flat board with no guides to hold the letters in place (the Super Scrabble for five dollars less,) but to call this a travel board is a stretch.	-1
I never played many board games when I was younger, but one that I always wanted to try out was Scrabble. This Tile Lock version is the first time I've played it and if anything, it makes me want to give the basic version a shot. The board is tiny, the locking feature doesn't work, and maybe it's just me but there doesn't seem to be enough letter blocks if you want to play with more than one other person.  Playing the game is fun and all, it's just weird that this is billed as a locking version when the feature barely works. If you even barely bump into the table the board rests on, pieces will move. I can't imagine playing this in the car unless you were on a long stretch of smooth road with zero bumps or rocks of any kind.  This is one that we won't be playing much in the future, and I plan on getting a standard Scrabble since it can't be any worse than this. The game itself is fun, not the presentation.	-1
This game is too cheaply made to be recommended to anyone, kids or adults. But again, "you get what you pay for".	-1
This is NOT overpriced, & to another reviewer, it's written '$5' or '$5.00', NOT '5$'! This should have more stickers & less coloring pages.	-1
We have never returned a game - except this one.  No one wanted to go through the trouble of figuring it out. Our group regularly plays popular "new" boardgames... with lengthy rules but this was tooo much.	-1
Totally  Used  Book !   There was actually someones Bic pen and some pencils in the pouch, writing all throughout, not too happy. Only thankful I had it mailed to myself first.	-1
Read the reviews! The cards look fantastic. But playing with/using them is tough. Cards are not coated so you're basically handling paper. If you want authentic-looking cards these fit the bill. If you actually want to play cards with them you'll have your work cut out for you.	-1
If in the 1800's they printed on off-center, crooked cut paper with pixelated designs, then these cards would be perfect. I think they printed better back then, these were pretty bad	-1
I bought this game because my 4 year old grandsons love the Pete the /Cat books.  However, this is about the worse game for pre-school children I've ever seen.  They could have provided actual cups to hold the buttons on, as little kids had trouble stacking their buttons on the flat board cup, having kids trade "cups" of buttons is even more ridiculous!  This games should have followed the simple format used by other color coded games.  When we played, I had to change the games format/goals to doable for 4 year olds.	-1
The drawings in the book have the eyes 3x bigger than the stuffed animal. Eyes are too small. My daughter noticed it right away.	-1
returnded it. pete's body has no filling at all.	-1
This hand puppet was very disappointing and expensive for what it is. First off, it's quite small- only little hands can fit comfortably inside. The puppet is supposed to follow the story, Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons, but it only confuses children. The second from top button, which is attached with velcro allows one to pull it off, which is great. However, the other buttons are stationary, so when children try to follow the story and pull the buttons, they rip at the shirt, nearly destroying the toy. I don't recommend at all. If I had physically seen one first, I would not have purchased.	-1
PASS	-1
Most of these reviews do not pertain to this lighted toy!	-1
Didnt work out of the box after several attempts. Was a birthday gift, double sldisappointment. And, of course, I tossed the packaging so couldn't return. Ugh.	-1
Absolutely isn't waterproof. It now doesnt always turn on. I literally just got it. Perhaps I got a defective one, but just an FYI.	-1
We received this as a gift, however, it allowed water in on the very first use. With a battery, that is not safe at all. I wouldn't recommend buying this for bath time.	-1
As noted in my other relevant game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance.  She is what some would call a "reluctant gamer" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to.  She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session) This game fit the bill perfectly.  Based on what I've read about this game on Amazon and BoardGameGeek this one seemed like a real contender.  And, there were many things we liked about this game.  We liked the theme -- you really feel like you are going on a journey (and that you got to play familiar characters and see lots of familiar faces and places along the way), the fact that it is cooperative, and the fact that we hadn't played anything quite like it before. And, I know lots of other people enjoy the game, and I by no means mean any disrespect to them by giving it a two star rating.  But, after playing it twice with her (and a third time with two gamer friends), we all felt the exact same way... it just didn't feel very enjoyable to us. Most of the game play was good but not great (probably 3.5 stars), but the ending was main problem. After all your hard work (and assuming you are lucky enough to get to the end in the first place), whether you win or lose often comes down to a simple dice roll. This was very anticlimactic. No game should end that way.  Given that there are also ways to lose along the way (in fact, it is quite possible you'll never get to the end... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself), it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game. At best (if things went very well along the way), you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning. But, ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate.	-1
Found this game at a Value Village for $2, seems like a good deal right?  Wrong, this game is not really a game, so much as it is interactively telling the story of Lord of the Rings.  No decisions feel important and the game forces you down the path to tell the story the way it was in the books.  If you fail at something you have to keep trying until the story works its way out, otherwise you lose.  Dumb game, ripped it apart and used the pieces for other stuff.	-1
The new investigators and ancients ones are nice, but we never use the board because it really isn't very interesting.  If you use this board you have to dedicate 1 investigator to running around on that board all game and never closing portals or collecting clues.  It's pretty pointless.  We do use the 2 new "other worlds" and their corresponding portals.  We just put Dunwich over top of this board to show the other worlds only.  I'd only recommend this to someone that plays the game a lot and is willing to shell out the money for basically just the investigators and ancient ones.	-1
I bought this for my wife because we love GoT. I was disappointed at how complicated the game is when the winner is really chosen when the families are taken at the start. There is no balance and nothing can happen that will change the fact that some characters and families can just easily wipe out others every time you play. Add this to the high price and I feel foolish even giving it 2 stars.	-1
pfft	-1
A money grab.  Game is horrible.	-1
A GAME OF THRONES is all about appearance, and no substance at all. One of the most boring, tedious, superficial, unbalanced board games I've ever seen.  As a stroke of genius, Fantasy Flight quickly released a game based on the famous books.  The game has six factions, quick method of resolving combats, cards to try to add flavor of the book to the game. But nothing works. Heck, this game is much worse than the classic BRITANNIA.  The map board is beautiful, but It could be about any fictitious land ever written about.  This is a very common war game ( a simple one), extremely unbalanced when played with less than six players, with an annoying "sudden death" mechanism to end the game. The components are awful (both "boats" - what are that??? - and armies). Why spend time playing this when you have DOMINANT SPECIES, TERRA MYSTICA, BRITANNIA, ECLIPSE, well, a whole lot of things better?  I understand there is a public for everything, but this is just a terrible game, that does not work at any level.	-1
This game falls into the "Extremely Lengthy + Almost Completely Random" category.  Highly recommend for those who like monopoly play-style and want a fantasy theme.  I find games like this a waste of time for me though.  If I'm going to invest countless hours into a single play, I want my decisions to have a large impact on the outcome.  This game does not provide that.	-1
I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game. I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape, both great games giving hours of replayability, and obviously high quality of design and materials. This one disappoints. All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition. The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS. FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity. Some of the pieces, like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4" in height and diameter.  The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well. The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old's hand. The board is quite large, about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard. Not much here folks, especially for the cost of the game. This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price.	-1
works but not all that great.	-1
I returned this, didn't like it at all. Not well put together, kind of cheapie. I bought 2 as gifts for my nephews and would have been embarrassed to give them as a gift.	-1
I bought this book for my husband to record for my son - he travels for work.  It would not record.  It was a waste of money and the book is pretty wordy anyway.	-1
This review is about the description, which is false.  This deck does not include the 5 headed dragon card and it does not include the power of the dualist booster pack.  This item ONLY includes the Dinosaur rage deck of 40 cards.	-1
not easy to use.  you have to hunt through the cards to get word matches.	-1
These aren't cut out around shapes; all squares. Also too small.	-1
Box is heavily damaged. Not great for a collectible action figure . Good if u plan on ripping the box open an using it....	-1
This dice bag was actually very disappointing. It looks very nice, but it doesn't hold up under wear and tear. The felt started falling off within weeks, the silver press on sword peeled off and within two months, I had to find a new dice bag solution.	-1
To start, let me tell you that I own 3 copies of the base game, and one copy of every encounter deck and every expansion.  I have 9 playable hero decks that I play regularly.  My take on the player cards:  Brand is not a great hero.  His ability is limited to multiplayer, and I play a lot of solo games.  I do not use him regularly in any deck unless I am looking specifically for Ranged ability, and even then I usually use Legolas from the base set.  The allies are good with the exception of Keen Eyed Took (so 3 good, 1 bad).  Four of the remaining five player cards (events and attachments) are cards I never ever use.  My take on the encounter deck:  This is a very extremely location heavy challenge.  So, if you can handle that by using cards that clear locations (Northern Tracker in particular) it becomes quite easy.  There are very few enemies and minimal combat.  It is a unique change of pace compared to other encounter packs, but simply clearing locations is a bit bland, and it does not hold up interest after repeated plays.  Note also there is a card in this encounter deck called "Rockslide" which is probably one of the most frustrating types of cards that can occur in any encounter deck (probably second to any card with "surge").  Rockslide can end a game in a hearbeat, even if you have planned well.  So, 2 out of 5 on this one.  Many other encounter packs are much more worth your money.	-1
These should be the same price as stickers... They are basically removable stickers not impressed not really worth any stars free magnet on my phone book is stronger than these	-1
Disappointed with these magnets.  They are thin and difficult to crack out of their magnet shell.  If I had known, I would have passed on this one.	-1
I wasn't expecting much, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be just decals over the magnets. While they look nice, on closer inspection you realize this is something anyone could have done with some adhesive paper, a nice printer and some magnets you can cut.	-1
I bought this game after seeing some positive reviews and an interesting premise, however things went badly after I broke it out with my gaming group.  But before I continue let me tell you that Infiltration is based upon the Android board game universe (which I have no knowledge of) in a steam-punk feel.  But maybe I can sum it up better by saying; this is a techy heist game where back stabbing and running through a facility stealing information is the "order-of-the-day" (much like the 1992 film "Sneakers" with Robert Redford, however the game's characters are much more selfish and don't really work together like in the film).  The rule book is beautiful but lacks a lot of information. I have had so many questions about game play and details, that I've had to go searching on the web for answers. Since this isn't a popular game, I've had to go to Fantasy Flights web and email them my questions, which they've never answered (Ultimately I figured out the game).  Since then, the game has sat on my shelf and no one in my gaming circle willing touch it. However a recent trip to Los Angeles, I broke it out with gamers that I had never met, and they all agreed it was one of the worst games ever printed.  Stick with me, and I'll explain why.  Problems with this broken game are;  - Your character can become wounded by a security guard or a room and this can knock you out of the game. Keep in mind there is only 2 rare ways to become healthy. Extremely frustrating for the player just sitting there doing nothing.  - If you become the first player to take a turn, you have dominance over the rest of the players by snatching up all the data tokens ahead of everyone else (and one player dominates the game). I call this the "Mario-Bros-2-Player-Video-Game-Effect" (where one player runs ahead and gets all the game coins/stars and other goodies). And the second player is swimming in his digital wake. I've won this game and I felt so bad for everyone else, I couldn't wait to move on after apologizing to them.  - It appears that a ratio of 1-in-5 item cards actually help negate the run-away-player problem (and some item cards really are useless)... but unless you get those cards, your screwed.  - Layout of the room cards are non-nonsensical and are laid out in an arc? The secret room sometimes cannot be even entered, and this is a problem too.  - Also, this game has very little strategy or real flavor. Run through... snatch data tokens... run back before the alarm goes off... bam... done... boring.  - The characters have no special abilities on their cards and every one of them are flat and lifeless. The game maker should of used colored cubes and numbers in place of players names because that is the level of character painted on theme here.  There are other problems with this game, but clearly every time I break it out, people can't wait to finish it to move onto another game.  I have heard the game was designed by the maker of Dominion, a well known and popular fantasy card game, but since I have not played Dominion, this is a mute point with me.  Don't get me wrong, Fantasy Flight did produce a beautiful game and the quality of the pieces are "first-rate", but it doesn't save the mechanics and details of game play.  TO END:  Simply stated, Infiltration is completely flat and lifeless. I feel nothing towards it and I intend on selling it soon. Players don't care about the characters and the way the game is tailored players don't care who wins the game. Sadly I feel no sadness when I kill a company worker in the building and some innocent employee getting "knocked-off"? (Is that necessary? Most thieves aren't interested in murder on top of their stealing crimes). In Infiltration there is no greater alliances with other players and no consequences to almost anything. And when you don't care who wins and when you the player is dead to the circumstances, why play it?  Don't buy it unless you plan to make your own rules. Instead I advise you to go buy "Can't Stop" a great push your luck game or "Elder Sign" another semi-push-your-luck game. This one is terrible.	-1
One needs THREE core sets to be competitive.  I bought all three.  It cost me around $100. I'll be selling them all now, because I feel disgusted with the business model.  There should of been a completion deck made available for $14.99.	-1
For its $30 price tag, this game felt woefully incomplete, especially compared to other beginner box sets like Pathfinder's.  With its handful of pre-gen characters (no rules to make your own) and just a smattering of NPC baddies to design stories around, there really isn't that much to do with this game.  I honestly think if you're interested in this game then you should just save your money and wait for the full version to come out.  I hate to sound cynical, but it really is obvious between the $30 Beta Rules book, this "sneak peak" of the rules (that most companies would give out for free via .pdf), and then the "real" version coming out next year, that they're just slowly milking eager fans for as much money as possible.  It would be like charging half retail price for a video game to be part of the Beta, then paying half retail price again for the demo, then finally full retail for the actual game when it comes out.  Who would do that?  Anyway, sorry for ranting so long on their marketing strategy. As it turns out, I found the actual game to be kind of a bore as well.  For instance, the main mechanic of the game consists of building a dice pool of green eight-siders that have "good" symbols on them dependent on your characters ability (no numbered dice in this game; you have to use their special dice!), add purple eight-siders with "bad" symbols depending on how difficult the task is, then switch out those green and purple dice for more symbol potent yellow/red twelve-siders depending on specializations , then add blue or black six-siders depending on advantages and/or disadvantages the situation might have, and finally rolling all the dice and taking note of how many good symbols you rolled subtracted by their bad symbol counterparts that were also rolled (there's three different kinds by the way).  If you end up with at least a single success you do it!  Other symbols describe how well/bad you did it!  If that sounds really clunky then I'd have to agree with you.  The fact there's only a single set of dice that comes with the game and you constantly have to hand off dice an build these rolls for EVERY action you want to do only makes things worse, and quite frankly, not fun!  My advice is if you're interested in playing a Star Wars RPG then go with the last d20 version put out by Wizards of the Coast before the price on it skyrockets.  If you're set on giving this system a go then wait for the full release ;don't let them dip into your wallet more times than they have to.  Edit:  Just discovered they put out an app that simulates their unique dice.  Wanted to mention it since that would help make the game run smoother if everyone could build their dice pools before hand and be ready when their turn comes up.	-1
Gift for husband; he wasn't a fan	-1
The only useful thing this set has are the dice, everything else is just meh. Save your money from this and get the main rulebook (which you still need anyway) and a set of dice then make up your own adventure, you will enjoy it so much better	-1
This one is a Star Wars Role Playing Game from Fantasy Flight Games, great company by the way. This is the incarnation of the Star Wars RPG, when you read it, you will love it, but the experience change a lot when you actually play the game. Young gamer will like the game, because its easy to learn. Some experience Role players may like it. I did not. The Product itself is high quality, have lots of full color tokes, nice dices, and large poster maps, also some pre made characters, but can make or download more at their web page. Before you expend money on the Core Books - 3 of them... I recommend to try this one or the other beginner box games first.  2 stars for quality...	-1
Well I know that it is a new system and that it's trying to be faster and more story driven but it really didn't work for my style of play. I was very disappointed in the way the system flowed and the random die just don't do a good job. If you just want your party to pass all the time, then you might like it, but it was totally not for me.	-1
Too confusing.  I love Magic but i hated this game a lot. Amazed at all the positive reviews... It takes forever to set up. We never play it.	-1
I am someone who has played games his whole life, my favorite type being deck builders like Legendary, Dominion, and Star realms.  I mainly game with my wife so we are always looking for fun two-player games.  Being a huge fan of Star Wars, and after reading all the positive reviews of this game on here, I was excited to purchase this.  Based on that, I felt some balance needs to be restored to these reviews, as this is NOT the fun game that the high rating implies. While this game isn't difficult, it IS confusing and the rule book and accompanying videos don't do a hell of a lot to clear things up.  I bought this game last Saturday at noon.  I spent most of the day reading the rules and watching videos trying to figure out how the heck to play the game.  Once I felt I understood I decided to play with my wife.  Upon starting, I found simply trying to explain the attack phase/edge battle aspect really difficult to do without my wife's eyes glazing over. I have NEVER had to watch videos to figure out how to play a game.  The rule book does contradict itself and leads to confusion, and then watching the videos really don't clarify the rules.  It simply re-states them.  Not a terrible game, and it's actually kind of fun once you figure it out and get it down, but be prepared for a learning curve.  even if you are familiar with gaming already.	-1
Fell Apart after one day!	-1
The dice themselves are fine, the qualm I have with this product is the price.  It is absurd to pay almost $30 for plain plastic dice.  I only had to buy them because the game that uses these dice is awesome, and I'm looking to play it with more people.  Generally speaking, the stater game is a better buy, it's only $10 more expensive than this product, and comes with some literature and adventures as well, but since I already had that, and I just needed dice, I was forced to get these.	-1
I thought I'd get more into the game but nope	-1
The rules are all online & cumbersome to use.  There is no clear explanation on how to win the game while plenty of clear ways to lose.  The app is adequate but the game seems to go on forever with no sense of progression.  My family tried the game twice and got frustrated both times.  Finally gave up and lost interest in playing.  My recommendation is to look at some of the video reviews before you purchase to see if the style of play is to your liking.	-1
I thought I'd get more into the game but no.	-1
I do a lot of puzzles and couldn't wait to do this one.  It's the greatest picture!  However, I went a little crazy!  It's been a few months, but I'm almost sure this is the one where the pieces fit but it's still not the correct piece.  It looks right, but it's not the intended piece.  I just don't have tolerance for those kids of puzzles!  I gave it away asap because I knew I'd never do it again.  I wanted to love it and wish it was made differently.	-1
Bought three of these all didn't work.	-1
This is a 2-3 player games. I was so confused with this card game that I gave up playing. Four people had a difficult time trying to play. Idea sounds good, and you may be more intrigued if you're a bigger fan of Game of Thrones, but there was much appeal for us.	-1
I wouldn't have bought this except that I wanted at least 1 of ever ship. This thing is massive!	-1
Idea is good. But material is cheap and there is one light which does not work. Waste of time ordering it and then returning it.	-1
Being very experienced game players, my husband and I were surprised that we had to struggle to understand how to play Chrononauts. We are relieved to see that we're not the only reviewers who have found the instructions for this game to be overly complicated and confusing due to poor explanations. This game has a good concept but is in serious need of a professional editor!!! As a former professional game editor myself, I am appalled at the lack of clear directions and examples.	-1
Granted, I know there are variant rules that may improve this game some but I've only played with the most basic rules and with those this is a pretty bad game.  It is essentially just Scrabble without a board and no scoring, instead it is a race to place the last tile.  Each player starts with a handful of tiles and begins making words with those tiles much like you would on a Scrabble board except you can rearrange your tiles at will.  When a player places the last of their available tiles they announce "Peel!" and everyone grabs a new tile.  This goes on until the final tile is placed and whoever placed it is the winner.  I feel like the game assumes that by playing all your tiles you can go through the bag while filling your opponents stock with tiles they can't play as quickly.  Except the first time you play you quickly realize that having a single tile isn't always as easy to play as a handful.  Plus the game gives you the ability to ditch a tile at any time and trade it in for 3 more.  It's just a nonsensical game where just happening to play the last tile wins you the game by a fraction of a second each time.  Even the argument that it is more portable than an actual game of Scrabble doesn't really hold water nowadays.  Not only does actually playing this game take up much more room than a Scrabble board would, even if you consider just carrying around the pouch of tiles, we live in the age of smartphones, just download Scrabble on your device and play on the go.	-1
Very disappointed in these tiles!  They're hollow - nothing like Bananagrams tiles from other games I've played.	-1
Played twice. eh. not impressed. Maybe you have to be a Scrabble kind of person to play. Word games aren't my favorite except for Words with Friends. I do like the little banana case though. Easy to store.	-1
I've played Bananagrams with my family for years and loved it- now that my husband and I are on our own I wanted to get a set for us for Christmas- I ordered from Amazon and just received it and I am dismayed to find that I got a counterfeit set- I didn't read the reviews before purchasing because I knew I liked the product, but I feel let down that Amazon let sellers sell a counterfeit item.  I feel like I'm going to pay more in shipping to return it than I paid for the item to myself. Such a waste of money- the tiles are cheap plastic (probably made in china with all sorts of chemicals in them), hollow on the back and the printing of the letters is horrible. I am so very disappointed right now.	-1
Ordered it 2 different times, got something else each time.	-1
Buyers should be aware that if you order this game on Amazon,  it is likely you will receive a counterfeit product,  a cheap knock-off from China,  not the original, trade-marked Bananagrams game.  The one I received was absolutely inferior to the ones being sold in Target and other stores.  The tiles were hollowed out on the back,  cheaply printed (the letters seemed like they would get scraped off with any play)  and came in a cheaply made bag with a wimpy zipper.  I sent it back and am hoping for a full refund.  I went and bought a replacement at Target,  and it is of such a higher quality, it's disgusting.  The tiles are like Scrabble tiles,  heavy,  with recessed printing,  and there is a trademark on the brown label on the bag.  The one I received from the Amazon seller looked like it came from a gas station,  cheap garbage.  Shame!	-1
I bought this for my verbal eight year old based on the reviews.  We have had it one year now and have played it 3 or 4 times.  For us, the negatives are: 1) you are essentially playing alone, building your own crossword without even needing to know what the other person is doing.  The only time you pay attention to them is when they take a tile and you have to take one too.  2) the child (at least mine) sometimes needs help fitting in awkward letters or reconfiguring her board, but she's on her own in this game.  Handicapping the adults by having them pull more tiles doesn't even this out so overt help is needed, which makes it less fun. 3) the child is not learning any new words since they don't need to pay any attention to any board other than their own, so the educational value is less.  If you are like us and think the above negatives are deal-breakers, then I would recommend the game Catch-Phrase which is interactive, educational, fast-paced, and kids can play even with adults if you let them skip phrases they don't recognize . (They still learn the phrases when they hear them defined on other people's turns.) We have the card, rather than electronic version. It's a blast.  Kids over on playdates always drag it out, and when we have family over everyone wants to play. This has never happened with Bananagrams.	-1
I let the salesman at the store talk me into buying this although I had low expectations.  I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas.  It was so incredibly useless.  I put it all back together immediately to return for a refund.  However, I had lost the receipt and I had paid cash.  So we still have it.  My son keeps getting it back out to try to play with it, but then he remembers it doesn't DO ANYTHING!  It is virtually impossible to get the slide to hold steady enough to see anything at all under the microscope.  It is uncomfortable to push the button to hold the light on while you're looking at the slide.  I understood that this was $20 and wouldn't work like an expensive microscope, but I'm telling you, this microscope is the same quality I would expect from a $1 microscope from the Dollar Store.  It is practically unusable because you can't hold it still and it's too hard to find your object under it.  My son plays with the little vial and the tweezers.  Was that worth $20?  No.  Trust me.  Do not waste your money on this.  You and your child will be disappointed.	-1
the game is ok. I don't like the feeling of it	-1
Being a retired teacher, I was excited to buy this for my granddaughter because she was very interested in how the body works. We had fun going through the book and reading the information as we extracted the parts. We did have trouble opening the skull, but it did open. The frustrating part came when we tried following the directions to put it back together. We still haven't been able to get the hips to stay together. The sticky organs are fun, except when you are trying to put them back in order. Their stickiness becomes a con. After the excitement of operating the first time, we've only used it one more time because it's too hard to reassemble it!  Also, I think the hips are defective. The "pro" of this toy is the book and information for the body parts as the child operates.	-1
This is garbage. Do not waste your money. Yes it's cool for looking at but kids cannot play with it. It's hard to put back together and the organs fall out. The organs are also sticky so the first time they hit the ground they're full of fuzz and whatever else is down there. My kids are 8 and 10, this thing didn't last much more than a week	-1
Not worth the money. I purchased two of these for my kids and once the body parts are out it is hard to get everything back in.	-1
The pieces get dirty CRAZY fast, the bones are super hard to hook into place, and the organs also break apart easily.. so if your kids like to squish and pull on squishy things.. the organs will break. Its a good idea for learning and what not.. but don't get this for your kids unless they are older and will really really take care of it and not "play" with it too much.	-1
This was a fun project to do with my daughter for educational purposes, but it was very poorly constructed. It did not come put together, which would have been fine but we never actually got it together. We eventually had to give up and tape it to make it stay closed. The intestines also won't stay in, no matter how you put them in. We tried higher or lower, and they still fall out. I only give this two stars because it did get the conversation going for our human body unit.	-1
First, I'll say that the organs are fantastic. The kids love them because they're disgustingly realistic and squishy, and they're made well. However, the clear plastic body shell is horribly, cheaply made. It is sorely misaligned and will barely snap together without all the bones, muscles and organs inside it...and with them inside it, it will not snap completely closed at all. If you can manage to line up some of the tabs, some of the other ones will pop out of place. We spent an entire evening painstakingly trying to get it to actually go together, with no luck.  We contacted Amazon, and were promptly sent a replacement (love Amazon!). I reserved reviewing it until we tried out the replacement.  The replacement clear plastic body shell is almost as bad as the first one was. It will almost snap completely together, but there is always one particular section that is misaligned. And, it came with one of the tabs broken off (that doesn't help things). I'm not sure we'll bother exchanging it and trying a second replacement. I think we will just be asking for a refund. This is a huge disappointment for my 8 yr old, who had asked for this thing for months (he finally got it for his birthday a couple of weeks ago). Imagine it's your 8th birthday and being so excited to get something you'd been wanting for a while, and it doesn't go together properly and has to be sent back. And then the replacement comes, but it isn't much better and the plastic body shell won't fit together properly to hold in all the parts.  Edited to add: We ended up returning the 2nd one and getting a 3rd one (thanks, Amazon!) because my son really had his heart set on this thing working. I'm happy to say that the THIRD one was the charm! This one was actually packaged differently than the other two were; the box was wider with a slightly different presentation and it seems like it was produced slightly differently. Most importantly, this one's shell actually fits together and stays together once all the part are inside it, so we are finally satisfied and my son is thrilled! I don't think I'll up the rating, though, since it took 3 tries to get a product that wasn't a hot mess, and I want people who are considering this product to be aware that there may be issues with the one they receive.	-1
I am not a stranger to difficult puzzles; if you check my reviews you'll see I did a 1000 piece puzzle of the Wicked poster, which is entirely solid blocks of color and almost exclusively three colors.  This puzzle, however, is almost as difficult and ten times more frustrating.  The pieces do not fit together cleanly, and sometimes when they do you realize later they weren't supposed to.  I have redone the border multiple times, and have had large sections that I thought was complete only to have to remove pieces and use elsewhere.  The end result is turning out great, but it's taking us much longer to get there than it should.  At several points we're having to turn the puzzle upside down to see if the fit is correct on the back.  If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan, this puzzle is for you.  If you are a puzzle aficionado, run far from this brand.  It will only frustrate you.  The pieces do not stay together well and the slightest bump dislodges them.	-1
This is a fun toy for kids as long as you keep it away from hair, lint, carpets, breathing on it or it ALL sticks to the pieces parts	-1
This was really difficult to put together and keep the body snapped into place.  I wouldn't purchase it again.	-1
We sent it back.  So inaccurate that my child was not going to learn much, and it fit together very poorly. The hard pieces did not mate up to the slots in the shell so it wouldn't stay together.  Book was all cartoonish and cluttered and no good for my visual learner.	-1
The parts did not fit into the fram well, and it was extremely difficult to snap the outer plastic casing together.  Purchased this for my "almost 11 year old" and while he thought it was cool - he wasn't into reading the book as much as I would have hoped.	-1
Great concept.  Nice visual way to learn about the human body and its systems.  3D is great too. My son also really liked the squishiness of the organs.  Made them seem more life like.  But... The negatives: -There are pegs that hold the muscles and bones in the back half of the clear body "case".  The pegs are extremely small and hard to fit into the holes on the case. -Some bones, like leg and arm bones have 2 pegs.  It's very difficult on some to get BOTH pegs to line up. -After you get one bone in place and start to pick up the body case to maneuver it to get another bone or muscle in place, the first bone often pops out. -After you finally get all bones, muscles and organs in place the next step is to put on the front half of the clear body case.  If ONE of the internal pieces is out of place it won't align and snap together. -While you're moving the body around a bit to see where the "snaps" are on the front and back clear body case, the foot or hand often falls out. -Also, the "snaps" on the clear body halves are difficult to connect.  I would suggest practicing clicking the clear halves of the body together before attempting to put in the bones, etc. -We've had one part of a "snap" break off the clear body halves.  After much practice my 8 year old was able to get the muscles, bones and organs in place but he could never get the 2 clear body halves snapped together on his own.  In all I wish the model itself were a bit bigger so the pegs and "snaps" were bigger and more sturdy.  I feel this would make it easier to put together.	-1
There are a couple of PROs 1.  My 6y/o grandson recognized all of the hard and 'squishy parts (diaphragm threw him).  2.  "It kinda looks cool" when we had it completed.  NOW the CONs.  1.  Holes for large pieces do not align well and when finally in, release really easily (In fact, the bony foot will not remain in hole when "body is placed on stand).  2.  The "squishy organs" stick to everything (except the model) they touch and collect fibers, hairs, dust, etc.  It literally requires a 'dust cover' as soon as the 'organ bag' is opened.  3.  When the feet are put in the stand, the head separates (the clip on top does not snap tightly).  4.  The educational pizza trip stops at the upper small intestines (grandson was waiting on the 'poop). The good thing is it was not expensive or I would have sent it back.  My grandson and I had 90 minutes of quality time that is currently sitting on the mantel covered with a Zip-Loc bag pending arrival of a more suitable cover.  I would not recommend this item.  I would have probably given 3 Stars except for the snap issues and the dust.	-1
Concept is great, but does NOT work. "Organ"izer is cute, parts are ewie and squishy, fun to put together . . . oh, that's where it breaks down, literally. You can't put this together. The parts do not stay in place, so you can not assemble this and then stand it up on display. You can put the parts in, but then that's it. Forget the rib cage and plastic housing all together. I was really hoping for a fun way to teach my kid about the human body. This is not it.	-1
Not that great. Hard to keep together. Keeps falling appart.	-1
I am a little disappointed with this product.  I wanted to have this to teach my daughter and once we put it together and started to take it back apart, it wouldnt go back together again correctly.  Things fell apart, the two pieces would not stay together.  It was fun for the first time and my daughter did learn from that.	-1
My son was dying for this, but after playing with it for several hours, he never picked it up again.  A very expensive Happy Meal toy (in terms of length of interest) if you ask me.	-1
The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place, problem is it doesn't stay. its such a tight fit, one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out. With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity; net-net, not a good teaching tool. Its also much smaller than I thought it would be.  We returned it.	-1
Parts are too small and it was hard for my 8 year to take out and put together the right way.	-1
The organs felt gross as promised, but the workmanship (or work-machine-ship) was so shoddy that we immediately whisked it away from the 4-year-old and sent it back.  Luckily, he's forgotten all about it.	-1
This is definately an adult dot-to-dot.  My granddaughter likes to do these.  She is young and thought it would be something we would do together.  Guess my eyesight is REALLY bad!  Very small numbers.  Will keep for an adult to use.	-1
Dont understand how to play it so have not.  I have read the directions and went on YTube to try to figure it out. It sits in my closet wasting away	-1
I wish I knew what I was missing my 15-year old daughter and I played this once and we were bored by how easy it was. But there are so many high rated reviews! What are we missing????	-1
This is a knockoff version of the game.  Mine arrived without a bag (the box states there should be a bag); the tiles were not of the same quality as the Qwirkle games found at Target and the game description on the back of the box and the instruction sheet had spelling errors.  I sent mine back for a refund - they were good about sending me a pre-paid return label in a timely manner though.	-1
What happen to quality control? Some wooden tiles are chipped on the corner and edge making them stand out from the other tiles. Not good since the game requires the face down side of all titles to be anonymous and exactly the same.	-1
Fun game gave as a gift. Was missing some game pieces. sad cause this was gift for the whole family. can anything be done?we just open it. Thank You JimL	-1
I think we could love this game if the directions didn't suck. They aren't clear and leave a lot that you just have to guess at. Maybe once we figure out our house rules we will be bigger fans. Was super excited for this game but was left frustrated and let down by the lack of direction.	-1
my eight year old girl never plays with this game... :(	-1
Like many others the box was sealed but had no bag inside, no instructions, the paint was rough and peeling. In addition the wooden tile paint smelled terrible!! I tried airing out the tiles for a week on the porch but everyone who saw the game said the odor of the tiles was horrible and probably toxic paint. I threw the game away and wish I could reorder but too many others say they were disappointed by knockoffs also.	-1
This came with only the tiles.  No instructions and we still have not figured out a way to print instructions from Mindware's site.  There is also supposed to be a bag--this was missing, too.	-1
The box for this says that the game includes both a bag and instructions. Neither were present and I don't know how they would have fit it into the box since the tiles *just* fit if laid perfectly flat in three layers. I'm lazy so I haven't decided if i'm returning this or just sourcing a bag and getting instructions off the Internet, but think twice before buying this SKU of this game	-1
Purchased this for our 6 year old.  tried to play it once.  the instructions were too difficult to understand and play.  getting rid of it today.	-1
We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition.  It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included.  The game board can also be expanded for longer games.  About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions.  I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included.  All in all, unless you are a complete comedy movie buff, I do not recommend.  I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just wasn't into the Comedy Movies that were included.	-1
If you're an obsessive fan of all the new B effort motion pictures and direct-to-video sequels being pumped out by the Disney studio, then you're likely to be very pleased with this game, which seems to give a lot more attention to Bolt and the newest Winnie the Pooh cash-in than the classic masterpieces that made Disney a household name in the first place.  Few and far between are My Play and All Play questions relating to the classics, instead utilizing the game as a sort of advertisement for all the garbage that isn't already in your video collection.  Add to this a thoroughly lackluster presentation (at least the disk loads faster because there aren't any impressive sounds, images, and effects to cue), and I give Disney a C-/D+ for their efforts here.  It works, and some families are going to enjoy it, but those of us who think of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast when we hear the name "Disney" aren't going to have much use for this game.	-1
Right before I played Scene It Magical Moments for the first time, I played a round of a 2nd edition Disney Scene It that I already owned.  That was great fun.  Sadly, the new Magical Moments edition is just not very good.  The presentation is pretty abysmal in comparison to other games.  The Second Edition board had pictures of characters on each space.  It was rather attactive.  Magical Moments on the other hand simply has blank spaces and a few random (and they are quite random) characters thrown on the board.  Also gone are the double move spaces, which is sort of inexplicable.  The Buzz cards are now retangular instead of circular and don't fit as nicely on the board.  Obviously, they went out of their way to make some changes, I just can't figure out why.  Also, one of the playable characters is the hero from the upcoming Disney movie "Tangled."  Seriously?  No Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck or any of those classic characters but we get Rapunzel?  This game of Scene It plays pretty much like any other game of Scene It.  You roll, you move, you answer a question on the DVD or cards and if you get it right, you move again.  Unfortunately, the first roller had moved three quarters of the way around the board before getting a question wrong.  And that was only because that person lost an "all play" which is really the only way to end a turn in this new game.  They also added a new DVD category called "my puzzle" which allows you to use the DVD remote to pick an answer.  These are also too easy.  The clips remain amusing, but the questions are just too easy for your average Disney fan.  Since I assume only Disney fans would pick up a game like this, it seems rather hopeless that people will have a lot of fun.  So my recommendation would be to go purchase Scene It Disney Second Edition, which really is a run and often challenging game.	-1
Do NOT buy this. Game cannot be played without software and the DVD doesn't work.  The phone numbers and websites listed are all defunct.  Paramount bought Screenlife, the company and then shut it down in early 2012.  It looks like it could have been a lot of fun.  Nice concept, but DVD materials should have been available on-line.  Now we just have a gameboard and some pieces and NO GAME.  DO NOT BUY! This toy and all the screenlife games should NOT BE FOR SALE!!!	-1
Fun theme. Poor "game."	-1
Good price and shipped well- but bad game.	-1
I was dissapointed that the cards looks just like the original Fluxx.  The same border, text, and bland pictures.  Cartoon Network Fluxx is a much better example of how to do a follow up to the original.	-1
Really can't get into this game, and neither can anyone else. Still, it gets good reviews, and I'm hoping that one day the right group of people will get together. It seems like it should be fun. I'm going to keep hope alive for this one, but so far.. nothing.	-1

I was trying to find a kind of fantasy game to play with my 6 year old son and this was a fail. It was confusing and boring. The goals are just having certain cards. Too many cards for my son to keep track of and the play was really boring.  I will try the Dungeon board game next, that's probably more like what I was looking for.	-1
No pronunciation included.	-1
useless for my needs, I gave them to charity.	-1
Dont buy if you don't know spanish! These cards have No English on them. Thought they were spanish translated.  They are only spanish, have pictures on them but you have to hope that its what you think. I should have listened to the other hints when they said not for beginners! Wish I could send back!	-1
This was a gift for someone else.	-1
Dungeon Roll is barely a game. It ALMOST as boring as Candyland, and involves 1 or 2 more decisions.  Here are all the decisions available to players of Dungeon Roll: Roll the dice (not a decision..well, I guess you did decide to play) See what happens (also not a decision) Roll again? (ooh! First decision!) Stop rolling? (ooh! I can choose this more boring option instead of rolling again!) Quit the game forever (Definitely the right decision.)  Don't buy this game.	-1
My rating may seem too critical, but it's honest.  The mechanic of flipping a card to upgrade sounds great in principle, but really makes for a very poor experience when implemented.  Because the cards are two sided, shuffling becomes a very tedious and awkward experience.  You don't want to look at the cards while shuffling, because that would be cheating.  So you shuffle under the table.  But then if you drop the cards your current game is completely messed up.  It's a novel concept, but a horrible when implemented.  I like the simple artwork, but the theme is terrible.  I like it that the theme is neutral, but it's terrible in how buildings are suppose to translate to powers of the card.  A better theme is desperately needed to bring this game together.  Overall, I can not recommend this game at all.  This is one of those games that has potential, but definitely needs to head back to the game testing labs.  Two sided cards could be an interesting concept, but trying to shuffle cards while not looking at them and not dropping any of them is just not going to work.  Simple artwork and generic theme are very much appreciated, but trying a card's image to it's function needs to have some mental connection.  Otherwise the theme is nothing but distraction.  A proper theme helps the player remember what each card does.	-1
I played this with 4 players.  I found it to be dry and boring and I couldn't get into it. The decisions weren't very interesting and when the price of the goods unpredictably change, which can happen at any time, everything you've worked for becomes a waste.  Boring, frustrating and annoying.	-1
I appreciate the attempt to create a good game with a small footprint, but this just falls way short.  The abilities on the buildings are very lackluster and you never feel like you are doing more than moving markers up and down a track.  The top hat mechanic also takes it down a notch or two.  The top hats allow you to use an opponents building without paying the fee.  But it is just too easy to get a top hat and it is not unusual for everyone to have one.  That just removes part of the reason for buying the building.  All in all a very dull game that as none of the good type of tension necessary in a good game.	-1
rules were not clear, this game just doesn't seem to play well	-1
Sadly we already had this booster from the original game, but did not know it till we opened it =(	-1
I tried out this game with the other residents of my senior citizen complex, and it just isn't for us old geezers.  The instructions are quite complicated.  I do think those in their 40's and younger will get a kick out of this.  It's just not for us old geezers.	-1
Boring and slow paced. The board also coming in two pieces and don't line up well. They also are very hard to keep connected and the have a slight bend in them that makes it hard to	-1
As many others, I first viewed this game on TableTop. Purchased it to play with a mixed group of gamers & non. Two of the group are huge car fanatics, so I thought this would be a good option to get everyone involved and having a good time.  Let me start by saying this game drags on and some of the rules just over complicate a simple game. Our game with 7 people took nearly two hours due to the fact that you are constantly passing the one lone dice set around the table. This game fills the void for huge groups, but other than that it is a pass for me.	-1
got three of these one broken ! one not ordered by that name and others do not work all the software was not working sent all of them back!! only ordered one of these got three??????	-1
Waited a week and was broken when it arrived,	-1
didnt work with windows 7 os	-1
What a total piece of junk. The ones who gave this POS 3 and 4 stars must be employees of the company. The software is better used for a coffe coaster. There are no drivers for this and everything is backwards. You can down load freeware simulators but this control WILL NOT work with it due to there is no adjustment. It really cracked me up when I read others who said this mickey mouse piece of junk works great. If I could select no stars I would.	-1
cant get the helis to load.	-1
this is the worst r.c. training program in the hole world. i think its 1985 tech. had to install drivers by hand on windows 7 COMPLETE DISASTER  F- it's this kind of stuff that makes me think about what the hell amazon is thinking. IF i COULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS IT WOULD BE -5	-1
this thing doez NOT work....it sez it needs a thing from microsoft but microsoft sez they don't have it...	-1
do not like the graphic	-1
was a pain to install and graphics poor, only good thing is you can use controller on other sim loads	-1
Wish they would be more specific on the graphic driver needed to run this sim. I would have bought one that was set up for vista.	-1
Not as good as prior reviews stated it was.  Not compatible for some flight games.  The controls are sloppy and have a short range of motion compared to others that are similar.  Spend more and maybe you can get better quality.  It is ok for the price but not good enough for high end users.	-1
First, mine arrived DOA but it was obvious that this is a toy and not really appropriate for proper training in radio control operation.  It's too small, doesn't have trim control and the sticks have none of the feel that an actual controller does.  I didn't get to test  its accuracy since it was defective but even if it was spot on, there are much better options out there - check out the Dynam 6ch controller - it is life size, has trim control, good feel on the sticks and works well with Clearview SE (free).  Don't even bother to download FSM, it is outdated, no longer supported and not all that good when it works.  The upgrade of Clearview is only $35 to get all the models and airfields or buy them one at a time to add to the freeware version.  Props to Amazon as they immediately issued a return label and promptly credited me back my funds.  Notice this is sold by a 3rd party vendor but fulfilled by Amazon - that makes all the difference in the world since the seller has to comply with Amazon's policies.	-1
It came quickly and as describe but there are flaws. Software are clunky and none of the helicopter model work for me so I had to download a different software (HeliSimRC). It's just a totally different feeling training with a computer vs a real RC. I suggest you save some extra money and buy a cheap 4CH RC heli instead of this. You'll learn quicker from training with an actual RC than with this. For me, this is a waste of money.	-1
I bought this toy for my son's Christmas gift. But it doesn't work on Windows vistar. My son was so upset about this useless gift. I want to return this toy. but I need to pay the shipping charge to send back this defect product. I should read all the reviews first before I buy this toy as a Christmas Gift!!!	-1
a simulater replicates what the real thing is ever used a rc controller? well throttel is on the left pitch yaw, elevator.. on right.. right?  well to tally reveresed on this .. so im trying build ..instincts on the sticks .. well learn on this when you got 200 or more on a  model,crash your cash its backwards!!! i have flown real airplanes have 83 hrs solo. this would kill you in the real world..  now sims are awesome this will waste your model.. because... the inputs on this.. mirror revers from spektrum.. futuba.. nice game though...lol  forget this #$% ok get a real one.. ok?	-1
The painting is of the lamding gear is mess up. Not good.	-1
Very Good model.  Problem is how it's on the stand.  Too much weight forward, very difficult to get it to stay off the plane's nose.  I'll have to add weight to the stand or fasten it to a larger stand base.  VERY SAD!!	-1
The plane is cute.  It is small.  It may have worked, but we'll never know because the controller did not work.  Unfortunately this was discovered on Christmas morning when my son received it!! So I've sent it back and ordered another type of helicopter.  Hopefully the next one will work.  Good luck to you if you order this.  Apparently there have been many that have worked!  Just not ours.	-1
After reading all the positive reviews and knowing many of these kind of helicopters get terrible reviews I felt this one was the one to buy.  My son opened it on his birthday and then charged it being so excited. Never got off the ground!!!  So upset for him.  Mailed it back that same day. I am still looking for a good one to replace it.	-1
Got this for my son for Christmas the truck is built well. Has held up to lots of abuse. But as kids are it has got broke, finding parts is a nightmare. On Amazon its not clear on the a arm I need, nitrorcx wants 2 buck for the part but 17 bucks to ship. I want to like the truck but parts are a joke. If I could get parts for a good price and easy to get I would give it 5 stars.	-1
Ok, this is the 2nd one of these I bought.  Sent the first one back because one prop would never stop spinning.  This one the headlights stopped working in the first 3 minutes of flight. And no, it was not because of a crash. But speaking of crashing, this unit is nowhere near as stable as the Hubsan X4.  Now, you put THAT one in a protective cage like this and you would really have something.  Here, all you have is a cage that protects the flying unit, but the flying unit is not very good to begin with.	-1
Terible worked for 30 mins	-1
I give it 1 star only because it came ahead f schedule, other than that, how anybody else who knows anything about the rc world can give this thing more than maybe 2 stars is beyond me. Were do I start, lets see, got it May 29, ran it around for a bit and I was surprised low level crawler was doing really good. Took to crawl some rocks and dirt the next day, not even 24 hours out of the box and for some reason it started out good but after 10 minutes its not climbing anything very well, must be the battery, its dead. Charge it up, lets go again, oh wait, same thing, hmmmm, what could it be, oh wow look at that, the rear axle is pushing but front axle is just spinning. Ok so lets pick it up and test something, with the rear wheels on the ground it wants to push like its crawling, put the front down and pick up the back with the front tires on the ground and the driveshaft just spins and tires don't even feel like they want to move. Well to make this story shorter, rear axle started doing the same thing few hours later, so lets see if we can figure what happened, let me notify the seller also and see if maybe something is wrong with mine sine this has a 4 1/2 start review. Well I figured it out and the locker inside the front and rear axles is garbage, its not even a good locker, its cheap plastic, so I start looking for parts. Mind you I sent the seller a email about my problem so, now back to the parts thing, there are some but not much, most of the main stuff like the main gear they don't have, its out of stock like everywhere and don't worry the upgraded one is out of stock also. So now I don't know what to do, I have a crawler that doesnt crawl and also its beyond slow, maybe three to four mph. Next day, finally seller emails me back and informs me of a website, Nitrorcx.com and they have every part for this truck. Well since I was already at that site I knew that was wrong, I emailed them back and the basically told me I can return it and get my money back or get a new one but thats it, no more returns. So basically they are telling  me if I return it for a new one Iam screwed if something is wrong with that one also. I don't know what to do cause this was for my son who saved and worked is butt off for 2 months. This truck need modifications to be a decent truck, not good, decent. I don't think the regular person who doesnt know rc should get this truck cause as we all know you get what you pay for, as far as the seller, rude and unknowledgeable, if your going to sell something at least know the product before you ship me off to someone else. If I could take away a 1/2 star I would.	-1
These do NOT GLOW! We put them out in direct sunlight from 12pm -7pm. Hid them at 7pm. 7:30pm absolutely NO glow for the kids.	-1
Does not glow at all. Not worth the money.	-1
Never used them. I thought it came with an easter basket. Waste of money.	-1
It took too much time to keep in dark for them to glow. Egg was very flimsy quality, and the color without glowing was not a pretty color. Sorry. I ended up throwing them away. You usually don't use Easter eggs at night when the glowing would be more appropriate.	-1
The lights went out pretty quickly for these. By the time we had finished hiding them, they were already dimming noticeably. I think the photos shown might be taken under blacklight, because ours were never that bright even after hours of light exposure.  Also, it's not so obvious from the photos, but these eggs are not plain -- they have a religious cross symbol on each of them. Just keep that in mind, depending on your purposes for them.	-1
poorly made, and obviously bootleg, it had 3 long white strings coming out of its neck. not to mention the ears and tail are only made from a single piece of fabric. I wish I could get my money back on this.	-1
This is a bootleg item, that's why it's so cheap. Not that I'm saying you shouldn't buy it, but if you're looking for the legitmate item you're in the wrong place.	-1
Kept crashing and didn't work like it was supposed to.	-1
i should have payed more attention to the pictures, when i ordered these i thought they were going to be the nendoroids from the first picture but they in fact are not...i realized it after i got them in the mail. The ones you get are those in the second and third pic, they are clearly lower quality the colors are way off on some of them and the details aren't painted on them at all. I should have noticed (by the price) that they weren't the originals, but at less than $4 a piece ill simply paint the corrections myself. The ones in the first pic currently sell for around $25 each. You can compare the quality between the pics yourself, i was disappointed but i don't think my purchase was a total loss. after i repaint them they'll still look nice in my collection until i have the money to replace them with originals.	-1
When I received this order I found that I had two Rins instead of having a Len and then they expect me to pay for shipping to return this item when this was their mistake in the first place!!! Because of their mistake I am now stuck with an incomplete Vocaloid set! Besides from that the box was in terrible condition when I received it and some of the Vocaloid characters are terribly painted to where it looks like they are faded such as Luka's hair which is more of a lavender than a bright pink and Miko's hair was blonde instead of brown. Horrible customer service and horrible item; I will never buy from this company ever again and I recommend everyone to do the same.	-1
I was excited to get this for my daughter who loves Curious George, but it's a very flimsy and small lunch box that isn't big enough to hold a substantial lunch, and the metal easily warps. It seems to be meant for display only, and could carry snacks, but doesn't hold up to being brought back and forth from school every day and holding a square meal for lunch. Very disappointed!	-1
While this is a cute tin box (and I used it to hold mini-muffins at at baby shower), it isn't meant to be used.  Would look cute as a decoration in a baby's room or to hold all those crayon's for an older child.	-1
Cheap junk. I expected standard metal lunchbox quality. This is a very thin metal, with a latch that is no match for any child. Ours now holds medicine and bandaids, since it is useless for children.	-1
Cheaply made. I could probably get one just like this on a claw machine for $1.	-1
This is just a peice of plastic that you pop onto a piece of cardboard.  Not the quality of the game I had as a kid. Junk.	-1
This is such a cheap version of what I had growing up. The board is just a piece of cardboard snapped in to the back of the plastic top. The bubble to pop seems like its going to get stuck every time. I would not purchase again.	-1
Classic game.... however the "push" part is SO STIFF that neither me or my 5 year old granddaughter can push it down to pop the dice. Very disappointed.	-1
very low quality board	-1
Game fell apart - it's really really cheap.	-1
Just basically a calculator with a drawer that opens	-1
not like the sturdy game of old, very flimsy	-1
Flimsy game, with an unprotected cardboard top that easily tears and wrinkles.  The old game was much more durable, though my kids liked some of the new twists in this version.	-1
Seriously?  I remember seeing Mindtrap in stores when I was younger, and always wanting to get it because of the cool art.  I bought this game at a garage sale for a few bucks, and thank goodness I did.  The questions on these cards fall into one of three categories: so easy it's silly, so ridiculous that there's no way you could get the single right answer that is printed on the back of the card, or silly math involving oddball fractional answers.  I guess if you were to play this game alone, it might make for a few good logic questions, but otherwise, it's no fun whatsoever.	-1
As with most games, the new generation has build quality problems which distract from gameplay.	-1
This is such a piece of junk! I can't believe Hasbro would make something so inferior! Thin plastic barely sits flat. Cheap paper graphics that sits under plastic. The bubble is smaller than original and the dice can barely tumble around. Box is thin like cereal box. A disposable game that won't last long. I wish people would return just to get the point across!	-1
I really like this game. Its a great way to teach logic.  This version of Mastermind could be much improved.  The tray is not large enough to store all of the pegs.  The piece that covers the secret code is just in the way.  The tiny red and white pieces that you use to signal whether the player has guessed the correct color or placement of the pegs must be placed into tiny holes in a strange square configuration.  My elderly dad has trouble getting those pieces into the holes due to his eyesight.  I can think of a much better way to design this game.	-1
This arrived twice with a bad drawer. Waste of money.	-1
Be advised that this is not the classic one.  You will receive the new version.  There is a seller that does sell the classic version.	-1
This is what happens when a company decides that they can make much more money by re-making a very popular game as cheaply  as possible (made in china) and then charging more for it. I ordered the game that is pictured and was willing to pay the $20 price tag because my grandkids have one and love it. What I received from School Specialty was "the new and improved" cheaply made version that sells at Walmart for $6. Stay away from this Hasbro disaster.	-1
False advertising! They charge you for the good sturdy version of the game and then send you the crappy one you can buy from Wal-mart for $5!!	-1
Make sure you verify which version you will receive before you place your order.  I received the newer version of the game that is VERY CHEAPLY made.  I searched to find the older one that's pictured.	-1
I just received this in the mail, and am so disappointed with the quality. I know it's not very expensive, but it couldn't have cost more than $3.00 to make. The box does not look like the picture here--it is white, generic-looking and is paper thin and flimsy, and I'm sure the game itself is cheap looking too. The box top does not lift off like you would think.  It is a Christmas present for my son, and he'll probably be fine with it, but what happened to the days when board games came in sturdy cardboard boxes that would last for years? Is there a specific company that still produces board games of quality material?	-1
The version received can be found in Walmart right now for about $7.77. Even without a discounted price, the game is only about $10.00. I paid the almost $17.00 in hopes of receiving the actual one and got this off-brand version instead. At least that's what I call it. If this version is supposed to be an upgrade from the original, I must not know what upgrade really means. This ones is cheaply made and not nearly as nice or as decorative as the original. I am very disappointed, especially since they had the audacity to keep the original picture of the board game up. Also for an extra note, when I purchased this I do not recall the other pictures that I see now visible when I first found this seller. Makes me wonder, because this version of Trouble is not worth $17 or so. It doesn't even sell for that much at Toys R Us without a discount. Highly disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone that has played the original version of Trouble. You will not be pleased.	-1
The kids got bored fast	-1
We purchased this as part of our classic Christmas - it's very cheaply put together.  The bubble pops, the pieces fit in their slot...but it's flimsy; even the box it is stored in is flimsy and not like other board game boxes.  Would not buy another - rather look for a vintage/ better made one.	-1
I returned it because it cost like $13 or $14, and it was put together so very cheaply. Can hardly push down the bubblmy 4 yr old g'son could not with 2 hands! Needs to be revised.	-1
The storage area doesn't close well. I have to put a plastic bag around the whole board before storing it. I don't like the new peg colors. Great idea to revamp the board. Redesign it and I will buy it. Terrific game.	-1
Stinks.	-1
This isn't the same as I remember as as child. The board is a flimsy plastic and the popper is kind of sad.	-1
great game just a bit cheap plastic not too comfortable to store the little pins which can get lost very fast	-1
Yes...the educaton value is there, so is the durability, but what most of the reviewers are neglecting to tell you is that this toy can hurt your child!! Is made of a hard plastic. My son grabbed a hold of it and swung it wildly, stirking himself in the face. He also go his arm caught in the toy on more than one occasion. I took it off of him and packed it away with some baby clothes. It resurfaced when the clothes were open when my daughter was born, but I made sure she didn't get a hold of this.	-1
The board size is needlessly too large.  Despite the large size, the build in storage for the pegs is too small and poorly designed.  It lacks a storage box or bag making it messy.  Does not stack among our other games.  The packaging is quite large suggesting there may have been a storage container hidden inside, but no such luck.  Regret this purchase.	-1
There's nothing wrong with the actual product itself, it's just that I really don't like that faulty new design. The old one was much better and stayed put...with this one, you can easily knock over the board, the pegs can't fit in the peg holder so they spill everywhere and the part that blocks the code is pretty flimsy. I wish they hadn't changed the design of the game so much.  THE GAME ITSELF IS ENGAGING AND FUN, JUST HATE THE DESIGN OF THE NEW BOARD.	-1
The game concept is good, and I'd heard it was very fun, but this version is made on the cheap. Extremely lightweight and flimsy, the base doesn't feel like it would survive an accidental drop. I might get an older copy that is more substantial, but I do not recommend this game.	-1
Mastermind the game is a good game, but Pressman makes the worst quality components of any game manufacturer, and this game is no exception.  The box is really flimsy and the colored pegs do not fit in the plastic container.  Better to find an electronic version since it works better as a 1 player game.	-1
I had Mastermind as a child and loved it.  For our wedding, we registered for this - the new version.  The box is CHEAP - it will fall apart very easily.  It is also way too big for what is included inside.  The plastic board is also cheap, and the wall between the two types of pegs does not keep the pegs from mixing, so you end up picking the different pegs out of the other slot - time consuming!  Plus, the trays are so poorly constructed that it is almost impossible to close the lid without getting pegs stuck so that it can't close.  They should have just used the same construction as the old sets, and they'd have been much better off.	-1
It's just a big calculator nothing else. I thought it would say the numbers when you punched a number or the scanner tool would beep to pretend to scan and it makes no sound	-1
Stratego was introduced in the United States in the early 1960s. Offering strategic elements of chess on a familiar board game motif, it became a very popular game in American households during the 1960s and 70s. By 2000, no doubt caving to constant reports of how stupid American children were becoming, Hasbro changed the numbering system on the pieces, completely inverting the familiar 1-9 scale. Historically, the most powerful piece (Marshall) was marked "1" while the least powerful piece (Scout) was marked "9." More recent editions contain pieces marked in the opposite manner, with higher ranked (i.e., stronger) pieces displaying higher numbers. This decision was not met with universal applause, and in response (or perhaps it was planned all along to generate multiple streams of revenue?), Hasbro released a "Vintage" edition. So if you wish to own the same Stratego game you grew up playing, you are forced to find an older game or else purchase the more expensive Vintage edition. Another pitfall for would-be buyers is that Hasbro recently capitalized on the popular fantasy theme, releasing a version of Stratego which replaces the classic Napoleonic army with medieval themed pieces (i.e., dragon, dwarf, slayer). Confusingly, this version is NOT named Stratego--the D&D Battle or Stratego--the Fire and Ice Edition or any other moniker that might be helpful in distinguishing among them. Note also that this version also reduced the number of pieces from forty to thirty.  To recap, there are three current Hasbro (Milton Bradley) offerings. They are all offered on Amazon (at varying price levels) and I will cross reference the manufacturer's part numbers and also provide the relevant links to the games on Hasbro's Web site, although you cannot purchase directly there.  ==================================================== <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stratego-Nostalgia/dp/B0001AGYFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stratego Nostalgia</a> Hasbro Item #40836 (See Comments section below for link.)  The Vintage edition (confusingly titled "Nostalgia" by Amazon) offers the proper (in my opinion!) numbering system, and comes in a keepsake wooden box. ==================================================== <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stratego-Milton-Bradley-Board-Games/dp/B00000DMFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stratego-Milton Bradley Board Games</a> Hasbro Item #04714 (See Comments section below for link.)  The basic Stratego (post-2000) edition offers the proper number of pieces (40) but the inverted ranking system. This last and most important point is not obvious until you scrutinize the Product Details. ("This new, updated version of Stratego is slightly different than the original, though the gameplay is the same.") Plus you need to apply the stickers yourself! Ouch, Hasbro cheaped out. ==================================================== <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stratego/dp/B0019L5ZZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stratego</a> Hasbro Item #45068 (See Comments section below for link.)  The fantasy-themed version with 30 pieces. Again, Amazon has failed to adequately label the game, simply titling it "Stratego." However the Product Features make it clear. ("Choose to lead warriors from an ancient arctic realm or a fierce army from a land of fiery molten lava.") ====================================================  Your best bet? If you simply want the same game you grew up playing, just look for a cardboard boxed set from the 70s or 80s. For example, this version (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stratego-The-Classic-Game-of-Battlefield-Strategy-1986-Edition/dp/B0028LEM26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stratego - The Classic Game of Battlefield Strategy 1986 Edition</a>) is the same one I have. I have owned it for many years with no complaints. Finding one for yourself, however, might be trickier than you think. Unless you buy it here from a Amazon Marketplace vendor--which is not recommended, given the ridiculous prices--you are left to your own devices to find it in a used game store or at a garage sale. Alternatively, you can buy one of the currently offered versions. But as I have demonstrated, they are not all the same as one another, and indeed very few are identical to what you may have grown up playing.  P.S. After much further research, I believe either of these two sets (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stratego-Vintage-Wood-Book-Edition/dp/B00285LPMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stratego Vintage Wood Book Edition</a>) or (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Library-Stratego-Game-Set/dp/B000AFDIDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Library Stratego Game Set</a>) are equivalent to the Vintage edition described above, and at least one may be available inexpensively at Target.	-1
Biggest disappointment in a toy i have ever seen. First of the quality of this thing is atrocious.  The solar powered calculator is really weak, you need a good lighted room for the calculator to work.  Another flaw especially your place is a bit on the darker side. The plastic is such horrible quality that its not even close to be worth the price they are selling this for... it should be 5 bucks at most, not even.  Rip off quality at a rip off price.  Such a huge waste of a purchase.	-1
Fell apart in a day	-1
Awesome idea for pretend play but the buttons get stuck making it very difficult for my 7 year old to open the register.	-1
This is a cute cash register for kids and the money is realistic looking. We are disappointed however that it arrived in a non- working condition. The included battery for the beep sounds was present, but the beeps didn't work when pressing keys. We replaced the battery and still no beeps. The calculator function works on solar power so it was fine. Disappointed because the grandkids would of liked the beeping sounds like a real cash register. We are not returning because it's too much of a hassle for a 30$ toy.	-1
Arrived in pink. Would of loved to give as a Xmas gift. Just sent it back.	-1
I ordered this red/blue register for Christmas. It looked just like the register they use in my grand daughter's preschool The box clearly showed what I ordered however on Christmas morning a pink register was removed from that box and I was looking forward to the "cha-ching" sound when opening cash drawer. I want to exchange it for the one I actually ordered but my 5 year old grand daughter doesn't want me to take it from her	-1
Stopped working after 3 days	-1
This product did not ring or make any sounds. I returned this item.	-1
Broken when I opened it ... "Open" button is jammed after 5 minutes out of the box. Disappointing present for my 3 year old!	-1
Got as a Christmas gift. Broke less than 6 months later. Was very fun for the kids while it worked, but it just locked up and you can't open the drawer or run the calculator. Poor quality!!!	-1
This was great when we first got it. I was excited about the solar to power instead of lots of batteries. However, 4 months later, it's not working at all. The drawer opens but the display is dead. I've changed the small watch battery and even set it outside in the sun for a few hours thinking that maybe the light in the house wasn't strong enough. Nope. Maybe mine was a defective unit but it certainly wasn't abused or even played with to an exceptionally high degree in the 4 months that we had it.	-1
This is solar powered and only works when I'm using it outside in the sun it does not work inside of my house. I did not buy this to use outside.	-1
Stopped working shortly after purchased	-1
I like the idea of this game, bought it for my 7yo son. We played this once a couple months ago (he got it for Xmas) and haven't played it since. Kind of a lot of rules and the cards only stack up one way (they're shaped like a piece of bread so if you turn them 180 degrees they don't stack nice). Not a fan.	-1
Well this is a cute toy and we did really like it until it broke! We got it for Christmas and it lasted 2 months before the beeping noise when you press the key pad, and the screen stopped working. And trust me when I say- that was with VERY limited use. We only have 1 child who is 3 and he had so many other toys that this one didn't get much attention right away. He was very upset when it stopped working. and to top it off, we couldn't find a place to replace any batteries because it works on solar power like the older calculators do. Disappointed! Would NOT recommend. Especially for the price!	-1
The game is kind of cute but the shape of the cards makes holding them in your hand awkward and uncomfortable. It's even worse for little hands.	-1
My kids LOVE games but this one was tossed in the trash within a few months.  My sons and I didn't like it and my daughters incorporated the pieces into their kitchen as play food.	-1
When this item arrived it looked like it had been used.  I was skeptical but didn't want to hassle with a return.  I liked the idea that the cash register worked as a calculator, giving my preschoolers an opportunity to interact with numbers and math in a real way during their play.  The digital display is so faint that sometimes you can't even see the numbers on the screen.  The credit card slide beeps when you run the card into it, but it is barely audible.  I was immensely disappointed in these things, but kept the cash register so the students could still open and close the door, pretend, and handle the play money.  Now after just a few months the "open" button is no longer working.  This item had awesome reviews and I haven't found any of the key features to be worthwhile.  This wasn't worth the money and I even got it on sale.  I shoul dhave sent it back!	-1
Not nearly as fun as the other Gamewright games.  We own about 7 different ones.  Confusing directions.	-1
I don't know why companies always feel the need to redesign things. The graphics on this game are really ugly. I purchased one about 8 years ago which had much cuter graphics. A classic game but this version is NOT	-1
Does my 4 year old like it?  Yes. Which is why it gets two stars. The game goes on FOREVER!  I'm not sure why there are not more complaints about this. The game could last 30 minutes, easily without some creative losing by an adult. I am all for a longer game, but that is not what I look for in a card game for kids. A strategy game, sure. This one is being hidden on the top shelf of the game closet.	-1
After recently purchasing Sleeping Queens and LOVING it, adults and kids included, I started looking into other card-based games, which are perfect for travel. I bought this one based on reviews and because I thought perhaps my 4-year old daugther could easily join in as well, and hid it to be a surprise for a recent vacation.  We played it once. It NEVER ends. Like literally, once you get down to two people, I cannot see any way this game ever ends. And that sucks. Really, my daughter and I were the last two left, and ended up playing for 20 minutes after everyone else had left, eventually deciding to end and eat ice cream. Such a boring game in general, and it goes on and on and on.  Get Sleeping Queens.	-1
My full video review can be found here http://www.gameboygeek.com/#!pit-deluxe/ckdt	-1
I returned this cash register sadly, all the keys when touched made a terrible annoying sound, and it was one of the cheaper cash registers but you could see why.	-1
I bought this game for my 7 year old son who is crazy for card games, but this was too much.  It's a little complicated at first but my 10 year old started to catch on to the rules and enjoyed it.  I wouldn't recommend it for a child under the age of 9-10.	-1
I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards.  What a waste of money it was!  It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination (two of the same next to each other ("a double decker") or two of the same cards on either side of a different card ("a slamwich").  There is absolutely no educational value to this game, it's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam.	-1
Update: The fact that the cash register is really a calculator was confusing to a 9 year-old in addition to my 6 year-old.  The older girl is well into learning money, and she was expecting a real cash register readout.  I echo other reviewers who say the readout is difficult to see.  The contrast is so low that it is hard to see in regular room light.  This is a big deal when you're looking for the decimal point.  "1.5" looks like "15"  This really frustrated the girls because they were trying to add up the purchases.  My 6 year-old daughter really likes the actual-sized money and large buttons on the register, but the fact that the register is really a calculator is confusing at times when it comes to dealing with money.  For instance, $4.50 reads on the calculator as 4.5 - not how we usually represent money.  Also, to give change back, you either have to start with what the customer gives you and then re-enter the total or hit the "-" sign and ignore or explain the negative number.  For instance, if the total comes to $4.50 and you give a $5 bill, the total will read 4.5.  To make change, you either have to clear the total and enter "5 - 4.5" or start with the total and enter "- 5".  Had I realized the implications of having a calculator rather than $ notation to a 6 year-old, I would have chosen a different cash register that always displays 2 decimal points (4.50 instead of 4.5) and allows you to make change more easily.  I believe there's another Learning Resources cash register that does this.	-1
I would give it less if it was possible. Bought this for my son for Christmas and the "solar power" is a joke! It doesn't work! If you hold it in the window sill tipped to the sun it will work but otherwise it's useless! My son likes the drawer and pretending to be a grocery store so he won't let me return it but I'm really unhappy the adding function doesn't work. Basically it's just a place to put the pretend money. Thank goodness the drawer at least opens and closes or it would be in the trash. VERY DISAPPOINTED.	-1
Game is just too difficult.	-1
Definitely not the same quality as when I was a kid. The people are very flimsy, thin cardboard, and the spinner broke after one use.	-1
The  game was  in  worse  condition  than  described  by  seller,  the game  pieces  were  falling  apart  as well as  the  box.  The  game  itself  was  easy  enough  for  my  5  year to  understand  but  its  hard  to  figure  out  where  the chutes  and ladders  begin  and  end.	-1
Nowhere near as good as original. The art on the board is highly distracting, the spaces where the chutes/ladders start and end are overlapping making it tricky to tell what space you are in.  Besides the poor graphic design, the message each "ladder/chute" tells a child is terrible!!  If you are carrying dishes (to a child is a helpful idea) ends up in a broken mess at the bottom of the chute. If you are reading books at the top of the slide (also a great thing for a child) you are bored at the bottom of the chute. The scenarios go on like this.  My 3 1/2 yr old was perplexed by the scenarios and stopped playing after reaching space 21.  She normally LOVES games ( Busytown, Busy Airport, Mystery Garden, Dominoes, Sneaky Snaky Squirrel, Racoon Rumpus, Hoppy Floppy Bunny, Deep Dark Woods...)	-1
the new characters look creepy	-1
The board is so flimsy that if (or I should say "when") it gets bumped, the pieces move around and it's difficult to remember where they were.  The pieces are too large for the squares they sit on, and the graphics are confusing.  I did not enjoy playing with the kids at all.  Maybe the "classic" game offered here on Amazon is better.	-1
Chutes and Ladders is an awesome game. A childhood classic that our toddler's grandparents even played. My issue with this version is nothing more than the quality of the board. The game is meant for 3 year olds. The board ripped after the first use while folding it to put back in the box. I would rather pay more and have a quality board. We ended up playing my in-laws 30 year old version instead.	-1
Remember the old Candy Land from your childhood? Well this isn't it! It has no cards and the board is completely different. Did not have fun was not what I expected.	-1
This is a terrible remake of a classic game.  The board is much smaller and the chutes and ladders graphics are so oversized that they cover the individual squares. The pieces are so big compared to the smaller squares that they are easily accidentally moved to another square, and you easily lose your place.  The graphics are so awful that this game was actually WORK to play.  This was one of my favorite games as a kid, and the new one is so poorly designed as to be unusable.  Fans of this game, don't waste your money!	-1
Meh, we bought a Candy Land about 10 years ago and it was pretty torn up, so I bought this.  I like the vertical board better, but the characters are not so great.  The pirate looks really evil, the lady is barely dressed. This is for kids? Come on!	-1
I don't remember buying this product so it's very hard to rate something you don't remember.  I don't know what else to say.	-1
was looking for the original chutes and ladders for my 4 year old, and this is not it.  feel a bit duped by the seller, as i was led to believe by the post that this was actually the original one.	-1
The frosty fairy has been remade since we were children. She looks like an over sexualized Bratz Doll now. Very disappointing. Other than that, the game was fine.	-1
That half-gallon of orange juice has been shaved down to 59 ounces.  Your 8-oz. container of yogurt is now 6 oz.  What used to be a half-gallon of ice cream is now 1.5 quarts.  It used to be that T-shirts you purchased held up for at least a year.  These days, they're paper-thin and fall apart after a single washing.  And now...  I discover that even board games are not immune to shrinkage.  With the cost of rising raw materials, manufacturers attempt to increase their profits without hiking their prices.  A common tactic is to decrease the amount of materials used to make the product, which is what Hasbro has done.  Their strategy fails miserably with Chutes and Ladders.  Did Hasbro even product-test the new version?  First, I want to say, I think C&L is a great game. It's educational because it tries to teach beginner math skills and instill some morals through the pictorial depictions on the game board.  I have fond memories of playing it as a preschooler during the early 1980's (yikes), but this current version, which my daughter has, fills me with annoyance every time she drags it out.  The size of the board is now 20"x15".  I seem to remember it being closer to at least 24"x20" (don't quote me on that by the way, I just know that it used to be a lot bigger!)  If that's true, then the playing area has been reduced by a good 40%.  The base of the player pieces are now circular instead of rectangular.  If two players land on the same spot, they can't both fit.  I don't remember bumping into each other being an issue in the old version.  For what it's worth, Candy Land (also by Hasbro) has shrunk to 20"x15", too and now includes smaller gingerbread men playing pieces and color block cards.  I'm not thrilled about that, either, but the new Candy Land is still playable.  Some games can tolerate more shrinkage than others.	-1
The images on this game board are shrunken down so small it's difficult to look at! They should have used a larger board or simpler graphics.	-1
I ordered this for my young children, reflecting nostalgically on my own childhood during which I would sit in front of this game board and play with the pieces for what seemed like hours. I was hoping for the same experience for them. Unfortunately they've remade the game where it now reflects that chaotic scenes in children's television programming. The game board is smaller, super crowded, and way too busy. It was difficult to even follow the colored road! I felt overstimulated just glancing at the board. It was really disappointing.	-1
I don't understand why, but this game has changed since I was a kid. The concept and game play is the same, but the board is terribly laid out. My young children cannot figure out which direction to go, and frankly, I have to look very carefully in order to help her. The game takes a long time to play, and often we get confused about direction and such, because the board is so busy and cluttered. I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp. I wish it was easier to play, like the version I remember from my own childhood.	-1
It's so busy you can barely find the road.  I like the old candyland and bought it on ebay.	-1
There are three items* SOMEONE should warn parents about before they buy them. This is one of them. I only wish someone had told ME years ago...  Yes, this game is cute and easy to play. Yes, it's famous. And yes, it's probably educational.  But be warned - it is THE most boring game in the universe. After ten minutes you will find yourself in a stupor. You'll look at the board and begin trying to calculate how much time it will take for the game to END. Soon you'll feel the urge to throw your chair through the window...not the loving-family-ambience you were expecting.  AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK THE GAME IS JUST ABOUT OVER, YOUR KID FALLS DOWN A CHUTE AND HAS TO START OVER ALMOST AT THE BEGINNING. You will find yourself lying to your children, telling them a "2" means "Move 4", and secretly scribbling over the chutes at midnight with a fat-tipped indelible black marker while spouting gibberish and drooling.  Let your kids play this at pre-school. Give it to the grandparents. JUST DO NOT ALLOW THIS GAME IN YOUR HOUSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY.  *the other two are Candy Land and the book "The Little Engine That Could"	-1
I bought this for my son as a first game, and I've played it with him, as well as his younger sister, who is now 4 years old.  I cringe every time they want to play this game.  The board is so busy looking, and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by.  It's confusing to kids about which way they're to go on the board (first they go left, then they go up, then they go right, etc.)  I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides, et al, tell them which direction to go, etc.  This is not one of the best counting games out there.  Try Hi Ho Cherry-O.  MUCH better game!	-1
I just played this game with my oldest son who is 6.  I felt like we had fallen into in infinite time loop anomaly, and a boring one at that.  Where to start?  First, there's the cheesy cardboard gender specific pieces, and if you have a combination of genders not supported by the pieces, tough.  Why not just do something colorful and abstract like other games.  Add to that the cardboard stand-up pieces are too tall and continually falling over and getting in the way when opponents are continualy passing each other and landing on the same squares as they are continually reaching for that magic 100 and getting sent down a slide to oblivion only to begin the process again.  Then there's the infinite and tedious gameplay.  Move in straight lines back and forth on a mostly featureless board counting up to 100 as you spin a spinner and hope against hope that you get to climb a ladder and avoide a "chute" (which is actually a slide).  I suppose it's great if you want to teach a child to count to 100 and keep playing at reaching a goal no matter how much bad luck befalls him or her, but Candyland can do that (well, not the 100 part but the goal part, and the kids don't need to know how to count to 100) and it's a lot more fun.  The other adults (my wife and a friend) that I mention this game to both remember playing it as a child and changing the rules just so the game will finally end.  So, what's the point in this game?  Seriously, this game might have been great in its day, whenever that was, but you've got a lot more options now.  Those kids don't stay little and cute forever, so why not buy a geniunely fun game to play with them?	-1
I know this is a "classic" but in this version my almost 5 year old son (and myself actually) have trouble following the track.  You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again.  The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously cannot follow the higher numbers.  So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way.  It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.  The "water color" pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be.  Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one.	-1
not a good product, it has very basic functions and this kind of features are available in 10$ registers at toysrus...very expensive and not worth the bucks. secondly the quality of material is very poor.	-1
This is not the classic version of the game as pictured. I do not need inappropriate looking fairies on a kid's game.  Disappointed, and returning.	-1
Really small.	-1
The reason for giving one star is because the manufacture is misleading the customer's with wrong description. As per the description, "The Big Blocks ABC Alphabet Blocks are painted with letters, numbers and objects". Well that's not true. In the box it's ONLY colored ABC alphabets. There are no numbers and objects. MISLEADING.  And the product does smell paint.	-1
These are the only wooden block we could find in such a large size. I'm kind of disappointed in them. The paint is stamped on pretty messy, so on some the raised letter doesn't line up with the paint quite right. The paint easily chips off of the textured sides. Also, several of the blocks have huge cracks in the wood that go down an entire side of the block, nearly cutting it in half. This makes them hard to stack and also makes me worry about splintering in the future. I would not buy these again or recommend them.	-1
We got these as a gift for my one year old's birthday. These smell SO STRONGLY of chemicals! Since they're made in China I'm rather concerned about my child to putting these in her mouth.	-1
Small little set not what I expected.  Found a much nicer larger set at one of the big dollar chains.  A waste and not a good gift. Looks cheap	-1
These Larger Size Blocks are a Nice Size But LACKING QUALITY CONTROL. The Paint is Missing on A lot of the blocks & they are giving off a Bad Chemical Smell on top of that. I Would Not Let Kids Play with these right away, AIR THEM OUT FIRST. I Bought these for my photography with kids and hoped to add another two sets to my Prop box But I Will Not Be Buying Any More. I hope I didn't just waste my money, these are made in China too. I Hope this feedback Helps. Truly Gerard	-1
Please see the reviews of this game from the other sellers on Amazon.  Most buyers call it a piece of junk.  Also check prices of the various sellers.  http://www.amazon.com/Candy-Land-Kingdom-Sweets-Board/dp/B00000DMF5/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1409928779&sr=1-1&keywords=candy+land	-1
These blocks arrived looking like they had been slightly used. I thought, okay, no big deal, but then the paint begain chipping off more.  Cheap blocks. It's what I get for the price payed.	-1
I'm not sure how these blocks got any positive reviews. Most important to me...all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read "elerhant". The pictures over all are not great. The grapes look like cherries...have you ever seen candy apple red grapes? The apples look like red pumpkins. Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters...confusing to a child trying to learn. Additionally, the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some. They have a strong odor (kind of like clay). Lastly, they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description. I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend.	-1
The blatant sexualization of the female characters pictured inside the board, which are not shown in the pictures, is very disappointing. Shame on me for not reading the reviews before the purchase.	-1
This game is sadistic. I'm fairly sure that is does more to desensitize players to death than to actually inspire us become surgeons when we grow up.  The buzzer haunts my dream at night. That said, if it needs to exist then it should be the classic version without any "new" or "updated" pieces.	-1
7 yr old is not impressed. First time playing it, one of the pieces slid inside the hole to where it was impossible to even touch it without the buzzer going off. Buzzer going off vibrated the board and moved more pieces out of reach. I'm amazed because I remember loving this game but kiddo refuses to try it again. "That one's no fun. Let's give it away."	-1
My son loved this toy, but we returned it as the digital display never functioned properly and displayed only gibberish rather than numbers. Sure, I got my money back, but did not appreciate the hassle. Also, the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time... my son needs no help making messes. Looking at other brands as I'm very hesitant to buy this product again.	-1
It was cheap- the quality the look.  I didn't like it and sent it back right away. It wasn't what I was imagining to complete the grocery store I wanted for them.	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter after reading the positive reviews.  Sadly, within a few hours of having this cash register, the drawer would not stay closed.  We try to close it, and it latches for a couple of seconds, then springs open on its own.  If we had been more proactive, we would have returned this for another brand.	-1
To describe this toy in brief I'd have to say all it is is a large calculator that makes a "ding" noise when it opens. I purchased it for my 6 year old so she can practice math through productive play but for what I spent ($33) I was better off purchasing her fake money from the 99cent store and a large calculator, I would've save a good amount of bucks and it wouldve been the same effect. The dollar bills and coins do not look realistic as advertised and it is not solar powered it uses a cell battery. So much for reading reviews! If it didn't cost dam near as much as I paid for it to send it back I wouldve sent it back as soon as I opened it and tried it out. It didn't captivate her amusement but for 30min. There are better options out there. DON'T BUY THIS TOY FOR MORE THAN $10 As for durability it is sturdy. The plastic is very thick.	-1
If you notice most 5 star reviews are dated pre 2006. It seems the board has been changed since then. I bought this for my son and was expecting the classic candy land game...I was very surprised to see the changes that have been made. This version is very busy...which causes it to lose a lot of it's charm (and give me a headache). This game is meant for toddlers...the board shouldn't be a chaotic mess.  Not a good update in my opinion.  If something isn't broke, don't try to "fix" it.	-1
I couldn't wait to buy Candy Land for my daughter.  I loved Candy Land when I was younger & I remember being jealous of the newer, cooler versions that came out after "my time".  I couldn't wait to open this box...but I was very disappointed when I opened the box.  The game board is TOO busy!  It's jam-packed with colors, characters, candy, scenery, etc.  It's hard to even see what's going on!  It's overwhelming.  & honestly, it's ugly!  we are considering buying a used version of this game that is not so ugly.  this board game is over-designed & poorly designed.  it's sad what has happened to this game...they should have left it well enough alone a few versions ago...	-1
Waste of money / difficult to put together/ direction in Spanish/ put back in box didn't play/  Cheap pieces	-1
I ordered this game for a Candyland themed birthday party I am throwing simply because the picture showed it would be the 1997 version. But that is not what I received!!! I looked all over for the 1997 version because that's the version I grew up with and that is the game board I was basing my entire party off of. I received the newest released version and I HATE it. I am so mad at the false advertisement that I have considered returning the game and just not having the game at the party, but our guests have requested we have the game so I am keeping it. Definitely going in a garage sale after the party.	-1
It doesn't work. There should be a 3rd hand on the pipes.  The Amazon photo ( took a screen shot) shows an extra hand.  This is critical to keep the helping hand moving sideways. If you can get the helping hand to hit the platform thingy it will work.  I have added a photo of what was in the box and a photo of what is on Amazon's website.  Otherwise game pieces seem sturdy and workable.	-1
Cheaply made junk.  Yep was hoping for mouse trap that would be fun for hours for my kids instead got plastic junk!!!  They don't make toys like they use too.  Arrived fast as promised	-1
There's a piece missing even though it said all the pieces were included so the product doesn't even work :( you have to minipylate the trap by hand which kind of defeats the purpose. I added a pic of the piece that is missing	-1
Best Age: 3  Pros: In theory, the game would teach a toddler to wait his/her turn, how to match colors to move along the path, and then the important life lesson about winning/losing and still having fun.  Cons: The entire re-design. Totally ridiculous. Don't waste your money. Go to eBay and get the real thing.  As everyone else has probably explained, the original characters from the 80's are gone. This alone wouldn't invoke such an awful rating. The problem is they were replaced with extremely intense pictures which are so detailed and huge, that the path has been narrowed and now winds through some new places (so it is longer and thinner). To be honest, I even missed the secret path when I landed on it because the game board is so busy, you can't really see where it starts. The enlarged gingerbread men (and I thought the Katy Perry video totally mocked them, uh yeah - they are fairly accurate in terms of these new creepy ones) don't even fit on the micro-spaces that comprise the path. Because the path winds around itself so many times, it is hard to follow, knock your guy an inch and suddenly you are in the next loop of the path and have jumped ahead dramatically. It now takes about double the time to play a game, in part because the path is much longer - but also because the board is harder to follow. It seems it was designed with a deranged teenage girl in mind, not three year olds. You would think they would test these products and do a side-by-side with kids comparing the new one to the old one - hands down, the original would have won.  Unfortunately, this is pretty much the only board game for 3 year olds and now it is rendered useless. By the time your child has the dexterity to move his/her piece along this narrow, windy path without being distracted by all the crazy graphics - he or she will realize how babyish this game is and will have moved along to something more challenging.  I did actually write to Hasboro directly regarding the above issues, though I doubt they will ever respond.	-1
to many pieces	-1
They forgot a piece when designing this. It won't work without it.	-1
I had fond memories of playing this game growing up, so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas.  After opening the game, however, I'm not so excited.  They have changed the board from the classic version; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls, which I'm not happy about..  Also, after playing the game as an adult, I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance.  Not super educational.  I'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store.	-1
Ugh! This game is horrible. You have to rebuild the stupid thing EVERY TIME you play, AS you play.	-1
Game was broken and had many missing pieces. Disappointed with this purchase!	-1
I do my Christmas shopping early starting in October, so the return window is now closed. My daughter unwrapped this this morning, it's Christmas today, and we were excited to play it. I took the plastic wrap and unboxed it myself as I would be inserting batteries and was shocked to find the bones were not included!  No wonder it was on sale so cheap!!!! Amazon, you need to accept a return on this item and you need to inspect the items you represent for quality. Shame on you. I buy gifts for needy children as well and thank god I did not gift this to one of them!	-1
Flimsy. Broke within a few days.	-1
Not the same as the original	-1
Missing peices	-1
I played this as a child and loved the game. It was so much fun to look at the pictures because they were so tempting (from the 50's). Sadly the game is cheaply made and the graphics are terrible and extremely ugly. I would pay more for a well made game and would much rather have the vintage graphics than these cheesy looking pictures. Ugly, ugly, ugly!	-1
A week ago this game was $20. Now it's $90!! Taking advantage of Christmas. Guess who isn't buying one. :) Have a great Christmas!!	-1
Bought for my 5 year old grandson.  It's made much more cheaply than I remember from this game many years ago. It's very frustrating because parts fall down and the sequence very rarely works. Don't waste your money.	-1
Terrible.. Does not work well at all	-1
Not like the one I had growing up. Meh.	-1
I remember the game when I was a kid. The game is still the same, however, Made In China means cheap construction. The pieces do not fit well on the board. The board is way too small. As you turn the crank the plastic pieces move and pop out of their cardboard slots. The kids just construct the pieces and turn the crank to see the action ... they don't like to play the game because of the issues with the pieces issue.	-1
Many adults don't like playing board games. Why? Because they think that all board games are more-or-less nothing more than sophisticated versions of Candyland - games which rely on nothing more complicated than random chance.  The fact is that random chance doesn't make a very interesting game for adults (unless you're making bets, I suppose), and it doesn't make a very interesting game for children either if they're used to games with more strategy involved. (My young nieces, for example, *will* ask a lot for Candyland - but only because I am not willing to play it with them very often.)  Some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children, and that's probably true, but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around, and they know that. I have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like Sleeping Queens or Crazy Eights that I have in Candyland - and, tellingly, when my older niece loses Crazy Eights she pouts and then asks to play again. When she loses Candyland, she pouts and puts the game away!  Some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game. But I do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.  Instead of Candyland, I'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - Memory, or Froggy Boogie, perhaps.  There is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.  Edit: I've found out why my niece likes this game at all. It's not for any aspect of the game itself - it's because when she loses or wins due to chance, we have her "draw a bedroom" for herself, or for us. We started doing it because she got too frustrated and upset at losing through no fault of her own.	-1
I was expecting much more fun game. My daughters are almost 4 and they get bored after 10 minutes :( It's so slow going and boring. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.	-1
Didn't order this.	-1
I loved the game as a kid.  My daughter was given this new version.  The board is different - more pop than before; cartoony characters.  I found the new board to be distracting.  Otherwise, it's about the same game I remember.	-1
Probably a really fun game. I had the old version when I was little. But I bought two of these and both of them had pieces break before I could even put it together. Cheaply made.	-1
I can't believe I spent money on this POS... the crank doesn't work and the boot has to be swung manually to make it kick the bucket (I had to bend the pole it's on to even get it to be close enough to kick it). It constantly fell apart each time we tried to add more pieces. I put this away after 1 day of frustration and my son hasn't asked to play with it since.	-1
Very poorly made. Pieces broke apart badly when trying to set it up. Never got to play it because the pieces didn't fit together n it didn't work because of it.	-1
I bought this game as a gift, so I didn't open it and test it beforehand :(  Wish I had because it didn't work.  It's used and the battery area is corroded!  Unfortunately it's past the 30 day window, and I can't return it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  Lesson learned.	-1
I wish I had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game. Paid $ 40 to get the "original" version of this game and instead got the so called updated version which has large holes and rubbish items to take out and that's it. Applied to return it but couldn't without talking to customer service. After explaining the problem she said she would issue a return slip and send the game I had ordered, which by then had gone up an incredible $ 20  to $ 60. She did agree though I should have it at the original price I ordered it for and was going to issue a $ 20 credit to my account. I presumed the matter was sorted until two days after when I received the exact same game from Amazon. I again could not return the game without talking to customer service but was unable to explain anything more than I wanted to return the game. The fact I still wanted to order the original game did not sink in with the cs agent. The agent merely commiserated with me when I said I still wanted the game and could I get it through Amazon or not as so far it didn't seem likely. The "I understand how you feel" comment I got made me decide to give up, particularly when, as I was chatting with the cs agent I noted that in the last two days the price again had risen by another $ 10.  I've now bought it through Ebay, at least I hope I have. It's a shame as I never had an unpleasant experience with Amazon before.	-1
We purchased this game for our  granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam. We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game. It sure isn't what it used to be. The plastic "organs" and "bones" slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the "surgery". They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them. Also, the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the "operative sites". Coupled with the loud buzz, our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt. Even though we explained that she wouldn't be. She said, "I don't like this game." The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed. It's really a shame that they've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing. Sadly, this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it's become junk!	-1
Worst game ever invented for a parent.  Setting it up and getting it to actually work is a nightmare.  My son and his friends do not care about playing the actual game.  Just setting off the trap.  The game always ends in arguments and as a result needs a parent referee.	-1
Just OK. First time I played this with the grandkids they enjoyed building the trap and seeing it all work. But now they just want to get to the part of capturing the mice. And they figured out how to place the mouse under the trap so it won't capture completely. So not sure they are really getting the whole idea of the game. Kids are 7 and 9. Became bored with this pretty quickly.	-1
The pieces are way too small and way too hard to get out of the spaces without making the buzzer go off.  My 6 year old doesn't find anything fun at all about this game.  The pieces get stuck under the game board and are almost impossible to get out. Save your money for something else.	-1
Perhaps it was the nostalgia, perhaps the clever packaging. Whatever compelled me to buy this game, I hope you do not fall prey to the same misguided intention. My kids hate the game. They hate the buzzer, and they hate the tiny parts that get lost in the carpet. They hate the premise. There is no educational value in this game other than learning to count money or learning that specialists get paid exorbitant amounts of money, even more than "regular" doctors. Within minutes after we installed the batteries, the red light bulb that serves as a nose no longer worked. I recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere.	-1
Bought his for my son for xmas.  We were disappointed that the game has changed since I was little.  Now you build the board as you play the game.  As a result we don't actually play the game.  We set the board up and make up our own game.	-1
If your kids are older and are really good at following the directions, maybe this could work. Otherwise you will be struggling to put this together while your kids are freaking out impatient to get started. It ruined our Christmas morning hassling with this game. Very annoying.	-1
To many rules to much crap to keep track of, not for children at all.  Children just give up and walk off.	-1
The game is kinda fun and my son loves it, but it's so cheaply built and over priced!  The plastic breaks too easily, nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place.  If your kids aren't asking for it, get them something else!	-1
I always enjoyed playing Mousetrap as a kid.  The game setup is the same, but the pieces and mechanisms are very flimsy, cheap, and low quality.  Parts do not fit on the board very well and the mechanism broke after just a couple of times setting it up.  This game is a great example of a company totally sacrificing quality for the bottom line.  A once fun game now compromised.	-1
I HATE THIS TOY!!! IT LOOKS SO MUCH FUN BUT HTEN, ONCE YOU BUY IT, IT BREAKS!!! THE TRAPS ARE BROKEN AND THE BOARD GOT SCRATCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it. The game itself is not worth playing, but the construction part can be fun. However, the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I don't think it is worth anyone's time to play with it. Not only do the parts NOT fit, but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily. My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid, but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set.	-1
Eh. Not that much fun.	-1
Got this based on the reviews and how much we enjoyed Sleeping Queens (for a game the whole family can play).  We didn't enjoy this one nearly as much.  It isn't a bad game, but when placed next to other games in our game closet this one wouldn't get chosen.	-1
my son loved this although it broke within the first ten minutes and he was not even being rough with it	-1
This game takes to much effort to figure out and play.  So we have not taken it out again to play it since Christmas.  The other games, Dweebies, Sleeping Queens, and ARGH! are way more fun!	-1
It broke when we used it just a few times. The links inbetween are flimsy that they break easily. And now it does not open up.	-1
the one I got was not the same color as shown in the photo, it was significantly different.	-1
really cool, but fasteners start to loosen and don't pop back on and stay.	-1
Clearly I got a cheaper knock off direct from China. Although I ordered the sphere with classic colors (red, lime, yellow, purple), the color of the one that arrived is more neon. The plastic is super flimsy. It arrived broken, which is no surprise since it was not in box. The black poly plastic bag that it was shipping in was also damaged, then taped up. What a disappointment!	-1
This came in a plastic bag wrapped in bubble wrap. It was partly squished and looks like it won't last very long. The plastic is flimsy looking. Not nearly as substantial feeling as the glow in the dark one I previously purchased.	-1
Broke the first day we had it. It was cool while it lasted, but not very durable.	-1
Did not glow. I feel mislead because it's very small. I know it says mini but the pic on the box looks bigger than it actually is. Also the picture shows the whole thing glowing which it doesn't! Ours didn't glow at all! My daughter asked me to return it. That's how unimpressive this is. Also it cost as much as the huge one I bought for my son.	-1
I am a teacher and ordered this product for my classroom.  While I wouldn't expect this product to stand up to heavy abuse, it broke almost immediately.  One of the blue connector plastic pieces fell off after one of my students simply handled the sphere.  I spent ten minutes trying to get the two blue pieces 'clicked' back together, but they will not stay on the sphere.  Now I am simply waiting for the rest of it to fall apart.  Good idea in theory, but not if it cannot be used without breaking.	-1
The random math problems for the drill are not random; the mathshark just assigns the same questions over and over.  My son loves math, so I thought this would entertain him in the car; it worked for the first few minutes.  Very disappointed.	-1
I bought 2 of these for my 2 kids for christmas (20 months and 3 1/2)  my husband and i were really excited cause they were the big santa gift.  We bought them plastic license plates with their names on them.  We waited ti; 2 nights before christmas to put these together because we didn't have a place to hide 2 of these.  Good thing we didn't wait til christmas eve like we were planning (i was paranoid they might be missing a piece)  Well, they weren't missing any pieces.  the first one took my husband and i, (together) over an hour to put together.  The instructions are the worst thing i'd ever seen.  There are NO words and you can't even understand the pictures; They skip steps and expect you to know what to do.  After we finally got through the first we were ready to tackle the second.  Well, it was faster.  15 minutes in we were on like the second to last step, and two of the pieces would not fit together.  We tried everything. Frustrated, I woke up at 6am christmas eve morn to go to walmart to exchange.  Guess what, i had the exact same problem.  Returned again, and they were out.  Went to toysrus and the SAME THING.  Okay now i'm peeved.  (my husband had been from square one)  then finally got another and it worked.  My daughter is actually almost too big for it (ages go up to 5) shes 3 1/2 and small for her age.  hers doesn't get any use and my son will sit in it and turn the wheel, but not move his feet because they get stuck under his seat.  i bought them  the matching gas pump and my son loves to put gas in his and his sisters car, but still they never actually get 'driven.'	-1
I bought the Mathshark for my 7-year-old child to practice her math skills. Opened the package, put in the batteries, and tried to use it. Half of the buttons did not work, no matter how hard I pressed. A few other buttons only worked if you pressed them REALLy hard. I was surprised given that we own several other Education Insights products with which we have had no problems. Too bad, a piece of junk.	-1
Half the reviews for this product are 5 star, half are 1 star. I decided to take the chance. I wanted something that would help me relearn my math facts and that would grow with my daughter as she begins to learn them. This sounded like the best one on the market and sadly, I still think that. So what's wrong with it?  The numbers are not very dark so it is difficult to read it in both dim conditions and in bright light. Forget using it in a car.  In addition, the numbers are poorly formed. They are similar to some calculators, where the numbers are made up of straight lines but that's not the problem. The problem is that the lines have fairly large spaces between them which make the numbers oddly formed. When combined with how dim they are, it makes them quite difficult to read.  The buttons barely work. You have to hit them firmly and check the display to make certain that your button hit was seen before moving on to the next number you want to enter. This is annoying for an adult but nearly impossible for a very young child to remember or accept. I also figured it was a matter of days before some of the buttons stopped working entirely.  Another minor problem is the LED's on the front are incredibly bright, actually painful to look at. A quick swipe of a black sharpie on the light itself would fix it but I figured there was no point. After trying it out for over a week, I sent it back. In case you are wondering, I ended up searching for an old DataMan - a similar toy from the 80's.	-1
I really wanted to like this. The screen is just so sub par. The kids will pull it out occasionally to use as a calculator but that's only because they don't have another one. However bad you think the screen might be it is probably worse. This quality of screen would have been complained about by reviewers 20 years ago because it does cut things off and make them unreadable. Today it makes no sense to sell a screen like this when people are use to so much better. Also a rubber button promptly fell off and is still floating around the house somewhere.	-1
Not impressed.  The graphics are very hard to read and all it is is numbers!  In this world of amazing graphics this should not be an issue.  My kids love math but this only holds my 7 year old attention for a few minutes.  I would not recommend.	-1
Cards get sticky and unplayable after just a dozen games!	-1
My 6 year old wouldn't even open the box. She read the description and handed it back to me stating it was for babies. She wasn't in the least interested. STEM club needs more challenging products age appropriate for kids.	-1
In general, the Gears line is a great STEM toy, but this is a poor set. There are very few pieces in this set by comparison to others. The springs are fun, but hard for little hands to remove or move. My son always asks for help with them. The propeller was the one great piece in this set except it was broken on arrival. Customer service was poor. They promised to find a replacement propeller but never never called back. Hubby fixed it with a fiberglass kit.  Would like to recommend the set as it has some fun unique pieces like springs, a variety of gear sizes and bases, a crank, and the propeller, plus the colorful stickers are fun. I do NOT recommend it as a first set as there are better sets for the price, easy of use, and durability.  Update: The stickers have peeled off, so I'm dropping another star. Definitely find a different gears kit.  +1 Multiple Gears sizes -1 Broken propeller -1 Poor Customer service -1 Poor value -1 Hard to move springs -1 Peeling stickers  :jk	-1
There is a reason most of these reviews are one star this toy doesn't even deserve 1 star all I can say is loved the ideal, didn't love the toy please save your money and PASS	-1
We were looking forward to this but it just does not deliver.  The dolphins don't make sound reliably and the darn rings will not stay hooked together.  It is going into the Christmas return pile if I can find the box among the recyclables.	-1
I actually found these at home goods for [...]...well I am glad I did not pay more than [...]... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they didn't match their tubes...When I mean they didn't match...they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube (no yellow dolphin) then we got two of the same colored dolphins.  Okay..so the colors weren't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins wouldn't whistle...that's totally useless...and as someone else mentioned the links don't stay linked. HUGE disappointment!	-1
We bought the cards less then 3 months ago and they are falling apart. They are very flimsy not sturdy at all.	-1
Fun game but this set is terrible quality! Cards are thin and some of ours were not printed on so we don't know which cards they are suppose to be and what we are missing. The directions have a ton of spelling errors too.	-1
I was disappointed in that the various rings do not hook together well at all.  Half of the dolphins do not make more than the slightest squeek.  For the cost of the toy, it was a huge letdown.  Don't bother with this one.	-1
It takes up a lot of space, without being much fun. The rings break apart too easily, which frustrates the little kid. Plus, they don't whistle easily...also frustrating a little kid.	-1
These dolphins are fun to blow through with your mouth, but they work POORLY in the water.  They work better when the water has been drained out of them before placing them in their innertubes in the water.  But seeing as they are water toys, it doesn't make much sense to do! My boys were 2 and 5 when we got them as a gift.  They are now 4 and 7 and still don't like them. I just gave them to Goodwill.	-1
Ordered these thinking they were the genuine article, but they were clearly fakes.  Multiple spelling errors in the directions.  Cards were very poor quality (faded colors, random dots on the back, etc).  Contacted Amazon since I purchased them using Amazon Prime and was promptly issued a refund.  I used that money and went to Walmart and bought the real thing for $1.50 less than I spent on these crappy cards.	-1
didn't stay linked in a ring, difficult to keep the appropriate amt of water in them to make them whistle.  We tossed them.	-1
This toy is supposed to be for babies and toddlers and yet it doesn't have any of the features one would expect in a young child's toy.  One would expect color, ease of use, softness, and purpose.  The only qualification that the Water Symphony Tub matches is that the dolphins and the rings are colorful.  Which brings me to the question of  who on earth thought that making the rings so hard to connect was a good idea.  As a mom, I usually have other chores at bath time other than ring rangler.  And then there is the hardness factor.  The dashboard of my car is softer.  A little more built-in teething satisfaction would have been nice.  Two stars.  The dolphins do make noise but not often enough.  They are hard enough that a baby can hurt their gums on them, or *you* or a sibling if they are thrown.  One plus is that they don't seem to mildew.	-1
We got these for our daughter becasue she loves bath time and playing her toy piano.  We figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong.  You have to beat the poor dolphins to get them to play a note.  And the note is more of an electronic sound...it's hard to describe it but it's NOT a musical note!  And it never fails after fianlly beating the things enough to get a sound out of them the ring comes loose.  It's just a total pain to use.  Granted she still plays with them in the tub just we could have bought a cheap bag of plastic dolphins at the aquarium and saves 3/4 of the money we spent on this set.	-1
I was excited about the idea of a little toy for my 19-month old that made music in the tub.  From the description of the toy, you'd think that's what this was.  First of all, tapping the dolphins on the head makes either a ridiculous whistling noise that can barely be called a note, if it works at all.  Most of the time, they don't really work at all.  And, as stated in other reviews, the ring does NOT stay together in the tub, making it hard to keep track of them and play any kind of "song" whatsoever.  That being said, it's a cute toy if you're just looking for a brightly colored, floating tub toy, and for that purpose, my daughter likes it.  Just don't expect it to be much else.	-1
I was very disappointed with this toy.  When it was put in the tub the dolphins do not make sounds like they are suppose to.  The floats do not stay together and this makes my 20 mos. old very upset.  They look good and are cute but not worth the money.  Would not recommend.	-1
This is obviously a fake.  The cards are not made of card material and it is impossible to shuffle them.  The edges of the cards are brittle and breaking right out of the package!  Awful!!!  Do not purchase.	-1
The original Rush Hour is still much more fun.  The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak.  The puzzles are not as challenging overall, yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories (junior, beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Also, the build quality is poorer, as a few of the train pieces don't sit properly on the board, and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards, a sore point for a young boy.	-1
I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com, but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing.  Our 4th son just turned 1, and celebrated his 2nd Christmas.  I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him....believe what you read.  The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really don't sing!!  If you tap the tops of the head, nothing happens; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly "smack" the water with it, it will make a noise.  Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin.  The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time.  Maybe I'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around.  Also, this toy takes up lots of room!!  I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy.	-1
This is a piece of junk. If I could give this a "0 stars" rating, I would. It is shameful to even waste trash bin space on this one. Seriously. Yes, it really IS that bad.  1) Chinese Checkers: The board size -- at 11-1/2 inches diameter -- is ridiculously small, which renders it frustrating to all parties of all ages who attempt to play. It is next-to-impossible for even the most adroit and nimble-fingered adult to play. And even our children at ages 6 and 7, with their teeny tiny fingers, cannot move one ball one space anywhere on the board without disrupting at least a dozen other balls and sending them scattering to the four corners of the Earth. And believe me, this has nothing to do with motor skills or eye-hand coordination!  2) Chinese Checkers: This set does NOT utilize real glass marbles which look aesthetically pleasing in their soft pearlized hues and feel pleasantly organic to the touch. Oh no. Rather this set comes with cheap, pathetic little lightweight plastic "balls" in obnoxious primary colors. The pathetic plasticness of these "balls" renders them utterly useless for anything other than annoyingly rolling to the four corners of the Earth -- at every touch, turn, hiccup, and/or breath!  3) Chinese Checkers: The holes are not set deep enough into the board; therefore, the pathetic little lightweight plastic "balls" proceed to roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth every time someone even minimally touches the playing table, board, or any marble on the board. In fact, if anyone even closes a door in the house, turns on the radio, or a car backfires in the street, all of the pathetic little lightweight plastic "balls" on the board WILL indeed roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth.  4) Checkers: First, the checkers are about the size of Sweet Tarts and trying to play the game on a board this small will nearly drive you mad. Second, the checkers will not stack and stay put when it comes time to "king" someone. Third, there is something about the sound of plastic checkers banging down in repeated movements on a tin board that is akin to nails on a chalkboard in the realm of one's auditory sense. And last but certainly not least, similar to the Chinese Checkers side of this maddening duo, if you can move your checkers on this eensy board without disrupting every other checker on the board and sending them sliding toward the four corners of the Earth, well, you have some mad playing skills that no one who has entered our home of any age, gender, race or religion -- be it man, woman or child -- can master!  5) Storage: The pathetic little lightweight plastic "balls" and maddeningly unstackable checkers cannot be sandwiched for storage inside of this two-sided tin (even though this is touted as a "feature" of the product) when/if kept in the nylon netted bags in which they come. We had to separate "balls" and checkers out into several ziploc baggies in order to spread them out in a "thin enough" layer to actually get the tin to stay sandwiched closed. So essentially, we had to repackage all the playing pieces immediately in order to simply get the tin to stay closed for storage in between play sessions.  Bottom Line: This set is ill-conceived and poorly executed on so many different levels it's appalling. "Cheap junk" is the best thing I can say about it. My mother bought it locally for twice the price it is here on Amazon as a Valentine's gift for our children. Within three days, they were frustrated beyond measure, and my husband and I went online looking for something better.  For a good quality, aesthetically pleasing, useable, properly-sized Chinese Checkers set at a reasonable price, please consider the **15" JUMBO CHINESE CHECKERS WITH MARBLES BY CHH** here on Amazon. It has a lovely, solid wood board with deeply drilled holes and real glass marbles in gorgeous pearlized colors... feels great to the finger, sounds right to the ear, looks much nicer in person than it does online. It has been worth every penny, complimented highly, and well received by all who have played.  Because there's so much more to playing a game than just winning.... ;)	-1

Although they arrived before their time,  That seems to be the only thing I liked. All of the game instructions are in Chinese, that won't help me out as I only read English..... What a scam....... what a joke, the garbage can is a good place to store them . The cards don't even look like what is on the box. I guess I should have read the reviews but I figured WHAT COULD GO WRONG WITH A UNO DECK !!	-1
Such a disappointment on Christmas morning! When taken out of the package, the driver's side rear tire is broken and falling off. I wish it wasn't a Christmas present so I could have opened it earlier when I ordered it. I will not be ordering again, as I fear the same thing might happen. We are very disappointed in this product and the waste of our money.	-1
Had to send this back.  The smell was so horrible...smelled toxic...didn't want my kids touching it.	-1
too high pitched. like a buzzing sound	-1
I purchased based on high reviews. Thought it would be great for 3&5 year old grandkids. I tried it out and was frustrated by the difficulty in getting gears to mesh easily... Plus it's pretty noisy. Over $7 for return shipping! Disappointed.	-1
My grandkid lost interest after a few blasts.	-1
Absolute utter Chinese crap.  Remember when we were growing up and toys were built to last?  Remember when a scientific toy actually taught scientific principals?  My kids have received numerous gifts under the name of Scientific American over the years, and each one lasted under a day before it broke. Add the "Meteor Rocket" to that list.  This terribly manufactured toy takes an hour to build and 30 seconds to destroy.  If you are considering buying this for your little ones, know that they will need a sharp utility knife (not supplied), scissors (not supplied), tape (not supplied), a ruler (not supplied), baking soda (not supplied), vinegar (not supplied), and plenty of patients.  Also not supplied is a discussion of the chemical reaction taking place that produces the gas.  Once you manage to cut the balsa wood fins and attach them to the rocket, it's time to head out to a field and try this puppy out.  Unfortunately, the pressurization system is as crappy as the materials.  It is a rubber stopper with a screw attachment that is SUPPOSED to keep the stopper in the mouth of the bottle.  The idea is that a tube stuck on the end of the stopper is supposed to keep the vinegar and baking soda from reacting while you tightening the stopper.  The reality is that it's really difficult to keep the rocket on its side while you carefully place the tube inside without spilling a single grain of soda.  If even a bit reacts, you will NOT be able to get the stopper to stay in.  The tightening mechanism does not work.  The only way we got a "flight" was to mix the chemicals and push the stopper in as hard as we could, allowing the rocket to launch while holding the stopper.  The result of course of a shirt covered with vinegar and baking soda.  And once the bottle opening becomes wet, it is impossible to create a good seal with the stopper.  A MUCH BETTER and virtually FREE chemical rocket can be found on the Steve Spangler website.  It uses things you have in your house to build the rocket.  The only thing you'll need to buy is a rubber stopper.  Plus, the site actually talks about the reaction that's happening.	-1
15 to 20 bucks seems a bit high for a few pieces of tape, balsa and a pop bottle. (But aren't most "science" kits expensive for what you really get?)  The only unique part was the molded plastic fin holder - tape it around the bottle and slide the fins into place with perfect spacing and alignment.  The parts were only durable enough for a few demonstration flights and then the rocket needed some first aid (bring duct tape for the balsa wood fins and paper towels to dry the fuel tube before refilling).  I found the launch instructions lacking in safety warnings.  In five launches we had one kid hit in the face by the rocket almost immediately after setting it on the ground and a second hit with the stopper that shot out prematurely as the rocket was being set on the ground.  Maybe we didn't get the stopper tight enough - who knows?  In hindsight this toy makes a better cork gun than a rocket.	-1
This product consisted of a plastic bottle, some ply-wood, some cellophane, and some silvery paper. The cellophane and paper were for "decorating" the bottle, but were very difficult to apply - and the directions didn't help at all. Couldn't complete the job at one sitting because had to buy an x-acto knife first. So we ended up with an ugly looking plastic bottle. Making it blast off was easy, just as we could have done with a plane plastic bottle. Very disappointing.	-1
This was a disappointment because they do not fit tightly with each other. The slightest bump and it comes up from the opening.	-1
This toy is a disappointment, the kit is overpriced for what it contains & the function of the rocket is terrible. Building the kit went fine & is enjoyable (which is half the reason to buy kits such as these) & the theory of operation is sound. The problem we had with the rocket is the stopper pops out just as soon as you set it down thus there is no time for pressure to build and the thing just goes about 10 feet into the air. If I try to tighten the stopper it slips out of the bottle opening again & again. I'm going to try to roughen up the bottle opening & the rubber stopper (or try a different stopper) to see if we can get it to stay in place - if this works the rocket should fly much better.	-1
When I saw this I immediately thought of my grandson and how much he would enjoy it, but after opening it and having him play with it I was disappointed. The gears do not always move as they should and it seems expensive for what it can actually do. It said it was educational but as a former teacher I do not see how that is. I would not recommend this to anyone.	-1
Had to return this drum due to an overwhelming chemical odor. I won't be giving my small child a drum off-gassing stinky chemicals, thanks. Off to look for a more responsibly manufactured product.	-1
There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy, which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer. Here are the I don't like about it:  1. It's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family. 2. There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it, so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.  UPDATE: This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good.	-1
I was a rock musician during the fun days, so I know what a decent drum is supposed to sound like.  Kids won't know the difference, but this drum has an annoying metallic sounding resonance, somewhat like hitting a large tin can.  I purchased this based on the raving reviews, and it is completely puzzling how so many people would miss mentioning the resonance (are all the reviews real?).  I know this is a kid product and not for professionals, but the product description talks about the "enhanced low-pitched fundamentals."  The drum sticks are nice though.  I will try the larger diameter Remo Kids gathering drum to see if perhaps those don't have the ringing overtones.	-1
We got this puzzle as a gift for my son. The knob size is good but the shapes are much too complex for a 12 month old to line up. My son understands what to do with the pieces but all the little edges and corners make it much too difficult for him to fit it where he goes. He ends up mad at the toy. The pieces are very thin as well. I would recommend this but only for a child around 24 months old	-1
The bags didn't have enough beans in them. Disappointed.	-1
too cheaply made. 2 of them came unraveled the first time we played with them and there were little white pellets everywhere.	-1
I bought this game because it promised a "green" experience for the entire family. i must say, i was highly disappointed. is it called "green" because you are dealing with vegetables? So be it. My family could not find any interest in this game, not even my four year old whom we bought the game for. I did not find the added value of this game. don't waist your money on this.	-1
I bought this for the beach. The issue it's very flimsy.	-1
I'm sorry I really, really wanted to like this game.  I have hesitated to buy it.  I am a Speech-Language Pathologist and I am "known" for the great games I bring to my sessions.  I was disappointed long before I showed it to any of the kiddos I work for.  The game is cheaply made.  :(  Very poor quality!  The game board is warped.  The pieces don't all pop out and I'm guessing this is an issue because there is note that says not to force them but to have scissors to cut them with.  REALLY!  I often like the kids to help me learn a new game.  If I had done that with this one, they would have torn the pieces.  The board with all the pieces is very visually difficult.  I live on an island in remote Alaska and was so excited to get this game.  Running errands ahead of a storm or hoping the ploughs and sanders was out is something the kids could relate to.  I'm sorry very disappointed	-1
love the concept, but the numbers scrape off the keys VERY easily and then they're unreadable. Trash	-1
Its not a voucher if you have to pay 7.95.  I regret buying this as a gift.	-1
So, I miss read it.  There are no caterpillars with this.  But, it is also NOT a kit.  It is the cage and a green thing with no instructions on what it is.	-1
As others have pointed out, the materials are inexplicably low-quality.  The board doesn't lie flat and the pieces are so flimsy that it's hard to handle them and they skitter all over the board when we're trying to play.  They're also a little small.  The real mystery is how you're supposed to play.  There are a dozen "time cards" and once you've turned them up, that's it - you're done.  If you've matched some cards already, fine, you know those aren't the ones that are hidden, but for the ones you haven't had a chance to see yet (because you - by pure chance - turned up time cards first), you're just guessing.  There's very little room for reasoning out an answer.  We LOVE logic games, just don't see the point of this one.	-1
I totally agree with the other reviewers: the quality is very poor. damage the card in the beginning. very easy to lose small cards. very cheap made. does not worth $12. The idea is fun. But there are other better games at this price(I mean quality). BTW, there is no way to contact the seller or manufacturer. No phone number, no response. Do not buy this. Buy something made in U.S. At least you can talk to someone when there is a problem.	-1
I did not realize that this kit does not include live caterpillars! Super bummed	-1
Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.  The overall compostion of the game is so cheap. It is like it was made on a copy machine. The cards are paper thin, and will not last over time. After setting up the game, many of the cards were already bent.  Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated. Maybe I'm impatient, but I just did not get it.  There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made. I'm just not sure that this is one of them.	-1
We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived.  Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews.  Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things.  My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love.  So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!	-1
Not great, 4 year old has a hard time seeing the answer. 5 yr. old, had a hard time seeing the numbers.	-1
wonderful idea yet the numbers are slowly rubbing off making it not useful.	-1
The assembly instructions are unclear and I could not get this thing to look right	-1
Waste of money, u have to pay 5.99 more for the insects	-1
a wonderful idea yet the numbers are slowly rubbing off making it not useful.	-1
I was very excited to get a non battery educational item for my grandson.  I guess in my memory of years ago this was a better product.  The concept is great, easy to use.  BUT you are suppose to press down and see the number.  It is so faint you can hardly see it!  I mean you couldn't have used a very dark black ink so it would show up?  I would rather it be battery operated and lit up!  I have to send it to him now as too late to return as I leave for out of town tomorrow.  Did I get a dud ?  Did everyone else's come with a dark number you can see easily?  As much as I like the concept I would definitely by pass this toy.  Which is a shame because they could have fixed so easily.	-1
I bought this because I remember wanting one when I was younger - and I thought it would be better than flash cards since- flash cards tend to go missing or bend and tear. However, the writing on this toy runs off over time from the oil from fingers. I had to re-write a few and put clear tape ontop to keep it from rubbing off. I only had it for less than a month and I had hoped it would last longer.	-1
I really had high hopes for this toy, but the numbers rub off easily.	-1
I bought a few of these games from this company due to all the hyped up reviews.  Very cheaply made, not that great.  There are a lot better games out there.	-1
Returned the item. Spend the extra money and buy the learning resources or lakeshore learning brand.  You can't see the answers on this one because your fingers are in the way since the number is under the plastic cover...even little fingers.  The other versions numbers are on the sides of the keys when they pop up.	-1
Chipping off paint on the buttons. Before long all the equations painted on the buttons will be scratched of just from normal use. :/ disappointed	-1
Caterpillars arrived already dead. Habitat was nice though, bigger than I thought it would be. My daughter was disappointed that she was watching a dead bug for so long waiting for something to happen. LOL	-1
I can't get excited about this and never see my kiddo use it.  It is hard to see the sum when you push down the button. For a kid working with these low numbers, fingers or manipulatives seem to be more useful. That said, maybe we just haven't found the right use for this yet.	-1
Bigger than expected. Also is much more time consuming to setup that I thought. Returned.	-1
You cannot see the answer through the plastic. Bad design!	-1
really? My son didn't care for. He played a bit and I thought he would keep playing but he has not touched since we got it and the only time he played. I think it should have some type of sound to catch kids attention and keep them interacting/entertained.	-1
I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.	-1
This is easy to put together, a good size, easy to transport/store, but the opening is Velcro!! Why??! As soon as your baby can crawl/stand they'll push right out of it. This is really only good for a sleeping baby because once your child is old enough to want to sit and play in it willingly, it'll be too small. Really wanted to like it... Going to take it to the beach and see what happens, but I think it'll be a waste.	-1
Uh cool voucher , where are my caterpillars thought that was included voucher means send money	-1
I used to have a great multiplication board when I was little.  The board had plastic slides that I could slide back to reveal the answers.  I bought this board for my son, but it was too hard to see the answers.  The buttons are about the size of fingers, so as you press a button down the answer is hidden.  It was not really helpful at all.	-1
Growing up I had a keyboard like this to learn my math facts and loved it. Bought one for my daughter and we received it today.  I would give it 5 stars for the idea of it, but out of the box 3 of the buttons are pushed in and won't pop out. No way to pop them back out. She was still happy with itm and the general idea. Disappointing.	-1
I got this crossing to supplement my son's (rather large) train set. The red arms of the signal come off, very easily. Which is fine, but we have a younger son as well so these are causing a choking hazard, and a sibling fight, constantly.	-1
It is so small. Don't buy it. The butterflies won't be able to fly around in it. I purchased this product several times over the past few years and it used to be bigger and better. I am so sad at how small and expensive it is now. I love the quality of the product, but the size has just gotten ridculously small.	-1
Not good	-1
I bought this for my son to help him learn his math. The answers under the buttons are very light and most are impossible to see. Complete waste!!!	-1
Broke on our first outing.	-1
The first day owning this toy my daughter suggested from the back seat that there was an error in the facts.  Sure enough, the top left button, which should read 1x1 = 1, in fact reads 1x2 = 1.  The button to its right does read correctly, 1x2 = 2.  My 8 year old caught the mistake.  I've posted pictures above to show you this error.  As other reviewers have stated, the answers can be difficult to see.  The translucent buttons are a little too opaque for easy reading.  At least my children's fingers are smaller than mine and they are able to move them out of the way to see the answer.  Also, the fact is simply painted on top to rub off with repeated use.  I also posted a picture to demonstrate the view of the answers.  We'll have to exchange this item for one of better quality.	-1
These eggs are just poor quality. I bought them for my 20-month-old son for Christmas, but I can only get about half of them opened. The colors are not very vibrant, and the plastic container (the reason I chose this version of this product) is just very cheaply made. Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase, but the seller was very gracious to refund my purchase price, no questions asked!	-1
Blue container is hard for children to open as well as the eggs! One egg has already broken, the inside shape came out. Very disappointed!	-1
Cheaply made and poorly stained wood.  I would not purchase this item again.	-1
Sorry to say, this product is not friendly for little fingers.  Extremely hard to open, both the blue "carton" box and the eggs.	-1
these are way too hard to open for my 2 year old. The first time I tried to open them, I had to use a butter knife to pry them apart.  Have not really loosened by much after a few weeks of play.	-1
Is hard to put together.	-1
when my child was in it and would crawl forward the whole tent tipped over, scaring my little guy.  He was too scared to get into it ever again	-1
I should have read the description closer as this does not have UV protection. Pretty useless for the pool or outdoors. Will just let my toddler play with it as a play house	-1
