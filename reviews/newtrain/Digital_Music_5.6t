Wonderfully!	1
I love it	1
What a wonderful compilation...but what else would one expect with such great artists working together & Tonne Brunette at the helm.	1
This is a collective of musicians put together by T Bone Burnett after he was given the opportunity to put some old Bob Dylan cast off and unfinished songs to music. The primary players included Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford, Taylor Goldsmith, Rhiannon Giddens and Jim James who appear on all the tracks. Individual tracks focus on each of these singers for the lead. Other contributors show up on certain tracks as well including Haim. The album is terrific. The sound is exceptional and they do a great job of replicating and enhancing Dylan's music, all with his approval.	1
Really good music I'm very impressed with this cd	1
Couple of Dylan classic type songs. The band is very good and well diverse. Elvis Costello's bass is better than expected. He, and Jim James are the starts of this CD, but everybody contributes nicely.	1
As advertised, well shipped...thanks	1
Not to well known album.  But I like it and like these guys and gals rocked.	1
Long waited for, and well worth the wait!  This CD is loaded with great music composed and sung by luminaries of the music scene. I am a long time Dylan fan, but I don't think he's the star of this show. The lyrics are good, but the songs produced by these artists are better.	1
Easily one of the best albums of the year....amazing all-star lineup where everyone shines and Dylan's lyrics infuse and inform the music...great for Dylan's fans but also for the handful of people who don't like Dylan....listening to it over and over.	1
I really approached this collection of Dylan lyrics augmented by music written by a cast of contemporary musical luminaries with great trepidation. How would 47 year old lyrics "fit" with the modern styles and musical inclinations of the likes of Marcus Mumford, Elvis Costello et al? The answer is just brilliantly! This is an album anyone-not just Dylan fans-will love. And there are reputedly at least two more volumes to come! Essential	1
Great album, novel concept, and it works.	1
Dylan- Costello, a incredible paar. Costello put some of the new music for the old Basements Tapes lyrics. A strange experiments but great. At the end is a homenage to Dylan trough Costello music. You can find folk, rock and the more important; the spirit of the Dylan and The Band music. Costello have fund a great bunch of musicians, who's also compose some themes for put new music to old songs. Now is very simple to know that Dylan is a great poet, and Costello and the band are a big composers. Is great idea but risky, thanks a Allen Trousseau this mixture is possible. Now with the edition of the complete edition of the Dylan tapes  all this proposition have more sense. Very peculiar but excellent.  PS. If you are interested in this kind of things, please try the excellent record from 1974 of McGuinnes Flint  call "Lo and Behold" they make a album of unknown songs, in those  times, from Dylan. Is a very good album from a british group. Is the perfect complement of the Basements Tapes	1
I cannot WAIT to hear more from Sam Hunt!  This is one of the songs that will be on "repeat" on my phone/in my car for months to come!	1
Awesome song!  LOVE!	1
Love the show, love the song!!	1
super and great price	1
I love everything about Outlander, especially this song!	1
I love this version of the song and it is very fitting for the show which started out very entertaining and kind of got very uncomfortable much like life in Scotland in the 1700s	1
I knew of this tune not long after I have listen to it a few times, then it occurred to me what it was and more It fits the OUTLANDER series very well. I give it high marks,  I do have season one, in my collection also.	1
Beautiful love this song love the show and the books	1
Wanted the song the first night I saw Outlander on TV	1
Great, want the full version please!	1
OUTSTANDING ENTERTAINMENT!	1
Beautiful song.  Perfect theme for the  Outlander series.  Nice to be able to listen to it on my phone.	1
I love this song!	1
Great music. Great song.	1
Oh holy night do I love this. And giant happy dance that it is connected to my beloved Outlander tv series and book series!	1
OMG! This is just an amazing song love it. It sounds like magic. Every time I hear it I know the show is coming on and I will be transported away like Claire. Love the show and love this song.	1
Nice easy listening!	1
love this song, love tv series its from	1
Haunting and beautiful.  Couldn't  get it out of my head after watching Outlander.  I remember Johnny Mathis released this song on one of his LPs.	1
I'm giving it a 4 because it literally is only the main theme song.  I really was hoping that it was going to be the full version of the Skye Boat Song.  This is definitely the best rendition I have heard of the song and I really hope that the producers of the show--or at the very least Bear McCreary--make the decision to do the full version of this song beyond the title theme.  The way this was arranged and the way it flows is amazing but it is so short.	1
LOVE THIS SONG!!!!	1
Great!!	1
Great Great Song. The first time I heard it on the radio, I loved this song!  The vocals are beautiful. The lyrics are uplifting and pure. The music is great. This song is a must buy. It is an instant classic.	1
Great song.	1
This sound is Awesome. This song gives us hope that when we are completely lost, we can be completely made new. Love this song.	1
Good song!!	1
This song is beautiful.  It touches the soul.	1
Love this band just the right amount of crunch	1
Great product.	1
Sounds good, just what I needed , easy to download and listen on my phone.	1
love it!	1
Great song! My 11yr old son has been practicing guitar. While he is only a beginner, he went in the other room & listened to this song on YouTube. After 10 minutes, he came out and was able to play this! No he wasn't a professional, but I have never been more proud of him, and saw his confidence fly! This is a good song, catchy tune with a youthful beat, and eerily bad lyrics to describe the state our world is in regarding war, misplaced children, homes. Sad.	1
Good song.	1
Very lovely EDM song	1
Love it! Had to buy it!	1
mellow lyrics with the sounds of dance music behind it. Great song that never gets old.	1
That was different - Don't know why I like it, but I do	1
I need to listen to the original to what it sounded like, but I really like this version.	1
I just like this song.	1
Love this song	1
FANTASTIC!!!	1
I have downloaded three different versions of this song because it strikes me as that good.	1
Great Song 2015	1
I have the original but prefer this remix version! Worth the purchase!	1
I heard this song a few days ago and had to have it. I like the melody. The music video does not seem to match the song.	1
LOVE this song	1
I have downloaded three different versions of this song because it strikes me as that good.	1
Great Song!	1
I can't get enough of this song!	1
Love. Love . Love. Love it	1
As advertised.  Fast shipment. A+	1
I guess this could be called EDM, but I think it goes beyond that.  For me, this goes beyond something to dance to.	1
Do Not Love The Song.	-1
Great song	1
Good techno music.	1
Nice beat, nice song.  Added to my current playlist!	1
love	1
SUPERB!	1
Great song.	1
Awesome	1
I love this song and it was fast and easy to download. The quality was fantactic and I love the speed of downloading.	1
I don't like any of her other music, but I do love this song.  I had it on heavy rotation earlier this year and we still turn it up when it comes on the radio.  If you like the current country-pop style of music, you'll like it.	1
Great collection of peaceful classics and can't beat the price ;-)	1
A whole variety of instruments take the lead in this collection. Its definitely not the same style over and over.	1
The best classical compilation ever put together. What's it got that makes it the best? Quite simply, EVERYTHING! Enjoy!	1
OK	1
I like this cd	1
10 tracks of indie folk ecstasy! 2 contain the 'f word'! Lots of acoustic guitars & expert banjo! Deserves a six star rating! Thanx!	1
Mood music	1
great cd	1
Please see my earlier review of their other CD- Superb Indie band with a talent for hitting/creating songs with just enough ambience/ethereal quality as to soothe the soul/mind or have on as background music without distracting you from the task at hand. They only have these two LP's out and I bought both.	1
xlint	1
Another awesome song ...	1
Love the song.	1
Very good music	1
Every time I hear this song by MercyMe, I imagine all of creation worshiping the Lord together with me.  It's so beautiful.  When I hear it on the radio, I kept making a mental note to buy the song.  Finally, I went to Amazon's MP3 music and in a matter of seconds, HAD MY OWN downloaded to my laptop!  I don't know what the Cloud player thing is all about that they always try to get me to download, so I just go to the bottom link and say no thanks, I'll just download with Amazon.  And boom, there it is.	1
I rated this download with five stars because, first of all, this is my all-time favorite Christian tune, written and performed by my all-time favorite Christian rock band!  I also gave this download a five-star rating because it downloaded to my p.c. just fine, and I had no trouble syncing it with my mp3 player.	1
Another inspiring piece of music and lyrics that are a balm for my soul!  I feel that the Holy Spirit is alive in this music and in all of Contemporary Christian Music today!  Thank you!	1
awesome	1
Thanks just what I was looking for.	1
Great song!	1
Wonderful	1

Great song ..... Downloaded to learn for our church choir.	1
If you believe you understand	1
Everything that I had expected, and more!	1
Love the song.	1
I absolutely love this song and have been playing it in worship services for years.  This however isn't my favorite version.  I suggest the Kari Jobe version.	1
This is an awesome song with an awesome message!!! We need more music like this in the world, it would make it a much better place to live in!!!	1
There are no words to describe this song.  If you haven't listened to it, you don't know what you're missing.  I highly recommend it, as it is one of my favorite songs in my Christian folder collection.	1
Very awesome song to have and to listen to. Really like the lyrics and the whole beat and tune of the song.	1
This song is truly inspiring and touches the very soul of me. I love it. I recommend it to everyone! :)	1
This is such an uplifting song and gives me chills everything I listen to it.  I have a hard time listening and not singing along.	1
When you hear this song and wonder, how can any human being receive such a song you might reflect on Handel receiving The Messiah thru the Holy Spirit.	1
Fun but could have been better.	1
Wow!  This is just amazing! When I first heard about a song titled "Batman Evolution" I thought, "If I were to make a song called 'Batman Evolution', I would take the 1966 Neal Hefti theme, the 1989 Danny Elfman theme, and the 2008 Hanz Zimmer theme, and make a compilation of the three."; and I'll be darned if that's not exactly what The Piano Guys did with this one. Starting with a quiet intro from the "Keaton" theme, it quickly dives into the '66 "Nana nana nana nana nana, Batman!" theme. This theme is hard to take very seriously, so this portion is shorter than the other two. That being said, it pays a perfect homage to the original, campy series with a couple "riffs" that sound like the "Pow!, Bang!" sound effects from the show. There are even vocals shouting Batman! to complete the feel of the original tune. Then it moves onto, probably, the most famous and recognizable of the three: Danny Elfman's 1989 theme. It's easy to picture Keaton's Batmobile cruising through the woods of Gotham, flames licking the road behind it. This portion starts slow, then gets into main gear. The sound gets darker and grittier with the 89 theme. Enough of the theme is in this compilation to satisfy the ones for whom Keaton's Batman is the favorite. Then after a lone cello lilts a small bridge, the Dark Knight theme starts up. At this point, the song gains strength and majesty until it takes up your whole attention. Then, all of the sudden, it ends. On the one hand, it sounds abrupt, and you're left wanting more; on the other hand, it ends exactly the way it should, disappearing into thin air. Just like the Batman. I can't wait for the video! Seeing TPG playing amongst the three most famous batmobiles is going to be every bit as impressive as the song.	1

Heaven is very open thru this song, everyone invited in. Praise the Lord. Top quality hands down for a first song.	1
I found this song to be so moving and awe inspiring.  The words of Revelation set to a beautiful melody.  Another song that gives me chills.	1
Phillips, Craig, Dean are a good group of guys! I love their song "Revelation Song"  It is one of my favorite songs we sing at my Church.	1
Beautiful praise music to relax and enjoy!  Wonderful purchase for anyone wanting to offer prayer through music.  A must buy.	1
I love this song so much. First heard it on the radio and could not stop singing it. Great song that I love to sing to the Lord at the top of my lungs!!!	1
heard this song at church and i loved the meaning behind it, would recommend for others to buy also has great sound	1
One of two of the most moving songs that I have heard in years. (My Reward, the other). Once you get this song in your head you will be singing it over and over.	1
This beautiful song has always taken me right to the presense of my Holy Father, in loving worship. Thank You Jesus!	1
I love this song taken straight from the book of Revelation. I can just see Jesus as depicted in the scriptures. Great worship song!	1
This song is a great reminder of the worship that is taking place in Heaven right now, and the worship that I (and hopefully you) will be joining in for all eternity!	1
Great song	1

This great song has fun with the #1 sentiment for which country songs are stereotyped...Jilted lover gonna go do some drinkin.  The riff is pure sweet country rock, but what stands out for me is Blake lettin loose his voice on the word "all-ri-i-i-ight" as only he can. Much as I love this song it will make for some cringe-worthy karaoke !	1
Awesome!	1
ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.	-1

I love this song song song about the bar bar bar. LoL its about dam time. :-)	1
I'll start by saying I'm biased just so you know, but I love Blake Shelton.  This new single sounds like it came straight out of the 80's with a nice, modern twist to it.  Sure to be his next number one.  Upbeat and absolutely enjoyable.	1
love this new song can't wait for the new album.	1
Good song!	1
Not enough stars for Blake. Period. I will say the Sangria song I wasn't too into.	1

Bought this song for my daughter.  It's one of her favorites.	1
Catchy song :)	1
sledgehammer by fifth harmony symbolizes the feeling of having feelings for someone who stirs up a sense of aliveness in the heart.  Fifth harmony also sounds like americas answer to either the girls aloud and/or the Saturdays (both names which also consist of talented singers).  However, fifth harmony manages to maybe pull inspiration from those groups yet still creating an innovative song of their own with sledgehammer. All in all, sledgehammer is great for those who like pop/euro-dance melodies.	1
I am obsessed with this song! it is a really catchy, cool song that I would highly recommend listening to.	1
This song is so cool! The saxophone in it is amazing	1

This song fits perfectly in our dance and cook playlist. My girls and I love to do both at the same time and this fits perfectly.	1
THIS SONG IS AWESOME!!!!	1
Nice product.	1
When I first heard it I loved it. The more I've listened to it the less though. I think if it was without Kid Ink I'd like it more.	1
Great album.	1
peppy	1
I went hunting for this song because I could not get it out my head. Found the video, and had to download the track. It's addictive. So did not know this was Fifth Harmony....	1

I bought this as a request for my Zumba Kids camp and they love it! Me, personally, I have to limit how many times I listen to it....because the chorus gets stuck in my head.	1
This is a good track, even if I at one point thought they had Iggy Azalea in their group or as a voice.	1

Oh yes Worth it is awesome	1
Fun to dance to and exersice.	1
There is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing, and others that just sound silly after awhile, and not really as simply driven because of voice alone. There aren't many right now that can sincerely drive alone on the voice from the heart, most of them now or days sound cheap and not as strong, like what we saw with The Pussycat Dolls and with other divas of today like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. It is sad, and with Fifth Harmony, they just haven't been able to drive themselves on the heart and voice alone. When I had heard their debut single, Worth It, I honestly would have to say is that they absolutely don't know how to sing. They absolutely didn't drive at all, they just have halted with the brakes. I found the song to be one that doesn't even rank high among girl groups like TLC, and En Vogue to just name a few. I really have to say that Fifth Harmony needs to look and find better, because this song wasn't worth it.  Song: D	-1
The debut album is finally here and it doesn't disappoint! Great vocals and infectious beats, these ladies have really proven themselves in the industry the past couple of years. Definitely one of the best pop albums of the last five years.	1
They sound just like Danity Kane...just don't expect a bunch of great music like "Lemonade","All In a Day's Work" or "Tell Me"...there's only one great song on here called "Going Nowhere"!!!{they snap'd on this song,it's perfect},an a bunch of other o.k songs."Worth It" ft Kid Ink was o.k,also "Like Mariah" ft Tyga{that sample saved that song},"Reflection" & "We Know".	-1
Fifth Harmony has such great;talent. Their voices match ever lyric in every song. I'm in love this girl group.	1
Love this album great pop songs totally recommend it.	1
Actually not a bad CD, and came signed by all five members. For a lightning deal I think it was well worth it!	1
love the lyrics	1
Love them	1
Love these ladies voices and talent. This group never ceases to amaze me.	1
Great new chick group	1
Excellent product and service.	1
love all the songs on this cd and i would buy it again	1
favorite band of all time	1
Reflections!  I was prepared not to like this CD.  But, I rooted for them when they appeared on X-Factor and figured it was only fair to support their first full CD and to my surprise, this is an excellent CD!  I am very critical when it comes to music and look for reasons not to like songs but there isn't a bad beat on it.  I think every track could be a stand-alone single.  Some of the songs sound like two songs in one and that is a hype factor to me, I love it.  Its not the girly girl music I expected; they show a lot of maturity and come off as very experienced songstresses/entertainers.	1
I was ecstatic when Fifth Harmony released their first album, and I knew the songs were going to be good. This album exceeded my expectations!! I love 5H and this album is one of the best I've ever heard. They never fail to impress!	1
Great album!	1
Jerry Lee Lewis does not show his age at all on this new release! Lewis, the producer and arranger did a great job of picking songs that fit his vocal range and style. There is still the presence of his strong, rollicking piano playing on each song. There is also a nod to his Sun Studio partners Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley with "Folsom Prison Blues" and "Promise Land". I will not be surprised to see Rock & Roll Time on some best of the year list at the end of 2014.	1
This is another fine album by Jerry Lee Lewis, the last surviving member of The Million Dollar Quartet.  It doesn't lean as heavily on musical "guests" as his previous album, although there are some here.  Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Neil Young, Robbie Robertson and Shelby Lynn lend a hand, but are not advertised on the album cover.  Rock, country, blues, The Killer can still take any song and make it a Jerry Lee Lewis song.	1
i love it	1
thanks	1
WOW !! this is a very cool CD, it's good to see that for an old guy, he's still got it !!!	1
Sorry, Jerry Lee, time for you to hang it up	-1
Excellent product and service.	1
A+++	1
An American Icon ! WOW this is great! Jerry Lee has pulled off a few more classics on this CD, I do not know how he keeps on doing it at his age; but WOW! If you have never listened to this guy's music you can start right here with this one. If you are a fan of the "Killer" then you must get this CD. Jerry Lee Just keeps on Rocken' the music industry. He in-fact is a legend in his own time.	1
"Rock & Roll Time" is great! This is a great album from Jerry Lee Lewis. This is also a great album from one of the biggest living legends of country & rock & roll.

Great songs!	1
I love this song. I listen to it often, especially when I need to be reminded of God's love. Thanks Jeremy for writing good music.	1
Such a moving song! Love this arrangement.	1
What I buy here are songs I've heard on K-LOVE and made a note of to buy later when I got the financial opportunity. They're all a five star pick, to me, or I wouldn't buy them.	1
It is always so great to that God sees all and knows all we are going through with great compassion!	1
I love Jeremy Camp! This is another great song with an awesome message. It's so comforting to know that God knows everything and is there with you, throughout the trials of life.	1

Future Classic by a great artist.	1
So far, this is my second favorite song from Sonic Highways. Granted, that range is 1 to 3 at this time :) This cut doesn't have the complexity of  "Something from Nothing," is straight-up rock with a little bit of Nashville, and features Zac Brown. There is a nice transition around 3.20 and it comes back strong.  I do enjoy the lyrics such as:  "I've been going through life...Making foolish plans...Now my world is in your hands." And, "There's mystery in this wood...And ghosts within these roots...That are tangled deep beneath this southern ground."  Can't wait until my pre-order lets me actually download it.  You can find the full song all over the Interwebs by searching Foo Fighters Congregation. Enjoy.	1
Best Current Band	1
I can see that this will be bring the house down when you see them perform it live.	1
Bought for my wife, She loves it!	1
Great new songs from the Foo Fighters. Shows how much they have grown since the beginning. This is a fantastic work of music from one of the best rock bands out there right now.	1
Great Tune!	1
Something From Nothing (Chicago): Released October 2014 features Rami Jaffee and Rick Nielsen. The first release sets the stage for the epic awesomeness of the Foo Fighters.  I can already envision this amping up the stadiums.  The bass is wonderfully dark and the multitude of changes throughout the song are outstanding:  A great mix of soft, melodic, funk, heavy and hard.  A week and change later, I watched the HBO episode. I like this song even more, now.	1
Yuck. ordered for someone else.	-1

The song is great, very emotional.	1
Love this artist and this song. Saw the video as well. I don't know who writes her music but every time she sings she has a hit.	1
I really like this song. It has a great beat and good vocals. Some of the lyrics are just a little too simple/empty, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but it is still fantastic all the same. I love to sing along to this while I am working out or washing the dishes.	1
To be honest, I am not a huge fan of Ariana Grande, but this song was an exception. After hearing it on the radio, I could not get it out of my head and soon bought it here on Amazon. The vocals are impressive and there is a bittersweet feeling to the lyrics as you hear of a past lover wanting the chance to be with her ex one last time.	1
Bought for my niece. I think she got a great voice, but cant get past her scuzzy image. She too is probably not likeable as a person, but that has nothing to do with an amazing talent. Too bad you got get dirty and ugly to make a living in music, or maybe that's just her style.	-1
Ariana sings of heartache, reminiscing of good times with a past lover.  At various points, Ariana's voice soars (especially during the chorus),  then drops to a beautiful lower register, underscoring her growing vocal range as she evolves to a more fully nuanced vocalist.  The lyrics examine perceived limitations in contrast to a lover's new partner:  And I know, and I know, and I know She gives you everything but, boy, I couldn't give it to you And I know, and I know, and I know That you got everything But I got nothing here without you, baby  Ariana laments for a happier time spent with her lover, pleading for "One Last Time" to bring her nostalgia into focus.  This is a beautiful, winning song which provides a nice showcase for Ariana's talent.  I highly recommend adding "One Last Time" to your music library.  It's a big step forward in Ariana's growing catalog of great singles.  Rob.	1
I love this song so much! It evokes a lot of emotions. Looooooove it!	1

Great song. Ariana Grande and the one who wrote this for her did a wonderful job.	1
G-Unit brings back the basics with this EP. If you are looking for the G-unit from last decade you found it. With solid beats and catchy hooks G-Unit provides a little bit of the best club music you can find.  If you are a classic G-Unit fan or are looking for some solid club/house music, this is for you.  Highly Recommend: I Don't F**k With You	1
Somebody pinch me right now, because I must be dreaming that the G-Unit is back. Wait a minute, oh snap,  G- Unit is back! The beauty of independence EP is fiery hot yo! I know the rap gods has blessed us all because the game was getting too soft, fragile, boring,suspect and weak. General 50 Cent has rounded up the troops to unleash that hard to the core dangerous bust your head open hip hop music. I truly did not see this wonderful surprise coming but here we are big baby! Instant bangers like"watch me", "the plug", and the sinister "I don't F with you" makes this EP remind the masses just how unstoppable the Unit still is in hip hop. Banks sounds sharper than ever on this EP. Young buck always was my personal favorite out the crew, and buck bodies every verse as usual. New addition Kidd Kidd from New Orleans is a great fit in the Unit with his street linquistic rhyme acumen and witty punchlines. Even Tony Yayo stepped up his lyricism to make this G-Unit reunion a true heat rock album. 50 Cent sounds like he has a battery in his back, because he is so energized and full of vigor and confidence like its 2003 again! I'm very pleased with this EP and I can not wait for the full length album. G-Unit is back like they left something!	1
It's decent I buy all 50 cent music I like the addition of kidd kidd to g unit actually I like ryder gang better than the unit with precious Paris, Kidd Kidd and 50	1
Doug Seegers is an example of sticking to your dreams and getting a break at the right time to make them come true.  The 62 year old was kicking around Nashville for years working as a street musician when a Swedish production crew doing a documentary on Nashville discovered him singing on a park bench.  He recorded "Going Down To The River" and once it was featured on the show, it became as monster hit in Sweden.  Mr. Seegers has a gritty and earthy voice that has been weathered over time.  The song has a lonesome and mournful acoustic guitar shuffle supplemented by a crackling electric guitar that pierces the song with a sad, longing feeling.	1
I don't really care for it. But I'm not a fan of bluegrass	-1
Againg love Eminem and Sia are great singing together	1
Love it.	1
Great!	1
I first heard this song  while watching "The Enforcer", Sia's voice is amazing.  I really enjoyed Eminem' clean version of the song.	1
He's a very good a artist. Just listen to his words.	1
I love this song because that is what it takes to survive in this world. It takes Guts over fear. Love it!	1
Gotta find a loud enough of a system to blow this on.	1
Awesome song!	1
This track is the theme for the motion picture The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington. It's also a pretty awesome tune. If you're an Eminem fan, or Sia fan, I'd say this is a must have.	1
instant classic!	1
Awesome!!! His best song yet better than 8 mile so true!!!	1
I highly recommend this album if you enjoy neo-classical/epic orchestral music and TSFH. Thomas Bergersen is a genius composer and this music is some of his best. I would say this is equal to his first album Illusions. They are slightly different in sound and feel but are both excellent. This album feels like its telling a story and boy its an enjoyable, beautiful, and epic one. Highlights on the album: Creation of Earth, Cry (one of my favorite songs of all time), Final Frontier, Colors of Love, Empire of Angels. There are no duds on this album.	1
Thomas Bergersen can do NO wronge. This is a fabulous piece of music, dramatic, powerful, keeps you  with it til the last note.	1
Beautiful music!	1
Product came in perfect condition!! I will order again soon!!	1
So much of this epic music is beginning to sound alike.	1
Loved it the first time I listened to the album and I like it more every time I hear it!	1
enjoyed	1
He finally put Cassandra on an album.  That song alone makes this disc worth it. The other music is just a bonus.  Don't take that the wrong way, this album is really, really good (hence the 5 stars).	1
When you read the insert included in this album, its clear to see that Bergersen has incredible passion for his line of work. and it shows. There is not a single poor track on this album, because its a sort of greatest hits album. There are distinctions to every song, from the female vocals ranging from haunting to wonderous, the norwegian folk influences, to the exotic instrumental features, to the prominence of string soloing. And the epicness. Yes, epicness. Its a tacky way to say, but its true. This album makes you want to close your eyes and exhale slowly and loudly. It makes you imagine goddesses rising out of the ocean, or a formidable army of spartan-esque soldiers marching across vast plains, with huge banners and chanting ominously. It gives you goosebumps and makes you smile and hum along. And if you're alone, you may may find yourself pretending to conduct the musicians. Or in my case, when you think you're alone. My coworkers still make fun of me to this day.	1
This man is a Genius	1
Bergersen did another masterful job.  This sounds like his work, as always, but it's differentiated enough from his earlier albums that it has its own distinct character.  It's not all moody battle music, and the tracks are far more developed than mere "trailer" shorts that his competition offers.	1
Sun is in every manner of the word . . . brilliant!  Let me start off this review by saying that I have so far purchased almost all available tracks from Two Steps from Hell and Thomas Bergersen. My review may seem biased, but I assure you. If this talented composer ever released a dud, I would be the first to express my disappointment.  So it took me a while to write this review because I needed to listen to the album a few zillion times to make sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase and not just running off the high of a new album.  The album starts off with Before Time and leads into Creation of Earth and Sun. These three songs are a great way to start off the album and immediately set the stage for what you're getting yourself into. When I listen to the beginning songs I see images of a hero or heroine rising to face a challenge and when the music crescendo's I see the massive obstacle before them in a flash of white.  The violin which was personally played by Thomas Bergersen leads the symphony in a rousing moment that captures that "heroic" feel oh so perfectly. This is the same feeling you'd get from any of their previous albums without feeling like it's been done before.  What do I mean by that?  Well Bergersen seems to not be afraid to experiment with different songs and melodies when creating his music. As much as I love Hans Zimmer's work, sometimes the music feels very been there done that, which is understandable considering how many movies he's scored. However, Bergersen somehow manages to find a way to keep his music fresh and new while still capturing the spirit of "music making you braver."  HOWEVER! I do have a few problems with this album. Nothing to knock off the stars, but there were a few songs in here that had me scratching my head.  "Our Destiny" felt very much like "Nero" from the Archangel album. The piano with the ascending and descending scales just felt all too similar to Nero. It was still a great song to capture the classical feeling of Greecian times, but I couldn't shake that all too familiar feeling.  "Colors of Love"  was a song that had great promise in the intro, but once the female vocals came in, I found myself getting very tired of this song. My main problem with this particular track is that the female vocals are WAY TOO REPETITIVE! I feel like I'm listening to the same lyrics being used over and over again with very little variation to the music and instruments. It just keeps looping at different pitches until it drives me completely crazy! Ah well, can't win them all right?  Disliking one song isn't enough to bring down a star rating, and when you have a song like "Dragonland" HOW CAN YOU GIVE THIS ALBUM LESS THAN 5?  "Dragonland" was the most unexpected song out of this album that completely blew me away. It's started off deceptively simple like "Fountain of Life" in the Miracles album. Just a soft piano, some sleigh bells, and a theme that softly repeats. But then some percussion hits and the volume slowly starts to increase. Then the strings arrive and you can feel a very gradual change in the song. The intro continues for some time and then . . . the choir shows up.  "Dragonland" quickly escalates into a bombastic soundtrack with a powerful bass, electrifying strings, haunting choir, tribal flute, guitar riffs, and just the most amazing sound you'll hear in this entire album. One listen to this track at full volume is sure to knock your socks off and I'd be surprised if you're not tempted to hit the replay button.  That track alone easily keeps this album at five stars and makes this song collection an EASY recommendation to buy. It's different, it's inspiring, it's thrilling, and it's well worth its value if you love this kind of music.	1
It's really amazing when you come to expect a masterpiece and are never disappointed. When writing my first fantasy novel I listened to Thomas Bergersen and Two Steps From Hell primarily when imagining scenes are brainstorming about the story. There is but few who even come close to these guys in helping me enter into an imaginary world of my own creation. I'm writing the second and third books now and this new album coming out is perfect timing for cultivating the process. I will listening non-stop for a few days.	1
hendrix recorded this in the last months of his life love it he really put his heart ansd soul in this 1 one of the best guitar solos ever hendrix showed them all he was the best guitarist in rock music rest in peace brother fly on.	1
Freaken awesome.	1
Interesting to read the diverse range of opinions about the new TV on the Radio album, but I can't say I'm surprised. Anytime a band decides to go for a more full sound (some would say slicker) there will be the inevitable backlash and cries of "sell out." But to my ears, this band is still progressing and taking chances ... and sounding better than ever. I love this sound.  Listening to these new songs I'm struck by the power and the energy, not to mention the strong melodies that abound. The band itself sounds tight and confident, clearly finding their sonic groove and locking in. For me, the brilliant "Right Now" is the highlight of the album, although I'm equally captivated by "Lazerray," a thumping rocker that sounds like a great long-lost Ramones songs. I want to shout "Gabba Gabba Hey" every time it plays!  If you've been a fan of the other TV on the Radio albums, don't miss the chance to hear this new one too. This is the sound of a talented band clicking on all cylinders.	1
Excellent album.  Top rating.  I have not been a big fan for long.  Had bought their last album, in my opinion, nowhere near as good as Seeds though.  I was lured in before this album was available with "Happy Idiot", because I am quite frankly a happy idiot.  I love "Careful You", it's my favorite song on the album.  The album as a whole is excellent with creativity and upbeat tempos that transfer positive vibes.  I highly recommend this album for all listening ears.	1
There's no doubt that TV on the Radio is a special and unique band. With each release they've managed to expand their sound and weave new textures into it, something that Seeds puts on display with expert precision. It's difficult to describe exactly why I love this album so much but right from my first listen I was enthralled. The sound is more direct here, as songs like "Happy Idiot", "Could You" and "Right Now" demonstrate. Then there are the more obtuse and varied songs that the group is known for, with "Ride", "Test Pilot" and the album's title track being some of the biggest standouts. "Winter" is driven by a distorted guitar and "Trouble" is driven by acoustic dynamics; they're both drastically different and yet they compliment each other so well. It's difficult to pinpoint any weak spots on the record and with each spin I find myself drawn in deeper.  Some may be turned off by the more accessible sound but it fits the band well and you can tell it's a natural evolution for this great group. Seeds is a joyful and moving experience that covers so many emotions without ever overwhelming you. I really can't recommend it enough and it just be my favorite album of theirs to date. Simply outstanding.	1
Great, uptempo, catchy Afro-pop!  Not what I usually listen to, an uplifting blast of melody and rhythm.  Tunde Adebimpe is a great singer, the production is rich and layered.  Just about every song could be a Top 40 hit single, but "Careful You" and "Ride" are among the best.  I know TVOTR has a reputation as an "alternative rock" band, but this is pure pop, a guilty pleasure!  (verified purchase from a large brick-and-mortar bookstore)	1
Great band. I hope they come through Tulsa and play Cain's I have all their albums.	1
I have all of TV on the Radio's recordings, am pleased to have seen them in concert, and consider myself a fan. When I first played Seeds (in streaming), it seemed surprisingly ordinary -- not a term I would generally associate with TV on the Radio. I thought it's good, but not as impressive as past efforts. Fortunately, I played it again, changed my opinion, and bought the CD. Arguably, this recording *is* more polished and smoother than earlier efforts, but that simply makes it more accessible -- and that's not a bad thing. Over time, Seeds may end up being the TV on the Radio album that I play the most often.	1
More melodious without sacrificing the band's signature sound, "Seeds" should appeal to a wider audience without alienating long time fans.  (Although "Ride" is moving into Gotye territory, maybe the only misstep.)  "Lazerray" is the standout modern rock song. Other good uptempo numbers are "Could You" and "Happy Idiot." Meaningful lyrics crafted with care as usual. Really, I enjoy listening all the way through, and it is perhaps this unique band's strongest all-around outing to-date, which is why it gets five stars.	1
TVOTR is one of the few newer bands I follow actively. I discovered them after the release of Dear Science, which sounded truly groundbreaking to my ears.  Here were these guys who were my age and grew up with the same music I did (80s synth-pop and alt-rock), who took those influences someplace truly new and different.  Dear Science was "experimental" in the way it combined sounds and ideas from the past and present into something that sounded immediate and had its own very unique character. My appreciation for that album only grew over the years.  Their next one, Nine Types of Light, was also great in that same groundbreaking way but sounded more introverted and reflective even at its harder-rocking moments.  Then nothing from this band for a few years and I wondered where they had gone.  So now TVOTR is back with an album that reminds me instantly how ahead of the pack they are.  The songs are, as other reviewers point out, less overtly experimental than some of the earlier work.  But the songwriting is just as strong as ever and feels more direct with some of the complexity removed.  The music seems more soulful now, with a greater emphasis on vocal harmony. Of course there's still the electronic backdrop and edgy guitar parts, but it all balances well to place the emphasis on the songs themselves.  There isn't a bad track here but so far my favorite is Careful You.  This is certainly worth buying if you have been following TVOTR or want to hear some very modern sounds and interesting ideas.	1
"Seeds" is the first album from TV On The Radio since the death of bassist Gerard Smith from lung cancer, and according to Tunde Adebimpe, their best yet. What they unfurl here are unfussy song structures largely giving up their charm early on, unlike the more complex and meandering path taken on previous albums, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.  The band carries on rather optimistically with lead singer Tunde Adebimpe singing "Rain comes down like it always does, this time I've got seeds on ground" on the moody title track "Seeds", and "Everything's going to be okay I keep telling myself, don't worry be happy" on the slowly shuffling "Trouble" with atmospheric strings and soothing harmonies. With that, they declare their intention to forge ahead.  How much do I love you?" he sings urgently against a wall of cascading "aaahs", gently buzzing synths and trilling guitars on opening track "Quartz" conjuring a rather reverential feel. Lead single "Happy Idiot" finds Adebimpe declaring ignorance to be bliss in a relationship over galloping beats and angular riffs, catchy and anthemic. Slowing things down is the blissful soul of "Test Pilot" with Adebimpe shifting from his regular tenor to falsetto in the blink of an eye, while "Love Stained" finds him singing in a creamy croon against a gentle tempo-shifting backdrop.  "Ride" has a solemn two minute-long piano overture before morphing into a widescreen rocker Springsteen would kill for. "Right Now" is a twitchy dance rocker and is also incredibly catchy. Following are a pair of punk rock-inflected numbers; "Winter" which is fuzzy and skeletal and reminds me of R.E.M, while the raucous "Lazerray" occupies the more frenzied end of the spectrum.  The album has a well rounded sound, and despite the immediacy of the songs still manages to give up more with each listen. A welcome and inventive return from a place of pain and loss.	1
When I first heard this album, I was a bit disappointed. After all, the band indicated this might be the best thing they'd written (which always makes me a bit skeptical). "Happy Idiot" was a great lead single that demonstrated the band certainly still has what it takes to make a great album. However, on first album listen, Seeds seemed too tame and lacked the innovation and surprises that make earlier TV on the Radio efforts so good.  Yet I found myself drawn back to this album again and again. It has quickly grown on me as a well-balanced and emotional effort that delivers more and more upon each listen. These aren't songs that are going to punch you right away, but they are going to stick with you if you give them the chance to grow. Tunde Adebimpe's vocals have never been so strong, and there's plenty of innovation on this album if you are willing to look for it.  It's not the best album in TV on the Radio's catalog, but it's the best they've done in awhile. Just make sure you give it a chance.  Edit (December 4th): I finally got my vinyl copy of this album, and I'm upgrading my review to 5 stars. The artwork and packaging are beautiful, and the record sounds loads better than the mp3s. It's a much fuller listening experiencing, and the mastering is much better. This is now a candidate for album of the year for me.	1

This is my new favorite slipknot album. I have listened to it enough now over the past few days that I can honestly say I love this album. Corey is in his musical prime, after the last 2 Stone Sour albums now this new slipknot, damn this guy can't be stopped! I have much respect for the guys of Slipknot. great job!	1
".5: The Gray Chapter" is great! This is another great album from Slipknot, a well-anticipated 4-year wait after their last album. This is one of the best rock / metal albums of the year.

Fantastic album and a return to the sound that made Slipknot great. After 6 long years and a lot of turmoil, Slipknot returned with an amazing album that sounds like a combination of everything that came before it. It combines the aggression of Iowa, the melody of Vol. 3 and the complexity of All Hope is Gone. While there is no bad Slipknot album, I would say this is their second best right behind Iowa. Highlights of this album are "The Negative One", "Killpop" and "Custer"	1
Great purchase, recommended seller!!!	1
I dig it.  Better album than all hopeople is gone.	1
great album they didn't disappoint	1
I've been a Slipknot fan since they first came on the radar in 2000 and thought they were really hard and cool, even "Version 3" which was more structured and more like straightforward rock. I kind of moved away from Slipknot and got more into thrash and death metal but after the death of their drummer, I found myself paying attention to the band once again. This album "The Grey Chapter" is definitely in the memory of their passed comrade and one song is sung to/for him. It is a very intimate album but it can go from sounding soft and sentimental, to the soft to loud dynamic found in most Stone Sour songs, ultimate hardcore metal with authentic pain and sadness, and almost Pantera-esque presence oand power at times. I've heard complaints that this sounds like bad nu-metal or something until Stone Sour put out another one but this doesn't feel like something excessive put out to cash in. Of course there are a few tracks on here that aren't really that great, almost every Slipknot album has a few fillers. Still, this is one of Slipknot's best hands down  up there with their best work. They used to sing about pain and anger from another standpoint but here it's coming from their own tragic loss and it really elevates the performances, the song quality, and the overall album. Sure, they use some Stone Sour like clean vocals/guitar once in a while but this is DEFINITELY a Slipknot record when all is said and done. I would recommend it to any fan, I was starting to lose faith in them but this reaffirmed it for me. If not here, their debut or Chapter 3. For anyone still hating Slipknot for being nu-metal or being too trendy, that should be put to rest because they have proved themselves.	1
Still better than ever. One of my all time favorite metal bands.	1
Slipknot has really managed to bring back the good stuff with Vol 3 and All Hope Is Gone without alienating fans of Iowa. The album is overall one of the band's darker ones, but its fused with a great touch of cleans. Corey Taylor has never sounded so good singing clean. His voice is comparable to the ones belonging to Swedish melodeath kings Bjorn Strid and Christian Alvestam. It sounds that good.  Right from the start you are treated to a lot of heavy riffing, and the attitude of the record helps you visualize the headbanging of the band during a live concert. Darker than it is heavy, Slipknot's fifth album is a great hybrid of everything they do well.  My favorite songs were Sarcastrophe, The devil In I, Skeptic, and Be Prepared For Hell.	1
All Slipknot fans miss Paul & this album is in dedication to him. Awesome work!!	1

If you like really heavy HEAVEY METAL you live this CD!!!! I needed this cd because I'm going to see them live in May of 2015.  Rock On Dudes!!!	1
I have to write so many words for this review to be accepted.	1
I like this item	1
I guess my son likes this . It was a gift.	1
Awesome album!	1
I'm sick and tired of people whining about whether it sounds or doesn't sound like Iowa, before Iowa, Stone Sour, Corey, old Slipknot with Paul, Joey, whatever, blah blah blah. Get over it already. Bands evolve and this is what Slipknot does best. Corey lives and breathes music. Nothing he does is half-assed.  It's already becoming a classic and fellow bands and musicians support them 100%. The more I listen to this album the more I'm hooked.	1
This is something special.  This is the start of another chapter to slipknot.  Great work!!!	1
In the top three of the music I purchased in 2014. I love this bands originality, musicians and vocal talents, and the song writing. They are right up there with Tool and Korn.	1
Is this Slipknot or Stone Sour? That being said this is not a bad CD by any chance it's just that now it seem Slipknot is softer than Stone Sour.	1
I love this music, it is very metal and great to listen to. Slipknot and Stone Sour are so different but I love the music that comes from both, even if the lead singer is the same for both groups, the music is totally different.	1
Awsome, Cheers	1
Slipknot is back! Ive been into this band this the get go. After each album I think they keep getting better and better. But after listening to this album I'm sorry to say I can't say that. The band is tighter than ever heavier than ever and the gutiar riffs are sickiest of any band I've heard in awhile. But after listening to this album a couple of times something just seems to be missing. Its probably heavier than they been since Iowa and with  the production of the first album that sort of at times reminds me of the first album but more mature. But where are the big chorus and catchy melodies that the other albums had. Where are the wait and bleeds, or the psycho socials or before I forgot songs. Don't get me wrong I love their deep cuts too but this album sort of seems rushed to me and its sort of tainted the quality of the music. But the album as so many layers to the music and so much going on maybe it just has to grow on you. Ill keep listening to it and look forward to other releases from one of my favorite bands.	1
Excellent product and service.	1

Awesome	1
I pre-ordered this album and was able to download The Devil In I and The Negative One ahead of the full release date. I was beyond impressed with these tracks and was interested to see what I was in store for us on release day. Was it going to be a mix of heavy songs and slow moody songs? Was this going to be some good songs mixed in with a bunch of whiny, emo lyrics?  It is neither.  This album sets itself apart from the earlier releases while still maintaining that Slipknot attitude and sound. It is incredibly heavy and aggressive and I must mention the lyrics multiple times because they are outstanding. This album lacks nothing....musically or lyrically. I read an interview by Corey Taylor a couple of months ago where he stated this album would be heavy but also moody. This album is supposed to be a culmination of all the feelings and emotions the band has dealing with the last few years...especially with regards to the death of Paul Gray.  While Slipknot certainly has reasons to put out an emotional, angry, hostile or even an emo album... they chose to release this album. It is emotional, it is angry, it is hostile and all of these emotions are put in their proper place amongst some great musicianship and amazing lyrics. I have always been a fan of Corey's writing style but the lyrics on 0.5 are on a new level. You can feel the anger and the pain these guys have felt in a musical package so well put together it can stand against any so-called "emotional and meaningful" album in any genre.  Simply put...this album is amazing! Every Slipknot release until this point has had tracks I love and a few I can live without. I have listened to it from start to finish many times over and I love every track. I am in no way a Slipknot fan boy but they have outdone themselves with this release. Every track holds its own on this album and every track deserves your full attention. While it does have its moody parts, those parts do not take anything away from the rest of the album...they only compliment it. The moodiness is presented in a real and mostly aggressive manner and this album is never emo in any way.  0.5 is raw...it is emotional...it is heavy...it is real.  Buy this album.	1
I was an on again/off again casual fan since 1999, a band I like but wouldn't place them in my top.. 15 or 20 but definitely one up there as one of the most unique bands spawned from the Korn nu-metal scene.  In a world of "just another heavy band catering to the converted" -  I wasn't expecting much but this is good stuff.  Love the use of samples and ambience here.  4 stars or 7.5 or 8 (out of 10)	1
Just as Slipknot's last album, 2008's "All Hope Is Gone," was, the same can be said about their new one, "5: The Gray Chapter," in that it, too, would make for the perfect career-ending retrospective. In this case, the band has produced a record that is kind of an amalgamation of all of their records, including the aged-but-fun angst heard on their now fifteen-year-old debut, the all-out brutality of 2001's "Iowa," and the more melodic and textured approach found on their latter-day material (starting with 2004's "Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses"). What this means is that ""Gray" couples together Helmet-inspired stop-start hooks and Korn-esquedowntuned guitars with vocals that alternate between both the shredded-throat type and the soaring, harmonious variety.  What this also means is that, despite being the first record not to include bassist Paul Gray (whom the band lost to a drug overdose in 2010), and drummer Joey Jordison (who was fired from the group in 2013), Slipknot sound like they have not missed a beat. For one thing, they have recruited a new skinsman who is every-bit-the-capable trapkit annihilator that Jordison was. And his identity might remain a secret, but his playing is also exceptionally tight, technical, and forceful (he is sure to include plenty of blast beats). But with that said, it is important to note that there definitely are a few new and original ideas present, here, including nearly perfectly balancing their harsh and dissonant music with an equal-sized dollop of harmony. As a result, what frontman Corey Taylor and Company have crafted, here, should probably go down as one of the most accomplished and well-rounded efforts of their long and storied career.  The really foreboding intro track that is "XIX" sets the stage perfectly for "Sarcastrophe," a cut of almost pure thrash, what with its thrashy picking, and pummeling drum blasts and thrash beats. Corey's vocals, meanwhile, usually consist of an unusually bratty screaming style, thus helping to up the intensity to a level that is all-but guaranteed to make your pulse pound. It is one very intense and brutal number, if nothing else. "AOV" is another steady, thrashy pummeling, but one that augments its furious buzzsaw riffing and hammering skins with an undeniably melodic side, including some Stone Sour-esque wailing that sound not unlike many-a-song circulating on numerous modern hard rock radio stations. So while this number is first and foremost a brutal one, it does possess a certain accessibility which comes from a sweet and catchy backing vocal refrain ("ooooh").  The next couple of songs, "The Devil In I" (the record's second single) and the propulsive "Killpop," abide by the same brutal-yet-tuneful policy in that they both feature clean singing and proggy melodic guitar pockets. But any notion of melody quickly vanishes when the songs slam head-first into brutal, pummeling thrash runs and mosh pit-stoking choruses. (And the former of these two tunes is also of note for opening with a really catchy and rhythmically marching cadence.) Next up comes "Skeptic," another agitating, blood pumping angst-fest that is packed with staccato riffing, tight and precise drumming, and really memorable, chant-along, fist-pumping choruses. As such, the song ultimately comes across sounding kind of like something off of Slipknot's eponymous debut.  Later cuts, including "Lech" and "The One That Kills The Least," boast catchy, eardrum-snagging staccato guitar hooks and drum beats, and augments it with the usual allotment of angsty, throat-tearing screams. As solid as these two tracks are, though, (especially "Lech," as "The One That Kills" seems to kind of stand out as filler material), they are both overshadowed by "Goodbye" and "Nomadic." The former piece offsets its brutal musical backdrop (with slamming blast beats) with unorthodoxly tuneful singing (most of the time), and epically huge, melodical choruses. And a brief but noteworthy, wah-heavy guitar solo is tacked on to the end of the mix, here, too. And "Nomadic" takes a similar path, as a steady, thrashy beating, albeit one with a short-but-sweet melodic guitar solo and huge, sing-songy choruses.  "Custer" is a really catchy and slam-danceable rant centered around an unforgettably anthemic, fist-pumpable chorus; but the next track after that, "Be Prepared For Hell," dials things down a bit by being an unnervingly creepy, skin-crawling interlude. And next we have lead-single "The Negative One," which is an insanely catchy cut that seemingly takes Slipknot's combined sound from over the years and meshes it all together into one, five-minute, twenty-five-second long frame. It features deft D.J. scratches, great drumming (i.e. tight, rolling drum fills), foaming-at-the-mouth vocals, and groovy guitar licks. It has another memorable chorus, too. And finally, the set concludes with its sole anomaly: "If Rain Is What You Want" is a spooky, foreboding, dark, and creepy near ballad, although it is one that is home to a few chunky, chugging power chords, up-tempo drum fills, and a wah-heavy guitar lead.  "5: The Gray Chapter" lacks the novelty that Slipknot's aforementioned debut had when it first dropped onto the alternative-extreme metal world in mid-1999. And it also cannot claim to be nearly the ingeniously-written and/or groundbreaking piece of music that 2008's "All Hope Is Gone" was. But even if it is not without flaws, this album is so well-done that it deserves to be deemed a worthy purchase to all fans of any of the band's previous releases. And, as this reviewer said in his review of this band's last album, if this is `Knot's last-ever release, then at least they went out with one-heckuva bang!	1
This is the first Slipknot album I've purchased since their debut (wasn't a fan). Since it got good reviews and I'm a metal guy I decided to give it a shot. It's unlike anything else they've ever done, in that it's meticulously arranged with outstanding production. There are humongous drums, machine gun riffs, and deep throated vocals, along with some really nice harmonies and guitar solos. This is easily the strongest work they've put out. In the past I've snickered as Corey compared themselves to Metallica, but I would say they have delivered something along the lines of "Master of Puppets" or "Rust in Peace". This will be the metric from which they're measured from here on out. Quite possibly their high water mark. If nothing else, they've proven they're capable of this kind of effort and the expectations will be higher.  If you dig metal, thrash, industrial, etc. You'll certainly like this album.	1
Slipknot is back & in fine form. Despite having two members gone, R.I.P Paul Gray & the extraordinary Joey on drums, they still sound great. It's another mix of Stone Sour & Slipknot which has been seen since Volume 3 was released but I enjoy Corey's singing & have matured since Iowa so I accept it. People say it's better then All Hope Is Gone but I really don't see the difference but that's not a bad thing. Highly recommend this album & I know it's going sell well. Favorite tracks are Devil in I, Custer, Killpop, & AOV.	1
findly Slipknot is back sounding like Iowa & All Hope Is Gone.yes Slipknot haters Limp Bizkit & Korn are good bands too lol. forever  the gray chapter is what vol3 should had been thank you Slipknot for not letting me down. & people try some Wumpscut, Hocico, Suicide Commando & Velvet Acid Christ for industrial music as well. i look forward seeing you guys live.	1
With over a decade invested in Something Corporate and Jack's Mannequin, surviving cancer, and a solo-EP, I think the road led to this. Ten Andrew-penned "piano pop" songs, a touch of electronica, the piano again, being front and center! "See Her On The Weekend," "All Our Lives," and "Cecelia" are favourites! Of the [4] Japanese bonus tracks, I really liked "Lottery Ticket."	1
They are awesome, great music.	1
Good effort for a newer band.  Some of the songs are great, a few not as great.  Overall, worth listening to.	1
A true west coast sound!! very relaxing and enjoyable CD.  Great purchase experience and would buy this again.	1
I saw this guys play in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I had to have their album I was so impressed with their live preformance. I whole album is great. I listen to music through ears buds and this whole album is on my MP3 device.	1
I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. If you love Andrew McMahon, going back to Something Corporate or Jack's Mannequin, you'll love this record. A couple of the songs aren't among his strongest, and the production seems kind of punched up, as though whoever did the final mix did'n't completely trust the material.  But it's definitely worth having if you're a fan, which I am.	1
Nice melodies...	1
Fantastic album. I was a HUGE fan of "o'god", mainly bc I thought the heavier tracks were a throwback to old school disciple. Well, I gotta say, the album makes that last one look rough! Improved musicianship, cooler riffs, more direct and bolder lyrics, and a heavier album overall. I've been a fan for 15 yeas or so, and I think th May be the best album they've done. Pick this one up.	1
I've liked this group since this might sting . Must have group if you don't have them.	1
If love there cds by GOD and this might sting a little bit and back again .little newer styel but mainly to my joy bold rocking for Jesus christ with out being ashamed of Jesus christ as this cancer lick dizes has infected Christan music disciple welcome back to what made me love y'all Jesus christ rock on as ushal more than10 songs pray thay keep on this track can't wate till The nexed cd	1
Been eagerly waiting this new album, the title track is really good , so is the rest of the album, the message is what it's about, in heavy metal form , my favorite	1
I waited in anticipation for this album and have to say I am not disappointed in the least!!! "Attack" is true to form for Disciple which includes the powerful vocals, Scripturally honoring lyrics, and strong, energizing music. I highly recommend this album to all! You will not be disappointed.	1
Excellent! People call God many things and we hear many names but the bottom line for me is that He is Father and a good one. I am reminded that when everything is stripped away he is still Daddy (ABBA).	1
What a great Father we have. This is a wonderful song.	1
Good song, Good melody and easy to learn, heartfelt	1
Awesome!	1
Very moving love it.	1
Great song.	1
Can't get enough of Prince!	1
quik is one of the best technical sounding Producers and he always kept a groove and of course i dug the old triangle base he came out of with. problem is he is recycling a third tier version of stuff he did better back in the day. bringing back  El Debarge, Rob Funksta Bacon,Suga Free  doesn't lite the fuse as rhythmlism did back in 98.  to  me  he has been  hit and miss for a long time now. you get the occasional decent or party fun cut. humor still is good,though this album feels phoned in. still good to see still putting out albums and he is one of the most underrated figures in Rap Music,however he has done way better.	-1
A gift for my daughter and I don't like this modern "country".	-1

what the heck is stalley talking about?  robbing people for chevys and selling dope? what happened to all the introspective lyrics from " tell montez I love her" or " monkey ish" classic and honest songs from intelligent trunk music. when I first got introduced to stalleys music it seem like it was gonna be something unique or different but what it sounds like now is a failed attempt at being a trapper...	-1
meh, I love City and Colour, like alexisonfire's first one, pink is ok...  this did not impress me at all.  It's like an over dramatic version of she and him.	-1
When I first heard this song, I thought it would be similar to Story of My Life, but it has been a disappointment. This song has a very annoying beginning as well.	-1
I like that Amazon offers wide variety of free music it gives me a chance to listen to artists or genres that I might otherwise pass by.	-1
Listened once. Not my cup of tea. Good musicianship, but not something I like to listen to.	-1

This is not MARY! This is an attempt to reach a European market. Mary is authentic to the core. This is not her! Mary is SOUL! Her music is passionate and moving... Thought provoking and uplifting. The CD sold 109,000 copies in its first 3 weeks. Most legendary artist sell that in a day! She wasn't loyal to her fan base. Sam Smith is a genius! She should have done a duet with Sam instead of an entire album. They co-wrote several songs together. To think that DARKCHILD Produced most of the album and it failed. Disclosure did an awesome job! I love MARY! A big fan, but this isn't MARY!	-1
Not really a good Mary cd	-1
It's the worst thing she's ever done.	-1
Mary needed a new sound but this ain't cutting it neither. I can hear Banks sound on "follow" & "right now" but those songs still come off as just another o.k song from mary,I can hear Robin S. style on "My Loving" o.k also,"Whole Damn Year" seems to be that cool Mary sound but it still comes off as just o.k."Nobody but you" & "picc me up" are o.k also.	-1
Another horrible song by two horrible singers.	-1
I ordered this song by mistake on my phone i was looking for another song so sorry i was looking for something else	-1
I'm a big Pink Floyd fan but lets face it....this album is an Endless Snooze. Its almost as if this is a different band. This is nothing like A Momentary Lapse of Reason. With all due respect to the band, I think its time for the Floyd to retire.	-1
This should not be called Pink Floyd-Endless River. A more fitting title would be David Gilmour-A Yanni tribute. This is not like any other pink floyd album and not even close to Wish you were here. This is David Gilmour's wifes' music and her influence is evident and ruins the album. You can be fine without listening to this album, It is not memorable and a rather boring Yanni-ish type of music.	-1
I want to state clearly that I am a REAL fan of Pink Floyd, mostly of their later works.  Not so much of all the atmospheric early work.  This is a throwback to that it seems.  And it does NOT WORK for me. I listened to the CD, was unimpressed.  But looked forward to seeing the Blu-ray.  The good news is the sound of the recording on the Blu-ray, no video, is awesome, DTS-HD MA 5.1 96 kHz/24 bit, beautifully recorded BORING. This Pig Don't Fly IMHO. Sorry, I really wanted to like this.  Nice postcards though.	-1
boooo! worst Floyd ever!	-1
It's crap.	-1
not as good as I hoped it would be	-1
l don't like this cd	-1
just boring. expected more	-1
Pink Floyd must be gettin' OLD, (Aren't we all!)	-1
Good for falling asleep to. Where are the vocals? I think for Floyd's sake it good this is their last album. If Roger came back that might help but no cigar. Doesn't want anything to do with PF and you can see why. RIP Pink Floyd.	-1
VERY disappointed! :( As a lifelong Pink Floyd fan who has all their albums, DVDs, etc; I was hopeful that this would pick up where Division Bell left off...The artwork is very cool and the overall package is excellent as one would expect with a Pink Floyd offering. Sadly the 'music' is woefully disjointed and lacking inspiration, direction or even a theme, it really doesn't sound like Pink Floyd. I was hoping for a crowning achievement, their magnum opus; and instead, I just don't know.. I feel like I have lost a dear old friend, and the last time I saw them I barely recognized them - so I guess if you measure it that way, it's a success; but it's not something I will be playing again. :(	-1
From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.  Nothing at all to sink your teeth into.  Was this a contractual obligation album?  Resting on their laurels?  It will sell because of who we are!  Guys, please don't end your musical career as a band with this one!!	-1
I'm sure there are many PF fans like myself who would crave for a new Pink Floyd album, but this album isn't it. 98% percent of it just sounds like filler. Yes there's the iconic musicianship but aside from that, it really doesn't have that much to offer and just leaves one left feeling kind of cheated. There's no real concept here, no through-line. Just one instrumental after another till your left asking what's the point? I guess for the die-hard it makes for an interesting coda, but The Division Bell - while flawed - still makes for a better ending to the Floyd then this.	-1
Terrible CD ... What a big disappointment.  Sounds like elevator music, will never play it again!	-1
Please help me, how can anyone call this a Pink Floyd album, when only one member really has anything to do with it, and that member is not even an original member? It would be like Ron Wood finding four new guys and making Rolling Stones albums. This album was given to me by a friend and I listened to it. It is not a bad David Gilmour solo album, in general, his solo albums are not bad. However, I do have a BIG problem with him putting that Pink Floyd name on albums that are NOT Pink Floyd albums. And I have a problem with the delusionals that go ballistic defending this nonsense. There is no reason for Gilmour to continue to use the name, except to cash in on name recognition. I have no problem with being flamed for this review by the Roger haters and the David apologists, but one cannot simply review the music on this album and leave it at that, there is a moral problem here. I mean. considering the living status of all the members, we are in reality left with two musicians capable of contributing new music, David and Roger. Why is David allowed to call himself Pink Floyd, when Roger certainly has much more claim to that title. And if you don't think he does, you are too far gone to argue with. And spare me the "Roger quit the band" nonsense.	-1
Wow! What a disappointment, especially in regards to the hype of the 'new' "Pink FLoyd" album, which itself is a very misleading title. The 'ambient' music (a term I see that is being used quite frequently in reviews for this release) is good music to do yardwork, that is if nothing else is playing! There is not enough of David Gilmour's ethereal guitar sound on this album. He recently did some soundtrack music for a movie called "Vile People" that starred Donald Sutherland. It was scored by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead fame. It was amazing, Gilmour's work was. I absolutely do not like Radiohead but Dave brought that score to life, folks! Where is that playing here?  Oh, the poor souls who spent $30 on the deluxe version, I feel for you guys...You  will be payin that dough for packaging, which is basically a box, two postcards, a hologram and a "hardback book" that contains track notes and some '94 photos of the group.  The music is mainly FILLER, which given that is Pink Floyd means GOOD filler, but filler nonetheless. A lack of searing Gilmour Strat is sorely absent. Only one track has vocals and lyrics, which Mr Gilmour sings, in usual appealing tenor. One reviewer stated it perfectly, that this material should have been release as some sort of companion disc for the reissue of "Division Bell." Shoulda woulda coulda! This material is yet another Christmas cash grab. I've actually listened to the album twice, and the main highlight is the only proper song, "Louder Than Words."  Final Verdict: 4 on a scale of 1 to ten. And for the deluxe package, 2, due to the $30 price tag and lack of anything of substance.	-1
Aside from extras....."Bored In An Elevator" would have been a more fitting title. Music seems to just fill an empty space in a room. Never really touched mind, body or soul. Would have been better if Deluxe included some 4-way.	-1
Hmmmmmm.... The endless bore should be the title. This is really just a jam session. I can't think of one good reason to buy this unless you wish to donate money to the cause. These works were left unpublished for a reason. When you listen , it is obvious why. Little to no intriguing content here. I intently listened in full three times and took nothing away from it at all. This is in stark contrast to the great momentary lapse of reason and division bell albums- both classics. This is a shameful release in my opinion and I am shocked this was approved for release to the paying public. This would have been more suitable as an extra studio session inclusion with the division bell release. Donate if you please but don't expect much.	-1
Yes it musically sounds like Pink Floyd of latter day. But where are the lyrics? Pink Floyd have always had a story to tell and without lyrics and am just not interested I am afraid. This album will not be getting many listens from me. Farewell Floyd.	-1
Sounds more like a David Gilmour album than a Pink Floyd album to me.... And it feels rather like a money grab.  Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I have every Floyd album after Syd Barrett left, and I liked / loved the all, with maybe The Division Bell not quite making it to the level of the other albums. I would like  to give this 1.5 stars.	-1
As an avid PF fan up to and including The Wall, this is garbage. Gilmour has a good voice and is a guitar virtuoso, but this should not have the PF name on it. Same goes for Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell. And for anyone comparing it to pre Dark Side of the Moon PF, you are absolutely clueless. This is not PF. Its Mason and Gilmour doing a cash grab and soiling the PF name more than they already have. I say good riddance to those two. And anyone who says they saw PF during the Momentary Lapse and Division Bell tours, you did not. Just like those who went to see McCartney did not see the Beatles.	-1
Pink Floyd has given us a "new" album, "The Endless River"... I acquired an advanced copy, and I'm actually underwhelmed by what I heard. I was expecting, as I believe we all probably were and are an album with at least three or four tracks containing vocals, but sadly 17 out of the 18 tracks on the CD are simply an ambient trip... Track 18 of (The Endless River) titled "Louder Than Words", is a good, but not great tune. When listening to the album you keep thinking that the music is building to something, only to have it merge into a different sounding experience.  Note: for those not aware, this album was pieced together using leftover material from The Division Bell sessions, with very little new material actually recorded.  I'm speechless, disappointed, and seriously hoping that I'm not the only person that feels this way after listening to the Pink Floyd album we've been waiting for forever it would seem!	-1
When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she honestly has one of the worst albums that has came out in 2014. Her album A.K.A. has honestly failed to impress not just in music, but sadly going very low in her voice and her heart. She really does not have the drive, within the way she used to, when she came out with On The 6 fifteen years ago. Her song Booty has to honestly one of the worst songs that she has came out with altogether. She and Iggy Azalea really do not have any chemistry whatsoever. It definitely is a low point in Jennifer worse than any of the songs that she has put out in years. This song is just as terrible as the case was with I Luv Ya Papi. If you really wish that Jennifer should've found better in her work, you are not alone. This song is not even worth the time, and the effort. It is time for Jennifer Lopez to retire!! This song is not even worth downloading and the money she recorded to make it.  Song: F	-1

ha ha- definitely this song fits the comedy/parody song genre perfectly. Lyrics are kinda in line with 2 Live Crew's Me So Whore Knee or Chuck Berry's My Ding A Ling (i love Chuck though, this is probably 1 of his songs that i care the least for). Just goes to show you, people will make any crappy song popular (ie Whoot, There It Is) This is like the Whoot There It Is for the new generation	-1
This song is one of the worst songs ever made.  So why did I buy it?  I am a mobile DJ and believe it or not,  high school kids want to hear this crap.  If I could give it a negative 5 stars I would.  How you can call this music is beyond me.  When my dog howls it sounds better.	-1
Purchased for my niece. Not my idea of music you would pay for, with that being said I sure my niece enjoys it.	-1
It's crap, but people request I play it, so...	-1
Wow, did she really just reference All About That Bass in this song? How pathetic. It just goes to show the lengths to which she's willing to go to keep milking that fake, body positivity "anthem." There is nothing original about her and this proves it.	-1
bought for my mom. I like one song that I know of, hence 1 star. don't take this as a criticism.	-1
Very repetitive sound and lyrics, she has a good voice but then chooses to sing in ways that don't show off her voice. Some of her meanings are pretty positive and agreeable, but some of them move past self worth and into narcissism.	-1
she is a cute cookie cutter act.  all about that bass is catchy and she obviously understands a hook and a groove however the material which is somewhere between karoke  Britney Spears and Connie francis and  it feels middle of the familiar road. and the only  deluxe edition she should have out on her first album should be around a burger king. she ain't got that intresting of an album to have a deluxe edition. talk in a few albums and we shall see.	-1
This was a bit disappointing in that it was highly touted before and after its release.	-1
Maybe if Gwen Stefani tried producing a song herself, maybe she'd appreciate or at least understand why it looks bad when someone else steals your work. Especially when a major label artist steals a independent musicians song. Gwen Stefani isn't a musician, she writes lyrics and sings. If her life depended on it could she even work pro tools?	-1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
Kind of sound like R.E.M. wannabes, in a bar-band sort of way.	-1
I just can't stand the chorus, but I do like many other of her songs.	-1

What a stupid song. Who cares if this twit writes any ones name? I wish I had the money the record companies have given to have radio stations flood the airways with this rubbish twice every hour, that way I could pay them off to never play it again and stop having it shoved down everyones throat every 30 minutes if they have no choice of what radio station is being played where they work, or whatever situation people may be in where it's forced on you. What a terrible, TERRIBLE, horrible untalented annoying song it is.	-1
I think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement.  it apparently is palatable to the tards who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last 5 minutes and spend $1.29 for it on itunes. i balk at how the Rolling Stone interviewer when interviewing Liam Gallagher, told him many people considered TS to be such a great songwriter and he balked at his implying this...i would rather hear anything off of Oasis' albums before resorting to listening to Style. The song reeks of poopy...	-1
Don't do it boys!! It's a trap!! You're just gonna be the subject of her next boohoo heartbreak song!	-1
I did not like this song, even though I usually like ballads	-1
Yeah, it's ok..but just barely. As a band, they sound great. The production, musicianship, cohesion etc. is really top notch, a carry over effect from the far superior effort, "The Connection". Here Papa Roach is simply treading water. The lyrics are as empty and unforgivably bland. Jacoby Shaddix has absolutely nothing new or remotely interesting to say here. As soon as the songs end, it evaporates from memory. What a let down from the previous album.	-1
Ok so whenever I think of listening to Papa Roach I already know what to expect, dumbed down radio friendly rock.  Like it or not that's what they are and you can't deny that.  Still except for their dreadful 09 album which I don't remember the title of, I've typically managed to find a handful of songs on each album that I enjoy, some quite a lot.  I actually quite enjoyed their 2012 release, again don't remember the name of it.  But this garbage?  this whole album sounds like a modern Disciple album without the Jesus lyrics, and I'm not exaggerating.  From the moment I heard the first song I thought "Disciple called.  They want their music back".  But what can I expect froma  band who ripped themselves off on the awful 09 release, remaking "I devise my own demise" forget the name of the horrific carbon copy track but that was the original song's title.  There's no edge at all to the music.  It's so generic it'll make your ears bleed.  Like I said going into an album by this band you have to expect a certain level of this, but geez this is too much.  We get silly rapping, bad electronic bits and guest rappers ruining what could have been a mildly tolerable song.  And most of these 5 star reviews must be put out by the band  I mean seriously I can't imagine people honestly believing this is amongst the best albums of all time.  Where are the voices of reason?  The 2-4 star reviews.  Hell the 1 star review before mine was obviously a troll.  I at least like some of this band's past work.  I mean I can honestly believe people out there like this, but a perfect score at such a rate?  Not even close.  This is no Dark side of the moon.  No Led Zeppelin 4.  No White Album.  Hell it's not even Ten.  It's just a silly band trying to stay relevant by creating an album to appeal to teenagers.  If not for the awful work Billy Corgan has been doing since re-creating the Pumpkins I'd say this is the worst album I've heard in the past decade.  And I forgot to mention, oh the lyrical cliches.  All of them are here.  And the singer's voice on here for some reason really bugs me.	-1
Given that I lost interest in Manson after GAOG, I still gave his last few releases a fair shot...and I was not the least bit impressed.  Eat Me Drink Me was a disaster, The High End of Low was disappointing especially since Twiggy was involved again, Born Villain was more of the same if the last album....and now there is this album.  Still not impressed even after a few close listens.  His voice didn't improve with age. The music arrangements are average at best.  And....Where is Twiggy on this album?  Is he in the band anymore?  He is not credited on the album.  This is arguably the fourth album in a row from "Manson the man", rather than "Manson the band".	-1
the pale emperor is ok cd and only ok. Marilyn Manson have put out better works like antichrist superstar & the golden age of grotesque. fear factory genexus is a 5 start cd. Fear Factory works obsolete & digimortal. progressive Industrial Death Metal music. but if you are a marilyn manson fan I just was wanting better music, and I feel fear factory have realy step up & so have Slipknot the gray chapter.	-1
Everything about this album was bad, except for the singer's voice, which isn't great, but isn't bad. The songs are wimpy with mediocre to poor lyrics and melodies. Don't be fooled by the 30-second snippets on Amazon. This is not a good album. I listened a couple times and threw it in the trash.	-1
It seems Linux is no longer welcome on Amazon as I cannot download this album to my computer... and for an encore it just locked out the work around Download Helper... GRRRR	-1
REK has always been an alternative country artist & imo an acquired taste which I have never acquired. The real test for me has been how any artist or group sounds live. This AM REK appeared with his bluegrass group on Imus live doing two songs off the new CD. You know your in trouble when your backing band is better than you are, when you mumble the lyrics. Nuff said!	-1
i love REK and own just about every album he's ever made.  this crossover bluegrass album, however, doesn't succeed.  the music landscape is littered with the bodies of fine country and alt-country artists who have tried to cross over to bluegrass and failed (e.g. dierks bentley) or stumbled across the finish line (e.g. merle haggard), but very few (patty loveless) have actually succeeded.  bluegrass is a different animal and, for one thing, REK's quirky, tremulous voice isn't well-suited for it.  The other issue here is that REK just doesn't seem to be feeling the music and his performance is uninspired.  Ironically, some of the songs on this album aren't even bluegrass, they are folk, blues or something else, but not bluegrass.  His band is good enough - especially dennis ludiker of the progressive bluegrass band MilkDrive - but the apathy of REK seems to have infected his band.  Even guest vocalists such as Peter Rowan and Lyle Lovett can't rescue him here.  Those unfamiliar with bluegrass music and who, therefore, have no expectations, may well enjoy this album and (as previous reviews indicate), most seem to.  However, I believe those familiar with bluegrass will likely be disappointed.	-1
To be very truthfully honest, I think it is very sad whenever someone that young and talented is so overexposed, that they can really throw their talent away by making themselves and becoming all about them, and non one else. Beyonce' Knowles, has became more like she has been a product, not a talented diverse soul. The songs on her self-titled record have been so poor, that even the remixes make you want to place ear muffs over her voice. Her remix of Flawless with Nicki Minaj was in response to her sister and Jay-Z's elevator brawl and sadly, the feeling of the song has been more of a defense of her marriage. Sadly, the song already was poorly made, but it doesn't make it any better with age. In fact, it still is a terrible song for her. Worse than the sound Beyonce' had with Diva, or Get Me Bodied. The next time she puts out a remix, she should check her own talent out with it, than throw it away. That is why she became more flawed than flawless.  Song: D	-1
There is a real difference between being a singer and a celebrity, and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die, and you're severely overplayed. Beyonce' Knowles has became the most oversaturated product in the music industry and sadly the feeling of her songs has died, and not even worth listening to. Her remix of Flawless with Nicki MInaj is absolutely pathetic and awful. They have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. The song alone is awful for Beyonce', and just like what Jennifer Lopez did with Booty, remixing it with Iggy Azalea, she really made a song that was already poorly done, into a song that was even worse. It was actually done in regards to heartbreaks with her marriage with Jay-Z ending. But truthfully, it is time for Beyonce' Knowles to consider retiring from music if she keeps making bad songs like this one.  Song: D	-1
I'm not feeling all the GDs, so its not my favorite	-1
There are so few artists that seem to honestly that really stopped making songs that really came from the heart. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has really been more of a product than a strong songstress, and sadly the quality of her has withered slowly to death where she has been more tiring than exciting, and sadly that has shown in her songs. 7/11, the lead single from Beyonce' Knowles, Beyonce' (Platinum Edition,) is actually a wasted dance song that definitely has shown she has honestly lost all of her voice. The song definitely is a wasted dance song that shows that she has lost her spirit. The song is honestly one of her worst songs in years. The song is definitely worse than, and below the stamina of other dance songs that she had done before like Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It,) Get Me Bodied, and Crazy In Love. I think it is definitely time for Beyonce' Knowles to retire if she keeps making poor choices in her music, and throws her heart away.  Song: D	-1
Just the same words bunched together,  incoherently.	-1
There is honestly a difference between a songstress, and a singer who has really been overexposed to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore, because they are severely overplayed and overexposed. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers, who has came off more like a product than a real songstress of the heart. Sadly, the quality of her music has slowly passed away from the heart, and instead she has just relied on the severe over-demand of bigger has to be better, just like Michael Jackson did. Unfortunately, the quality of her work has caused her to lose her voice at the heart of the matter. Her songs like 7/11 from her Beyonce' Platinum Edition album have faltered badly. The song 7/11, definitely is one of her worst songs on the record, and shows that she has relied too much on being a dance diva to where her voice has suffered a setback in the soul. I found this song to be absolutely annoying, and shows the worst at her own work. Beyonce' honestly needs to grow up and find better than being a product. Her success at her own work, like her voice has died.  Song: F+	-1
DUMB, but good beat.	-1
No lyrics and the beat is whack. Come on... It's crap. I can't imagine listening to this songs 20 years from now. Not even 20 days from now. Really bad.	-1
It is honestly absolutely so sad whenever someone who is young and talented gets so overflowed, they become more like a product than a real singer and entertainer. Sadly, that honestly is the case with Beyonce' Knowles, and her music right now. She has became so overexposed, she feels more like she is a product than a real human being and talented singer. She has let her talent absolutely go to waste in her music right now. When she had came out with a surprise record last year, it might have became as a sales buying spree, but honestly the songs she has came out with for the Beyonce' record, feel more like they are absolute trash, than strong of a singer suppose to be of her calibre. 7/11 from the Platinum Edition of the Beyonce' album is absolutely terri blue, and not even worth the voice singing. She had made a song that is absolutely so poor, it is really her worst dance song. Even Get Me Bodied and Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It) seems more like blessings than garbage after hearing this song. She is absolutely not worth listening to anymore, and if she keeps making bad songs like this, I would say it should be time for Ms. Knowles to retire from being  real singer, and end her career. Because she is unlucky in her own voice and songs to make it enjoyable.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more of a product than a real singer. Sadly, the quality of her being a singer has died, and the heart of her trying to hard to follow in her husbands' shadow, has really ruined her quality in her songs. When she came out with a surprise album last year, that may have been appealing to her fans, but honestly the heart of her songs has really been much poorer at heart. Her latest single, 7/11 from the Platinum edition of her Beyonce' is actually a very poorly-driven song. She really has lost her street-credit as a female rapper. The song doesn't ignite with people the way Taylor Swift's Shake It Off did this year. I think it sincerely is time for Beyonce' Knowles to retire. Because if she keeps making bad songs, people will stop listening to her. That isn't just the roll of the dice at the craps table.  Song: D-	-1
Barely hear the song, had to max the volume	-1
J. Cole always sounds bored when he's rapping. Why am I supposed to be interested if not even he can work up any enthusiasm for his music? This is a little better then his first two records, but it's still boring and the audio version of NyQuil. Still don't get this guys appeal.	-1
This young lady appears to specialize in old-style rock sung loudly, and will apparently be hoarse most of her professional life - if she sticks with this style of music. The drummer and guitar guy are ever-present and almost vie for top billing with the singer. However, my exposure to her is limited and others will surely have a more reliable view of her music.	-1
Labyrinth has a mesmorizing.	-1
Gotta say omarion isn't underated folks album is subpar and honestly Joe's bridges is miles better than this lp and yeah theres better baby making muzak than this. It's amazing how many people believe this album is spectacular sorry but this is a dud	-1
Great cause but nit really listenable	-1
It's okay, but I don't think it deserves 3 stars. I like the original version better.	-1
makes me wanna start moonwalking around the Christmas tree! ridiculously horrible, played out yuletide turd!	-1
I like the music but the sound quality is poor.	-1
I did not know when I purchased it that it had the offensive language contained in it.  I will do more research on my next music purchase.	-1
i just bought it for uptown	-1
Terrible language on some songs.  Only one good song on the whole CD.  Returned for refund because of language.	-1
Only one song worth it ......the rest is profanity all over	-1
Very disappointed!	-1
1 great song, one ok song. Now 53 had the great song. waste of money	-1
I kind of mind, when I think of my sister, daughter or mother. WTF are we teaching kids these days. I don't care for usher like I once did. He's wasting his talent or maybe run out of good ideas?	-1
I love Bob Dylan. His music has been part of my life for over half a century and, like many people, I feel as though a lot of his songs are woven into my very bones. He is one of the very greatest of all singer/songwriters, he has profoundly influenced the music and the consciousness of generations with his work and he has obviously earned the right to record anything he pleases. Most professional critics think this is very good. And even taking all that into account, I think this is a terrible album.  Bob's singing voice, bless him, has always been awful by any ordinary standards, but the way he used it and the superb songs he wrote to sing with it made it great in the context, and absolutely magnificent sometimes. I can still remember the sheer visceral thrill I felt the first time I heard Ballad Of A Thin Man, for example, and it's happened plenty of other times, but it's not a voice cut out for these crooner's standards - it really isn't. Tempest showed that Bob has still got it both as a writer and performer, but here he sounds feeble, tremulous, cracked and downright out-of-tune some of the time and that just won't do with this material. To me, this is painful and embarrassing. Even songs I like a lot, like Autumn Leaves, make me cringe inwardly here.  I say all this with real sadness about one of my greatest musical heroes, but it is my honest reaction. I have forced myself to listen to this several times in case it grew on me, but it really, really didn't. Aside from Bob's singing, much of the material is uninspiring, and the arrangements are decent but so samey that they sound dull after a couple of tracks. I have given this two stars because I simply cannot bring myself to give a Bob Dylan album just one star, but I suspect I'm being over-generous.  And now I'm off to play Tempest, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde On Blonde, Blood On The Tracks, Bringin' It All Back Home and probably several more to remind myself of the sheer genius of the man and to try to expunge this hideous mistake from my mind. May Bob forgive me, but this is bad.	-1
I hope he never does this again. Crooner tunes are not his forte. But then, he doesn't have to worry what we think. he has made his mark with his wonderful poetry and music in his previous albums.	-1
Think I'll go listen to my Sinatra albums. Seriously there are enough 1 and 2 stars to get a true idea. The 4 and 5 star reviews are kidding only themselves. 1st Dylan lp I truly regret buying	-1
Buyer Beware! If you are a Bob Dylan fan this CD may not be for you. None of the songs are written by Bob. You will not recognize his voice either. This CD contains songs from the 30's and 40's sung by Frank Sinatra. If I wanted to hear songs sung by Frank I would buy a Cd by Frank. This CD is for people in their 80's and 90' since I am only 72 this CD is not me. It will probably win a Grammy but I sure don't know what category is will be in maybe ""Old Geezer" I just don't understand.	-1
I'm a Dylan fan.  I have dozens upon dozens of his CDs, a couple box sets, multiple compilations, the mono collection, and 9 volumes of the bootleg series.  But this ...  THIS is just killing me.  This CD should come with a free 5-hour energy.  He was never a singer.  Why?	-1
Having played it through its the first Bob Dylan since Under the Red Sky I am going to have to take a while to get into. Its a very 'chilled' album. His voice is at times not suited to the style of music. It's not a bad album but reminds me somewhat of the recent Neil Young album but with weaker vocals. The overuse of the same instrumentation also does not help, the songs are as they are classics with Bobs interpretation with the same music backing and similar vocal style. All in all I prefer him playing the blues influenced music he has done brilliantly over the past 50 or so years. 2 & 1/2 Stars	-1
I only listened to the samples for this album but I can tell you right now it's crap. I saw Dylan a couple months ago in Denver and he was actually quite good - except when he played one of the songs off this album at the end. The place was astonishingly quiet. I knew then - when he announced that he was putting this album out - that it was a bad idea. The actual release of the album hasn't changed my opinion. I love Bob but this is garbage. Look at all the 1-star reviews - that should tell you something.  If you want to enjoy "Autumn Leaves" then listen to the instrumental version done by Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderley back in the '50s. It's brilliant. Dylan's version reminds me of being at some weird funeral.	-1
Sorry Bob, I think it's time to call it a day as far as making albums like this is concerned. TO MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS IS SAD. Maybe  it could be played at nostalgic funerals. I think it's time to tour the club circuit or old peoples homes. This is an insult to the albums you have released in the past and I feel that you have done this to be self serving. At your age you must have some brilliant songs still hidden inside, to move future generations. Take a leaf out of Leonard Cohen's book and start writing songs of substance again! Or is it, that you just couldn't be bothered?	-1
How arrogant of Dylan to even have considered this project.  I think Sinatra might have told him, "If you even DREAM of singing my songs, you better apologize when you wake up."  This album is akin to an artist taking a crap on a blank canvas and his followers marvel over its 'texture'.  Hey!!!  The emperor has NO CLOTHES!!  Wake up, you fools!!  This album is as if Richard Simmons did a video called "The Mike Tyson Workout".  It is so egotistical of Dylan to, given his LOUSY singing voice, tackle songs done by Frank Sinatra.  But, line up and buy this pathetic album all of you Bobby Zimmerman worshipers.  As Arlo Guthries said many years ago, "If you want to see Bob Dylan in concert, you've got to come see me." Oh, I did like his older music and saw him with The Band (they opened for him) in 1974.  I liked his acoustic songs and was falling asleep during the electric portion of his set.  IMO, Bob Dylan has become a parody of himself.  Can't wait for his next Victoria Secret's ad. If heaven and hell exist, this could be Bobby Z's ticket to the latter.  Oh, the songs, as sung by Dylan, suck.  Nuff said.	-1
A bowl of soup with no flavor no taste no nothing. Nothing on here worth mentioning.	-1
This is pretty embarrassing.	-1
When it has came down to Nicki Minaj in her music and her rapping, she really hasn't brought out her strength in her songs. What is shown from the tracks from The Pinkprint, she just hadn't found the strength in her notes, and her collaborations with other. Only with Chris Brown and others just feel flat, and her collaboration with Beyonce' Knowles on Feeling Myself, absolutely is a flop for both of them. I feel that Ms. Knowles absolutely didn't even come close to delivering her strongest A-game, considering of her collaborations with her husband Jay-Z like Drunk In Love delivered to her fans, but overall didn't ignite at strength. Nicki really didn't show it. Like the other songs on her album such as Pills N' Potions, it sincerely is a absolute waste of time. Perhaps, she need to find better in her own rapping, and Beyonce' should take notice for her next collaborations with her husband. Hopefully, they can deliver better than this song did.  Song: D	-1
It is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and talented, really has thrown their own career away. For Nicki Minaj, she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real drive as a rapper. The list of songs she has put out for her Pink Print album has definitely wasted her own talent away, than a real sense of what real talent is suppose to be. Her collaborations with others on the album have really dragged her talent down, Only for example with Chris Brown and Drake among others, just really was one of her worst songs in her own career. Feeling Myself is another example. Her collaboration with Beyonce' doesn't actually ignite any heart by bringing in the so-called queen bee into the mix. I really found the song to be less than striking at all. Nicki and Beyonce' have absolutely no chemistry together. I think Nicki really has made some very poor songs from her Pink Print album, and this is honestly one of her weakest.  Song: D	-1
When the song begins you feel like great things are on the way.  When it gets going the beat is not as strong as it could be - it feels a little cheap, but Nicki does alright. Not as good as say her verse on "Monster" but eh, not her worst either.  Perhaps the highlight of the song is Mrs. Carter, Beyonce. She kills her parts. Not her strongest performance but even on a poor day she delivers pretty well. The only issue is at points the Beyonce and Nicki part feel really disjointed. Maybe a future collab will go better?	-1
When it has came down to Nicki MInaj and her worth in her music, its has been looked at being cheap, than strong in her own voice. Whatever it took to compile the music fr her album The Pink Print this past year, it honestly is not even worth the time or the money. Her collaborations have sincerely been less than strong for what she could come up with her own heart, and Only from The Pink Print is definitely no exception. The collaboration with Chris Brown, Lil' Wayne, and Drake does not even come close to igniting from the heart at all. Instead, it is weak for her, with what they do bring to the game. The song is haunting but lagging the essence in song. I think if Nicki really wants to have better for own work, she should do more with her collaborations to make it completely worth her weight in the diamond. Only really was a cheap song, and I sincerely do not recommend it.  Song: F+	-1
When it has came down to music collaborations these days, they sincerely and absolutely do not even come from the heart. In fact, the songs feel more wasted than drive from the soul. Nicki MInaj actually has been the worst with collaborations, and trying to prove her staying power in voice. So far, the music she had came out with for her third album The Pink Print has actually been a real waste of time from the ears and absolutely from the heart. Her collaboration with Chris Brown on Only among others feels jaded, and sincerely a waste of time. Her voice has lost its real heart, and Chris shows he has lost a lot of his own as well, with all the talent he had in the world. The song is absolutely one of the worst she has came out with, and definitely not a must own even for a Nicki Minaj fan. I think she should take more time into her voice and find something better, if only.  Song: F+	-1
Can someone explain to me why this crap gets played every day on the hour on radio stations? Especially rock stations that shouldn't be playing this anyway, it's not rock. Just another example of record companies paying stations to flog their music. It should be banned. What an irritating song.	-1
a let down cd. I try so hard to get into all that remains when the metal radio station was playing this probably won't end well. but when I got the cd all songs were no where close to the first track. save your money. buy slipknot new cd.	-1
I really did not want to check this album out, but I did anyway to see if this band would be a little better after the atrocity that was "A War You Cannot Win", and would show musical evolution. Unfortunately, this album is yet another clunker in the ATR cabinet, but unlike their past efforts, there are at least a few small baby steps taken forward into the right direction. However, judging by the fact that frontman Phil Labonte is a complete backwards moron as evidenced last month when he stated his ridiculous views on the LGBT, this album is still pretty much musical surstromming.  The tracks on this band where the band at least attempts to make for better change are "Divide" and even "A Reason For Me To Fight", and that's really about it. The rest of the album is not much different from their other albums. You have tracks on here such as "No Knock", "Victory Lap", and "Pernicious", which sound like songs that are carbon-copied from past albums, albeit with a much more technical side which doesn't mean jack. And of course on a majority of these, the frontman really does a good job at showcasing his horrendous high screaming vocals. Now, these screams are not as infuriating as they were on their last album, but it still is irritating and monotonous when they can be. But, it's not just his vocals this time around, it's really the fact that he's singing these songs in general. A good example of this is "Tru-KVLT-Metal", which is supposed to be a song attacking metal purists and elitists which is a good message indeed, because some of these people are absolutely stupid. But, it's ruined by the fact that this is the band performing it. A band who has claimed that they are "transcending metal", when really, they're not all that impressive.  I guess one positive I can say about this is that the backing band did step up their talent. The drumming is a lot faster on this album, and Mike and Oli show that they have some talent when it comes to shredding. However, everyone involved with this album is roped to mediocrity, which really makes it worthless. You can make an album that is very technical, and is "hard to play" on drums, and it can still be a heavily misguided and off-putting record, and this album is no exception to that rule.  "The Order Of Things" is once again the latest goose egg in the All That Remains catalogue, and is one that I can only recommend to die-hard fans of ATR who will go out and buy anything that the band has ever put out. Like I said, they did at least try to not make this album a bad one, and for all intents and purposes this is not as bad as their past albums, but it still doesn't escape past one star in my opinion. If you want an ATR album that is actually good, then listen to "Behind Silence And Solitude", which is actually a solid disc. Otherwise, let this album collect dust.  Rating: 15/100	-1
Sorry but ne-yo track 16 sums it by the lyric saying everybody loved his older albums which is true and I got say non-fiction is mediocre has some gems and I bought the target exclusive with 21 tracks but I've heard better material dude's sold out	-1
I only like  2 songs on entire cd very disappointed	-1
he  got over at a  good time as a  Modern day  Broke  Babyface meets a modern day  Broke Michael Jackson and it worked for a few projects and he made more of a name for himself as a songwriter for others, however his basic formula as a artist on his own has been  stuck in being average and putting the same ole thing out.  despite more risque on the lyrical tip, nothing is a upgrade in the songwriting or his artistic growth department.	-1

No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!! IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought*** I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube. Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it. ***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.	-1
Terrible song! I just needed the clean version for Djing. This is the reason Hip Hop is dead amongst most Black artists!	-1
I'd rather view a 10-hour loop of that wonderful Phantom Menace moment in which Jar Jar goes out of his way to deeply inhale an Eopie fart with headphones at full volume than listen to this album again. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.	-1
i saw this band on the ellen show and was really excited about getting the cd.  it was terrible.  the only good song was the one they sang on the show.  signed, disappointed.	-1
Album seems like it was put together in a hurry.  Nowhere near as good as their first album, which is to be expected.  But this is an enormous step back.  Has a lot of yelling, loud lyrics, lacking enjoyable sing alongs.	-1
Not my favorite kid Rock cd. Worthy of  a list to though. Album NOT fun as last slbums.	-1
EH	-1
This moronic cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growth of this man cannot even be charted. He is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.	-1
Like always, I couldn't wait to hear this album, and like the last 3 albums, it's been a huge disappointment. With that said tho, even the last couple of albums had a couple of songs at least I liked, but this album, I didn't take a liking to the title track when it was first played on the Letterman show back in November 2014, and its certainly the strongest track on this album. Yet still not something I personally want to listen to again.  The problem with this album is every song really does sound the same, with the same story, only the tempo changes. I admit, I'm not much of a country music fan, however a lot of what Kid has done in the past I have taken a liking to, but this album here, I just can't get into it. I may not have been a fan of the early Kid's rap/hip hop days, but I was an instant fan when he went hard driving metal with in your face rap lyrics, and Kid's ventures into other genres made me like a few songs in genres i'd never really enjoyed before, but none of the stuff on this albums resembles any of that previous material. Probably the only song I almost liked on this was FOAD, but it just doesn't have a beat or the attitude I like.  I'm still a Kid Rock fan tho, but I can see that Kid had previously had a lot of success mixing up what genre he can be classified as, but at least he had a bunch of genres on previous albums, but this idea to start making records instead of songs hasn't impressed me at all. Born Free just did not cut it for me, and the last album seemed like Kid was really starting to get it together again and I was hoping this album was going to be one of his best in years, but I can't see any of the songs on this album becoming greatest hits. Well, I know a few people really like the title track, and yes, it is probably the strongest track on this album, but to me personally, it's a 2 star song, not Kid at his finest, and then every song after seemed to just be the same story repeated again and again with generic music playing to it. No great riffs, stand out lyrics, big stand out chorus, memorable moments or something that just raises the adrenaline, not anything touching or sweet etc...etc...  If you're a country fan, you may appreciate this album, and be fairer towards it than I am. But if you're like me and you're more into the hard rock/metal stuff, then I don't think you will enjoy this album very much at all. Be your own judge tho, as this is just my own personal opinion and this album not doing anything for me, as its not the genre I like, and didn't feel anything stands out as great at all, even for it's genre. I can't imagine anyone would disagree that had "Picture" come out now on this album, that song would have cast a huge shadow over the rest of this album and made everything else here feel like cheap filler. So if nothing can be compared to Kid's biggest country hit in the past, how can the songs on here be rated 5 out of 5 stars, on all tracks, giving this album a 5 star rating? Too many generous ratings from people who don't really put much thinking into what they rate these things other than "I like it, therefor it deserves 5 stars"... really? 5 stars, as in the same 5 star ratings given by the majority to say AC/DC's "Back In Black" and all the other greatest albums of all time? So the people here giving it 5 stars are saying First Kiss is not only the best album Kid Rock has ever done, but it's also one of the best albums ever? Sorry, I give ratings that are deserved, not just the highest rating for a lazy vote and a comment saying, "loved a few songs, didn't like this and that, but I rate it 5 stars anyway"	-1
I got this as a gift for big fan of Pink Floyd, but they were sorely disappointed in this CD from Roger Waters.	-1
Roger hits a new low here!  I guess I seen this one coming after hearing about his 4th divorce, recent negative interviews, political bashing, anti Jew/Isreal stuff, and even negative comments about David Gilmour, angry rants, and bashing Trump and others at the recent live shows.  This guy is one angry grumpy old man.  But I could have forgiven all that for a great new album after all it's only the music I really care about in the end. But tons of political stuff, F bombs, bad language, and some pretty good songs toward the beginning of the album ruined by profanity.  Deja Vu is the only song I like because at least he made that song without saying the F word 7-8 times throughout.  But it's also ironic that he talks about what he would have done had he been God (yet he's a professed atheist).  Toward the end of the album when he finally stops cursing, every song runs together (slow, generic boring numbers).  Wait For Her, Oceans Apart, and Part Of Me Died sound like the same song and stuff that could have easily been put on the weakest Floyd record The Final Cut.  After the brilliant Amused To Death 25 years ago this is what we get.  Oh well, we will always have the classic Floyd albums he helped make and a couple MUCH better solo albums!	-1
Instructions for listening to this album.  Combine: 1/4th The Final Cut 1/4th Amused To Death 1/4th of a subpar Radiohead tribute band for session musicians One washed up old man who has not written provocative lyrics since The Wall (1978-1979)  Stir them together  Mix vigorously with a healthy heaping of oppression fetish  Throw the album in the trash bin.   - -  I have a hard time listening to the same, downtrodden, egocentric, (previous) lyrical genius gripe about the world's ills while writing lyrics from his multi-million dollar home in Manhattan. Even more so after knowing he cleared over a half-billion in revenue from his recent tours. Even an ungodly amount of money, twenty-five years of self-loathing and reflection, and an amazing producer (Godrich) couldn't buy Waters a way out of his self-imposed pity. What's worse is the cheap attempts at "sounding more like old Pink Floyd" by simply restructuring highlights from the album Animals about a half dozen times.  I wish Waters would put his money where his mouth is. A) it might actually help the world rather than whining about it, and, B) It would finally shut him up.	-1
What a waste of hard drive space !  Music Stinks !  Save your money ? You know iv been looking forward to this CD all year and all most brought concert tickets for a Roger tour concert 3.5hr. one way from my house. This Mo. but this CD made up my mine about that !  You know am 63 yrs. old and I have always loved the Floyd. iv seen Brit Floyd the last 3 yrs . and have loved every min. of there tribute shows. But I have always been a real Floyd fan but Roger should of stayed in retirement . The overall sound quality is bad muffled and tasteless. + the format stink's..I really didn't think anyone could make such a waste. Of recorded space ...!	-1

another one of my download problem never got this song! Sick of calling! sound bad but the problem never gets better for they want you to get Prime. I never had a problem until they started to change after Cloud which I like.	-1
I heard one song by these people on my ODEZSA station and thought oh yeah sure. Not worth it.	-1
Really like it.	-1
didnt get same reason as the other one.	-1
What a disappointment. I'm sorry that her marriage broke up but that doesn't automatically make for good music. The hype on this one was deafening, and the music does not live up to the hype. Sonically it's amazing, and Bjork's voice is stunning as always, but the songs, are, sad to say, boring. No melody, nothing memorable to take away from it, I've listened to it 5x and nothing stuck with me. Don't believe the hype!	-1
never no what to expect with bjork  ,this is not very listenable for myself, but still give her credit she's stood the test of time	-1
A boring album.  Bjork has run out of ideas.  Her last few albums have been her screaming with some "artsy" noises as music.  She needs to collaborate with other artists to make a good pop album.	-1
There is so much that could honestly be said about Nicki MInaj, and the lack of really strong songs that could be said into what made her talented. Sadly, the lack of strong songs that led into what made The Pink Print, shows just how washed up she has been, and making so much about her voice, and it is not there. Truffle Butter from Nicki's album The Pink Print, is another one of those songs that lacks her own chops, and instead just puts the rapping into Drake's own hands. Sadly, she doesn't deliver as what she should have. It truthfully, is a song that lacks her talent all the way from start to finish. The song lags absolute heart, and Nicki MInaj herself just drags her own voice. I think it is going to be time for Nicki Minaj to consider retiring from making rap music, because she just isn't even close to being a rappers' delight, and instead the truffle better she has put out, has left a sour taste in the mouth.  Song: F+	-1
it's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they resort to recording pornography that makes the 2 Live Crew sound like a Disney soundtrack. Truffle butter is when you pull you dong out of the butth0le an continue doing the nasty in her kitty cat, and the tan buttery substance around her kitty is known as truffle butter. plus this is another example of no talent, corporate cash in muzik. look how many people it took to write this worthless song (Writer(s): Aubrey Drake Graham, Maya Jane Coles, Nicki Minaj, Aubrey Graham, Onika Tanya Maraj, Dwayne Carter, Paul Jefferies) Six songwriters to write 1 mediocre piece of crud porn??? really??	-1
When it has came down to Nicki MInaj, she honestly has been more like a joke with her music, than taking her music t the next level. The songs that she had compiled for her album, The Pink Print have simply been more less of her persona, more of other rappers and entertainers, and sadly it has absolutely been a complete waste of time overall. Her latest collaboration which isn't enough of her, but mostly all of Drake isn't worth it. Truffle Butter isn't exactly one of her better songs. It overall shows Nicki has lost her voice and instead made a so-called A-List rapper into an absolute joke. I think the song is absolutely not only worth its money, but shows she honestly has run out of good songs to mix her own voice. Truffle Butter is absolutely not only a waste of time, but a song worth passing up. For someone who did Starships as a hit, she now has to find herself again.  Song: F  4,700th Review!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
PAUL MCCARTNEY THINKING THE WORLD FORGOT ABOUT HIS SATANIC AZZ DECIDED TO DO A SONG WITH KANMYE AND RIHANNA BECVAUSE THE KIDS LOVE THEM, WELL IF YOU LIKE GAY HOP YOU'LL LOVE THIS.	-1
"FourFiveSeconds" is another example of the music buying public getting enamored of a song because it is different.  Just because something is different doesn't mean it is good.  In this case, the mixture of Rihanna and Kanye doing a soft acoustic soft along with Paul McCartney providing the guitar work, has people falling all over themselves about this.  Some who are love the song aren't used to Kanye and Rihanna doing this style of music (and have no idea who Paul McCartney is), which intrigues them.  Others are fans of McCartney and love that he is working with contemporary pop stars.    However, once you get past the initial trappings of the song, it should be easy to recognize that it's not a very good song.  Sure, Paul McCartney is playing guitar on the track, but it is basic high school music classic quality.  Vocally, neither Rihanna nor Kanye are made for this type of soft pop style.  In Rihanna's case, her lyrics just come across as whiny.    I won't give it a one-star rating, because it's not truly awful (Iggy Azalea is reserved for my one-star reviews).  It just isn't that impressive.	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no. Kanye showed it badly on Only One, now with FourFive Seconds, the two of them do not ignite in the heart, instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice, and in chemistry with Sir Paul. Overall, I wasn't even impressed with the song, and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in songs before. If you are a die hard Paul McCartney fan, I would sincerely pass this one up, because four and five seconds, feels more like wasted time overall.  Song: F	-1
I'm not sure what I expected, but the combination of these three sounded like it could make for an interesting track. It's just WEIRD imho.	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them. They have absolutely no chemistry with Sir Paul's classic rhythm and classic songwriting. For Rihanna, it is one of the worst songs she has came out with, and she needs to really find her voice all over again, and for Kanye, it is the most rogue thing he has simply done, and lost his own voice at the same time. For Rihanna fans, she needs much stronger for her next work, and she wasted her own time with low gimmicks.  Song: D	-1
I'm not sure what I expected, but the combination of these three sounded like it could make for an interesting track.  It's just WEIRD imho.	-1

To repetative with bells and not much other substance. Does not mesh well with the other instruments. Needs a lot of work.	-1
I have wanted for this to come out and I was let down.  to long to many songs it was a let down	-1
There is no question that when it has came down to music, Nicki Minaj has honestly been one of the worst acts to have came out with music the past several years. Musically, her last song Stupid H** was so atrocious, it felt like she had gotten her voice chopped off and voice box got seriously injured by a blood clot. Her latest song, Starships is the exact same thing. It really is a terrible song. She really is more like a in-your-face self-centered weezie. Just like Isabel Sanford from The Jeffersons was proclaimed by Sherman Hemsley. I think if Nicki wants to make better music, she should stop and get a better tune with her lyrics before the next time she makes a new album.  Song: D-	-1

Excluding the Gary Cherone misstep,  I equally love both incarnations of VH.  But, this is horrible. The VH3 sound in good form, but DLR really ruins it with his God-awful pathetic singing.  He owes everyone who's already bought this a refund.  I played it once, and then tried a second time, only because I couldn't believe it was so bad the first time.  It was on and off the iPod in less than 24 hours. Now sitting on the shelf collecting dust.	-1
boy did i get took this is not alabama	-1
Eddie and Alex are great.  Background vocals suck.  Dave needs to learn how to sing again and not yell and talk the lyrics.  Oh and maybe sing the melody once in a while.	-1
Yikes!!!  I mean... YIKES!!!  What the?  Are they kidding?  Is this some kind of weird joke? I couldn't wait to place my order for this long awaited live VH album, and I couldn't have been more excited the day it arrived. I carefully unwrapped it and studied the cool packaging (no band pics though - very odd) and let it rip. OH MY GOD. What were they thinking?  This is so freaking bad I think it just turned me off music - period. The drums are sloppy, the guitars are surprisingly sloppy too, the keys are lagging behind the band, the bass is solid though, but please, please, please don't even ask about the vocals. This is not the band I know and love. Regretfully, I absolutely HATE this release.	-1
I heard my friend's copy of this new cd and it was exactly what I expected......I saw the "reformed" Van Halen in late 2012 and this is an accurate document of what I heard on that disappointing night. In 30 years of going to rock concerts, it was the first and only time I had ever time I walked out of ANY rock concert. ....and now the awfulness of that night has been captured for posterity. David Lee was great at one time...now he's plain awful.  Sammy Hagar must be laughing hard right now. Deserves 0 stars, but that choice not given here...	-1
Wow...I'm really disappointed in this.  I guess I'm just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this, but the band sounds muddled and uninspired.  I get the impression they are going through the motions (which they are) and could really care less anymore what they put out.  Roth sounds soooooo bad, It's really embarrassing.  And I'm still not excited about the set list.  It's not that its a bad set list, but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore 4 albums worth of material as if it never happened AND virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting.  So disappointing.  Back in the day, VH would play 80-90% of a new album.  They were proud of what they did and dying to show it off.  There are songs on ADKOT that are just begging to be played live, but I'm guessing we'll never hear 'em.  Shame to put this out and not have cuts like Big River, You and Your Blues or Beats Workn' on here (as terribly retreaded and unoriginal as ADKOT was, I still enjoyed the release quiet a bit.  I play it often and it has some great songs to workout to.  To bad most of them will never see the light of day light.  What a shame.  I'll pass.  I own about every VH CD that's been released (had III, but got rid of it).  But I'll pass on this one.  I'll still listen to the studio cuts (heck, Daves last solo was pretty good), but I'll pass on the "Live Money Grab" thank you very much.	-1
Not from lack of trying, and to be honest, I thought this would be a record I would dig from what I've read.  I love bands that experiment, I love electronics, atmospherics like on records produced in New Orleans by Daniel Lanois, and I did hear a brief clip of a song when the album was advertised in a video shown at Target, which sounded pretty cool.  But let me backtrack a little bit.  I absolutely HATED the first album "Boys & Girls"...too bluesy and not enough melody and no catchy hooks whatsoever.  I love soul singers, espesh those who rock, like Janis Joplin, Chris Cornell, etc, but they incorporate a melodic sweetness to counteract the raunchy rawness.  AS singer Brittany Howard is a shouter yes, but has no sweetness, it's all full throttle howl, no dynamics. VERY uncomfortable for me to listen to. I hate her tone completely, and last but not least, she is one UGLY woman...I can't even look at photos without gagging!!  From what I heard in the video, I thought, hmmm, have they improved??  I like the stylistic change, I took the disc out of the library, and I like the cover and the fact that the vinyl is clear...but I put it on, it started out promising, INSTRUMENTALLY, but once Brittany started, um, "singing"??, uh oh...that ugly tone barrelling forth, ruining my brain, I couldn't get past track #2 without risking brain damage...totally unbearable.  Then I open up the booklet, and I see the photos...the rest of the band look like OK guys, kinda cool, but Brittany??  Like Medusa!!  Yikes!!  Sorry fans...and there are thousands...I can't understand what you see in this band or Brittnay as a singer...why my taste doe not agree in the slightest is a mystery, but for me, they are clearly America's WORST band by far!!  Worst album of the year, up with the Vaccine's godawful "English Graffiti"...  Bring on the hate mail, I don't care...just being honest...	-1
got a  chance to  hear this  album and while  Brittany Howard  got a  nice touch on the axe and her  vocals  have moments, this album is just rather run of the mill to me.it has a  steady  groove going which is a slight noticeable different then their first album, however this album gets fairly predictable in a hurry.  there is a  throwback feel involved and yet it never quite gets thrown forward either.	-1
Using a deceased soul legend's name for your teeny bopper song is distasteful at best. I highly doubt Gaye's estate agreed to this...I mean if they took issue with Thicke and Pharrell's (rather liberal) sample of his song/melodies on Blurred Lines, I'm pretty sure they would not be ok with these two nobodies exploiting Gaye's name for commercial gain.	-1
The first time I heard this I could not believe it was incubus. I thought it was a joke!  It doesnt sound like them at all.  The lyrics are horrible and they sound as if they were trying way to hard to write "cool" lyrics... I love incubus since their first release but this is seriously the worst song I've heard in a long long time.	-1
not what I expected, just not my style	-1
I don't really like Courtney Love but it's an okay song	-1
I love the BTC and have all of their CD's.  This release lacks the same spiritual fervor as their other releases. There are a couple of songs that I feel are on a par with their previous material but I was not as inspired by this release as I have been in the past.  The choir's ability to sing as a unit remains intact but I just did not feel the same passion in this CD as I have in others they have released.	-1
Not the product I thought I bought. Shame the distribution company puts out Deluxe editions. To me, it's tricky, tricky, tricky. But, then again, reading is fundamental.	-1
they missed the boat by not having the better songs on the disc.  the better cuts are all on the mp3 nd having said that the  songs work better for the show as to their own to me.  the show is good, the soundtrack is hit and alot of miss and missing tracks here. however on the show things compliment better to me.	-1
so so	-1
One would expect this collection to be pure enjoyment since it has MORRISON teaming up with some great artists and songs.  It's not.	-1
Too much rap	-1
Being a fan of Drake when he first initially started in the music industry and seeing his progression as an artist has left me wondering if he really has anything left to offer both musically and artistically. I've caught a lot of buzz about this album through social media saying this album is great, but man this was just sad. Thank Me Later and Take Care were good albums, and Nothing Was the Same was decent, but this is just pure lazy music for Drake. For those who don't know, this album is labeled as a "mixtape" and should have been treated as such. A mixtape should not be sold for retail, it should be distributed as a free project to the masses which makes me want to ask Drake, "why not just call this an album?" If someone could give me a good example of an artist selling their mixtape online, please leave a comment below, because this is just ridiculous on Drake's part.  As an album running 17 songs (19 on the physical release) it is seriously a waste of time in my opinion. The beats are very generic, the lyrics are just about money, girls and fame... and the album cover just demonstrates the kind of effort Drake put into this project; ZERO. As a consumer of music, I believe that Drake is just exploiting his fan base at this point, and I can't believe the positive responses this project has been receiving lately. If you enjoyed this album, then that's your M.O., but as for me I am done with Drake at this point.	-1
do we really need some more of this corporate poseur rap? i mean really, i can't even tell if drake is black, white, or jewish (what is he?) i have heard him on a couple of songs that are ok for what they are...but i cannot understand why this guy is so popular. his music is just stereotypical rap and he has another r& b side that kinda sounds like inxs meets pm dawn. for the most part though it's more of this macho posturing bs about how many ho's he's bagged. zero starz for lack of creativity...	-1
IS HE SERIOUS!? He is trying to be someone different and do a different style but this shat sucks major. I am disappointed, thank heavens I bootlegged it!  Drake is better than this, he downgraded with this album as if he just didn't try hard enough. Seriously only 4 snogs are good and those are the ones where he is talking about women. I hope this is a joke album and the new one is coming in September, I'll just wait on it.	-1
Um... ok I'm [not] sorry, but this album is NOT that great. What are y'all listening to?? I wanna listen to that album! Like damn  No but seriously...I love Drake, and I love rap, but this album is painfully boring. Not even the track "Used To" with Wayne is good "6 Man" might be one of the worst hip-hop tracks I've ever heard "6PM in New York" is WACK and I don't think it flows at all And is Drake even ON "Wednesday Night Interlude"...?  There are a FEW songs (as in 3 or 4, tops) on the album that are OK, such as "Energy" and "Know Yourself"...  But overall, NWTS is 1,000 times better.	-1
FNM was a very different band to start with but they had something that drew people to them from many different music styles for better or worse but i think this is there worst  cd yet! this do 0 for me i couldn't listen to more than a few songs at a time and that was more pain full than a tooth extraction! avoid this like the plague or aids! You don't want this!!	-1
The title may say "Faith No More", but this isn't FNM. This is CRAP. It's another bizarre Mike Patton trainwreck, right in line with his 47 side projects. I don't even know what you would classify this album as. It's not Rock. Faith No More was a rock band. This is just extremely bizarre noises, chord progressions that don't even make sense musically, odd vocal notes, and strange lyrics. What an absolute disaster this was, after a VERY long wait. I'm a die hard FNM fan. That's why I can safely say this rubbish isn't Faith No More. It's another Mike Patton side project.	-1
No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!! IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought*** I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube. Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it. ***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.	-1
Typical Bieber, teamed up with Skrillex. Totally tweeine stuff. Nothing I would play at a wedding reception.	-1
Weird horns, a bunch of pots and pans banging around, and some type of drip-drop noise with a random voice over it all...that's the best way I can describe the songs on this album. Not a fan. The only decent songs are Take U There, Where Are U Now, and To U - but even those 3 songs can be irritating.	-1
annoying	-1
Bought wrong song	-1
Snoop and Pharrael give a decent melodic mix however snoop needs to hang it up I didn't really enjoy this funk based album	-1
I went into listening to this cd thinking I would hear Snoop Dogg and instead I heard a male Miley Cyrus. This cd was terrible!! If you are expecting Doggy Style or The Masterpiece or The Blue Carpet Treatment, you will be disappointed. This cd is full of pop songs, all about nothing. There are no songs about weed, 64s, gangsta sh&t, hood issues, etc. The edgiest song deals with a grrrl's big b00ty and he doesn't even use the word @$$ to describe it. This was a huge let down. Clearly it is the worst offering by Snoop he has ever put out. Avoid this cd at all costs!	-1
I can't tell if this is an album of 10 different, or unique songs OR ONE LONG TRACK, and a crappy one at that..wasted $$ more crap from Pharrell Williams, who seems to think that Happy was a success so its groove and time must be repeated endlessly...	-1
Snoop is one of  the most engaging and charismatic  artists  over the  past twenty years  however  he been on cruise control  for the past  decade plus. he has a  set formula  and its allowed him to cover  alot of the filler on his albums.always glad him and Charlie Wilson  are on this set and glad to  hear kendrick lamar  as well,  snoop  has  been there  and done this album years ago.	-1
at  first i was checking to see what they might go as they have been pretty cool with their folk brand of pop music.  however this album feels are odinary for radio play. sorted like they are settling for being a rascal flats of folk pop.  it  gets  real watered down and plan in a hurry. Mumford and Sons needs some  Sanford and Son in their lives in that they need to switch up lanes and get a new groove going.	-1
The Wolf is a total rip off of Delta Spirit's Bushwick Blues!	-1
I loved Mumford and Sons first album.  I only somewhat liked their second album despite it surprisingly winning Album of the Year.  I never really cared much more for the band.  In fact I didn't even care to watch their music videos so I actually forgot what they even looked like.  When the band announced that they would be going 'electric' I was excited.  I said I loved their first album, but I would take synths and electric guitars over banjos any day.  So my first thought was that they were going to follow in the steps of Arcade Fire who went into disco indie rock territory with the post Album of the Year album Reflektor.  The lead single "Believe" was released and my hopes for a Mumford Reflektor went out the window.  I loved the song but it didn't seem worth the hype.  They also released "The Wolf" which was also a decent song but far from their claims of real 'electric'.  I didn't discount the album yet though.  I wanted to know for sure what the band considered electric.  So the album finally came out and I decided to preview it a few times on Spotify before considering buying the actual CD.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  I listened to it through 5 times and it just didn't click.  They went sorta electric, but somehow they got even more boring.  Some of the hooks in the songs are catchy but very forgettable.  The lyrics are so cheesy and cringe worthy most of the time.  The only decent songs that save this from getting a 1 star rating from me are 'Believe', 'The Wolf'', 'Hot Gates', 'Only Love' and 'Snake Eyes'.  But even those songs are forgettable aside from the lead single.  Also note that only one of those songs isn't a single.  I really don't remember any of the hooks.  I said some of them were catchy, but I can't sing a note of any of the songs if you paid me to.  The so called electric guitar riffs were so bland.  This will sound hipster, but its also true, the band has become generic and boring.  This isn't them experimenting.  This is them preparing for their downfall.  Not all bands have everlasting success.  I predict this will be the beginning of the fading of Mumford.  This album might do well in its first weeks on sale but it will fall off quick.  The band needs to really concentrate if they wanna get up from this slump.  I can see some people enjoying and even loving this album, but that doesn't mean its good.  I see more people hating it.  I tried to like it and not be part of the group, but its hard when the album really is as bad as people say.  If you're a hardcore fan of the band, then I don't know what to tell you.  You could gamble a few bucks on this album, but I suggest you listen to it online first and see if you like it first.  Like I said, some people will love it, but more people will hate it.  Proceed into this album with caution, especially if you're a fan of good music.	-1
Josh has such a great voice, but I found this CD to be less than I expected. Song selections do not do his voice justice & I really didn't like most of them. Ordered it without reviewing the music on-line, and wish I hadn't. This collection will be given away or relegated to the rack to collect dust.	-1
this  cat has  legit talent, however his material  is about  as  tasty as ex lax.  i mean i have seen him on tv singing  and playing drums,etc.. however his talent doesn't get to fully compliment him in the studio. instead he be on that lounge happy hour  sleepy time  feel. no changes or real tone or feel on this set.	-1
This is nothing but a yelling contest.  With the exception of maybe one  or two selections, everything else sucks.  He doesn't sound like he's worked on anything, doesn't sound like he's actually singing for a musical; he just gathered some sheet music from musicals and caterwauled his way through it.  There is almost nothing of substance on this album... he's picked "Over the Rainbow"...big deal.  Third graders do that one.  He also chose "Pure Imagination" with absolutely no thought that his voice is not right for that song.  "Pure Imagination" is a gentle, warm song, not fit for the yelling and hollering that Groban seems to think Broadway songs are to be performed.  It's like he thinks every selection is "Anthem".  It's not. You know, we get it.  He can sing.  He has a strong voice.  We don't need another album of vocal exercises to prove it.  He chose almost all of the wrong selections for the kind of power his voice has.  All in all, very disappointing both in Groban's attitude towards this album, his lack of thought towards the pieces he chose and his arrogance towards noise ordinances.  Save your money.  This one will be on Cheap Album of the Day soon.	-1
When it has came down to what Kanye West has delivered in his art, it has sincerely been more about being selfish, than a strong rapper. Unfortunately, his latest set of songs with Paul McCartney, on Four Five Seconds with Rihanna and One Love, were songs that sincerely weren't his best songs. But with so much of his career, being more focused on being Mr. Kim Kardashian than being a strong rap artist, he just doesn't seem to drive his heart into his work. Kanye's song, All Day isn't exactly a strong rap song, but taking out things on others. He sincerely doesn't put his all in the category genius to his work, and instead takes it back a little too far to his earlier works. He had much better song several years ago, and instead his song lately have been wasted from the heart. I really think when Kanye West does put out a new album, he should wear more of his heart from his earlier sleeves.  Song: D+	-1
Didn't know there was like an interview at the beginning and end of the song.	-1
This is just pop music.  Zac Brown has a good voice, but the beat of the music is formulaic, boring and nothing which has Zac Brown separate himself from others who put out middle of the road pablum.	-1
totally sucks i like real country music the stuff they pay on pop stations is better than this ZBb was one of my favrites	-1
This is not the Zac Brown I fell in love with. Much like Daughtrys last cd it seems all too many great bands follow the pop road and change their sound to appease more people. This cd is a huge let down.	-1
Pre-ordering a ZBB CD has always been a no-brainer.  I am totally devastated by this CD.  It sounds like the other 99.9% of concocted pop garbage that comes out nowadays.  Totally unbelievable.  The first track could pass for Justin Bieber.  Sounds effects, distortion ... Sounds like a Disney soundtrack featuring One Direction.  I'm all for branching out and crosses genres and exploring new territory.  But this is not new territory.  This is pop garbage grade A.  As my friend said, "I am going to pretend this CD never happened, and wake up tomorrow, waiting for the new Zac Brown Band CD to come out April 2016."	-1
On first listen, suckage. I get that artists in general reinvent themselves (JEKYLL + HYDE) but man, I was not expecting this.  I was SUPER excited because my all time Favorite gal Sara Bareilles is on here and also Chris Cornell whom I enjoy.  I listened to Sara's song and thought what is this, Jazz? Chris Cornell is rock and WAY off for me. The majority of the album has a serious pop beat and does nothing for me.  I always thought of ZBB as one of the stead-fast modern times true country bands. I also miss a lot of the harmonies they have had in the previous albums 1) Beautiful Drug- Pop 2) Loving You Easy- more country with a pop beat 3) Remedy- more true to the ZBB sound 4) Homegrown- this is the first country single off the album and is more rock to me than country 5) Mango Tree- feat Sara Bareilles- Jazzy- starts with heavy horns in the begining 6) Heavy is the Head- feat. Chris Cornell- Rock. 7) Bittersweet- slower paced more country feel 8) Castaway- are we trying to be Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney? 9) Tomorrow Never Comes- does have a country feel to it. 10) One Day- more Buffett 11) Dress Blues- more of a country pace.  This is actually a lyrically great song. 12) Young and Wild- synthetic rock beat. 13) Junkyard- I am not sure what this is but I cannot stomach more than 15 seconds of it. and its over 7 minutes long. 14) I'll be your man (Song for a Daughter)- I love the lyrics in this song, its beautiful.  Set more to an islandy beat but great ZBB harmonies 15) Wildfire- more synthetic stuff.  Good beat though. 16) Tomorrow Never Comes-Acoustic- and an acoustic version of song above. This is just one music lovers opinion.  I don't really need much flack from my opinion, we all have one- have a great day.	-1

Honestly? What happened to the song I hear on the radio? The version I WANTED???? This is the only version by the group offered by Amazon and I'm sorry but IF I WANTED A RAP SONG, I'D BUY A RAP ALBUM. They have a great melody, catchy lyrics...it's great. But THIS version is at least half rap. And that just ruined it for me. Completely.  Just...NO.  I'm being generous with my 2 stars...right now I'm feeling that I've purchased musical vandalism. This sort of bait & switch is inexcusable. Usually you can tell when a great song has been ruined by a needless remix with a random rap artist, and I completely understand that some people like it. They think it's edgy or modern or hip or whatever. And that's great that there is an alternate for them. But if you just want the song to be SUNG, it seems to be an impossibility.  If a band releases a song to the radio, THAT version should at least be available for purchase.	-1
This is pop music for girls who think they're too cool to listen to pop music. Uninteresting, irritating, and wimpy radio ready pop music with no heart and soul. Essentially a few white guys doing some rap, reggae, and bland pop music. In one ear and out the other at best. At worst this truly becomes grating on the ears after awhile. This is only a step above Miley Cyrus and Justin Beiber. Yes it's that bad.	-1
Did not like this CD at all.  Sounds juvenile.  If I were 12 I might like it.	-1
Their previous stuff is much better and I will continue to listen to that and not this.  I wasted my $.	-1
Not good	-1
I'll be honest, I was never a big fan of BB but my older brother was and I liked a few of their songs off past albums. I was curious to see what they came up with after being gone for around 6 years. Unfortunately this album has nothing interesting to offer. It's just cliched predictable radio rock with no heart or edge to it. I swear the chorus of the song "failure" felt like a Kelly Clarkson song. I feel like BB really could've come back with some urgency and bite to them but it's just the same stuff they've always done. They pretend to be heavy, they pretend to write interesting hooks without actually doing so. If someone wants to hear some good accessible hard rock/alt. metal then try Chevelle, Sevendust, or Helmet. All of those bands are heavier and simply write more interesting and creative material.	-1
There's just too darn much of this noise! Generic wanna be EMO crap, crafted specifically for the Hot Topic adolescent to think it's groovy! Why would you buy some crap that sounds like 3rd generation GreenDay/Metallica ripoff music...Originality is lacking here, KneeGrow! Keep calm and listen to The Beach Boys (real original music). So much to this enormous palette we call music. Don't stunt the growth of your musical ears polluting it with this generic-sound like everybody else on Iheart radio crap...This is just another Nickelback/Daughtry wanna be.  This music may be the closest proximation to having some homeless krak hed defecate on your face and wipe his bum with your shirt collar.	-1
The new Eric Clapton release isn't in the Top 100 here, but this dreadful waste of aluminum is? Something's WRONG here!  Sounds like vague attempt at metal via Metallica with a shot of Green Day and so on, but never gets past first base.  Not to worry, these folks will be forgotten in the near future.	-1
Some groups, such as Chevelle, don't change their style much over the course of their career and still manage to stay interesting. Breaking Benjamin are not one those groups. The first three albums should some growth and promise, but on Dear Agony and now this disc, theyve become more copy/paste. Several songs on both discs sound too much like songs they had done on previous discs. I had hope that entirely new lineup behind Burley would bring some inspiration and vigor to the band's sound. Instead, it feels like the other members are merely pawns. I will continue to hold out hope that on the next effort, the other band members can help steer the band in a bit of new creative direction, rather than merely recycling what's been done. Like I said, the problem isn't the keeping of their core sound, it's that Ben isn't doing enough to keep it interesting in my opinion.	-1
Well, Hillsong United is my absolute favorite but this is NOT like their other cds. I bought it for "Touch the Sky " and on my first listen through,  I thought it would be a good sleep album. Maybe so, but it is now one of my most inspiring, with several sons on my Favorite Favorites Playlist.	-1
i should  never listen to reviews.i love the killers..and  his voice but this is not that  exciting yet  listened once.. i give one more try ..fast service  though	-1
No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!! IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought*** I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube. Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it. ***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.	-1
I got the wrong version. I love Kirk, but not this version of this song. I wanted the hip hop version, but got the gospel version. The Demo's on Amazon aren't long enough to figure out with is which and they don't say. I'd love to buy the version I want, but can't on here.	-1
If it is the clean version. It should not have curse words.  I wanted to like the clean version but it is not clean.  What is the point.  Money gone down the drain.  I stand by my 1 star because It should have used alternative words like chic instead of &!*CH!!!  No I can not listen to it when I have my kids in the car or even when I am driving with my Windows down.  It is embarrassing.	-1
RI LOST HER DAMN MINDS AGAIN  GUESS HER GIRLFRIEND OWES HER MONEY AND SHE WANTS IT BEFORE SHE KILLS HER OR HIM WE KNOW RIS BISEXUAL.	-1
once i saw the video, everything i felt about this song changed..	-1
There is honestly a difference between when a singer is a real singer, and when a singer is more like a manufactured product. Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those artists that has been for the past several years, been more like a manufactured product. Sadly, the quality of her songs, just like herself has slowly withered away, to where she has no rhythm in the songs she has came out with. With all the hoopla she has with her upcoming album R8, she really hasn't yet found her real voice in her own work. Also, with the songs that she has done Four Five Seconds with Paul McCartney and Kanye West and American Oxygen, she honestly needs to have better. Bitch Better Have My Money, from the upcoming R8 record is so terrible, she sounded like she took one too many doses of medication, and lost her own voice. I really found this song to make my ears bleed. If Rihanna really wants to impress her fans, maybe she should retire and go back to what makes a real songstress swoon, because she  has became more like a broken record.  Song: F	-1
It is honestly very sad that whenever someone is talented, that they have thrown their voice away. Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those singers who has been so severely overexposed that the quality of her own work has diminished greatly, that her work has not been worth listening too. Her latest set of songs with Kanye West and Paul McCartney on Four Fiver Seconds has been less than striking from the heart. She really has not found better for her own voice, from start to finish. Bitch Better Have My Money, or BBHMM has been one of her worst songs she has came out in a long while. I definitely found this song that not only be just annoying, it definitely ranked much lower from her work from before. I definitely think Rihanna really has let her own voice go. It is definitely a song that not only that I do not recommend you download, it shows that whatever Rihanna has came out with is just not even worth it. Just go to someone else.  Song: F+	-1
It is absolutely so sad that whenever someone who is talented that they have constantly thrown their voice away. Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those washed-up singers who has been more like a robot in her voice, than really having anything that can match from the soul of the heart. Her latest set of songs has honestly been less than stellar in her voice, and it has shown to be more choppy and course, than elegant and intimate. Four Five Seconds, which she did with Paul McCartney and Kanye West really failed to deliver from the heart in every way. Bitch Better Have My Money, or BBHHM is honestly one of those songs that feels more whack than anything that really has delivered. I definitely think the song feels more like a waste of time, than sincerely a singer that knows she should be working it. I overall found the song to be one of her low points overall. It is not only a song I do not recommend, but if Rihanna keeps making songs like this, her career will drop dead.  Song: F+	-1
It is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and gifted has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs. Rihanna has made some of the most disgraceful songs that have came out the past several years. She ,just like Beyonce' Knowles has been so oversaturated in airplay, that sadly the quality of her voice has died. The talent has also died too. Her latest set of songs just haven't set the benchmark as a real songstress. Bitch Better Have My Money or BBHMM, her latest song is absolutely pathetic and poorly done. She tries and changes her game and be more street, and instead her spirit in voice has diminished at the heart of the matter. Just like some of her recent songs like Four Five Seconds with Kanye West and Paul McCartney, she absolutely doesn't ignite at all. I think when Rihanna's next album, she had better for her career. Honestly Bitch Better Have My Money has left her broke in the heart.  Song: F+	-1
I bought this album-- because I've always been a James Taylor fan. Quite frankly, I think he's a little "Burned out," creativity wise. I listened to the first four tracks or so, took it off the CD player, and haven't  been impressed enough for a second playing-to this point.	-1
I am not a fan of this album - and I am a huge James Taylor fan:  going back to his Sweet Baby James days.  He seems obsessed by death and aging.	-1
Meh, 3 tracks are "good" but Its all over the place. When doing a fun song it abruptly changes. Has christmas music.  Not my thing and wouldn't buy again. Expected it to be more organized w a theme more like Glee, then another "theme".	-1

There is so much that can be said for Ciara in her personal life right now. The end of her relationship with her fiancee Future had ended with him cheating on her, and also her music has not really been anything extraordinary. The latest set of songs she had come out with have been poor, than anything that really comes from the impassioned heart. The setup for her last couple of albums Ciara and Fantasy Ride have been much more lackluster than strong. I really did not find the songs like Body Party and Love, Sex & Magic to be anything impressive. Dance Like We're Making Love, the latest song from her upcoming album Jackie isn't anything that ignites at all. She tries to be seductive, but honestly Ciara instead feels more like a whimper alone. The song feels weak and her tone into the song sincerely is not anything that is special. If Ciara really is going to keep making poor songs, I think it is honestly time for her to considering retiring from a music career. Her next album should have better than this song really did.  Song: D+	-1
It is honestly, and sincerely so sad that whenever someone young and talented, has really run out of ideas, with making better for her own music, and better to her own voice. Unfortunately, Ciara has been one of those singers whom has definitely lost her own edge for quite awhile, and sadly, her own career has faded in the wind. With the end of her own relationship with her ex-fiancee Future, and her music falling, she has tried it again with her song I Bet, and honestly the song has lost her own edge in voice and song. Her second single from her Jackie album, Dance Like We're Making Love, does not even try to deliver. I found the song to not even ignite the way other seductive songs have shown in R&B for so many years, like Spanish Guitar from Toni Braxton. If Ciara really wants better, she has not gotten it. I think with all her lagging sales and work, it is time for Ciara to sincerely retire, and start having a new life with her young one.  Song: D+	-1
It has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from Ciara. Musically, she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own albums, not only they have been very poor, but they absolutely have failed to ignite on sales. She has really rushed her music out so much that she has really faltered in her own work. Her songs have not really simply done very well. Her last album Ciara, has failed to ignite in sales, and with the over-releasing early songs, she just has left  less for her fans. For what has been going on for her Jackie record, has shown she really has to find better for her own voice and motherhood. This isn't the 2000 decade anymore. Dance Like We're Making Love, the second single from Jackie fails to ignite a passion that can make you dance from the soul, just a whimper to become a wallflower. I found this song to be just as lackluster as I Bet was. It is definitely time for Ciara to consider retiring from music, if she keeps making poor songs like this one did.  Song: D	-1
It is honestly so sad that someone young and talented has not really made the mark that they had made, to make the music in their life come alive. Ciara, who has had a lot going for her musically and personally the past several years, is one of those singers. She honestly has had a lot of lackluster songs from her past few albums that really have lost her voice in the wind, and not driving her heart to where her voice should really be. Her last album self-titled has had some lackluster songs from Body Party and Sorry, were not really as strong as she would've wanted them to be. Her latest song, Dance Like We're Making Love, the second single from her Jackie record, isn't actually as strong as her earlier songs like Goodies, and Love, Sex & Magic shown. I really didn't find the chemistry to drive into the song, in the way she wanted it to be.  I think Ciara should really take more time into her work, than rush her work out, like the overexposed Beyonce' Knowles. Hopefully, there will be better with Jackie coming around.  Song: D+	-1
Excellent concept. Horrible singer. He was strafing at the top of his range entire song.	-1
It has been a very long time since we have heard anything new from Adam Lambert. While he has had some good songs from For Your Entertainment, he has not been able to definitely follow-up to his success from American Idol after his debut record. It honestly has been a very tough ride overall, but it has been a stepping stone. Still, he has a whole lot to find better for his own work, than trying to be a sound-alike to George Michael. His latest song shows to be more of a haunting rhythm, but not anything outrageous. Ghost Town, the lead single from his third album The Original High, is not anything that really ignites afire from the heart. The song doesn't actually ignite they way that he did with What Do You Want From Me from his past. I really do think Adam needs to have a sound that is more driven from the soul after Idol, and he not been able to have something more strong that made it more like a haunting.  Song: D+	-1
I've recently revisited Idol artists after the news that idol is to be cancelled. I've enjoyed some great music while watching, but sadly many of the artists put out music knowing that their fans will praise it no matter what. It's a shame because that (often) false praise never really benefits an artist.  "Ghost Town" is interesting at the start, sort of dark and mellow, but the dance floor vibe kicks in and then you realize the lyrics are trite and too repetitive (yeah, we get it...Ghost Town, ghost town, ghost town).	-1
Some creep stalked me and pointed out that I had written a few reviews for his Adam that he didn't agree with...so this is for my stalker...I hope you like this review. Adam is a potential talent but his taste in music is just not nearly as good as his voice. Thus this is another album that fails to deliver.	-1
I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.  I just wish he'd do more ballads, songs with deeper lyrics and let us hear raw Adam in all its natural beauty.	-1
After I heard Trespassing, his last album, I felt that it was one of the most beautiful albums I'd ever heard. I couldn't wait to hear The Original High. After listening to it, I am so disappointed. I don't understand how he can make this mediocre album because he's such a talented musician. I don't recommend this album to anyone unless you're a diehard Adam Lambert fan. Otherwise, I'd say skip it and wait for the next album. Hopefully, it will be good.	-1
I've been a fan of Adam Lambert since his Idol days and I have his previous two albums which were really good.  Adam must have sold out or been pressured into recording this generic sounding pop music that everyone is releasing these days.  Also, I would like to comment on his new look, he has that hetero macho mustache and beard that all the guys are sporting these days, boring!!! where is the Glam-Rock God with the wild hairstyle and make up.  I know that everyone evolves and changes but I feel that Adam Lambert regressed with this release.  Sorry but I'll just put this CD away and store it somewhere because there is nothing for me to be inspired about.	-1
Some creep stalked me and pointed out that I had written a few reviews for his Adam that he didn't agree with...so this is for my stalker...I hope you like this review. Adam is a potential talent but his taste in music is just not nearly as good as his voice. Thus this is another album that fails to deliver.	-1
No big surprise that it is so bad: I listened to "Ghost Town" a few times and hated it...sadly that is one of the better (cough) songs on the album. This album does nothing to showcase his vocal abilities...it's the type of music that anyone with a computer could put out.	-1
There is honestly so much that can be said from a singer, who is a real singer. But, when they become more like a robot than a real singer, than you know it is honestly time to throw them away. Unfortunately, with all of that that Rihanna has shown, she has been more like a wasted and manufactured product, than a real songstress, and sadly most of her songs have really been severely overplayed, to where she is more annoying than brilliant. Yet, I was not appealed with her recent set of songs from her life, because they, like her have been overdone. Four Five Seconds, didn't ignite with my heart, to what there could've been done with Paul McCartney and Kanye West. Her latest song, American Oxygen really continues that lagging path that she has been known for, by not listening to herself. She really sounds more like a robot, than really flexes her own voice. If Rihanna is going to have another record, she really has to listen to herself, than what American Oxygen has brought in for her, a wasted tank of gas.  Song: D	-1
Didn't like at all.  Don't know why I bought it.  Anyone want it?	-1
Not a bad effort, but sounds like a Jackson Browne/Eagles wannabe. We've already got that music in our library, so on to more good things from Joe Bonamassa, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and especially the new Buddy Guy CD.	-1
I did not purchase this someone else must of under my account	-1
None	-1
Its way too mellow and the guitars are pretty much non existent so its pretty boring	-1
Worst song ever!!!	-1
So this is what music is nowadays? Thats sad...	-1
She has a great voice but the music???I'm not feeling it. Her an reggae need to part ways. Jennifer Hudson did the disco sound on her JHUD album an it work'd,but this reggae influence album ain't doing it for me. I downloaded this an "blood" from L La H ...both were weak at first but L La H album grew on me...this did not. Just like that "Star" tracc said...{Let's just agree to disagree"}.	-1
I really don't want to be "that fan" when reviewing this.  I respect the rights of an artist to evolve their craft, to experiment and try new things, and in general do what they want with their works.  And I don't want to be one of those fans who whines and gripes whenever an artist decides to try out a new genre or a new style.  A fan shouldn't dictate what an artist does, and it annoys me when fans of a work start complaining "he changed it, it sucks!" or "it's popular, now it sucks!" or "<insert name here> has sold out and gone commercial!"  I have long tried to avoid falling into that trap with my favorite writers, filmmakers, musicians, and the like.  However... I have to confess that I find myself falling into those complaints here.  I love Owl City so much... but this latest album is a letdown, and yes, I will say that Adam Young's decision to shift his music style to be more in line with today's popular music is the main cause.  "Mobile Orchestra" is something of a departure from Adam Young's usual style.  Instead of the dreamy electronic tunes with eccentric but charming lyrics I've come to love, this album has much more straightforward lyrics and more of a generic pop sound.  There's much more emphasis on percussion, and on using the synthesizer to create heavy, strong sounds instead of the whimsical and light sounds of his earlier albums.  And while Young is still the primary vocalist on about half the songs, the other half feature guest singers, including Aloe Blacc, Sarah Russell, Jake Owen, Britt Nichole, and boy band Hanson.  Call me an old-school Owl City fan, but I loved Owl City's original sound -- it was unique and delightful, standing out from much of the more generic-sounding popular music.  And I find myself disappointed that Adam Young has altered his signature sound to match up to what's popular.  In a world where a lot of music sounds the same, it was nice to find a band and singer that stood out from the crowd yet didn't sound harsh or ugly, and Owl City fit the bill.  Now Owl City sounds virtually indistinguishable from countless other musical acts, and it saddens me.  That's not to say the entire album is for naught.  "Verge" is a fun and peppy song, and "Unbelievable" is one of the stronger songs on the album -- partly because its lyrics are a return to Owl City's original sense of surreal whimsy instead of blandly straightforward.  And as a Christian, I did enjoy the two Christian-oriented tracks on this album -- "My Everything" and "You Are Not Alone."  Though Owl City isn't entirely a "Christian rock" musician, it's good to find a singer who isn't afraid to proclaim his faith through his music.  Most of the rest of the songs are fairly weak, however, and largely unmemorable next to his earlier hits such as "Vanilla Twilight," "Alligator Sky," "Dreams Don't Turn to Dust," and his most popular single "Fireflies."  It doesn't help that there are a lot of collaborations on this album, and as Adam Young's voice is soft and dreamy in nature, he tends to be overpowered by whoever he's singing a duet with.  And while the guest singers sound nice enough... I came here to hear Owl City, not a singer I've never even heard of until now.  I love Owl City, but this album was disappointing.  I'd recommend that fans of Owl City stick with his older albums "Ocean Eyes" and "All Things Bright and Beautiful."  ("Midsummer Station" is lovely enough but shows some ominous signs of things to come...)  As for individual numbers on this album, I'd stick with downloading "Verge" and "Unbelievable."	-1

You might take pause to wonder about a song that starts with the artist declaring "you already know who it is!" before telling you his name (just in case you in fact did not know who he is). It's a catchy song with a catchy hook. Perfect for those who like to kill a dance party by forcing people to make a dance circle and watch them dance a litany of dance moves they memorized for this one OMG IT'S MY SONG EVERYBODY WATCH ME SERIOUSLY I'M SO DOPE 3 minutes of fame. The beat is old, like beating a dead horse with a crowbar sort of rehash feeling. Silento's "verses" (if you can call them that) aren't awful, he's just mentioning a bunch of dance moves white kids like to think they can do after watching a few YouTube videos. What makes this song awful is that it's nothing more than dance-circle bait and the artist has to repeat every.damn.thing. he says in every line like we're too stupid to have listened the first time. This incredible lyrical depth and genius is evident in verses like "Do the Stanky Leg (stank) Do the Stanky Leg (stank stank) Do the Stanky Leg (stank) Do the Stanky Leg (stank stank) Do the Stanky Leg (stank) Do the Stanky Leg (stank stank) Now Break Your Legs (break em) Now Break Your Legs (break em)..." etc. As a DJ, I hate this song but I must play it as it is one of those fun "crowd pleasers". As a father of a toddler, I love watching my little girl dance to this song. Take it for what it is.	-1
Bad language	-1
This song is trying way too hard to be the song of the summer. Maroon 5 is seriously shameless - at this point it's safe to say they'll do anything for chart success. Doesn't have the organic feel of some of their previous summer smashes like Moves Like Jagger or Payphone. They need a break, and we all need a break from Adam Levine.	-1

I wouldn't recommend this CD, as it doesn't really bring much new to the table.  I bought this because I was seeing Warren in concert and wanted to be 'up' on his latest project.  Well, I walked out of the show during the drum solo after being ready to leave even earlier.	-1
This is an uninspired effort by guitar luminary Warren Haynes, backed by Railroad Earth, the popular so-called "newgrass" band from New Jersey.  Warren Haynes is a perennial winner of Guitar Player magazine's guitarist of the year and has backed such greats as The Allman Brothers Band, The Grateful Dead, and jazz guitarist John Scofield.  He is also co-founder and frontman of the blues rock quartet, Gov't Mule.  Haynes produced this album and wrote most of the songs.  He has never particularly shone in these roles nor as a vocalist, however, and is most noted for his guitar work.  This outcome of this album is, thus, not surprising (although one might have hoped for more synergy between Haynes and Railroad Earth).  There is more acoustic instrumentation and much more of a folk-rock feel to this than his work with Gov't Mule.  Perhaps this is why he chose to be backed by Railroad Earth.  At any rate, Railroad Earth, while competent musicians, are hardly virtuosos and it feels as though Haynes is dragging them along.  The album overall has a leaden feel to it.  "Gold Dust Woman", the rock classic by Stevie Nicks and sung on this album by Grace Potter, utterly fails to capture the dynamism and tension of the Fleetwood Mac original.  Haynes musters some energy, however, for country classic "Coal Tattoo", by Billy Edd Wheeler, and his own composition, "Beat Down the Dust", both of which also have appealing working class political themes.	-1
polished turd...I hear this every now and then in an elevator or a department store alongside Lady In Red, She's Like The Wind and other inoffensive eighties cheese pop	-1
dont like to much	-1
I did not like the songs.  Only one was worth listening to.	-1
she is not. no one can be....sell yourself as yourself. Dont rest on some poor young woman who died too soon. R.I.P Amy.	-1
NOT BEST ALBUM AT ALL ;(	-1
I honestly hate this record with every fiber of my being.	-1
Jake used to be awesome his first 2 CDs were amazing. He started to go pop with beachin and this song is even worse. It's terrible.	-1
Downright broken-hearted & depressing songs! There are two guitar jams, on this release! Not my cup o' java! Thanx!	-1
I never heard or saw this group outside of amazon...the only reason I gave them a chance was for that song "Get Away"!!!{she reminds me of Tinashe on that record},another banger is "Gabby"!!!.The o.k traccs are "Girl","Penthouse Cloud" & "Curse".	-1
B SIDE OF BLOOM ? ;(	-1
While the 60's produced some very good music, and while artists like Dan Auerbach like to capture the sprit of the time, most often they miss.  Dan Auerbach of Black Keys fame, put together this new band The Arcs with a bend towards 60's psychedelic rock.  Now despite all of the glowing reviews that all of the major music magazines have been giving this album, I have to tell you it's really not that good.  And I'm not the only one, several people that I trust have heard this disk and all have been less than impressed.  Skip this one.	-1
This album was recommended to me because I'm a fan of Zella Day and Meg Myers. I like their darker tones, the honesty in their lyrical content and just the overall depth of the music, and I was hoping and expecting much of the same from this. Musically, I have no complaints. It has a very good dark pop tone to it, great grooves, easy to get into. Vocally, again, sounds good, she has that dark tonal quality. My issue with the album is the lyrical content, it just seems hollow. The lyrics just seem very generic and not very personal at all. Many of the songs, including New Americana, and Strange Love, just have really generic and overdone meanings. Forget everyone, I'm better than them, I'm going to do what I want. Well high five, good for you. Zella Day and Meg Myers actually feel like they are writing their music from experience. It's less about conveying a idea, and more about expressing their emotions through their past, and how they've learned to move on. They are songs people can listen to, and relate to, and apply to their own situations to hopefully find some healing in whatever difficulty they face. Halsey on the other hand neglects these things. While still "dark pop", the majority of songs are more about being the person you want to be and giving the finger to anyone who disagrees. This would be a fine sentiment, however, it has been so overused, and the message so abused that it is really just rendered repetitive and unoriginal.	-1
2nd vinyl ordered first one was horrible quality and skipped a ton, second time around...even worse and MORE skips...AWFUL PRODUCT BUYER BEWARE!!!!	-1
like the music but the lyrics are Satanic and I'm a Christian	-1
It is now exactly 1 week since this album was released and this already has 44 "5" star reviews. These are from the fans. I like Ghost, but I am not a fan. Thought the first album was just alright. Really liked the second album. Heard this and sort of laughed. It sounds like a North Las Vegas casino lounge band doing Graves-Era Misfits cover songs. It's hard to take it seriously. I gave it a few spins, but god this is really corny. Sorry. They really tried, but 'trying' doesn't equate to 5 stars in my book.	-1
god song	-1
Hah, how ironic, given that Ellie's voice is anything but powerful! I really wish she would give it up already. Every time she opens her mouth, it just sounds like she's out of breath. Maybe that's a sign that GIRL, YOU CAN'T SING!!	-1
None of the songs downloaded. All of the other bands did. Not sure what the problem is. Will change my rating if and when I figure it out.	-1
Guys this album is worse than trash only highlight is Anytime an its only bcuz Snoop sang an rapped made the only tolerable song dope thats why it gets a 1 outta 5!! Only dope track	-1
straight  up this  cat  has always had a nice voice and i applaud his longevity from the coke commericals to film,tv,etc.. cat has kept a brand going, however musically  he has always been a cat who just never had any songs and settled on trying to fit in. and the Black  ty thing is comedy.  glad he got a number 1 album and he is right about the racism of the music industry and the" AL jolson " acceptance of justin timberlake and robin thicke on R&B radio.  anyway  another aight album by a  cat who has some talent,however nothing that sticks.	-1
I was really excited when I saw that Tyrese had a new cd coming out.  I usually wait before I purchase, but the reviews were great and I took a chance and bit.  I have yet to find one song that I really like.  This was a bust for me.  Even when I would be kinda vibing, he'd kill it with all that screaming and whining.  Needless to say this didn't work for me...at all.	-1
Nothing good worth mentioning but "Picture Perfect"!!!.That tracc with BRANDY was o.k an "Dumb S**t should've been without Snoop an Blacc Ty.	-1
Regrettably, I just didn't like it.	-1
I had all sorts of tech issues. The music itself is great.	-1
Disclosure showed so much promise with the last effort.  But, here Disclosure is "Disappointing".  This CD is way too mello and fluffy...in fact this effort reminds me of "PM Dawn"...who i  liked....in 1995!	-1
What happened??	-1
Oops sorry I never thought I would say this but this was horrible.  I don't get this CD at all I want my 999 back on I m going to trade this train wreck in bye Felicia	-1
I didn't even know this was coming out till I saw it on shelves. It makes sense that the record company and probably Rob Zombie himself had no faith in it being a great album... if you can even call it one. It's more of an EP. There is only about 5 or 6 songs on this, and the rest is either talking/radio cut filler crap, or some stupid short instrumental that doesn't even sound like J5 is even trying to tune into his talents.  There is 2 decent songs I don't mind. One being UFO and the other Get Your Boots On. Neither make any sense, or have much meaning, but when does Rob ever do that anyway? The UFO one I take a liking to because it reminds me of Jerry Reed, if you know who that is, and sounds like Jerry gone Rob Zombie style which is unusual, but makes me wonder what Rob would sound like covering "East Bound and Down" lol  The other stuff on here is easily forgetable. Not Rob's best work and the album just feels incomplete like the big singles are missing from it. I expect as per usual, Rob will try to rectify the negative reviews and bitter tastes in fans mouths left hungry for more by releasing a deluxe edition soon with a few more songs or a quick cover of something to fill in the 40-50 mins remaining of CD time this one here has left blank.	-1
Well, here we are with another Rob Zombie record that is just kinda "there". Rob Zombie hasn't released a worthwhile solo album in over a decade and every time I get my hopes up that he will make a comeback he just ends up disappointing. Rob said that this album was going to be "heavy" and do things "they haven't done in awhile". I can first and foremost tell you that what he said was a lie. This album sounds exactly like his past couple albums and this one in particular sounds worst with some of the most cringeworthy lyrics I've heard on a Rock record in a long time. The lead single gave this flaw away with the saying of it's title "Well Everybody's F***ing In a UFO" I mean, come on. That title sounds silly and filled with stupidity and that exactly how the song goes as well. I know Rob has always had "weird" titles and strange lyrical themes in his music. Trust me, as a long time fan of Rob Zombie (especially White Zombie) I know. But this album is too far off to be taken seriously. So many of the songs sound like parodies of something else than serious songs. Only positive thing I can say about this album is its guitar tone sounds pretty cool at certain points. Other than that, this album is very passable.	-1
Boring, sorry.  Good sound, but the songs just do nothing  for me.  I really admire Yo Yo Ma as a person and artist.	-1
I was looking for something more acoustic and mellow, the album was pure pop. Kind of a imitation of Adam Levine but not as good.	-1
I loved Rob Thomas's first album so much such a bold style and great variety and I was sorely disappointed with the 2nd release.  It seemed like a lazy effort and it was so generic. It had the style but no substance.  But this new album is really a joke, most of it is experimentation way out there trying stuff just to sound different.  This is not going to help his career one bit.  The songs that he does take serious are quite good.  I Think We'd Feel Good Together, Hold On Forever, The Great Unknown, Heaven Help Me, and Pieces.  Five songs that he wrote and took serious which get the two stars.  The other 8 songs are mostly wild experiments trying to reach outside his own space and be something he is not (and should not be).  Those songs lost 3 stars from the rating.  He should have continued and built on the 5 songs and he may have had a great new CD.  The 5 songs I mentioned I liked for the most part much better than the stuff on Cradlesong.  I think it's Rob's wild idea that this techno or new pop sound would land him a hit single or something?  It did not and it won't!	-1
This is unbearable to listen to. It sounds like someone cant force out a turd while trying to sing a great song.  I get cringe worthy chills every time I hear this awful sell out.	-1
This is the epitome of what's wrong with film music today: it's bland, boring, forgettable and, while it fits the film is an utter bore to listen to isolated from the film. The Terminator Genisys score sounds a great deal like Lorne Balfe listened to the original scores, namely Brad Fidel's, jotted down a couple notes, included some very weak reference and then filled up the rest of the score with a Hans Zimmer-style soundtrack of synth noise. With tracks like "Sarah and Kyle" it sounds like its trying hard to find a theme or a melody but completely failing. I can leave a film scored by John Williams and remember themes and melodies clearly, but with this soundtrack, there's, well, there's that song that went "dah-duh...." then had some noises and booming chords and drums and, was there a theme in there somewhere?	-1
Waste	-1
Not worthy	-1
Beats are FIRE!!!!! HIS LYRICS ARE BETTER THAN BEFORE BUT STILL WEAK. I really can barely understand what he's saying. Too many bars that don't RHYME. To many phrases repeated. As a DJ I need it for the younger crowd but a T.I., Jeezy, Ludacris or Killa Mike he is not.	-1
All of the samples sound like the "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/No-Words-Skit-Explicit/dp/B011JBDWO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">No Words (Skit) [Explicit</a>]" on Hopsin's new album "Pound Syndrome"... and that's nothing to be proud of.	-1
He is playing to his audience of people who hunt and fish.  Like Hey,  he's talkin' bout huntin' and fishin'...I'm gonna git this one.  Not that special.	-1
If this is what country music is coming to then I'll pass.	-1
not as good as I expected from  Don Henley	-1
Not rock	-1
Awful album. A couple of country dancing songs, but nothing like the Eagles.	-1
I find this album to be a lot less emotionally involved than the band's debut.  Maybe it's a testament merely to my overtly melancholic & hermetic ways, but all I find on this album is memorable synth beats.  Unlike a lot of (some?) people, I don't think the sheer ability of a song to stick around in your brain makes a song good.  Songs are about feelings.  I don't feel anything when listening to this album.  There's a couple songs toward the middle and end that brought up the experience a little.  "Clearest Blue" - the 3rd single also - was OK, and "Empty Threat" was probably the best song on the album, even though it kinda drags on as it goes...	-1
Hate this song regret purchasing it.	-1
I have purchased all but one of his albums and I wish I didn't buy this one. Nothing like anything else he has done but not in a good way. I wouldn't tell any to buy this cd. Sorry Flame	-1
This has to be the worst recording that I have purchased in my lifetime. The quality of the recording is unbearable. They need a guitar player and singer. Don't waste your money.	-1
I remember the first time I heard Black, from the first album on the radio.  The radio scene at that time had become so stale and boring filled with sissy alt rock bands posing as rock bands that a song with some actual teeth to it stood out amongst the audio fecal matter that was late 90's radio rock. Since getting their first album I've followed this band and they've been one of my favorite bands to come out over the past 20 years. I even have most of their bonus tracks, b sides and soundtrack songs, except the rap influenced stuff which wasn't my thing.  But honestly I think they're running out of ideas.  I loved 2010's Cold Day Memory at first, but as time went on I found that love wore off and now the album is only ok.  Black out the Sun is one of the most forgettable albums I've ever heard, I seriously tried really hard with that one and now we have Kill The Flaw.  The songs just aren't there anymore.  It's not that the material on here is bad.  It's just not memorable.  There are no catchy choruses, no memorable guitar riffs just nothing that makes me want to keep comong back.  Honestly I love a lot of their non album tracks more than these songs, or the songs on the previous album.  The sound is toned down and softer, kind of like Cold Day Memory, and the songs are very basic.  The vocals still sound good, and he has an awesome voice.  The band still has talent.  It's just that their songs have become stale to me.  The album opens with Thank You, which is a pretty solid track.  My only real complaint is I feel the guitars in the verses should have been heavier.  I'd also have sped up the chorus, kind of takes away from the momentum of the song.  But still it's a nice track.  Death Dance is also ok, one I do enjoy but don't really remember much.  The title track and bonus track have their moments and Letters has started to grow on me a bit, but that's about it.  One song has a cool acoustic part, with nice guitar work and a nice drum beat but I feel the slow electric section, when the electric guitars kick in, ruin the pacing of that song.  That part should have been faster too.  Other than that nothing really stands out.  Like I said these songs aren't necessarily bad, in fact there isn't a bad song on here.  They just aren't memorable and don't make me want to come back.  I could listen to tracks 1 and 2 and then stop and be perfectly fine.  Still the album is getting mostly positive reviews, of course on here it's amazon so most albums do, but I still recommend listening to it before getting it.  It's not a terrible album, but these guys are better than this.  If you like the 2 previous albums then you'll probably like this, but I just can't get into this.	-1
useless	-1
First off let me say, I am a huge fan of Dr, Dre.  I don't like a lot of rap, in fact, I really only like Dr. Dre productions.  The Chronic and 2001 were epic, monumental releases.  A sign of the times, but innovative and genre earth shattering releases.  Dr, Dre had been working on a follow up for years, upon years, upon years, and in the last couple of years dropped some tracks for his 3rd, supposedly solo album.  Fast forward to August 7th and I see this album available on iTunes.  I purchased without hesitation.  It's Dr. Dre.  Even when he doesn't release his own albums, he's always maintained a high production profile for other artists and his production is still Dr. Dre.  Upon first listen to this, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  It's as if Dr. Dre, the innovator, the beat master, the pioneer, the Dr. who changed the face of rap music, is influenced by I guess those who were influenced by him over the years.  There is nothing original, there is no earth shattering beats, and there is definitely No Chronic whatsoever.  This album sounds hastily put together, to coincide with the NWA movie just recently released, a rush release that sounds so overwhelming by todays artists and sounds. And to see that movie about NWA and then here this it's like asking yourself what happened to Dr. Dre.  NWA created the sound, the style, Dr. Dre defined it with The Chronic, and 2001.  This is not a Dr Dre that we all grown to jam and bounce to.  Dre day is history.	-1
Really??? You have GOT to be joking!!! This is a joke, right??? We waited 7 years for THIS??? This cd was ABSOFRIKKINLUTELY HORRID!!! If he scrapped Detox to make this, then there is no describing how bad Detox was/is. They say that after musicians become famous and sustain long popular careers, they eventually lose their creative juices and ideas and run out of subject matter about which to write. You would figure that Dr. Dre being worth 1 BILLION DOLLARS could write the most profane, vulgar music ever conceived. What would you do with $ 1 Bil??? Can you imagine?? You could snort c0k3 off a politicians' wife and get away with it. You could shoot up anywhere in public and walk. You could finance a space program to have brothels in a space station!! There is NO limit to the depravity you could rap about, and THIS is what he thought up? Wow!! What a huge disappointment this cd was.	-1
Not westcoast rap !! Snoop sounds refreshed as he did on Bush,Eminem did well,Kdot did well,other than that only other song that remotely sounded like Dre was Talking to my Diary!! Not a gud album not even average! !	-1
I really expected more from Dre...Especially after waiting over 15 years.  Expected better beats and better raps...Perhaps he is out of ideas.	-1
Huge Dre & Death Row Fan! If Dre spits on a record, I would buy it so its no surprise when Ice Cube announced a day before Dre did that this secret album was coming out I got excited and then Dre confirmed on his Pharmacy radio show. Fans went "bananas" (as Dre described Ice Cube's track) waiting to hear and see the track listing. After all, its been 16 years waiting for Detox which he eventually confessed on the Pharmacy that he didn't like it and scrapped it. I don't know about you but the leaked tracks and the ones he released sounded amazing. Just search Dr. Dre detox unreleased on YouTube and you will find those joints with Jay Z, Eminem, TI and Game. Dope! Pure Genius!  Now, I purchased this on iTunes like everyone because at the time they said it was exclusive to Apple and there was no word on the cd launch. I couldn't wait or take any chances so I bought it the night of the streaming. When I first heard it I thought it was just not sounding right from my laptop so I copied it to my mp3 player and cd and took it to ride along to with my homeboy the same night. We were both so disappointed! What is up with this new sound and how does the beats, lifestyle and pure genius from the NWA days INSPIRE you to make this?  Dre has spent the last 16 years perfecting Detox and didn't release it because he felt it was leaked, didn't live up and all that yet he can finish an album in a few weeks and release it thinking we will all love it after a "few listens" or hoping it "will grow on us" or "keep an open mind" as some reviewers are saying on amazon. No it doesn't work like that Dre and to my fellow fans we deserve better and we were owed a better album and he has to be accountable for this. I don't know about you but I bump my Chronic and Chronic 2001 today, years later. Can you honestly say you can bump this Compton album even next year or the year after? It sounds like everything else out right now! There's absolutely nothing special about this and don't tell me Kendrick's joints are hot - ALL KENDRICK'S JOINTS ARE ALWAYS HOT! We buy Dre's albums because of the chemistry of the artists and amazing production - revolutionary sound. I felt like production was all over and some of the lyrics didn't even go with the beats.  The first joint "Talk about it" is good and the "One Shot One Kill" with Snoop is dope. The other with Xzibit and the last joint My Diary sounds more like Dre. I didn't expect a Chronic follow up or a Chronic sound, I expected a fantastic final album from the best Rap Producer of all time. Dre disappointed many fans and don't tell me I need to give it a chance and a few spins to grow on me. Is that what a Dre album has come to or what we should settle for? Say what you want but at the end of it all, Dre did Fall Off.  #DeathRow	-1
Dinosaur back-up/girl group singer from the '60s put out a real stinker. Her range is long gone. Purchase at your own risk! Kermit, the frog could out croak her.	-1
My wife made me download this song, complaining that I don't have enough "new" music (I'm a classic rock fan - Floyd, Zeppelin, etc.)  This is just another classic example of why current music is in the toilet.  The song has a few catchy hooks, but the vocals are weak, the lyrics inane, and the singer appears to be someone they dragged off of a pole at the Cheetah Club and forced to record a song.  Thank God I was a child of the 70's and was exposed to decent music. This song makes me weep for the future.  Kids, please go buy a copy of "Dark Side of the Moon" or "Abbey Road" instead of this.	-1
A HUGE let down. After the first song the rest of the album was bad. Heroes for sale was my favorite rap CD ever so to hear this was a HUGE let down. I wish I had better things to say about this album but then I would be lying. Hopefully the third time will be the charm.	-1
What can I say , I had to give it a one star , it's too short  songs is like 3 minutes long ,  beats are nice , lyrics are great ,songs full of emotion,and  insight , it is just too short ANDY I want more time so if there's anybody out there that know him personally tell him to make longer songs, I have all of his music , and as long as he stay on his knees I will continue buying his music , sending people to his shows , outreach ministries ,one, God bless , and for the record this CD totally deserve 10 stars	-1

Here we go again, more dreary tosh from a favorite with a phenomenal backlist. Nothing good for years now, and these mainly dreary and uninspired acoustic covers left me cold. For me the life has been knocked out of these songs. She could at least have finally covered 'Smoke on the Water' which has been a fun request at concerts. Why oh why doesn't she get back with John Leventhal and a band and get some punch back into her music. Has the creative magic finally dried up? Dar Williams for example is still delivering every time. Really disappointed.	-1
21 years ago, Shawn Colvin put out an album of cover songs - 'Cover Girl'. It was actually pretty good. She walked the tightrope of doing songs that weren't extremely well known to many people and yet still made them accessible.  21 years later, Shawn Colvin tries to replicate that model - but with less success with the release of 'Uncovered'.  First off, I will go on record saying I did not purchase this, but it had been available for full streaming for at least a week prior to the album's release. I've listened to each song multiple multiple multiple times. After her last two mediocre studio albums, I wasn't buying this sight unheard. Not again.  With 'Cover Girl', I knew about one-third of the songs fairly well, so I had the advantage of not having too many preconceived notions of how the songs had once fared.  With 'Undercover', I know about 90% of the songs well. This doesn't bode well for Colvin.  While I won't say that some of her selections are classics, but to me, they are songs that I love, and some of them that were recorded are not easy to interpret and even less to surpass in greatness. And while I know she's probably working on a shoestring budget, the arrangements and musicians are sparse - leaving too many songs sounding too similar, just in instrumentation.  Let's start with the good:  Colvin does a decent job with Paul Simon's "American Tune". It's not Simon, but it is decent.  John Fogerty's "Lodi" fares ok. I'm not sure it's an acoustic song, but at least this selection has the most 'band' feel than most of the songs here. Robbie Robertson's "Acadian Driftwood" is pretty good.  The bad: None one could truly touch Neil Finn's "Private Universe" and get away with it - for me, that song is too iconic. This includes Shawn. I know Finn is one of her favourite writers, but still, it's ambitious song at best and it doesn't make the mark.  Ditto with Springsteen's "Tougher Than the Rest". I'm not fan of Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street" (any version) and I'll give her this, at least there is no annoying saxophone on it like Rafferty's version. I was hoping her rendition would show me that it was indeed a good song, but it just isn't.  And there are 10,001 versions of "Gimme a Little Sign" out there. And most of them have life attached to them. I know Marc Cohen is on the song, but he's so drowned out, I'm not sure why they bothered having him on.  If you want a better version of Tammy Wynette's "Til I Get it Right", even Tricia Yearwood has one with more heart.  It's a heartbreaking song and Colvin doesn't convey any of the emotion.  And that is what is really wrong with this disk - good to great technical readings of each songs, but no emotion, no heart and little warmth. A song evokes a feeling, and unfortunately, too few of these do. She can put forth emotion on her own music, and even with her 'Cover Girl' material, but here it is like going through the motions.	-1
This one had thousands of good reviews so I thought I would really enjoy this one. After all, o brother where art thou and Chicago are sound tracks and very good. But I cant seem to get into this one. Maybe because I haven't seen the play or movie.	-1
Over hyped and poor quality recordings.	-1
I bought the first album with the new singer wasn't that impressed now the second album is just missing something first Krista Garmo left now Jeff Tate is gone and well I guess Queensryche is gone I know this probably isn't popular with all the positive review but I guess the 80s  and the nine days are gone so is Queensryche	-1
I truly and deeply love BA and his rock has shaped my world in so many ways! We have seen him in concert  twice in the past 2 years and it was AMAZING each time. His talent and passion is really beyond compare and there is so much love and rock living within his bones....it's just incredible to see.  Having said that, this album is totally like Roy Orbison meets Ringo Star with a Willie Nelson meets Flock of Seagulls twist.  Yep. There is some twang.  It's just not Bryan Adams that we all know and love.  Skip this one and go out and get vinyl versions of 11 or Reckless and keep on rocking.  Oh and DO go see him live. It's simply fantastic.	-1
"Don't Even Try" is one of the many lackluster tracks on this album, but it really should be the title. I've been a lifelong Bryan Adams fan and enjoyed his work up till 2008. But this album is, by far, his worst effort. The song-writing is atrocious. He simply has nothing to say. Not even remotely interesting melodies. It seems each song tries to emulate a band he liked growing up (Thunderbolt attempts a an AC/DC imitation, but most of it is very weak Elvis, early Byrds inspired).  The only listenable track is "Yesterday was just a dream." But the outtakes from Reckless were all far better than anything that can be found on this album. I usually am very happy to see artists whose heyday was in the 80s and 90s still producing new music, but this album seems to show that Bryan Adams simply has no creative instincts left and can't write a decent pop/rock song anymore. I suspect that most long-time BA fans will be very disappointed. The album barely goes beyond 30 minutes in length because BA just couldn't write any worthwhile content.	-1
Was not very clean. Not even by radio edit standards. Most fetty songs cannot clean up. Too many "f" and "n" words.	-1

Seeing all the pictures of Jackie with this wacked out brother of hers is just sickening. Five years of following someone's career wasted by a lunatic brother called Jacob Evancho and her lunatic family. This song is absolute crap as is the video. Jackie had a nice voice but she does nothing to improve it and now she loses her mind with her wacko brother. Never buy anything from these lunes.	-1
Typical weak album by the band's later work.	-1
Somehow doesn't work for me. Too many similar and overworked songs. Waste of money. Jusy buy the BEST--and skip this mess.	-1
Hugh Van Morrison fan... I was really looking forward to this.  The DVD is stereo only.  The video is fair-ish  Like TV quality, then.  Sound OK but stereo only..... So no I'm not really impressed or happy with this.  For the completest or the got to have your Van Morrison fix no matter what fans....	-1

I cannot concentrate on the words in the song because of the horrible beat that backs up the song.  This is garbage.	-1
Purchased this song but I never actually received it. It shows I purchased it but I cannot add it to my songs.	-1
great song	-1
somewhere between being a broke  Jennifer lopez meets a Broke Beyonce and a couple of other acts in places. eye candy factor she is on point,as a music  artist she is almost below zero. her voice is pretty liteweight. a couple  of ok  tracks,  however  she  is a  great artist to listen to on mute  if  she had a calendar.	-1
What's wrong with being confident? Nothing. What's wrong with this song though? Everything. This generic, cliche ridden fluff is Demi's idea of empowerment? And to think, this is supposed to be the title track to her upcoming third album?! Yikes. I am not looking forward to it at all.	-1
Odd one out here, sorry! I love Demi, but I find this album to be her least impressive piece of work. There are barely any stand-out tracks...the only ones that come to mind are "Stone Cold", and "Old Ways". I do also really like the Jump Smokers remix of CFTS. However, the majority of the tracks on this album are just extremely slow and bland. Just my personal opinion. Also, "Kingdom Come" ft. Iggy Azalea, and "Waitin for You" ft. Sirah are without a doubt the WORST songs on the album...this is the first time I've heard of Sirah, and hopefully the last. Overall, I'm just honestly very disappointed with this album.	-1
There is honestly a lack from female singers of today. They sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart, and instead have had a lot of songs that really have been more cheesy than a strike from the soul within. Honestly, there can be more patience to make a song strike well. Demi Lovato has had only a few songs that worked very nicely from that place, like Skyscraper and some other ones. But honestly, she has tried to be more in your face in the way other artists like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna have been, and sadly she has lagged from a strong inner soul. Her latest song, Confident, the second track and title track from third album is definitely a song that I didn't feel was a strong presence. Instead the song has been more of a waste than Cool For The Summer was. I really found this song to be one of her weakest songs overall. I hope the next single can bring out more confidence from the lack on the soul that this one showed.  Song: D	-1
It is absolutely so sad that someone young and talented that has a great head on their shoulders, throws away their own voice in regards to trying to capturing a younger audience. Demi Lovato has had a lot of ups and downs in her personal life, but honestly she has not really had good music choices in her heart. After Skyscraper, she has been trying to mostly be more like Beyonce' Knowles in her music and not being strong at her own voice. I found her last song Cool For The Summer to lag at the soul, and just feeling less than enticing than Heart Attack was. Her latest single, the song self-titled song from her third album Confident, tries to ignite from the heart, and sadly it doesn't work for her at all. I feel the song was even louder than her voice was shown at all. I think that Demi needs to show more sides of her, than just trying to stay the same way, because it has lagged in her work. Maybe she'll do better if she puts more diversity at her soul.  Song: D	-1

Whether it's by kicking a female fan at one of his concerts or admitting he's sleeping with his cousin, Baton Rouge rapper and Atlantic Records artist Kevin Gates (Kevin Gilyard) sure knows how to make himself look like a douchebag in the public eye. And for those two revelations to surface close to the release of Islah, his debut studio album, means an even more severe blow has been dealt to his likability and career-longevity. Gates has released several mixtapes since 2006, worked with many notables in the game and was inducted into XXL's 2014 Freshmen Class, something the popular hip-hop magazine might be regretting now. Islah (released Jan. 29) is just what you'd expect from Gates and nothing more, as he positions himself comfortably in the dual role of gangster and lover in this precisely unimpressive first major label LP of his.  Islah actually starts off decently, but it doesn't last long. Gates holds hip-hop's pupils' attention for the entirety of the first song, "Not The Only One," with its ordinary but nice low-key beat and the good kindhearted intentions of its contents, and Gates also has some solid flows in there, but after track's end, the ADD is likely to flare up for wildly anxious listeners. All of the rest of the album proceeds in the exact same predictable way, showcasing Gates as either a hard product of the trap or an experienced romantic, and he takes really no chances anywhere.  "Really Really" and "Two Phones" attempt to establish authenticity and rally up support for Gates's cause and brand, and "Pride" shows his softer side as he misses his ex-girlfriend and carries on in that way. He then goes back and forth between the streets and his relationships, song for song between the hood and his love life, the ghetto and the game of love. This two-way structure is pretty obvious to make note of if you map out the whole tracklist. Gates switches from one to the other so regularly that the pattern is really conspicuous, and the issue isn't necessarily in the skeleton or outline or the number of topics presented but rather in the nature of the topics. The sensationalization of the dangerous black "gutter" and emotionalized intersex relations are such trite rituals for rap in these times. Accurate reporting from real black communities is always useful, but here it's wickedly and exaggeratedly characterized and dramatized so that it's no longer in a useful context.  Bars-wise, Gates is up to snuff based on his prior standards, but lyrically he hasn't challenged himself. His scratchy low voice and occasionally funny side remarks and hooks are unmistakeable, but it's all in the service of his and his label's agenda and image-advancement. The music doesn't make a great impression or step forward either, and for all the different producers involved in making Islah, the beats all sound too similar, too consistent from one to the next, all using the current trap style or some pop variation, like in "Kno One," a universally appealable slow jam engineered for the people. And besides Trey Songz, Jamie Foxx and Ty Dolla $ign in the bonus "Jam," the non-deluxe version is completely guest-less. For a debut, Islah is disappointing, and considering who and where it's coming from, people shouldn't be surprised. Kevin Gates cares more about getting major "paper" in the game than being a major player in the game.	-1
This is not my type of musci was pruchased for someone as a gift	-1
This cd is terrible from start to finish, this just shows you that rap music is in a bad place right now.	-1
one of those  artists that had the goods,however he never got the goods. like that Pro Athlete who was top tier talent,however said person either never had the right coach,system or a complimentary teammate. this  album like so  many of his albums  feel like he outta be singing at a local Holiday Inn with a Lounge band. His  voice is  the truth, however the songs he  gets for the most part tend to lack any fire or substance or juice. he showed promise back in the 90's,however two decades later he settle on a formula and that got him over.	-1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
Fight song is a way better song. Glad she didn't come out with this one first.	-1
There is honestly so much that I can say about Beyonce' Knowles, but one thing is mostly clear, she is a product and not a real singer. When she made her surprise album in 2013, she unfortunate;y has lost her way, and became more like what Michael Jackson did with the publicity stunts for his career. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has became so severely overexposed, that she is more like a robot than  a actual songstress in voice at the heart of the matter. Well, for Naughty Boy, to make a collaboration with a product, it is very sad, because Beyonce' Knowles doesn't even light up a room anymore. Runnin' (Lose It All) with Beyonce' doesn't actually ignite at the soul, and instead feels weak at heart. I really found the song to be very weak from Naughty Boy. He and Beyonce' have sincerely no chemistry whatsoever. If he really is going to do another collaboration with her, he really is wasting her time.  Song: D	-1
Catchy song, but she's quite the despicable person isn't she. This is her attempt to address the allegations levied against her in Ed Sheeran's "Don't"? "You wanted my heart/But I like just liked your tattoos." Really? Well, if true, then it basically confirms everything Ed was saying and makes me dislike her cheating a$$ even more.	-1
I'm not going to lie to you: I didn't like Taylor Swift's 1989. I thought it was boring. I thought it was plain. I thought it was bland. So I might not be the right person to listen to about this record. I like Ryan Adams okay. He's written some really great songs. He's put out some really strong albums. I don't like everything he does (included but limited to his recent production work on Butch Walker's AFRAID OF GHOSTS) but I would say I enjoy more of his stuff than not. So when I heard that he was doing a track-by-track cover of Taylor Swift's immensely overrated 1989 I was a little intrigued. Especially when he was said to be doing so in the style of the Smiths. So when it hit Spotify I thought I would give it a chance to see if it was worth the purchase. I am glad I did so. Because these songs are still just not very good. Adams does a couple of interesting things here. But I still find the narrator of these songs incredibly out of date and incredibly out of step with the real world. The melodies never really take hold and it's kind of boring to listen to. Maybe as background music this works but it didn't command my attention. But a lot of people seem to like this version also. So I am just missing something. Because even in this context I find these songs on the weaker side of mediocre.	-1
I like most of Ryan Adams' music, and I'm a fan of his general style.  I think Taylor Swift is talented, but her music is simply not my thing and I'm certainly not her target demographic (my 13 year old daughter and wife think she's fantastic and sing her songs constantly).  I have listened to this album of covers by Ryan Adams, and  to my ears the songs don't translate into somber rock songs sung by a 40 year old male.  In fact, they sound like something you'd hear at a local bar by a cover band making a poor choice in attempting to please their audience.  These songs were written to be performed as polished pop songs, and, while it was a bold move by Ryan Adams to cover the collection is its entirety, I can't imagine this album being considered anything more than a eyebrow-raising novelty to be listened to once and set aside.  A couple of things I find interesting about this album:  1) It seems like dads and middle aged guys are ecstatic that one of their favorite musicians has covered chart topping favorites familiar to their daughters and wives.  As if, "finally we can both listen to these songs, but now in musical style I like".  They seem to think this will legitimize Ryan Adams, and perhaps his genre, to the younger generation and top 40 listeners.  2) Kids and top 40 listeners have absolutely no interest in hearing their favorite songs re-done by a 40 year old alt-country musician.  Think about when you were a kid. If you grew up in the 80's (like I did), were you clamoring to hear Cyndi Lauper songs reimagined by Eric Clapton?  Of course not, and today's kids are the same way.  To test this, put on "Bad Blood" as done by Ryan Adams (in a particularly embarrassing moment of this album) and see what your kids/neighbor/local Taylor Swift fan thinks.  I bet they don't say "turn it up".	-1
Awful material. Only like 3 songs, two of them being singles. She annoys me for some reason. Her singing is okay, nothing really fancy. I don't get the hype with her! Really I don't!!!   2 deserved stars.	-1
This is coming from an object reviewer and not a one direction super fan who thinks that every single song by them is amazing.  For me, this song was a complete miss. One Direction definitely has more potential than this song shows. The lyrics are unexciting and uninspiring. I feel like I have heard them a million times. It all just felt so unoriginal. I also did not like the general rhythm and sound of the song. I really do not think that this song should have been released as a single.	-1
I thought it didnt't sound as good without Zayne. It would be way better with Zayne in it.	-1
This isn't Jumpman!!! FAKE SONG	-1
"Writing's On The Wall" is not a bad song. It does have a good melody, but Sam Smith's vocal leaves much to be desired. His vocal is all wrong. Like I said, I like the melody, but not Sam Smith's vocal. Even some of the lyrics seem a bit forced.	-1
yet another attempt to regain their once great and powerful reputation with yet again new recruits for the band. well they fell very short  save your money	-1
I'm a die hard Megadeth fan, I even occasionally still listen to Risk but, what happened with Dystopia? Barring the Threat is Real, every song comes out of the gate like a race horse and crosses the finish line like a pack mule. I was eager to see what the new line up with Adler and Loureiro would sound like, what a let down. looks like it's Back to 13.	-1
JESUS is indeed the way Maker!!!!	-1
A typical kind of boring schlock that Tim McGraw puts out lately.  Hokey.	-1
Wow--22 five-star reviews so far, and one four-star.  The Train fans are out in full force, and quite early.  I'm really glad that I was able to stream this album first, because otherwise I would have felt completely ripped off.  All in all, while this isn't the worst Christmas album I've ever heard, it's certainly not all that good.  The vocals are all over the place--by the third song, I was hoping for a new vocalist to take over.  They seem to have been done rather quickly, with few if any retakes, and to be honest, I don't feel that the lead vocalist has the vocal qualities to maintain interest for more than ten or fifteen minutes, much less an entire album.  The music behind him is competent, of course, but nothing at all special--it, too, sounds like it was done rather quickly.  Christmas albums are often like that--groups don't spend nearly as much time rehearsing or recording them.  The bottom line is that for every standard on here, I have four of five versions that are much better than these.  For the new songs, there was nothing that made me take notice, nothing that I felt I really wanted to hear again.  It's a standard pop album, with somewhat Christmasy lyrics, and nothing special that I'll look forward to keeping.	-1
Worth the price I guess	-1

Sorry redman delivers a lackluster and just dreadful piece of work hopeful his muddy waters 2 will live up to the hype	-1
At forty-five, Redman (Reginald Noble) of Def Squad, Hit Squad and Red & Meth is much older than the new guard of hip-hop, but he doesn't sound like a wheezing, beleaguered old man at all. Some of his '90s-edge has escaped him, but for the most part, he still sounds like the same old Redman, except what relevance does he serve in today's growing and competitive rap landscape? His reputation would suggest that it's near impossible to picture the merry and mean emcee hopping on some erudite conscious tip, and that's exactly what he doesn't do on Mudface (Nov. 13), his eighth solo LP and his first album not on Def Jam Recordings. The followup to 2010's Reggie, Mudface is instead catered by Red's Gilla House Records, and it's obvious the Def Jam panache is missing. The hard truth is that though his veteran hall of fame status in the game is vaulted for good, he just isn't the hottest ticket in town anymore, and on top of that, on Mudface, he shows no new angles and just doesn't outdo himself.  Despite its too many shortcomings, Mudface does house the fun, wild unmediated jollies Redman has always been known to get his rocks off with, but now, name-dropping celebrities, referencing pop culture, partying in the club, smoking his grade A stash, and belting out a few namesake catchword anthems is not going to make the cut. The Gilla House posse song "Undeniable" is nice, but it's unlikely the beginning of a super group. "Bars" contains some of the best lyrics on the album, but Redman should have gone that hard lyrically on the rest of the tracks. What remains is medium well wordplay in flawless moderato obsequious to Redman's well established formula.  Sadly, the production is also poorly innovative, a music relic of Red's heyday that bypassed the necessary sound upgrades, giving us a trip back in time that we don't necessarily need. This is clean content compared to the controversial hip-hop material of the present, making Red an option for today's kids that parents might let slide. Redman pokes fun at enough new phenomena and landmark events that came about since Reggie to give Mudface an intriguingly current timeliness, and he will no doubt attract a few new fans, but in short, the album is short (thirteen tracks clocking in at thirty-four minutes) with fading fortunes, no surprises and no brilliant answer to the question, 'So what?' in regards to the purpose and importance of the album. Let's just hope Blackout 3 and Muddy Waters 2 actually come out, save the man's reputation and give him more of the respect he so deserves.	-1
I'd like to give a more in depth, track specific, review, but honestly I had such lack of motivation to listen to this that I've only heard it 3 or 4 times all the way through.  I tried a few others but could never make it through.  If you're looking for a Primal Fear album full of PF cliches, recycled riffs, recycled melodies and filler tracks which will have you running for albums like Jaws Of Death and Black Sun then this is for you.  NONE of these songs are worth being recorded.  Granted there isn't 1 terrible song on here but there isn't a single good song on here either, hence the 1 star rating.  It's all filler.  the last album was bad but at least there were 3 or 4 songs I really liked.  this one doesn't have any I can even remember except Rulebreaker which might be sadly the highlight.  It's probably good for a filler song but that's about it.  When they try to change things up they basically put movie trailer music as the intro to an overly long song "We Walk Without Fear" and call that progress.  I mean seriously I expected to hear the movie trailer guy talking over it saying things like "Coming..  July.. 31st..  Get.. Ready..  For..  Action" followed by a list of actors or some variation.  I don't think they do those trailers anymore actually.  I'm not saying Primal Fear needs to be anything other than what they are.  Sure some experimentation would be nice, but they don't have to stop being a power metal band or anything, but they need to stop using the same riffs, melodies, and drum beats and try to write something that's actually good.  But this will please the people who only want the same stuff over and over and don't care if a band puts effort into creating a good album or releases another stale boring release.  I like these guys I really do.  I like most songs on all of their albums from the self titled through Unbreakable, but I feel they've gotten too comfortable and no one, no producers and certainly not the fans, are pushing them to do better.	-1
Usually Adele does just fine with her music.  Even if it's a song that you don't particularly gravitate towards, you can acknowledge that it is a well-crafted song.  Unfortunately, her song "Send My Love" is not one of those songs.  It is the prime example of all that is wrong with her latest album "25".  The entire album is lyrically and musically lazy.  It tries to coast on the strength of Adele's stellar voice.  It offers nothing else (certainly not the way "19" and "21" provided sharp song-writing and musical arrangements)    "Send My Love" has several things working against it.  First, it is part of the mediocre "25".  Second, it has been so badly overplayed on commercial radio (well beyond how much "Hello" was played) that even the song's biggest fans or totally sick of it.  Finally, it is just an irritating song.  It has been described a peppier version of Adele's 'bashing her ex' songs.  At this point (3 albums worth), Adele repeatedly bashing her ex in song has gotten quite tiresome.  Make one of those songs with a more energetic musical sound is just obnoxious.	-1

This song is horrible. I like Adele, bought her last album, but this song is so repetitive and sounds like every other song she's made in the past except just the choruses of those songs repeated back to back leading to a song that's filled with nothing but screeching nonstop trying to sound talented but instead coming off as very conceited. Trying to show off your vocal range just screaming is not talent.	-1

It is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent, can really make terrible music. Unfortunately, Arianda Grande has been one of those singers that has made some lackluster songs that really have made her sound more cheap than beautiful and sophisticated. I found her song Bang Bang with Nicki Minaj and other awhile back, to be more sloppy than a sense of real talent at the core of the matter. I really felt she could deliver better. Her latest song Focus, is honestly one of those that really shows she has not delivered better at the soul. She really made a song that really says, "I am catering to a young audience and not branching out to where I can do better for everyone." I personally feel that Arianda can do much better, and she has not been able to do so. Hopefully, her next set of songs can really bring out the soul in her heart. Maybe then, she can focus much better.  Song: D	-1
Awful. Simple chorus, male rap verse, nothing new to see here, move on.	-1
Jamie Foxx ruins this song, in my opinion. If the chorus were to be completely different, this song would be a lot better. However, the entire song sounds nearly IDENTICAL to "Problem". I actually starting singing "head in the clouds, got no..." by accident and had to stop myself because the bridge to this song sounds exactly the same as the bridge in "Problem".  I really like Ariana so I hope her next single is better.	-1

It bothers me that the name Last in Line is used here.. I remember seeing an interview of the newest (at the time) Leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss. Sure we are entitled to forgiveness, but it bother me Ronnie went to his grave despising VC and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory...after RJD has passed no less.  Onto the music. The vocals are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire..he reminds of a better contestant on American Idol. Vivian of coarse rocks but I question the bland guitar amp sound, just doesn't have any punch. Everything else is just by the numbers.  For a band that has taken such an amazing album and title as its name sake they just don't even begin to break new ground, do nothing special with it, and just generally disappoints on every level Ronnie excelled in.  ""this time they called in vocalist Andrew Freeman, a guy who has the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the Dio band."" What a joke.	-1
I don't like it	-1
Too  much gayest in this Cd for me	-1
I don't expect Dream Theater to make another great album like WDADU, Images and Words, or Awake. But I do expect them to sound like a talented band with a great chemistry, energy, and creative edge. The Astonishing sounds like a bunch of burned out musicians laying down some tracks over a early 90's Boss drum machine...Maybe next time	-1
To Bad I cant get my money back or at least credit	-1
This album is getting tons of hate, but also there are a few people that enjoy this disc (or discs). I'm one of the people that isn't really into this album all of that much. Too many forgettable songs. I think albums like "Octavarium" are better than this.  Rating: 60/100	-1
A review in 3 parts:  Part I: Dream Theater has put out concept albums before.  Theyve put out double and triple albums.  They are a well-known and well-regarded group of gifted musicians with backing deals and monetary funds to help them put out products of excellence and ambition that lesser known bands simply cant compete against.  So then how can they put out a conceptual double album that fizzles out practically before it even gets started?  One of my favorite bands, a small little independent group called The Violet Burning, with a pittance of a following put out a conceptual triple album a few years ago (around the time that Green Day got some mild publicity for releasing three albums in three months if I recall correctly) that blew my socks off.  How could they pull that feat off but Dream Theater put out a wishy washy (dare I say wimpy) piece of fluff like this?  It boggles my mind.  I expect so so so much more from them.  Theyve got such a great catalog!  But not this.  Part II: The Astonishing is musically mild.  It is rarely heavy and hardly ever muscular.  Its melodies are underwhelming.  Youll find ambient and future-computer-code sounds, which are perhaps the most musically interesting tracks on the album, sprinkled throughout.  Youll hear a song that starts out like a Christmas tune (Im not kiddingcheck out A Savior In the Square) and I even had a moment listening to one of the tracks that made me recall The Carpenters of all bands!  What is this!?!  Dream Theater has thrown their chops around with ballads and even some close-to-standard rock songs but they usually stay close to the progressive metal sphere and love to let their collective hair down on epic tracks that take their time and take the listener on an adventure.  Theyve eschewed all of that this time around in favor of a wealth of short to average length songs that allow keyboard concepts to mostly take the leads.  Sure the guitar is there but it is almost always playing second fiddle to other elements of the song, or providing an additional melody.  If there are wild drum and bass excursions then Ive missed them amidst all of the songs trying to bewell, songs, that all add up to a story.  A hackneyed, dystopian future where a musical genius can be the savior story.  The packaging is pretty!  The interior booklet has some nice art in it!  But that cant make me like these songs.  There are a couple that pass muster but theres nothing that is anywhere near the greatness that Dream Theater can achieve.  I enjoy the feel good arena rockish anthem Our New World.  LaBrie sounds pretty good there and its rousing, but theres little else that generates serious interest.  Part III: Concepts albums may be harder to pull off than a regular release but in the end, just like regular releases, they have just as good a chance to be cool or to suck.  This one sucks.  It doesnt suck because of the production.  Productions fine, sound levels are paid attention to, arrangements while lacking the usual DT dynamic are still tight, and the musicianship is fine.  But it sucks because its boring.  And the story is linear, obvious, surface, and just boring.  Sure there are other concept albums that fail (check out, or better yet dont, P.O.D.s The Awakening) but there have been so many great ones.  DT has a few of their own with Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence being at the top of my list.  But what this album needed this time around to really help it out was different voices.  LaBrie carries the vocals and speaks for many different characters and because he cant make them distinct characters via his own voice he ends up hurting this release (it still wouldnt have been great even if they used other vocalists though).  I wonder if he remembered working on Ayreons The Human Equation and heard that fantastic end product, carried through by a variety of singers, to work out its concept exquisitely?  Did he ever think of doing the same?  Well never know.  Best to put this one behind us and move on.  When all is said and done one can listen to the album and not hate it.  You can find some different points of interest.  But I think that, as a whole, you're hard pressed to find that you enjoy the entirety.  I think most Dream Theater fans will be mightily disappointed and I don't see this making many new fans.  Not even of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Vanden Plas and others who play up offerings similar to this.  They at least do them up pretty well.  I want DT to go back and play their long songs.  2.5 stars of disappointment.	-1
currently my LEAST favorite DT album they've done......there's  maybe 1 or 2 tracks that catch my ear but that's it. was really hoping for a 'studio' album not a 2cd concept album, even before the first listen i knew what it was going to be like. I'm going to see them live in support of this album so maybe i'll have a different opinion after that.	-1
this really is a beautiful album, and i bet if my mom listened to it, she'd love it.  it's full of piano parts and soft lyrics and it feels like 95% of the songs are slow ballads.  great music to fall asleep to.  i'm not even going to criticize the album for its numerous faults, but if you want to hear a progressive rock album from dream theater, then avoid this one at all costs.  i listened to a handful of the samples on amazon and thought it sounded okay, but i honestly regret buying it.	-1
After about 1/2 hour in to this spectacle I began to wonder about the new drummer,  Mike M. and if he feels that he might suffer from 'Newsted ' syndrome;  meaning that as soon as he joins the band of his dreams he gets a decent album to show his talents at first but then the band starts to move in a different direction then what he might have hoped. This double album has none of the classic DT features: endless sweeping guitar solos,  unfathomable drum playing, and song length of epic proportions. Most is mid paced music with an occasional heavy song or guitar solo. Otherwise it's Labrie taking center stage and I don't really think so much mediocre lyrics and solo type of singing will appease the die hard fan. I've listened to this a few times and to me it just sounds like an attempt that didn't quite work or hold any interest. Not much memorable in this one.	-1
Perhaps their worst album yet. Someone needs to tell these guys to lose this rock opera and concept album idea. This is the same band that created the masterpieces Images and Words, and Awake, some of my favorite albums of all time. I understand their glory days are far behind them but they've since gone on to write some of the most soulless prog rock and metal out there. Where has the good quality songwriting gone? What's with the bad production on this album? These guys are acting more like prog amateurs instead of the veterans that they are. They either  need to lose this homage/tribute rock opera junk and get back to writing original quality albums, or hang it up. They're borrowing so much from bands like Rush, Pink Floyd, Queen, and they're not even doing it that well. Where's the heart and soul on this thing? I can't even bring myself to finish this. DT have gotten much much worse since Octavarium and I'm sorry to have to say so because I really don't like to see this. Their last 4 albums or so are just mediocre and forgettable. The Astonishing has a lot of the same problems of those past albums, but on top of that, it over stays it's welcome.	-1
With "The Atonishing" I was intrigued, what I'd read about it made it sound quite interesting. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but the album is really tough to sit through. Instead it's a great album to put on if you want to fall asleep. The album just sort of slowly moves along, there are some decent tracks, but you have to wade through a lot of mediocre tracks to find them. Musically it's all over the place with several different styles being heard. This probably would have a been a decent single disc album. On the whole, it reminds me a lot of the KISS album "Music From The Elder", which isn't a bad album, but it is a cruddy KISS album.  In a nutshell, there's a lot of story and music on "The Astonishing". It's an album that requires a lot of the listener. At 2 1/2 hours it's not an album that will get a lot of repeated play.	-1
I was really excited for this album.  After the self titled album I thought they'd found their way, but I was wrong. this sounds like a more piano driven version of something Geoff Tate would do except his vocals would be awful.  It has all the trademarks of his work over the past decade and a half; a bunch of ballads, slow uninteresting and forgettable music, no hooks, no particular tone nor emotional connection to the listener, no consideration as to what the fans would want to hear, bad lyrics.  I may be forgetting something but you get the idea.  Ok so what's wrong with this album?  Well for starters there's NOTHING memorable about this album.  It's seriously painful to try to listen to front to back when there's absolutely nothing catching my attention.  There are a bleep ton of ballads.  The album has to be a minimum of half ballads if not more.  Now look Dream Theater has some amazing ballads in their catalog, usually an exception rather than the rule especially once Kevin More left but still they've had some amazing ones, but none of these are on the same level as any of those classic songs and frankly they haven't written a great ballad in a long time, a couple decent ones over the past decade but none have been great.  Then there's the whole rock opera thing.  I guess that's a genre some people like but I absolutely hate it, though in fairness this is my first and it's exactly what I think of when I hear the term.  Another reviewer already stated some of this music sounds like Disney music and it so does especially the overly bubbly happy chorus to one of the few semi better constructed songs on disc 1, towards the end but I forget its name.  What happened to the song structures?  Dream Theater use to be a band that would give you an album of 7 to 9 songs clocking in at about 75 minutes.  I'll admit some of those songs could use some trimming especially on Train of Thought, but that's the style most fans have gotten use to, and there'd be something incredible on every album.  Not here.  We get a bunch of 3 and 4 minute, at most, songs with several 1 and 2 minute tracks thrown in there, and they don't even construct them properly.  Take a 3 1/2 minute song they'll have a 1 1/2 minute intro and leave about 2 minutes to dedicate to the actual song, if it ever gets going.  This album is also a heavily Jordan featured album.  I've said it before he's the worst thing to ever happen to Dream Theater.  I hate the man as a musician with everything that I am.  I'm tired of his circus music, boring piano pieces and nonsensical and unnecessary contributions to the band.  He was fine on Scenes from a Memory and hit and miss on 6 Degrees but he's been awful ever since.  I really hope these guys don't become the new 1999-2012 Queensryche cause while I enjoyed making fun of them it really came from a place of sadness, witnessing a once great band become a waste of anything involved in the making, producing and listening to  of any of their albums. I don't want that to become these guys.  Already this is the worst album of 2016 for me.  I don't care what else is released.  Already this year we've had albums by Megadeth-a good album, and Primal Fear-so so but better than this.  This thing is seriously so bad I listened to Kiss after, mother you know what KISS!!  That's how terible this is that anything Kiss has ever done, even their most silly cheesy uninteresting or over the top song is still better than this trash.  I would rather listen to In Flames's Siren Charms.  Yes it's an awful attempt at mainstream radio rock from a band that shouldn't attempt it but it had 2 good songs and wasn't 2 discs and over 30 tracks.  heck the bonus tracks were even ok.  Heck I'd rather listen to Q2k, Mindcrime 2, and American Soldier many times over before hearing this again.  Heck even Dedicated to chaos had 1 ok song.  There's absolutely nothing on here that's any good.  3 songs; A Better Life, A Life Left Behind and Moment Of Betrayal are ok as in if they were the weakest songs on an album of actual good songs they'd be worth listening enough that you wouldn't need to skip them.  Oh and this is really a John Petrucci solo album not a Dream Theater album, much like Q2k-Dedicated to chaos are Geoff Tate solo albums.  this isn't good and no one should ever have this in their collection for nay reason EVER.  But listen to it before you buy it. If you like it then by all means get it but be sure to listen to the whole thing first.  Oh and Def Leppard's self titled album is also better which is just sad.  If you want a good prog metal album pick up anything by Symphony X especially their 2 most recent albums.  Now that's a band that can show off their talent and write good songs.  In closing this album makes me angry.  It shouldn't I suppose but it does.  This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard a band I like put out and I won't support this garbage.	-1
It is too bad that when SINGERS eventually cover the recent music of Lucinda Williams they will have better sounding versions than do the originals as 'sung' by Lucinda.  I have no idea why she has chosen to slur and mumble through her songs, but she has and her vocals make the songs not worthy of listening to them.  The instrumental portion of LW's music is great, but her vocals keep me from buying this crap.  Bob Dylan's voice sucks donkey dongs. So, it is not hard to understand why he sings the way he does.  On the other hand, Lucinda has (at least she used to have) a very good voice and why she would record her vocals as she does is beyond me.  I suppose it's because some worshipers still buy this drivel.	-1
Lucinda sounds appropriately sedated or intoxicated....thru most of these vocals.....I am really trying to find some deep down poignant  original songs cutting to the heart...but frankly these are mostly retreads from earlier efforts....For me her last great album was West....since then we really get a mixed bag often uninspired, often shadows of greater performances and songs.....However her version of the Woody Guthrie's song  is illuminating....so in sum this is just another ho hum effort....too bad....	-1
I am in a charitable mood so I give it 2 stars. It sounds to me like someone is singing and moaning from the grave. Lucy needs some vitamins, coffee and some serious umph.  Not much here IMO.	-1
I think I'm giving up on Lucinda Williams.  With her first, I dunno, six albums, she pretty much hit it out of the park. With her next 2-3, she was ok and the disks grew on me. But with 2008's 'Little Honey' it kind of all went south for me. She somewhat - kind of - redeemed herself with her 2014 release, but a Williams album, to me, should be more than just halfway passable.  I have zero qualms with the musicianship on 'the Ghosts of Highway 20'.  The musicians are great. For g-d's sake, she has Bill Frisell and Greg Leisz on guitars. Not too shabby.  The songwriting seems ok. Not Williams-stellar, but certainly not bad either.  But like the last few disks, it's Lucinda's voice, or lack thereof, that drags the songs down. The gravel, or singing with a mouthful of broken marbles makes Marianne Faithful (circa 1979) sound like sweetest voiced angel ever.  And it's not that Williams should have the perfect voice - that's not her style, it never was - but if you compare, not even her early work, but the could have been / should have been great 'West' and the iffy 'Blessed' in comparison she could give diction lessons then.  Perhaps she has a vocal cord issue. If so, she should get a vocal coach and do some exercises. If she's purposefully trying to sound like this, then the end-result is lost on me.  I get her "true fans" would rip me apart for a review like this. But I own every disk she's ever released. Just because you like an artist doesn't mean they get a free pass for putting out subpar albums.  The bigger question is if I will just buy her next disk blindly.	-1
Ever since she & Gurf Morlix split, Lucinda Williams' music has ranged between pretty good & simply awful. This album seems to have some pretty decent tunes, but trying to get to them through the I've-got-gravel-in-my-mouth vocals is not worth the effort. KGO said it very well in an earlier two-star review: "Her delivery on Ghosts is minimalist slow dreary sluggish and sometimes vocally slurred"  Now, I need to prepare to be shouted down by all the LW fans who will tell me I just don't understand, and that everything LW does is a masterpiece.	-1
This group has to find a lead singer. It's like they all shy away from the mic when it's there turn...some one needs to step up or something. I heard no Beyonce or Kelly in this group...just a bunch of Michelles. The only standouts are "Carry On" an "Hey"{e mix}.That girl group B.O.Y {Be Only You} sounds waaayyy! better then this girl group King.	-1
Nice jodeci sound at first but this album is still weak. Nice first verse on "She With The S..." and "#Born Day" is a good club banger.	-1
Shame on me for ignoring the 19 (1) comments and being swayed by the 259 (5) comments.  I am totally nonplussed how 259 reviewers could give this product a 5 rating.  Please consider another source if you expect to listed to the nostalgic Beatles songs listed in the Amazon product description.  This is not a true audio CD or at least it does not perform like one.  Grassroots Books should have included appropriate caveats regarding this type CD media.  Other than that I agree with most of the negative reviews already posted for Grassroots CDs.	-1
This CD is not the same album I owned on vinyl or audiocassette. The original American HELP! album was both a Beatles album and a Soundtrack album. What happened to the instrumental tracks that Ken Thorne composed?  Those great instrumental tracks that were on the LP are missing? One of the central plot elements of HELP! was the satirical slant spoofing the James Bond-Spy phenomenon of that period! The music that Ken Thorne composed or adapted is now missing. The Beatles' songs interlaced with Thorne's instrumentals made for a great musical experience from the film. I objectively can only rate this based on the absence of this fantastically nostalgic material. This cover is not as good as the original in my opinion. The original was more intricate and detailed and was truly more a product of the film and the times. ....	-1
After the first two tracks, the album got completely uninteresting. I tried to like the album and got curious after hearing ''In Our Dreams'' but it just wasn't enough after that for me.	-1
I agree with the previous post. These three mixes should have been available on the cd version. The Offer Nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there. It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette forms. A Cloud in a Box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour. Say It To Me Stuart Price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there. It is the second-best version of all the remixes.	-1
I am a 3 Doors Down fan, but I didn't like this album.  It seems like they have tried to go another route, or are tired of each other, or who knows why they changed their sound, but the songs have lost that rock edge that I've loved so much in so much of their other music.  I know that most people prefer the pop-ish songs like Kryptonite, but for me I love songs like Down Poison, which have a distinctively darker edge.  This album is missing that.  If you like the pop-ish songs you might like this album, but if you don't I wouldn't get it.	-1
Man, 5 years waiting for this? A lot of people proclaim this as being a ''comeback'' to their roots but for me, it ain't even close. This album for me doesn't even come close to their last album, in fact, their self titled album was much better than this. I honestly thought this was generic at best, nothing like they have released before. The opener wasn't even an energetic track like ''Time of My Life, Train, Right Where I Belong, etc''  This for me is a sad wait for a band I had high hopes in coming back strong after losing Henderson and Harrell. Every band is entitled to have a bad album, this one for me is 3DD's album.	-1
If I ever hear this song on the radio again by the time I get out of bed ? I turn the alarm clock off so I won't have to hear this awful singer. Isn't her 15 minutes up by now ?	-1
This year has really been with awful music that has really not came from the heart. Nicki Minaj has honestly been one of the worst artists to have ever came out with good music. She has really shown no such diversity in her voice to really be for all artists. Her latest single Pound The Alarm from her album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded is really bad. She really hasn't changed her sound and flexed her vocal muscles in song. It feels like the exact same "I have to prove that I am the best" sound that she came out with before. I think the song is definitely one of the worst songs that has ever been released this year. Hopefully, Nicki will start growing up and then make better music. But overall, that is not going to happen for awhile.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Nicki Minaj, she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing, but drive in good songs either. Pound Te Alarm, the latest single from Nicki's album Roman Reloaded isn't really a driven song. It feels very weak and not exciting. She really doesn't have something that makes her driven in her voice. She really has shown that she doesn't have the talent in her voice. It feels more like what she tried to prove with starships earlier this year, it feels like it was honestly wasted away. Well, it won't happen with her next single either. Maybe she should find a new change of pace for herself. Something else that would make you pound the alarm.  Song: D-	-1
So ... when did you come of age with Iggy Pop?  Did your ears first meet Iggy in 1969 as I did, was it 1973, or was it in 1977, when a song about a passenger sent your fingers rushing to dial the radio station to see who was singing.  Ive lived nearly my whole life with Iggy, Ive lived nearly my whole life attempting to like his music, his theater, his character, and his vision.  Yet after all this time I still find Iggy Pop to be nothing more than a novelty, with a mere handful of songs that I enjoy.  So why in the world would I think that Post Pop Depression, especially claiming it as his swan song, complete with Queens of the Stone Age in tow, would be any more, or any different.  People would like to tell you that theres something raw and hedonistic about Iggy Pop, and for mere moments thats true ... but those moments come on fast and and are just as fleeting.  Here we are, stepping into the 21st century, and Iggy Pop is attempting to doing the same old shtick he did in the latter half of the 20th century, and doing it not nearly as well.  Post Pop Depression is not something I even care about, much less hold dear to my heart, praising the powers that be, thrilled and saddened in the same moment that Im holding a new Iggy Pop album in my hands, and knowing it will be the last.  Most music rags are afraid to tell you they don't like the album for whatever reason ... but Im not.  MOJO gave it page after page and talked only about the secret nature of the release and Iggys Rolls Royce.  Rolling Stone talked endlessly about the old Iggy and his emergence with the Stooges.  Iggy tells us that he likes the songs, and so do some of his friends; though he says it in a less than convincing manner.  Make no mistake about it, Post Pop Depression is not bad because its the music of an old man, its also not bad because of its association with Queens of the Stone Age ... its just bad because its a grouping of songs presented in a manner thats irrelevant.  If Iggy had one thing going for him, it was that he was a one trick pony and you always knew what you were gonna get.  But this, this is Iggy trying to be relevant, and failing utterly.  He might have well recorded with Primal Scream, they couldn't have helped him make it any worse.  The album has a feel of desperation laced with incomplete thoughts, structured to guide the listener nowhere.  This is not punk, this is not 21st century punk, this is frustrating musical purgatory that will not last for more than one or two playings ... truly post Pop depression.  Here we find Iggy Pop making the rounds with Josh Homme, each hoping to gain some credibility from the other, just as Iggy so transparently did with Lou Reed, David Bowie, and a host of others.  Theres no search and destroy here, theres also no psych punk Queens of the Stone Age ear splitting anthems, its all slightly affected nervous energy, injected with a spirit that belays the end of a roller coaster ride ... no hills, no downward plunges or sharp curves, just the jittery end of the ride stop and dis-embarkment.  Review by Jenell Kesler	-1
deftones need to call it quits. the gore I a hit and miss big time. their last good work white poney RAP METAL & NU METAL was cool.	-1
With the way music has gone from good to embarrassingly bad lately, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that even Deftones has lost its edge. This is not a bad album, but it's not great either. Does anybody remember Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure? If you do, you probably remember Wyld Stallions, and how the music of Bill and Ted restored peace and reset Nature's balance around the globe. Well, it feels like that's what Deftones are ATTEMPTING to do with Gore. It's a collection of eleven tracks that are neither metal nor rock nor ambient. They're eleven average songs trying too hard to restore peace and reset Nature's balance around the globe. None of these tracks stand out. They all just kind of start and end and blend from one to the next. This is one of my favorite bands, but this is definitely my least favorite album they've released since their inception well over a decade ago. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I can only hope future efforts find these guys on top of their game again.	-1
What happened to this band.  Diamond eyes was incredible beyond words. KNY was pretty decent for the most part and now we have gore. The album should have been called Meh, because that's how I feel about most of the songs.  Besides the excellent, beautiful and passionate Phantom Bride and prayers/triangles, This album SUCKS. Its just random noise, inconsistent and unfocused. The song writing is weak and sloppy. This is very disappointing as Deftones are one of my favorite bands and I was really looking forward to this album, but I have to call a spade a spade.  Avoid this album. Go with Diamond eyes, White pony or around the fur first.	-1
I liked the first one better more hit's this one not so much.	-1
It wasn't that good	-1
It is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone whom has became a product, not a real singer has made more songs that make them just tiresome and more annoying at the soul. Tragically, Rihanna has been one of those singers that really has been more of a product, not from the soul, just overexposed with each and every song she has came out with. Unfortunately, with all the songs that she had came out with, setting up her Anti album, has been poor and lagging at her soul. Her prior single, Work showed again her own voice losing steam, and feeling weak and like is on drugs, during her song. Kiss It Better is also a bleak waste of time. She doesn't deliver a more seductive performance in the heart, and makes the listener feel like they have not been seduced and enchanted from each not sung. It is just a loss at the heart. I definitely think it is time for Rihanna to just retire alone. Perhaps when she walks away, if she walks away, she'll find better on the other side to make it kissed better.  Song: D	-1
I have been honestly very tired of Rihanna making very poor choices in her own sound, and her music. She has really wasted her own talents, and her own time in finding less than the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Unfortunately, the time that she made coming into her Anti album, was not even close to what she could've done. When I first heard her song Work with Drake, I really continued to recognize that was tired in her own voice, and felt choppy and cheap at the soul. Her second single from her Anti album continues to show that she is trying to be sexier in her sound, but she is not at all. Kiss It Better, tries to throwback into the sexy R&B sound of the 90's in seduction, but sad the seduction is not a sound that has hit very hard. I really didn't find this song to really show she was bigger in her sound, and just not showing that she could make better than before. Perhaps Rihanna should retire and walk away. She hasn't kissed it better, she just made the kiss turn the other cheek.  Song: D-	-1
It is absolutely sad that whenever someone whom is young and talented, has thrown their voice away, by not finding better in her own works. Rihanna, has really made some of the worst songs from the past few years. With all the works setup for her Anti album, she really didn't put patience in her songs, to really find better. In fact, she really had found worse from her music. The past several songs she came out with, were planned for R* and then Anti, but overall songs like Four Five Seconds, B&&&& Better Have My Money, and American Oxygen, could've been released on the album, but they have not overall. Her lead single, Work with Drake really was terrible, and she only showed that her vocals were tired and sincerely choppy, possibly using drugs. Kiss It Better, the second single from Anti doesn't ignite either. She tries to show her sex appeal, but instead falls short of where her work should really be. Perhaps Rihanna should retire from music, after her latest set of songs just like before, sees her falling from the waste side.  Song: D-	-1
It is honestly and absolutely sad when someone young and talented has thrown their voice away. Unfortunately Rihanna has been one of those singers that has been more of a product, than a real singer. The past few years have shown a lag in better music from her, after the wasted time prepping for her Anti album. The set of songs that she had came out the past few years like B&&&& Better Have My Money and American Oxygen, were overall not included on the final product which became Anti, and for her lead single from Anti, Work with Drake, Rihanna had sounded more like she was high on drugs, than made a solid song because she really felt more tired and choppy in her work. Now for her second single, Kiss It Better, she is trying to be more of a sex symbol in her song, and sadly she doesn't pull it off. I really wasn't impressed at all. After she tried to make a better song, where she sounded weak, and now she is trying to be a sex symbol, and she doesn't pull it off. I think Rihanna needs to find much better in her work, and take a long break from singing, to find herself all over, because she hasn't yet kissed it better.  Song: D	-1
It is absolutely so sad that whenever someone is talented and tortured doesn't even make really good music that sounds different from what they did before, and the different music that the artist makes, is cheaper from the voice within. It is sad that someone like Rihanna, doesn't deliver with her own work anymore. It is sad that she put all the effort into making the songs for her Anti album, and she hasn't been able to win over new fans from beginning to the end. When I first heard Work, not only was I unimpressed, I really felt her own voice was tired and felt less authentic than before. Kiss It Better, her second track from Anti didn't fair better. Needed Me, the third single from Anti is one song that showed she was trying to be more aggressive in sound, but instead, she just falls back much further along the line. She didn't bring out anything new into the song, and instead Rihanna just misses that songbird mark yet all over again. Perhaps, it is time for Rihanna to just retire. Because we don't need another wannabe.  Song: D	-1
It is absolutely so sad that a artist can push the envelope so much, that they are just so tiring and more annoying in their music. Tragically, Rihanna is one of those artists that really made their own sound so severely overexposed, that Rihanna has now been more of a product, and less of a songstress on the inside. With all the hype that she had put out for her Anti album, she really has felt more like a whimper, and more of a joke of herself. When I first heard Work, I not only thought the song was poor in her voice, where she sounded tired and choppy, or someone who was experimenting on drugs, but she really doesn't have anywhere else to go, to find better inspiration that just go on replay with the same sounds over and over again. Kiss It Better was no better, and that also goes with Needed Me, the third single from the Anti album. I definitely found the song to be one step back from her earlier, earlier work like S.O.S., and Umbrella. She really didn't even come close to where she could ignite beyond aflame, and instead saw afire get dowsed into small ashes of the soul. I really found the song to be a waste of time, and on the ears. Perhaps, Rihanna should just go off and retire, because her sound is sincerely short of being needed.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
There is a difference between a songstress and a product. Unfortunately, it has been a decade since Rihanna had made it on the music scene, and she has been more of a product, not a real singer. Sadly, she has not really been someone whom has made the music of our times, as would be the case with acts like Taylor Swift. Sadly, the hype that she really made to get into her album Anti, has been all hype and absolutely no heart whatsoever. The songs that she came out with the past few years like B&&&& Better Have My Money, and Work just shows that she is more tired and less appealing in her own music each time. Her latest single from her Anti album, Needed Me is definitely another sour note in her work that has been more tired and choppy. She really hasn't found better in her voice, and definitely made another song that really sounds more like she is a product, not someone who's music is infinite like she wants it to be. Perhaps many die hard fans will go back to Umbrella, when she really had became popular.  Song: D-	-1
It is absolutely so sad that Rihanna has been a poor role model in her music, and her own status as a diva, by not only making very poor choices with her own music, but lately she has been sounding more tired and choppy with her music, and a bit more angry in her own work. When I first heard her song Work from her Anti record, I found that her own work was really a waste of time overall, and not even close to the voice that she could be and is not. Her latest song, Needed Me, follows in the very bad slide in her own work with songs like B&&&& Better Have My Money, and Kiss It Better. Overall, I really found the song to be short, and Rihanna had not been able to sound more like a siren, and instead just crashed and burned in the fire. She also sounded more like she was swearing and not showing more of her vocals. Personally, I did not like the song, and this song is not a must download, even for the hardest-cored Rihanna fans.

This is not the song that I wanted, so I can't write a good review for it.	-1
ILLUMINATI PUPPET!!!	-1
I hope there is more coming because in my honest opinion, this is Rihanna's worst piece of work to date.  It's not a HORRIBLE album overall, but where are the hits? I can almost guarantee not one song off this album will be a #1. Not to mention the majority of these songs are only 1-2 minutes long...this is what we waited 3-4 years for, Rihanna??  I've listened to the entire album numerous times, and there are only about 4 songs that truly stand out to me: - Work - Needed Me - Love On The Brain - Pose	-1
You have all types of fans -"the extremist "who think everything and anything she makes is a master piece ,everything is wonderful and if you dare giving it a personal critic they will come down on you hard saying you are a hater -"the true hater "who are the complete reverse. They hate everything and will go down hard after those "extreme fans" - the"regular" fans , the ones who enjoy her voices, her work , her performances , her lives , her energy . Like some dislike some . Just because someone doesn't like it all doesn't mean they aren't true fans . We all support riri in our own ways.  Music is very subjective. We all have different taste . There is no need for all the rudeness here .  I m a "regular fan" of Rihanna . I love her energy. I love her voice and let's say it ,this girl is drop dead gorgeous and have a stunning body. At 28 years old she looks more beautiful than ever . She is also very talented , an amazing dancer ( also amazing twerker) and has a truly beautiful voice . I ve been a fan of Rihanna since her debut and been listing to her music , going to her lives since than .  Sadly this is the one album from Rihanna i simply can't stand . TO ME  it felt more weak than her past albums ( maybe because i m used to her "older "stuff) The music , the vibe was very slow and it felt like 16 tracks was simply unnecessary .  I was expecting something with more beat .  I am unsure if this album will be a turn in her career and she is trying to change from her "classic style" / rihanna signature  or if she is simply experimenting something new. Also unsure if she put something out there because her contract said she had to . To me it simply lacked rihanna imprint on it  This album is a hit or miss depending the person. It at the complete oppositite of her past songs , music , vibes and style. I m glad some people enjoy it . I personally didn't . Its the first album i won't be listing to again .	-1
Be warned  she went creative #pose #7 #iscreative . I first had 4 stars but went to two lol	-1
The original of a song is usually better than any subsequent attempt by others to do the same track-- and that's definitely true for this song. To each their own opinion, but Thomas Rhett did this song perfectly. Nelly has some songs of his own that are ok, but he needs to stay out of country and do an original song of his own.	-1
The album before this was fire, not crazy about this one	-1
This is a disappointing CD.  After watching the show last season, there were several times that I was astounded by what I heard from Jordan.  This CD sounds like it was made in a couple hours.  The recording/production value is very poor.  The songs are bland and generic.  I purchased this without hearing it and I will not do that again.	-1
Cheap Thrills is a cheap song that only hit #1 because her label and/or Sia were so thirsty for a #1 hit that they had it discounted to 69cents for like 6 months and added Sean Paul to the remix to give Sia that "hip factor." Notice that the song was gaining no traction whatsoever back in February, when it was first announced as a single and the remix was first released. Then, the discount pricing took effect around March, and suddenly people had an interest in the song. Coincidence? I think not.	-1
I'm not loving her singing voice...no big deal cuz I said the same thing about Rochelle Jordan 1021 album. But RoJo got a 5 rating because she still manage to make good music. I can't say the same about this "Whispers" album. I honestly do not have a favorite song on here.	-1
This is not my type of musci was pruchased for someone as a gift	-1
This cd is terrible from start to finish, this just shows you that rap music is in a bad place right now.	-1
This album is a major disappointment for me. M83 decided to move away from the style of the previous album and that direction they chose unfortunately is very cheesy and pop.	-1
I have rarely been so disappointed in an album. The title is apropos - a lot of junk tracks - whereas that first album I found to be brilliant. This sounds like it's done by someone who has lost his vision or nerve and decided to stop sounding unique and join the crowd of sound alike whiney pablum that too often passes for pop and rock these days. Better luck next time, guys.	-1
Yup. It's JUNK. Like all smart people know. He's run out of ideas. Not a true lone artist. Needs help. Need to bring in a partner again and go back to what made M83 amazing in the first place. No need for singing. No need for pretentious self-indulgent live shows. This new high-pitched elevator music crap trying to be trendy is so tired and boring. And no, Anthony, you can't sing, so stop trying, stop pretending. Go back to smart, coordinated effects-laden atmospheric synth and call it a day. This one is as unlistenable as the last two. I'll go back to the first 3 albums and enjoy those instead.  You lost	-1
Honestly, I am very upset at how very poor many girl groups have came together and lagged on the chemistry their voices have shown at the soul overall. It is just too sad that they haven't shown enough chemistry in regards to a song being more everlasting at the soul, and just sounds more like a fad eventually going away. That has honestly happened so often with a lot of girl groups from the Pussycat Dolls and others losing their career focus, and will only have maybe at least one song to stand the test of time alone. Unfortunately for Fifth Harmony, they have been really lagging in regards to better songs, and not showing individual harmonies and chemistry at the soul. They did barely show it with Write On Me from their 7/27 album. Work From Home though isn't actually a driven song that ignites from the heart, and the song just drags down overall. I didn't like the song at the very end, and the gals definitely haven't really been able to learn from their first set of songs like Worth It & Sledgehammer. Hopefully, there will be much better from them down the road.  Song: D+	-1
Honestly, I have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade, because they have not had the strike in the hotness of the iron, while the songs were hot from the soul. Unfortunately, Fifth Harmony has been more like the tween group that hasn't shown that they could blossom louder than words. I had found that so far the songs that the gals have made for their 7/27 album, have been below par to the soul that they could have set afire. Their only song that showed that they were maturing with the essence of the soul was Write On Me. Their other tracks like Work From Home ans All In My Head (Flex) were not very solid. That's My Girl, their latest single, again falls short of being a more empowering anthem. It doesn't work in the same way that someone like Beyonce' had with Run The World (Girls.) It just doesn't have the staying power that groups used to have like En Vogue or TLC. I think that Fifth Harmony needs to really find their deeper, inner voice that can set the world more aflame than what it currently is, just a small candle wick.  Song: D	-1

Nine brief Country based songs! He dabbles in jazz, country rock & orchestral with horns, strings, etc. Includes a cover of a Nirvana song! Thanx!	-1
Never put the words "to be played at maximum volume" on your record unless your songs do something besides inspire sleep. I followed instructions, and was rewarded with 2 consecutive snoozer ballads that made me queasy. Ridiculously self-indulgent, hyped beyond belief, derivative, and flat out boring. But it does serve one purpose: Williamsburg hipsters feel "earthy" listening to this on the F train. Drink up, woo girls!	-1

It is absolutely sad that whenever someone who is young and talented takes on a different route in their work, where their career goes down to tubes. That is a very risky move at the start, and easily someone's career can easily be lost or found again. It surprisingly worked for Ed Sheeran but honestly it hasn't worked for Meghan Trainor whom just came out a few years back. She did make a good starting namesake for herself  with catchy songs like Dear Future Husband and All About That Bass. But with the success of her first album, trying to change your work isn't always as good as the first record. When I had first heard No from her second album Thank You, I was honestly not impressed with the song, and thought it was a absolute departure that really showed her voice expanding was a blow to her heart. I really found No to not deliver. While it might be stepping into Beyonce' and Rihanna territory, it really doesn't work for Meghan. Maybe when her second album Thank You comes out, there will be much better songs for her in the second album slump.  Song: D-	-1
This womans voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard.  She is horrible and cannot sing.	-1
It is sincerely sad that whenever someone is on top of their game with good music, can actually have a set of songs that can cause them to lose control with their credibility. Meghan Trainor has been one of those artists that just came out a few years ago, and scored some big hits like All About That Bass and Dear Future Husband. But overall, when you can make a namesake for yourself, you also can easily lose it with the wrong set of songs that can make you lose your career. Her latest set of songs has been fairly good with Better When I'm Dancing from The Peanuts Movie, but when I had heard this song, I thought she is going to make a tailspin down. NO, the lead single from her Thank Album is really a move that could also derail her career, trying to be a little bit of hip hop and pop, into the styles of Rihanna and Beyonce' into her music. Sadly, the song does not even work all out Meghan, and I'm not very thrilled overall. The song was definitely not even worth listening to overall.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to Meghan Trainor, she has really made a good namesake for her own work with songs like Dear Future Husband and Better When I'm Dancing from The Peanuts Movie. But when I had thought she had a good path for her in the future, I was honestly surprised that she chose to take a step back which unfortunately might have made her lose her career. It is hard to her to follow up with her Grammy for Best New Artist. But when I had honestly her latest song, I would honestly have to say I thought that she really had wasted her voice and blew up to a massive lemon all over. NO, the lead single from her second album Thank You, feels more like she could've made care own career end before it could've gotten bigger. The song really has been more of a far departure into what she was starting to make in good songs. I found the track to be more stepping into a Beyonce' and Rihanna kind of sound, which really isn't her beauty. I found this song to really be a let down. If she really wants to end her career, she seems to start into going that route.  Song: D+	-1
I won't go as far as to give her one star, but this is a terrible album. I only love Hopeless Romantic and Just a Friend to You. Thank You went downhill, but I feel like she has what it takes to come up with a beautiful album like Title. I can't recommend Thank You to anyone. It's not good for the most part. She can do better!	-1
She is one of the worst musician in our day and age...	-1
I hate Meghan Trainor but had to buy this for someone to use at a work conference.  If I didn't love the company I would rather have lit a dollar on fire than give Meghan any royalties but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  I did hide it on my Amazon Music account and the company needed it again so I contacted Amazon and they added it back.  Amazon rocks as always with their great customer service!	-1
Horrible.  Childish.  Needs to grow up that singer.	-1
It is so hard whenever someone who is talented, that unfortunately, they just haven't been able to sincerely to find their voices again, after their first record. For Meghan Trainor, her first album had some really good songs, but when it had came out to her second album, Thank You, I would have to say that I am very distraught that she has not really been able to drive her work further, where as the case with a lot of the songs like, No & I Love Me, I really was not hearing a stronger sound from Meghan that really drove her voice in her work. She really did throw people a hard hit, where her songs are not as strong in where she could've gone. Me Too, her latest single from Thank You, really doesn't deliver. She really delivered more of a sound that really showed she is a shell of herself. I was not very thrilled at how she had been delivering her work lately, and she delivered less in the drive of the song. Perhaps Meghan should not try and follow into Beyonce' or Rihanna territory. It really isn't Meghan suite at all.  Song: D	-1

I'm a huge Kendrick fan but this, this was like left over music that he should have kept left over. it was uninspiring even with the strong lyrical content.	-1
Jackie's newest hit has a very sensitive yet powerful emotional message. The topic is central to any service family's life, seeing life in the service from both sides of the family. This is Jackie's gift of love for all who have served and all who have waited at home, powerless to protect their protector. Also, listen to the incredible harmony that starts about half way in. That's ALL Jackie, and ALL beautiful.	-1
One song is the endless repetition of one phrase.  Many songs have inscrutable lyrics.  Alarmingly, a few songs are about drugs and guns.  Noisy, ugly, mostly meaningless.  Not nearly as good as the music of Dhani Harrison and Julian Lennon.	-1
I was very disappointed in this new CD, a collaboration between Sean Lennon and Les Claypool. The songs and arrangements are monotonous (too much bass, mellotron, and heavy guitar), and the lyrics make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Sean needs to get back to some serious melodic songwriting (and back to girlfriend Charlotte Kemp Muhl, if they have not broken up).  Two stars for this release, which, frankly, is generous.	-1
Thank you.  Great album.	-1
These epic compilations, and usually for a good cause, have always managed to stumble me, often leaving me to feel that by reviewing something of this nature, that I would be less than noble by leaving people to feel that the endeavor is hardly musically worthwhile.  Certainly the Grateful Dead in all of its incarnations has left us with a staggering catalog of music, and like all artists, often times hearing another musicians take on a song might spark a light, bring back some long forgotten memories, and perhaps bring some fresh vibes to the table.  Though having said all of this, there seems to be but a few artists on the outing who actually fit the nature and theme of The Grateful Dead ... in that theyve nothing in common with the late 60s and early 70s mind-bending psychedelic alternative country weirdness that spawned a movement that lives on to this very day.  Most of these artists, try as they might, merely see these songs as bits of broken mirrors that they can neither piece together, or fully understand the nature of what these songs reflect.  Major exceptions of course are Touch Of Grey by War On Drugs, Box Of Rain by Kurt Vile, Goin Down The Road Feeling Bad by Lucinda Williams.  These artists, along with the other twelve tracks that Ive kept, have managed to not only make the songs their own, but have managed to find the heart and soul of the numbers they cover.  Most of the other artists, while presenting a good rendition, just don't own what they're doing.  Most of these songs will not give you respect for The Dead, they only showcase the artist whos presenting, leaving me to feel that many of the songs by the nature of their presentation ended up not being even faithful variations of Grateful Dead music.  All and all, there is not a cohesive flow, no contextual point of reference, no emersion that guides you down the rabbit hole and out the other side a changed person.  Review by Jenell Kesler	-1

Used to love these guys. They went off the boil years ago and I had hoped they could recapture the magic. Not to be.  If you like Replacements inspired Rock played with an edge check out Broken Gold. You can get them for free on Soundcloud. noisetrade (dot) com/brokengold/meet-broken-gold I am in no way associated with this band just dig their music. While you're on Soundcloud also check out Altadore and Highchair Kings. Lots of good free stuff on that site.  As for The Goo Goos, I'll hold out hope that someday things will change for the better.	-1
