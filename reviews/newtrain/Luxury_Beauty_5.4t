Probably one of my favourite essie blues!  I just cant get enough of this beachy, breezy color!	1
It's a flat neon magenta. Beautiful with a glossy top coat. Excellent price. Full size bottle.	1
I love the color. Only needs 2 coats.	1
Love the color, it's lighter pink, just how I like it.	1
Love the color!!	1
Beautiful color	1
My new favorite lilac!!	1
Like most metallic shimmer colors, this chips easier than a cream (but I am hard on polish any time). The color is very unusual, it is almost a cool gold, not quite tan, undertone with a warm (not cool) silver metallic flash in the light. It goes on streaky, so needs two or three coats, although the streaks don't show when it's flashing silver, just when the base color shows. It is NOT gray. The base color is more prominent with just one coat.	1
Does not shout "look at my toes" like so many of the contemporary colors. This "old-fashioned" color is not available in local stores.  I love it - not too pink, not too red.  Just right.	1
pretty color but it takes a lot of coats to be opaque. I put white under it.	1
One of my favorite colors.  I definitely recommend this color.	1
Love this color	1
Love this color, it's a red wine, which is what I like I don't like such a solid wine color, this is beautiful, ordered more for fall!	1
Stunning color, but it doesn't dry down to a glossy sheen. You have to use a top coat to give it a glossy look.	1
nice color..was looking for a true mauve..needs 3 coats to be that color, but that might just be on my discolored nails..very conservative, but not that "pinky" color that i don't like..	1
Beautiful light blue color!!	1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
Fabulous color!!! Cannot wear it enough, perfect for summer pedicures.	1
This color is so lovely! The product only requires one coat and it lasts for 7 days.	1
Came fast and is really pretty.	1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
Essie is my favorite polish ....... love all the different colors.	1
Fast shipping, product just as described	1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Another beautiful color, I am loving this.	1
Love the color! Doesn't wear as well as some other brands.	1
Great summer color	1
Thought it would be a little darker, but overall still a good color!	1
Perfect for touch ups when you don't want to get a manicure every day for 10$, even better for those with real nails	1
Love this neon summer collection, and the name says a lot.  Peachy and light, perfect!	1
My hot pink key west color to go with my other one, a great touch up for at home collection............and of course, what woman doesn't want a sexy neon pink to make every guy trip!?	1
I get my nails and toes painted once a month for good measure, but I'm beginning to keep a small Essie Collection at home, especially for touch ups when I don't need to spend another 10 on a manicure, or when the manicure tends to chip a day or so after... I have REAL nails, so this is not to offend those with gels, schalack or anything else but real nails just chip faster!!!!!!!!! Great bargain and way cheaper than most retail outlet discount chains, including the shipping, if any at all.  My Key West color!! :)	1
Love this.  I do my own nails and use this for a natural pink color.  Great Product.	1
This color was everything that I wanted it to be...almost exactly what you see on the picture! I did my nails, then went to work two days later, so unfortunately it did chip. That was my fault though..I was a bit rough on them! Regardless, I would definitely recommend this Essie polish. It is beautiful!	1
Beautiful brownish-red color, hard-to-find locally. Glides on effortlessly. Perfect all-year long.  Amazon shipments always arrive quickly!	1
love the color	1
Beautiful and good price...	1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Good polish	1
besttttt color ever its what I was hoping for the same as the picture	1
beautiful this color	1
just gorgeous, richer than Essie's "I'm Addicted" and I can't decide which one I like better!	1
love love LOVE this nail color.  It glows and gets compliments left and right.	1
bright, bold and beautiful for summer	1
LOVE!!!! Pink with microglitter. Bought 2 bottles!	1
We can't go wrong with Ellie - can we?  I love this and so will you.	1
Essie does deep pink better than anyone we know!  This color is perfect for the beach or the bistro.  Go for it!	1
Love this polish. This is my second bottle and it is perfect. It arrived very fast and has been worn several times on my fingers and toes.	1
What I thought it would be	1
Great coverage and lasting color	1
Fast delivery, great price!	1
Beautiful color! Goes on gelly like, but evenly. Two coats is all you need. And excellent service from the merchant.	1
Beautiful color, speedy delivery, and the merchant was very helpful and responsive. I originally received this item defective, it was very tacky and thick, hard to put on. I emailed him, and he sent a replacement immediately, which I also received quickly. Will definitely do business again! TY!!	1
Love this color. As another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery. I used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color. It looks great. Just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color.	1
Pretty color, very pink!	1
amazing color, get a lot of compliments because of it!	1
Holy smokes! This very well might be my new favorite essie color!!! Literally the most gorgeous shade of blue EVER! And you really only need one coat to get total coverage. Just plain beautiful and I've received so many complements on it..it just pops!	1
Love this color! It's so pretty and coraly. Goes with every skin tone.	1
The color is absolutely phenomenal. Its muted- but it pops color at the same time! If you want it more neutral, you can apply the coats lightly, if you want it brighter you can do thicker coats. This is one of my favorite Essie colors! It has an orangey tint so I would not suggest getting this color if you'r skin has an orangey glow. My skin's undertone is more pinkish so it looked good on me.	1
My favorite new color polish!	1
I purchased these (26) to give as a thank you for my baby shower. They have not been given yet but if it is anything like any other Essie product it will be well recieved. This was the best price for Essie without going to some unknown website that sold imatation items. I look forward to sharing these with my guests. We are very excited that the pink with the sparkles will represent our daughter!	1
So cute	1
Really pretty blue color,perfect summer color nail polish.	1
Such a bright cheery coral color! I bought a few extras for my bridesmaids. Love the shimmer to it, actually matches the color in the bottle really well. I've had others in this shade (in the bottle) that look fire engine red on the nails. This doesn't do that. Love it on my toes!	1
Love their colors!	1
great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated, very satisfied!	1
Such a pretty pink with a light purple iridescent tint. I like it because it is sparkly yet subtle. And I can wear it for weeks and just paint over it for an easy touch up.	1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I really love Essie and their colors!! This color is beautiful but if your looking for a neon this is not neon. I don't know why they call it neon collection. I have two others but haven't used them.	1
My favorite new shade for summer!  Turns out gorgeous and bright even without a white base.  Couldn't be happier with it!	1
Love this color, received many complaints.	1
i went on a mission to specifically find this polish since i had got my nails done 3 months ago with it. Thank bby jesus for amazon because i couldn't find it in any store and i refused to pay 8.50 plus shipping on essie.com. its an awesome color, not really a summertime shade but you can definitely get away with it because its blue!	1
This color isn't as bright on, but nevertheless, I still like the green. Essie is slowly becoming my least favorite brand of nail polishes, simply because they seem watered down (literally). Any Essie color I use; I almost always have to do three coats. But what I can say about Essie is that they have such a great array of colors! They're always so lush, vibrant, demure but yet sexy at the same time.	1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
Pretty color	1
Love it	1
Love the color	1
Love it, pretty color	1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
brand new as description, love the price!	1
Love this color, it's a fun neutral.	1
This color is so beautiful and perfect. Remind me of a vintage blue once you paint it on your nails. I loved how it was shipped fast and bubble wrapped. Will definitely order from them again!	1
First off, I love the color.  I don't have anything like this and I used it immediately upon receiving it (it was June's High Shine Club selection for me).  I did have to use 3-4 coats to really get it to be opaque, but light colors are often like that for me.  I think I am going to try it in the future over an opaque white polish; it should look great that way.  It was a good texture when wet (not too thin or too thick) and was easy to apply and I like the brush.  The finish on my nails is super smooth.  However, I did get chips on a couple of fingernails within 24 hours.  I had tried to be careful, and my nails aren't that long, so this was a little disappointing.  I touched up with new polish in the chipped areas and it's hard to tell I did any touch up unless you get really close.  So, I think my manicure will still last for a few days, though I expect to have to do more touch-ups now.  (I did peel a whole bunch of oranges and the polish didn't get messed up, so that was nice.)  I used a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat with this.  I do have an Essie topcoat and I may try that next time to see if staying within one brand results in increased performance.  Overall, however, I'm pretty happy with this.	1
I was looking a finish like this for a long time. It's just what I want!!! Little bit pink and transparent.	1
I actually came across this sort of accidentally. See, I was removing some dark red nail polish from my fingernails, and it left behind this really awesome pinkish hue. No, I did not use a base coat, and yes, I do realize the pinkish hue was a stain. But this got me thinking...I would pay for this look. I had no idea if I could replicate it, and it was a little uneven so I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a nail polish that could give me the same effect?!" Turns out, there is. It's Essie's Pink Glove Service. I ordered it a couple days ago, received it today, and put it on. My nails are adorable. They look so natural and feminine! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a classic, elegant look for their natural nails. :)	1
Shipped on time, item exactly as described. I love this color on my nails. Perfect summer color to wear. Also love the shimmer.	1
I am very happy with the quality of the polish and the color is simply beautiful on my tanned feet.	1
I saw this color at the salon and knew I had to have it.  I got a pedicure with it at the salon, and when I applied it on my hands it came out a bit brighter, but I actually like it better like that.  I used two coats and it looks exactly like the color in the bottle.	1
This is a great light almost nude color. I received this polish very quickly. Great fall color. Love Essie polish.	1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
Love this nail polish. I have worn it more times than not already and it is my go to color of the summer.	1
Really love how bright the color is. Already have the whole Neon collection but wanted a 2nd of this shade.	1
Color is beautiful and as stated in description.  I have been looking for this type of blue polish for the longest time.  The polish goes on smoothly.  Great quality!	1
Great summer color.  New nail polish dries so much better.  Very happy with color. It was a risk online.  I love all things hot pink and this is true to family.  Yipppee	1
Long wearing and easy to apply formula.  Love the Essie line.  Was not able to find in the local store.  Fast shipping and brand new bottle	1
Long wearing and easy to apply formula.  Love the Essie line.  Was not able to find in the local store.  Fast shipping and brand new bottle.	1
This is a great summer polish for toes and fingers, but I mostly wear it on my toes...it's a great shade of pink that doesn't clash with anything else you might be wearing and Essie pretty much won't chip (at least on your toes) for at least a week.  Great great color!	1
Love the color.  Very summerish. It's a great polish.  And the price was great. Less money than I have seen it at any store  The quality is great too. They use it at all the nail salons	1
Beautiful sheer gold color. Applies smoothly. Opalescent, I love it! The name is also fitting for the color. Very pretty.	1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I love Essie because of it's staying power. It lasts for more than one week and this color was rockin'. I received many compliments on the color.	1
a cream color very pretty magenta purple pink not super bright just right. Would recommend for others to purchase for nice summer or all seasons color.	1
This is pretty. It wasn't the hot pink I expected because it has a hint of orange in it. But I am very fair.	1
I love this color. Essie is always a hit or miss for me. This is definitely a hit! Plus i love the name!	1
A friend and I saw this polish on Pinterest but couldn't find it anywhere.  We were so happy to see it on Amazon.  It is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year, as well as any occasion.  You can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event!	1
great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated, very satisfied!	1
I don't know why Essie stopped selling this in drugstores, but I absolutely love this color.  Seller was prompt. Great great wedding nail color.	1
pretty color	1
this item is great	1
I love love love this color. No matter what season, it always looks great and I get compliments on it.	1
I love Essie nail polish and this will be a favorite of mine.  It looks like turquoise and that is my favorite color.	1
I love everything about Essie this just ahppens to be my favorite color. Goes on nice, Comes off nice and last about a week or two depending how applied.	1
I had not used Essie polish before but am satisfied with my purchase. Love this color. Neutral but with color.	1
I love nail polish (what girl doesn't) and this pretty, girly color stays on fabulously. I'll definitely be ordering more in other colors.	1
Love this rich color, that's good to go in one or two coats! It is a cool-toned magenta, but it is hard to see in the picture that there is also a very fine silver glitter.  Very subtle but very beautiful! I find I can really pull this color off any time of year.	1
This is the perfect pink and I really love it.  Order and I don't think you will be disappointed at all.	1
LOVED this nail polish! Such a pretty purple/grey color. Not shimmery at all and looks awesome on my nails. Is not too thin and streaky but is not too thick either. I love Essie colors, especially purple and will continue buying them!	1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
I'm in love with this polish! Its the perfect neon pink for summer and looks super hot with my tan! People keep commenting on how much they love the color and want to know brand and color. This could possibly be my new fav!	1
Great color and product. Essie is a great nail polish! This color was difficult to find at my local stores. So glad I found it on Amazon.	1
I loooove the color of this nail polish - it matchs exactly what I wanted it to match. the only downside is that it chips fairly easily without topcoat, so that is necessary.	1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
essie is by far my favorite nail polish! I needed a good green color. While yes, I do like this color, it is not as thick as I would like.	1
I love Essie nail polish. It is easy to apply. Goes on smoothly. Color is beautiful! Long lasting. Will buy more Essie nail polish.	1
Bottle services goes on matte so if you like that shine which i do I had to use a high gloss top coat. I also had to layer up to get the desired coverage I wanted. I would describe the color as Barbie Pink and I love it.	1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
This color was a lot of fun. Very neon. I used about 3 coats and it is so nice .I got a lot of compliments on it.	1
I love Essie for the quality and colors and I love that Amazon often has a good price.  Pleased with my polish.	1
I love this color. Wore through recent holidays and it was just great. Many compliments. Thank you so very much.	1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
This was part of a nail polish gift package for my sister and she loved it. Great color! Excellent service too--very fast shipping and appropriate packaging.	1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
The color is a beautiful dark pink berry color, not a dark color but for pinks, considered dark. The formula is great and super easy to work with and very shiny. I can decide if this polish is a creme or jelly so ill go with crelly.	1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
This Essie is a really cool color and looks better on the nails and has cool white sparkles in it	1
Love this color. It just might be my new summer color. It has just enough sparkle with a beautiful pale pink.	1
Essie's The Lace Is On is a beautiful color and has become one of my favorites. Nice cross between purple and magenta with some shimmer (but not glitter) that adds depth to it. Sophisticated color suitable for all ages.	1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
The color is really beautiful, it lasts a lot, doesnt fade. I always buy this nail polish and have never had any concerns about it.	1
The color is nice and stays on a long time unlike other polishes I have tried. Would definitely buy this again.	1
Nice color my wife likes how easy it went on.  Not too bright not too plain.  A cool natural tone for every day.	1
Very pretty. Good quality polish that is easy to use. Looks as pretty as a french mani. Highly recommended if you are in a hurry or don't want to pay for a salon white tip mani. Skip the tips and use this .	1
a true fushia which is really hard to find.  Very nice formular coverage is good and the color is WOW!	1
This is my favorite Essie polish in the orange family.  It is perfect for fingers and toes in the summer.  Stays on well too.	1
I bought this for my sister who loves nail polish.  It arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color.  She gets compliments on it all the time, and like other Essie polishes, it doesn't chip easily.	1
Made a great gift for a friends birthday! The color is beautiful! I would highly reccommend this product to anyone.	1
It was a gift to my girlfriend and she loves it. She wears it all the time. She loves the color and it stays on for a while	1
I love this nail polish color so much!! The color in the bottle doesn't do it justice. It's gorgeous on the nails!!	1
Pretty color . Great for summer on toes. I love Essie polish. It wears well and a long time.	1
Nice vibrant color! A beautfully deep blue. I love the quality of Essie and how long it lasts. Worth ever penny!!	1
Love love love this color! Perfect mix of purple and pink for a new fall color. Dries just a touch darker then the bottle shows, in my opinion. Perfect.	1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
Love the color and the quality of Essie.  Dark blue/navy is pretty in as a color this year so I plan on wearing this polish a lot.	1
Got a lot of compliments.  Polish is naturally chip resistant.  Good brand of polish, OPI is my other fav, this is the first time I tried Essie.  Now I am open to Essie as well as OPI.  (tip----learned from my manicurist that the Essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is NOT the real Essie- beware.)	1
Picked this out at the nail salon today. Wanted a pink that was pale but not too pail to wash out my hands. Love it! Perfect Pail pink color with a tiny bit of sparkle.	1
So bright. It did last. Everyone gave me compliments on the color. I'll be wearing it next spring and summer again!	1
Perfect for fall!  It's a nice grey with just a little bit of shimmer in it.  I liked it so much, I bought one for a friend too.	1
This is the perfect medium brown color for fall. Very polished look, and a great change from the normal bright colors.	1
my granddaughter has been asking for these nail polish the day after I ordered them she loves the color and the nail product. they came all together and in very good condition. They came on time. Thanks Teresa	1
Great color, when I bought it - I thought it was very similar to 'Jamaica Me Crazy' by Essie; but 'The Lace is On' looks very different, it is a pretty purple. 'Jamaica Me Crazy' is a bright pink shimmer (more fuchsia). Great finish and formula. This is definitely one of my favorite colors for fall!	1
I'd been dying for this color from the day I saw it on the Essie site, and for anyone who's been on there you'll know it's been sold out for months! Finally I found it on Amazon and I nearly cried. It's the most perfect pink and definitely a must have nail polish color. No matter the season, hot pink is always in style, and it's absolutely perfect for nights out! It makes me feel ten times hotter when I'm shaking it in the club and my glowing pink tipped nails catch the flashing lights. Definitely buy this color!!! You need it I swear.	1
Love, love, love this color!  Essie is always great!  The bottle was actually a little bigger than I expected.  I got a lot of nail polish for my money.  Will be buying Essie products again and again!	1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
The color is amazing. Perfect for fall. As with most Essie brand nail polishes, you'll need to apply 2+ coats and it only looks good for a few days max. The color is awesome though.	1
I love all of the Essie nail polishes. They go on perfectly and last for a lot longer than regular polish.	1
The color has a lot of brown and a slightly noticeable burgundy, a rather nice mixture for fall. I would recommend this color in place of red or brown.	1
Gorgeous, deep color that looks great on all skin tones. Nice consistency and great shine.  Another example of color and quality from essie brand. Great price from company, too.	1
Love this glitter polish, it is perfect!  Very fine & light  glitter.  it's great for an accent color on  top.	1
it's actually the color for my wedding so i'm a bit biased, but this looks amazing and essie is a fantastic brand.	1
Love Essie's nail colors. This is a perfect color of red not to bright but very soft. Had a hard time finding it in stores. Thanks to a Amazon you can find anything.	1
I love the color, but again I am a purple girl, and Essie did not fail to deliver here either. Love!!!	1
This is my new signature Fall polish!! Love this color! It looks black, but in the light there is some shiny wine undertones	1
I really like this nail polish.  All Essie colors are amazing.  This one lasted a long time.  However, when I purchased it, I thought it was a dark pink.  It goes on a very dark red.  I love the color, but it was not what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a dark pink, don't choose this one.  If you are looking for a burgandy, I definitely recommend it!	1
This color is surprisingly unique. The closest thing I have to it is OPI's Let Me Entertain You, but this polish is quite a bit more purple. It's a nice brighter shade that still reads on-point for fall. Great application, passable with one coat.	1
This color is so pretty!!! I saw it on pinterest and had to get it! I is pretty light so I have to put on about 3 coats to get my ideal color, but I usually put on 2 coats of any color anyway just to get good coverage.	1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
Love this colour, exactly as described. Wish I could give more stars since this was the fastest, cheapest shipping for any purchase I've made on Amazon, ever. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.	1
Great color if you are fond of the new green colors. Shipment fast and I am satisfied with this seller.	1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
Loved it everything was easy thank you!! Will shop again because it was so easy to do and the producta are great. Love that it comwes right to my house so simple, thank you, I will be buying more colors again.	1
I wasn't sure about this color but the minute i tried it on I was in love!  The color has a bit of shimmer and its more of a pinkish coral color.	1
Perfect for the summer.  Looks like its very shimmery in the bottle but its actually very subtle when it's on and makes it look brighter in the sun.	1
This is a very nice color from Essie.  It seems to be a winter color to me and I have it on right now.  It is a very deep purple with a brown tone to it.  Almost coppery.  Essie polish is always easy to use and has very nice colors.	1
SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED THAT THE POLISH WAS WATERY, NOT THE CASE WITH THE ONE I GOT. I BOUGHT IT AS A BACK UP FOR MY PEDICURE IN CASE I CHIP I CAN DO A TOUCH UP WORKED JUST FINE	1
The color was a lot darker than I had expected. It reminds me of Sally Hasen's Brick Wall, which I already have.	1
Fast shipping! Loved this color. I usually go for darker reds and thought I'd try something different. Absolutely love it for fall!	1
Love this color. I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores. It was sold out. You need a top coat for sure!	1
I ove the navy blue with just the finest hint of sparkle, not too teenage-y looking and perfect for fall!	1
It's nail polish.  It was unopened, it was the color I wanted, and it arrived relatively quickly.  What more can I say?	1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
I love Essie polishes. Essie products are very consistent in the quality. It goes on smoothly and dries very fast.	1
Maximilian Strasse is a great color that goes on smoothly.  This grayish green complements my skin tone and works with both casual and professional attire.	1
Love this color on!!! Great spring/summer hue, and been an addiction to pair it up with Essie's Matte About You topcoat!!! Great price, shipping time is quick, and great addition to my Essie polish collection!!!	1
I have been using delicacy for years and wanted to stock up. I love this color and it suits my tastes.	1
Saw this color featured in several magazines, and was happy to see it available here. The color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors. Stunning with grays, jewel tones, and a real pop with black. I like Essie because it stays on nicely without chipping. Essie always has the perfect updated colors. This color will look great with whatever you wear this winter (The Lace is On).   Also bought another 2013 color, Vested Interest. This is a lovely matte color, a greenish gray, that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors. Love the slightly edgy vibe, but super wearable, and looks fabulous on short nails.	1
I saw this color on Pinterst and had to have it.  Much to my excitement, the bottle was much less expensive then in the store and arrived quickly.  I've worn already and it lasts on my nails great.	1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I would do without the glitter in the polish. It was a great color and amazing for summer. Great part of the summer collection.	1
I loved this bright shade a lot so much that I bought two! I am African American but I think it will work for many skin tones... it's great!	1
I ordered "The More The Merrier" and I really enjoy the color. Essie quality is great about 99% of the time, so you can't really go wrong. Stays on well, for about a week. They sent me the wrong color at first, but when I emailed them about it, they quickly fixed the mix up!	1
This nailpolish has a little shimmer to it.  I love this nailpolish.  I've worn it several times since I've purchased it.	1
Nice color for summer. Essie polish lasts a good week and a half without chipping. Would recommend Essie polish. Great deal.	1
Love the color!  Perfect for summer.  Just like what you buy in the store for more than half the price.	1
goes on nicely, I would recommend using a topcoat over it. Color doesn't fade but normal chipping happens with use	1
I honestly did not expect the polish to be so sheer (4 coats required to be opaque yet still not bright). I recommend painting your nails white then putting about 2 coats of this polish on. Thanks so much!	1
I love Essie Nail Polish - It's the best out their - and the prices here are fantastic!  Very happy with this purchase!	1
i absolutely love this color for summer! The pink has a tint of shimmer in it which looks amazing in the sunlight! I received this product a day before the expected delivery date so I am very happy =)	1
The color is true to the picture! I think it's a perfect color for fall, and I received the product a day before my expected delivery date! I am very pleased.	1
Excellent color! It literally goes well with any season! I bought it for the summer but it looks fantastic so I will be wearing this all year long. If you haven't tried the Essie brand you're completely missing out!	1
I was never really into the expensive nail polishes like Essie. However, one day I fell in love with a color my friend was wearing. It was DJ Play that Song. So I asked her if I could borrow it. The polish went on very smooth {I always were a bottom coat}. I only had to put 2 coats on to achieve the desired color. I loved it!! I am a faithful fan of Essie now, with DJ Play that Song as my most favorite polish color. It is a slight neon purple color, however not to bold. I have it on my toes now and receive tons of compliments.	1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
Usually, my nail polish chips in 1 day... this one is long lasting, but I find that I need to shake it often (almost between each nail) or it gets clumpy, and then it dries with a dull finish.  Nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat can't fix.  I'm really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4.	1
I LOVED this nail polish, I had seen it around the blogosphere and was so excited to try it! I ordered three different essie polishes, and they arrived before scheduled time! Highly recommended seller!	1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
IF YOU LIKE COTTON CANDY PNK! THIS IS FOR YOU. MY FAVORITE PINK ESSIE NAIL POLISH OF ALL TIME!	1
It's a very pretty color, and it has smooth application.  I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless.  In sunlight, the silver shimmer is very beautiful, but still subtle.  It's a very summery feminine polish. The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen.  I painted my nails with Sunday Funday last night and they haven't chipped 24 hours later.  Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school, work, guitar, and piano.  But it's held up so far with a top coat.  Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50-something I have.  On a side note, the polish arrived very fast, a day before the shipment stated.  The polish was properly wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into paper packaging that was encased with bubble wrap as well.	1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
Went to get my nails done and chose this color.  I love it.  So many people have asked me about who made it.  I would have given it a 5 star rating but sometimes, you'll need 3 coats instead of 2 to get the true color.	1
This looks amazing in sunlight -- it's not quite a neon but it's definitely bright and noticeable. I love this color because I've been looking for a bright bubblegum pink, and this is perfect! The formula is typical Essie - kinda gloopy and thick - but not too bad.	1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This color is really cute! Cute coral with shimmer on it. Originally was for me but my mother ended up taking it for herself.	1
Saw this nail polish color on pinterest and I searched the stores trying to find it and then I saw it on here and I was a little skeptical buying nail polish online but it came brand new and the color is a dead match!	1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
it's not as bright as the picture -- it's like a neon grass green in reality --- and i can't get enough of it! it's such a unique color... a must buy for the polish obsessed!	1
I LOOOOVE Essie polishes - they wear great, don't chip, and have dozens and dozens of colors you can't find anywhere else -- this color is vibrant and has the TINIEST [and i mean TINY] amount of sparkle to it -- it is a great go-to color for when you can't decide at the salon -- for ALL AGES! :) I highly recommend this one, ladies :)	1
beautiful neon baby pink. perfect for those who want something bright but don't want any loud colors. Essie never disappoints.	1
This is one of my favorite colors from Essie. I have been looking for a pale pink nail color for awhile and Pink Glove Service is just perfect! You have to paint at least two coats before you can see an obvious difference, as it is so sheer. Perfect for a french manicure as well as just wearing by itself. I've gotten many compliments on it :)	1
I love Essie nail polish! It's my favorite brand and one of the brands I buy most. Love this color!	1
Love Essie products and love this color. Looks great and lots of fun for summer. Very bright. Would definitely recommend	1
DJ Play that Song is a vibrant purple/ magenta hue. It goes on fantastically & is as bright as the bottle. There is more pink in the polish than I thought from viewing online, but I love the shade.	1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
This color took nearly three weeks to be delivered. The color is hot orange and neon but it dries in matte finish not gloss. I wish it was glossy because the matte finish always looks cheap. It's hard to find a neon nail polish that looks glossy and high-def.	1
So I love essie and the color was rich and beautiful, though the picture is not really what it looks like in person. The color is more of a pink, then light coral. It took almost three weeks to be delivered.	1
As usual Essie has another hit!  Great color for a mani/pedi for summer.  Looks great on most skin tones  Shipped quickly too.	1
DJ Play That Song is a semi-neon purple color with red undertones. I say semi because it's not a blazing neon. It can be worn to work. It looks just like it is pictured in the bottle - pinkish purple. I tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn't capture the real color. I tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn't work. The color is really pretty to naked eye.  Saturday Disco Fever is a bright pure orange color. This is not a very blazing neon, so I am able to wear it to work. It looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors. I felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in Summer. I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don't like Yellow/Orange shades. But this color worked for me. It is more red-toned than yellow-toned. This dark Orange looks good on nails too.  The formula on both the polishes is great. Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. They dry quickly but dry matty-ish. So top coat is a must for me. I applied a base coat (OPI Base Coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (OPI Top Coat). They lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).	1
Love this fun color. I get tired of only pink and red shades. This was a great way to mix it up without the color being too young looking for this 30-something woman! :)	1
Just put this color on my hands and feet Luv it !!! I would recommend this color to all my friends	1
I can't recall when I first found this color, but I'll keep ordering it online since Essie has discontinued it.  It's the best summer time pedi color.	1
I love the purple color.  It's not in your face purple, but almost a little more pink and soft looking.  The one thing that I'm still on the fence about is the flat sheen.  It's not really matte and not shiny.  I haven't decided how I feel about that.	1
She needed green nail polish and thought she might like the color.  I bought it. she got it, and i'm surprised but uses it all the time.. She loves the color and I may have to buy another now.  Totally worth it to see the expression on her face.	1
What a fun and unique bright pink. This color is thinner then the darker Essie colors making it a lot smoother and easier to paint. It's not as neon as I thought it would be, however, it's still a bright and fun color. If you want true neon, I would recommend China Glaze Pink Voltage instead.	1
The formula is a little thin, but its a beautiful color for summer. I use it over a white polish ( like I do with most ESSIE brights) and it looks beautiful.	1
When I chose this candle for a Vine review I checked the price on Amazon. I was blown away by the price! After receiving it in the mail and burning it, I'm impressed with how strong the scent is. I keep it in the den and when I have it burning you can smell it throughout the house. Very nice scent throw! It burns fairly clean with minimal amount of "mushrooming" of the wick. I had my own candle business for several years and do know a bit about what makes a good candle. This one is very good in the fragrance department, but I feel it is a bit pricey at $55.00 for a 12.5 oz candle.	1
First, it's embedded in really sturdy glass, so even if this topples over the table on which I've set it I'm not afraid if it shattering.  We keep it in our living room and light it when people come over. The smell isn't insultingly strong and wafts down the hallway into the dining room and kitchen. We live in a single-level apartment, but it's a very wide layout, so I was surprised to find the smell all the way in the opposite side of the house. But the living room (again, where this candle is) doesn't have such a strong smell as to be harrowing on the senses. Yes, the smell is obviously stronger, but not unpleasant in the way some candles can be.  It's a warm woodsy smell, and everyone who has come in has commented on how nice it smells. We used to use Febreze NOTICEables, but they can get quite expensive if you don't find them on clearance, and they would often leave a very strong smell in the beginning then suddenly fade away, even if there was half of the liquid still in the cartridge. Candles are a better alternative, though may not be as strong as something like Febreze. Which is completely fine for me.  It may seem a bit expensive, but when you stack up the prices for electric replacements, the candles are certainly a better deal in the long run.	1
This is a very nice candle in a nice jar, it smells very nice and upon burning, it spreads the fragrance nicely. It's not a heavy smell and is more of a delicate one that will spread slowly and surely. The only drawback is the $50 price tag which I don't think is exactly justified for a candle.	1
This candle comes in a very nice packaging, probably nicer than any candle deserves, but is a nice touch that will make you consider keeping the box around because it is that nice looking.  The scent itself is nice, not over powering but again not very memorable.  The packaging does cary over to the glass the candle is encased in and after about 100 hours of use (according to the package, I had no interest to time it myself to see how accurate that is) it will be worth wild to clean the remaining wax out and reuse it for something else it is that elegant looking.	1
I'm not sure how much I can say about a candle but I have sure enjoyed this one. Its price may not warm the cockles of your heart but the candle has a lot to commend it. The fragrance is fresh and classy rather than sickeningly sweet like many candles. The wick holds up nicely. The candle burns completely evenly as is the quality of a good soy candle. When the candle is blown out, the containing glass that holds it does not stay hot. In fact, the glass container does not get overly hot even when the candle is burning which is a big plus for those concerned with fire hazards. This candle makes a great addition to a romantic evening.	1
I wasn't sure about this candle.  I'm usually not a big fan of Patchouli, but it doesn't overwhelm the other notes.  It's a good size.  I burned it for the first time for about four hours.  I barely melted an inch.  I enjoyed the fragrance.  It didn't knock you down, but was pleasantly there.  I think this is a quality candle that will last a long time.	1
This scented candle smells delightful with fragrance of  Patchouli, Vetiver, Oak Moss, Liquid Amber & Rum. It reminds me somewhat of a fancy cologne for men. The scent is just right, any more and it would be just a bit too sweet. My husband and I typically have strong reactions to certain candles and fragrances but this candle didn't bother us in the least.  The selling point for me is that this candle is made out of soy wax and in the USA. Soy wax candles are a sustainable renewable resource and burn cleaner and more slowly than other types on the market. If I was choosing to gift a family member or a friend a candle, it most certainly would be made of soy wax. And I think this candle is a scent they many men would favor.  This candle states it will burn for 100 hours. Give or take, 100 hours is pretty good burning time depending on how often you light it. If you spill any wax somehow, rest assured that the soy wax is very easy to clean up with just soap and water.  The box the candle comes in is straight to the point. I adore the upper-class typography and that the packaging isn't busy. Simple is good and smart. I am now eager to delight my senses  with some of the other candles in the Baxter of California collection.	1
I love the scent of this candle. Not flowery at all and the liquid amber and rum scents dominate. I love how the house smells when burning this candle. Superb and elegant without being overpowering.	1
Oh, how I wish that was hyperbole! White Wood Number One by Baxter smells truly blissful. It carries an extremely clean scent. The vetiver is not overpowering, giving it a natural woody aroma that lingers after the flame has gone out. The smell is not overpoweringly masculine, which I love. There's just one gripe, for the price the burn just doesn't last long enough. Soy based candles are supposed to carry a longer burn but for the price ... you'd expect more than 100 hours. But the trade off is a wonderful scent that isn't overpowering but is noticeable, it's not going to fade into the background.  Baxter is an excellent line. I got my husband to give it a go and he likes quite a few products from their line. The packaging is wonderful, and would make a great gift for any guy, or girl, in your life.	1
Did not work for me	-1
My wife and I do a lot of outdoor photography and filming outdoors and needed a sunscreen that wouldn't bother us while handling sensitive equipment.  The Capital Soleil allows us to get to ample protection without us feeling like we're lathered up in regular sunscreen.  We simply apply a few minutes before we go out and we simply forget about it and that's a good thing.  Strongly recommended for anyone wanting the SPF 45 treatment but not be distracted by it.	1
A good many years ago I fell in love with Skin So Soft lotion because it went on like LOTION and was a bug repellent and sunscreen in one.  Then they discontinued the lotion and I've been suffering through the nasty sunblocks out there ever since.  I HATE feeling greasy and this lotion is awesome that you can apply it and it just soaks in like lotion... but still gives you the excellent sun blockage that you need.  So far I am super happy with it. It hasn't been intense enough in sun to really test it out fully, but even a full day outside I am not getting any real sun effects, so I think it's working. So hard to test it this time of year though... I will update in the Spring when the sun is more intense.  I did take off a star for the price. Really?  I definitely won't be using this on the kids, just on me, at that price!	1
My wife has very rough sensitive skin so she has to be extra careful what products she uses and she loves this one. She says that this is light and airy that she barely feels it on her skin. Has a good light scent that is not over powering.  She liked it so much she wants to get more!	1
I was fortunate to be able to review both&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/L-Oreal-Paris-Skin-Care-Age-Perfect-Hydra-Nutrition-Facial-Moisturizer-1-7-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B01648QGU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">L'Oreal Paris Skin Care Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Facial Moisturizer, 1.7 Fluid Ounce</a>&nbsp;-- which I have used in the past -- and this Vichy SPF creme which is new to me.  Previously I used the L'Oreal product in the winter because I feel I need a sunscreen when the sun is bright and because it is oily and that oil seems to protect my face from the rough winter wind.  The ingredients for both are very similar --and I'll talk about that shortly -- but I've found that I like the VICHY product better.  WHY I LIKE VICHY BETTER ====================== -- first, the Vichy product is not as greasy/oily.  It goes on looking the same but soon absorbs or does whatever it does so that it leaves only a silky presence.  The L'Oreal product is very heavy having a lot of glycerin.  -- the Vichy product has a higher SPF.  45 versus 30 with the L'Oreal.  -- Vichy costs more but you get a lot more of the lotion.  Neither product currently has a price on Amazon but it appears from the briefest look at google that Vichy is twice as much... BUT you get about 3-times as much product.  L'Oreal also uses a really inefficient pump system that had me pumping like 5 times to get enough lotion to cover my face.  With Vichy you just squeeze so you aren't paying for the packaging. .  ACTIVE INGREDIENTS COMPARISON ==============================  L'OREAL ------------------- Avobenzone Homosalate Octisalate Octocrylene  VICHY ------------------- Avobenzone Homosalate Octisalate Octocrylene Oxybenzone  There is a large difference in the inactive ingredients.	1
It really does have a dry finish to it, I was really surprised, I have never sen a sunscreen like this before and I really like it. It's very nice, not a greasy or slick, "pore suffocating" cream! It is light and invisible, absorbs in in seconds leaving a matte dry finish  as if you have nothing on your skin.  I have VERY sensitive skin and most lotions sting and burn so bad I have to wash them off immediately, I had absolutely no issues with this sunscreen! ***** (5) stars EASY!  It also has a fresh light scent that dissipates quickly, no strong or heavy perfume smell to it. You need to apply it 15 minutes before you go out into the sun and then reapply it every 2 hours, unless of course you go swimming and towel it off, then it must be reapplied right away or if you just go swimming (no towel drying) reapply within 20 minutes to maintain full protection at a SPF of 45	1
I tend to like more natural ingredients in my sunscreen, so that is the only reason that it loses a star.  That being said, the more natural products are very hard to come by.  Compared to other sunscreens in general, however, this is a standout.  It has full spectrum coverage which is important - especially in south Florida!  It has a very nice, non-greasy texture.  I also like that it has a pleasant, sort of flowery scent rather than the standard sunscreen smell, which I really dislike.  That makes it nicer if, for example, you are going out and want protection but don't want to smell like the beach.	1
The product is odorless, and really does disappear into your skin, not greasy at all. It protected my skin well in Florida sun. The nicest feeling sunscreen I've ever used.	1
What I like best about this product is that is doesn't leave my skin feeling oily, like so many other sun blockers do. It goes on clear and dry, and I don't really worry about it rubbing off on my clothes and staining them, either. It's definitely on the pricey side of the market, which is the primary consideration for my rating of four stars rather than five. So, while I really like the product, I have a feeling I would purchase other, less expensive products in the future.	1
This is a nice sunscreen, in a five ounce container.  I'm out in the sun every day in the summer, so I go through a lot of suncreen.  I wish that  they had a larger size for this.  I like the scent, it's not over powering.  It doesn't feel greasy at all and is lightweight, not a heavy cream.  Like all sunscreens, you will have to  reapply it every couple of hours.	1
The silky, dry touch (no sheen) quality of this Vichy sunscreen (appropriately called "Silkscreen") is awesome - especially since I use moisturizer first, anyway. I especially like the SPF 45 for my face and the back of my hands. I have always worn a good sunscreen on my face, hands, chest, throat, and arms, to prevent (or at least slow down) sun spots and sun aging as I read that the SUN causes most skin aging.	1
I like this for one big reason: no gross odor. No chemical smell and no super sweet smell to attract the bees and bugs.  I used it all over, even on my face, and it didn't irritate my skin and didn't migrate up to my eyes to sting. It's thick enough to control the flow and not waste it.  Also, the lid fits tight. That matters if you are like me and have spilled countless bottles of sunscreen that end up upside down in the beach bag.  I find the brand is trusted as well, having tried five of their products before I was offered this one by Amazon to try.	1
I like Vichy products and always bring some back when I visit France.  This sunscreen is lightly scented and not greasy or heavy; doesn't make my skin breakout even under makeup.  It also does an excellent job blocking UVA/UVB.	1
This product was my first intro ducting to Vichy, though I've always heard good things about the brand.  Now that I'm in my 30's and starting to experience the early signs of skin aging (ugh) I've become much more diligent about my sun protection.  BUT I also have sensitive, dry skin that is acne prone so I also need things that won't irritate my skin or make me breakout.  I love this sunscreen because it addresses all of my needs.  It protects perfectly (though if I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time I do need to reapply as with any sunscreen), is easy to rub in, feels lightweight on, and doesn't disagree with my skin.  Yes, the scent is a bit floral where I would prefer something unscented or coconut-y, but it's a lot better than some other brands I've tried (Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen comes to mind as being the absolute worst sunscreen I have ever smelled.)  I'd definitely recommend this	1
A nice dry finish. I know it is supposed to be for "sensitive skin" and maybe I am interpreting this wrong but I think it feels a little "stingy" when first applied. This goes away pretty quickly. As a guy my only issue is that the fragrance seemed a bit strong and flowery. I was actually surprised it had fragrance as I usually associate "sensitive skin" products to be free or near free of scents perfumes. I saw in the questions section that someone asked about the smell and people answered that it was not strong. I guess I disagree... Not overpowering but I thought it was definitely there especially when on my face.	1
This feels good and refreshes this old skin of mine.  It doesn't have the annoying odor that some sunscreen products have.  I do recommend this.	1
The SPF on this thing is 45, which is likely more than most people need in Northern climates like where I live. It does contain avobenzone, which protects against UV-A radiation, which causes aging wrinkles and the like. Great! It's also got homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone, in various amounts to (I guess?) hedge your bets, and give you protection against different types. Mind you, no sun screen will protect you from 100% of UV, but you want to have some fighting chance, no?  That said, you should be using at least 1 oz of sunscreen to cover your entire body when you're going to be exposed to the sun for long periods of time. This bottle is 5 oz. That means that you'll get 5 uses out of it, if you're using it properly. Put it on and let it get into your skin, or you're not doing enough to protect yourself. I don't really get out into the sun that much (especially as the autumn days are making the days shorter), but it's still something I'm careful about for my face, since I'd like to avoid wrinkles.  Why did I go into all of that? The SPF 45 isn't necessarily going to give you exponentially more protection than an SPF 15 or 30. The percent UV blockage from SPF 45 is only a percent or two more than SPF 15. In other words, you want something that you can wear every day, in reasonable enough quantity to cover yourself, and have it be pleasant enough to want to wear.  The scent on this sunscreen is not like that of other sunscreens I've bought. It doesn't smell like sun screen. It smells pretty nice, actually. Score one point. When you put it into your skin, it doesn't feel greasy at all. Score another point. Also, it even says on the bottle to reapply every couple of hours, after swimming, or if you sweat a lot. That means that you'll want to keep it handy with you when you're planning a long day out in the sun.  This scores well enough on all points, such as wearability and pleasantness of wear, but the reason I'm docking a star is because of the cost. This 5 oz tube costs over $20. That means that wearing it every day will get very expensive very quickly. If you can find one that is as pleasant to wear as this one, with SPF 15 or more, that is cheaper, get it instead.	1
My absolute favorite brand of lipstick.	1
Another lip color that had to be reapplied several times a day...not at all what I was looking for. Would not buy this product again, very disappointing when it says long lasting and I had to constantly reapply..	-1
Love it	1
I love this brand.  I love the rich pigment.  This color is really a lovely shade for spring I think. arrived well packaged. It really doesn't' stay all day on me, but I love that it lasts a long time.  I like all of the Stila bright all day lipsticks.	1
Probably my holy grail of Liquid Lipsticks. I use a number of different brands (to accommodate my need for many shades) but this one is both an ideal color (Beso) for my skin tone (pale with warm undertones), and an outstanding product as far as longevity and application. I prefer the liquid lipstick as reds are my go to and if you wear red you DON'T want to deal with the unpleasantness of smearing, transfers or uneven wear.  This lasts way longer than other brands I've used (Revlon, which doesn't last as long, but does wear evenly, and is less drying than others) and has a better end result than some of the longest wearing brands (Rimmel Provocalips, which does last but tends to look peely towards the end of the night, particularly if you reapply.) The price keeps me using it only for days/evenings when I can plan on eating and drinking over the course of a few hours, when I don't want to worry about it.  My process goes something like this: Balance Your Chi if you want to try to use it to line your lips. If you're new at that part, no shame in using a separate lip liner(Knowing that that part of your lip may fade), but if you want to get clean lines, Just wipe the excess off the applicator towards the center of your lip, then with the wand only slightly full of product, carefully line your lips. Fill in as needed with a full brush. This is the most important part: I let it sit with my mouth slightly open for 4 minutes. No kissing, smoking, drinking (even from straws) It's a good time to do your mascara, as the face you make when you do that is probably perfect. If you make a mistake on the lip line, just immediately push from the outside in with a tissue before it dries, and try again with a nearly wiped brush (I've had some luck going over it with wet product after it dries and doing that, but it's touch and go, and the smear risk is higher.)  If you consume oil based foods, it will affect the longevity of this product. So that salad with vinaigrette will probably make it so you have to touch it up. At a party, I only had to touch up the inside of my lips once, and I was sipping on a drink all night, and snacking on appetizers, so that's pretty good. My lipline and the area around it was sharp as a tack until I took it off. NO transfer to my teeth, glass, or husband either.  Because I wear this type of product regularly, I always put on an emollient rich lip balm after removing it every night, and keep my lips well hydrated whenever I'm not wearing makeup. This won't have the same longevity on dry lips, and it will dry your lips out, thus creating a cycle of drying, then not working as well on subsequent days. Also, on a regular basis, I take a toothbrush with a pot style lip balm (Blistex DCT is my age old favorite) and exfoliate as I do my weekly facial) This keeps the product from drying out my lips, and ensures good results any time I use it.	1
Drying.  When first applied has a smooth, glossy look & feel.  After a few seconds it dries my lips out and because of that, I wouldn't purchase this.  (Received it in Birchbox or Ipsy.... don't recall which one.)	-1
Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick is my holy grail lipstick.  I have it in Patina and it's easy to apply and lasts and extremely long time.  I'm hard on my lips and prone to chewing on them or eating and drinking a lot and this is one of the few lipsticks that stays on for hours.  And even when it does start to wear off, it does so in a way where it just looks slightly faded and isn't unsightly.  I especially LOVE Patina.  It's a rich nude-mauve that's like my lip color only a little darker and prettier.  I have neutral-toned light/medium skin and it's a perfect color for me.  I love pairing it with a brown or plum smokey eye and I get a lot of compliments on it.  It's the perfect lip color to have a pretty, pulled together look and as such it's regular in my makeup bag even though I have a substantial stash of 50+ lipsticks.  Would recommend.	1
This particular color (Beso) has great reviews but I personally didn't like this color of red. I find it too bright and almost orange? I much prefer a bit of a darker and more blue toned colors. Fiery would have probably worked better for me.  I'm taking off one star because this lipstick peeled on my lips. I have two other Stila liquid lipsticks that I bought from Sephora that don't do this. It might have been because my lips were dry but I'm not certain.	1
I would be super pissed if I bought this based off of the online portrayals of the color.  This is not a subtle pink.  This is neon pink and I jut happen to love it to death!  This is genuinely my go to lipstick.  I like the color and I love the formula.  It can dry kind of fast so you need to work quickly.  It dries fast and stays put.  It doesn't dry my lips out but it does transfer when eating/drinking.  It doesn't move around only lips though and the color stays very vibrant for hours.  I have tried a lot of liquid lipsticks and this is my favorite formula.	1
I love the color and formula that is made with	1
Lovely lip stain with a beautiful color. I'm love the color as I don't wear make up.  I do use this sparingly and the color lasts for hours.	1
Very natural nude type of color -- stays on through eating and drinking -- no sparkly stuff or sheen.  Just a basic nude.  Good to wear with anything.	1
i love the color but it doesnt last as long as the kat von d ones, either way i love it	1
This really does last all day! I got a good 6 hours of wear out of it and the only reason it came off at that point was because I ate a very oily pasta dish. I have dry lips and this is one of the few longwear lip products that doesn't make them uncomfortably dry. I was also able to dab on a bit of lip balm over the lipstick once in awhile to keep my lips hydrated without the color coming off. The shade 'Amore' is a deep matte berry/brown shade that looks awesome on my fair, cool toned skin. I like that it is a darker shade that isn't too loud.	1
the colour is beautiful so pretty	1
nice colour, love it	1
I got this for my mom to try and she loves it. First time user with this brand	1
Item is as described and arrived promptly.	1
I am so in love with this matte liquid. It stays liquid long enough for you to get it on right then dries to a perfect matte. It lasted for hours. I just wish they had more colors.	1
As usual when I read reviews about products I see the helpful reviews and those that are written by unrealistic people. This lipstick is no exception in that reviews are varied. I guess I think it's common sense that a lipstick boasting to last 6 hours is going to stay on pretty well and not be full of moisture or that one needs to be somewhat precise when putting this on, but that's just me I guess. To address some of the concerns from other reviews, yes it does stay on, but it is easily removed with putting a balm on your lips so it's not like you are stuck with it. As far as messy goes, I don't see how it is messy, but hey, I guess someone did. What I do know is this is the best lipstick I have ever purchased. I don't wear makeup at all except of lipstick and mascara and I am cheap and not one bit into brand names, but this lipstick delivers. My lips actually look fuller wearing this and I love how the color stays. Yes, it is not a moisturizing lipstick but I would not call it drying. I do however dab a tiny bit of Aquaphor over it if my lips feel dry (not to much though or the color will come off). I am brunette with a medium skin tone that likes a more natural look and at first I ordered the color "Aria" (which I like), but it is to bold for my practical everyday look. The second color I ordered was "patina" which is my all time new favorite color. It is a stunning, natural looking mauve like rose shade that looks stunning on dark haired people. Again, this is the best makeup product that I have ever purchased and I would suggest giving it a try if you are a reasonable person and don't expect perfection out of a product.	1
I am a 42 year old woman who has been shaving daily for 25+ years. I started off shaving with just plain bar soap and moved on to canned Barbasol cream, which I've used for probably the last 20 years. My skin is dry and somewhat prone to irritation/razor burn, although not truly sensitive. Lately I have also been experiencing some irritation and itching on my lower legs, which I attributed to winter dryness. A friend recently mentioned that his wife shaves with his Proraso soap, so I decided to give it a try. My husband gave me a quick tutorial on lathering, gave me a shave brush & lather bowl, and I gave it a shot. I'm very impressed with this soap. It lathers up quickly and easily, and has a creamy, rich consistency. I didn't find it overly mentholated or irritating - in fact, I barely noticed the menthol at all. I had concerns that it would over-dry my skin, and while it was definitely not hydrating, it also didn't dry me out. No nicks or cuts, no irritation. The first time out, I got one of the closest shaves I've ever had, and that was with a several days old cheap disposable razor. The next morning my legs were still smooth & stubble-free, which is unheard of for me. And that lower leg irritation I previously mentioned? Completely gone since switching to this soap. I have tried using this soap both with a secondary lather bowl, and with lathering directly on the skin with a brush. I personally think the bowl method works better, especially for legs, as it produces a thicker, more creamy lather. And as someone who is usually in a rush in the mornings, I should note that using this soap & a brush doesn't take me any longer than using my old canned shave cream. The frugal side of me appreciates that this one bowl of soap will probably last me 2-3 months of daily shaving, as I only need a small amount each day. There's also less packaging & waste compared to my old canned cream. I've already ordered the red & white Proraso soaps to try.	1
This is the best shaving stuff I have ever used. Got the closest shave ever.  Try it, you won't regret it. You don't need a lot of product because it suds up and for the price, you cannot beat this.	1
Hope all of you are having a great shave! In this review I will touch upon some tips to follow to maintain the longevity of this soap in particular. If you're wanting to know more about the philosophy of the Proraso company and how it is presented in the shaving industry, then I would advise you to check my detailed review of the Proraso Red or the Sandalwood Proraso tub.  My first experience of this soap ties me to another review I just posted for the Proraso pre shave cream in the green tub. I linked this soap to its pre shaving cream for the purpose of how different each component plays an important role in terms of scent and performance. The green shaving soap is different from the cream through one clear factor. The shaving soap is more soapy in scent and less cologne, in other words it's more fresh scented, mildly in strength and powdery to the nostrils than the pre shaving cream. Usually one would say both products should be identical well not here with Proraso. That's why I love this company because each single product holds its own line of effect and performance.  The pre shave cream is there for the face prep and therefore it will give you the first wiff of what is yet to come. Holding that sensational pleasant feel, by introducing the soap, you will add another layer of experience. The luxurious sheen and cushion will be calmly interlinked with the cream in a pleasant marriage. You will know when the soap is added by just the smell of it. Some people might shy away from the handful usage of menthol products, I have to say no to the case of this brand, the shave was still pleasant and the menthol didn't overwhelm my nostrils and eyes. When I combined both shockingly the only difference was the change in sent and the menthol sensation through the three passes didn't tone down or built up it stayed the same.  Some shaving soaps in the industry have a repeating trend of building up the effect of coolness by every pass in a shave. When combining the two products of this company the soap and pre shave , you get something those companies fail to accomplish, the word is consistency and balance. I have tried blooming this soap for one reason, although it's a soft soap I wanted to experience more to what this soap has to offer. The slickness was intensified by this soap alone, I did this once without using the pre shaving cream. It was a delight!  Now in order to maintain the life and performance of this product I would like to share with you some tips that you will find useful. After I load my brush with ANY soap I directly rinse the tub clean from the excess soap with water. I then place it face down on a towel. I leave it over night to air dry, NEVER leave your tub facing upwards; this will force the water to stay submerged in the soap and what you will end up with is a slimy gooey substance, nearly half eaten soap. The water will react to soap like it reacts to soaps in general. You will dinimish the longevity of this product and in less than 10 Shaves you will find yourself with an empty tub sooner than you know it. This soap can last forever if maintained properly. Never load the brush and close the tub immediately; by doing so you are creating a vacuum area and a chance for bacteria to form with the foam that is already on the tub that was formed while loading the brush. This is very important to have in mind because this bacteria can give us a bad shaving experience and increase the chance of our faces getting infected this is not a common happening but science does tell us that bacteria of some sorts do effect our skin. So just be careful.  So by placing the tub downwards and leaving it to naturally air dry you will allow whatever water to go down naturally with the effect of gravity and you will be able to maintain a safe product to be used on your face every time you shave, for a long long time. People often get nervous especially ones like me that own over 60 soaps and by looking at the expiry date they tend to have the urge to rush and finish a product without enjoying it. Guys this is a soap. It's enemy is water. As long as it is dry , soaps can last for years and years. They are even selling vintage soaps 60 years old plus on ebay. You find people paying rediculous amounts on auctions. Why? Because they are soaps. If maintained you can use them for decades! One shaving soap you can browse on eBay auctions is the vintage Shelton known as the might OLD SPICE. If you find a NOS ( New old stock soap with its cup and sealed...) do me a favor and check the price on it. People in the wet shaving community live by collecting these.  Another tip I gathered while shaving through the year that I would like to add here because of the special package of this product is once you finish this soap don't discard the container,,, keep it! There are countless options for using this tub to me I use it to put in another soap, sometimes it's cheaper to purchase a refill, instead of buying a soap with a tub. There are some cases where you can save yourself a minimum of 60 bucks with a refill. Some companies add a lot of money to a soap by shoving in a ceramic bowl, a wooden bowl, or a bowl that they created from heaven. In the end of the day it's just a soap. A wooden bowl might expand and crack if you bloom the soap in it or by just exposing it to the slightest drop of water.  The ceramic bowl might break and shatter with your slippery hands while loading the brush. Always think positive. Why I say this with Proraso is because unlike other plastic products out there, this is well created product and is a good grade of plastic that can be used over and over again with no worries of getting any chemical reactions to the soap.  This whole idea of wet shaving should add pleasure to your life. It's really beneficial for your skin health, and boy you will love it! shave on! Ladies and Gents!  Ps. There is one thing I want to say, is if you ever want to purchase a shaving soap from Proraso, is get this one before you head to the Sandalwood red tub, why? Because there have been countless rumors and complaints across the web of people actually having their face irritated by getting a slight burning sensation on their face while placing the red tub lather. Some might say it's the contents found in the ingredients of the tub, and they end up praising this green one. To me it's not the case, I have found both scents and types a pleasure to shave with even with my extra sensitive skin and hard stiff stubble. To me it's all about face prep, and that comes before anything else. To me it actually improved my Shaves and experiences drastically. Plus we only have one face for god's sake. So to put all mysteries aside I actually recommend you to give this tub a try first and then move the red tub.  Shave on!	1
Proraso White soap was the first real shaving product I tried - about 3 years ago, right when I quit the razor cartridges for good and switched to double edge safety razors and straight edge. That remains my favorite scent and it motivated me to try other Proraso products and other soaps.  I have about every Proraso product at this point and their soaps and creams perform very similar to me (good), so other than that it's mostly about scent.  I was hesitatnt to try Proraso Green, because I thought I wouldn't like the scent (afraid I'd get the blast of toothpaste-like smell). It turned out to be very pleasant and refreshing - great for warm weather. The soap still has a classy "barbershop" scent, yet without feeling like an old geezer. I find that the scent of Green does not linger quite like the White and Red, which is perhaps good, because the scent of the green tonic (splash) is great! The days that I use all of the Green products, I do it because I look forward to the splash - it lingers for hours and is like a classy cologne (and not exactly similar to menthol/eucalyptus you get here. The Green preshave/soap/cream and balm smell more medicine-y, in a pleasant way. The Green splash (lozione) is more like perfume.  I love it for the price.  I really HATE that Proraso changed their labels with the color of Italian flag. Not because it's the flag, but because it made some of the products hard to differentiate. The stripes are supposed to be like those on a barber pole.	1
The green cream smells horrid. I can't stand it. The soap is more subtle and actually smells decent. I wouldn't be able to chose between the red and green. But the green is def more refreshing and the red can be used in between. I just love the smell of the red.	1
This is a very nice soap but RazoRock XXX is much better at lathering, slickness and protection.	1
Works perfectly as I always say with soaps use about 10 times as much as you think you need this stuff lasts for ever and is pretty cheap anyways so the best way to get a lather is use more than you expected.  Also I use a bowl to get the lather nice and thick always a great product	1
I see why this is so popular in Italy!	1
It stinks like old man but will leave you with a baby face.  Nobody likes a stinky baby.  Pay the extra money for Geo F. Trumper's Coconut Oil Cream - it provides an ever smoother shave and has a subtle and pleasing coconut scent.  Don't be cheap, you only live once and you could die tomorrow.	1
The product comes in the hard plastic bowl shaped container as pictured. The lid just kind of snaps onto the container and is easy enough to open and close. When you open the container the minty menthol smell is very prominent. The shave soap has a firm texture.  I lather and apply this product using a separate cup and synthetic badger brush. First, I soak my brush in warm water while I am showering. Next, I squeeze out most of the water but not all of it. Now it is time to load the brush, I firmly push it into the shave soap and brush it in a clockwise motion for a while. Once it is nice and loaded I build a good lather. To build my lather I start running my brush in a clockwise motion inside my lather cup. I add a few drops of hot water throughout the lather building process. I keep working it in the shave bowl until I get a nice creamy dollop of shaving awesomeness. Finally, it is time to get this on my face. I just simply wet my face with warm/hot water and thoroughly brush on the lathered shave soap. I usually shave in three passes and just rinse and reload my face after each pass.  This shave soap lathers wonderfully and goes onto my face well. It gives a nice smooth layer of protection. My skin is more on the sensitive side so I was apprehensive about using a menthol product. I do not seem to have too much of an adverse reaction to this product except for some tingling in my face. This container seems to last forever, way longer than any of the canned gel junk you can buy.  I will probably give the Proraso Sensitive a try next because of the menthol in this, but I may go back to this shave soap in the future.	1
Great lather and refreshing.  Leaves my face all tingly!	1
Love at first shave. Though the Red Proraso Sandalwood has a scent that I love, the feel of the menthol and eucalyptus on my face is really amazing. The soap has good slickness and lathers easily, especially if you bloom it for a few minutes by putting an ounce or so of hot water on top. Even if you get rowdy and give yourself a bit of irritation, this stuff will minimize it.	1
Smells good!	1
Excellent soap to start with if you are new to wet shaving. Lathers effortlessly in a bowl or straight face lathering. Charge that wet brush with a couple dozen swirls on the soap and get it going on your face or in the bowl. Spend a good couple minutes working that lather into your whiskers as that's what softens the hair and preps it to be cut. The soap takes water with no problem. Very pleasant cooling sensation on the skin. Classic clean shaved barber shop scent. Just a great soap. Finish your shave with a wet alum block, a cold water rinse, and some Proraso After Shave splash and you are ready for anything that morning...or night, I guess. Enjoy!	1
Good product. Lathers up quickly.	1
After many years of dreading shaving I decided to start using a straight razor. Wish I had gone this route years ago. My shave is now a ritual. I love to shave now. I love the feel and weight of the razor and the skill it takes to produce a smooth shave. One of the problems I was having was finding the right soap. I read many reviews and besides wool fat soap, the Proraso comes out on top.  I tried it, I love, love, love it. Smooth, silky, great lather. Buying this proves you don't have to spend a fortune to become a wet shaver. you can buy a fine, shave ready razor, a nice badger brush and this great Proraso Soap, right here on Amazon! If you have never had a straight shave, get one!  Then get a nice razor. Great forums online but you will see the Proraso is always highly rated.	1
You'll need a shaving brush and a new blade to enjoy this amazing product.  Absolutely great price and quality.	1
I buy all sorts of shaving creams and soaps in a never ending search for the perfect shave.  This products is one of my favorites, especially for the price.  I have others that I like more...but they are twice the price.  For an old school shave this is the best bang for your buck!	1
With over 30 years of scraping sharpened steel across my face, I've come to the conclusion that the key to a close, comfortable shave is less about the razor and its blades as it is about the lubrication provided by the soap or cream being used.  I purchased a tub of PRORASSO EUCALYUPTUS AND MENTHOL 5 months ago, have been using it daily and I'm pleasantly surprised by the results.  WHAT IT IS:  - A plastic tub holding 5.2 oz. of softened shaving soap.  A shaving brush can be "loaded" right in the tub.  TEACHING AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS:  - Fleeing the disposable razor cult allowed me to see that there was a better shaving world out there.  The old method of spraying a glob of gel, smearing it all over my face and using that single application to shave my skin from every direction is officially over.  No more dragging a blade across unlubricated skin after the initial "with the grain" shaving pass removed all the cream ... not good.  Sure, it got the job done, but my skin burned, there was irritation around my neck and there were annoying "rough" patches left behind (because not all hairs grown in the same direction).  To be honest, I never thought of adding a second, third or even fourth application of gel for the subsequent "against the grain", "from the side" and "touch-up" passes ... using a can of shaving gel a week wasn't appealing and I never saw anyone else do it.  There had to be a better way to shave.  WHY PRORASO:  - First of all, this stuff has been around forever; it's an icon of shaving.  Honestly, in this day and age, that means something ...  - Unlike most every shaving gel/cream/soap I'd used over the years, PRORASO provides a rich lather without "glopping up" my razor and that helps prolong the effectiveness of the blade.  A simple rinse clears any soap and hair buildup on the blade(s).  - I can swirl a wet shaving brush directly into the tub of Proraso for several seconds and get enough soap to squeeze out four facial applications to provide enough lubrication for my four shaving passes (with the grain, against the grain, from the side and touch ups).  No more dry shaves!  - One tub of Proraso has lasted 5 months and counting (shaving daily)!  - The refreshing eucalyptus and menthol provide a cool, refreshing and tingling sensation to the skin that becomes more pronounced with each subsequent application.  The fourth (final) application is when the menthol's coolness really kicks in.  While I have gladly been using a double-edge safety razor for the last 6 months, I would highly recommend PRORASO to compliment any shave, regardless of the razor being used.  I believe the most crucial element of a quality close shave is the lubrication factor of the shaving cream as it allows the razor to do its work without damaging your skin.  PRORASO provides the necessary lubrication without mucking up your blades and this means your blades last longer.  Longer blade life and the ability to get up to 6 months of daily shaving from a single tub of Proraso should certainly lessen the financial burden of shaving.  The best aspect, however, is the ability to get a really close (baby smooth) shave without irritating the skin.	1
quality product!!!	1
Love it	1
Good stuff... All Proraso products are simply the best however, I prefer the white ( sensitive) as I think I get a bit closer shave and just a bit more lather.	1
Smells great, feels great.  You get a nice tingling sensation with this shave soap.  It lathers well, and is overall a great product.	1
I enjoy all of the Proraso shaving soaps.  The eucalyptus and menthol doesn't smell as strongly as I was afraid it might. Just a nice clean fragrance.	1
What can I say this shaving soap/cream is the best product I have ever used, IMHO. Most of the guy's that use it say the same thing. My girlfriend loves the way I smell after shaving with it. It really lathers up into a rich thick lather and give a smooth and comforting close shave. I now use all of Proraso's products.	1
Does a very good job, especially when used in conjunction with Proraso pre-shave and after-shave. I use all four flavors: green, white, blue, and red. Spice is the variety of life and I enjoy rotating through different products and experiencing what each has to offer. Buy Proraso products with confidence.	1
this stuff works alot better than  the gel,  this jar has lasted 6 months so far . this size will be good for a year i shave every day	1
I'm a brush-and-shaving mug guy and have been since the mid-1970s. I bought a cake of English shaving soap about a year ago and it inexplicably stopped making lather a few months ago. So, knowing the Italian penchant for luxury, I gave Proraso Shaving Soap a try. Used with my Gillette Fusion razor, it gives me the most luxurious and closest shaves I've had in my 68 years on the planet. I wore a beard for close to 30 years, but now I actually look forward to shaving. My wife loves the eucalyptus and menthol aroma and remarks about it every time I use it. Count me as a Proraso convert.	1
I have been buying this soap for years from amazon.  The soap is really good - the leather it makes is simply the best.	1
This is my second jar of this brand. I got my first jar in March 2013 and just ran out. I like the smell and I never use can shaving cream again. This gives a close shave and I rally recommend it. Even after  a major snowstorm, the USPS delivered it on time!	1
A saw that the Proraso shaving soap was frequently purchased with the Merkur Safety Razor I was purchasing, so I decided to give it a go since it was less expensive than the shaving cream from the Body Shop I was using at the time.  Up until now I have been using other brands of shaving creams that I applied with a brush, but none of them compare to the great shave I get with the Proraso shaving soap.  I only need to run my shaving brush in the soap dish a little to be able to achieve a full lather when I apply the shaving soap to my face.  The soap gives a bit of a tingling feeling which is nice.  Using this soap, I think that I can achieve a closer shave than with shaving creams.  The Proraso shaving soap has a nice scent which basically smells like soap.  I have gotten comments on the scent from other people.  Plus the Proraso shaving soap doesnt have a bad affect my skin.  I have tried some creams such as the Baxter of California Super Close Shave Formula which caused my skin to break out horribly.  Overall, this is by far my favorite shaving soap.  Using this soap with my safety razor and a Feather shaving blade, I am able to achieve a close shave that doesnt leave my skin irritated.  I highly recommend this product.	1
I'm new to the world of wet shaving, and while I've watched some YouTube videos and have some nice gear, I'm still a beginner.  This is perfect for anyone, even beginners, to get good quality lather.  I load up my brush, and then I whip it up a bit in my bowl, but honestly, it's almost instant.  It smells good, and my shaving results (with the right blade) are top notch.  Very satisfied.	1
Lathers easily, great price, and stays lathered if you need to reapply for multiple passes.  You need a good brush and a bowl or mug to maximize this products' usefulness.	1
Still have a tube and tub of this (don't ask), but I've been trying lots of other brands and finding things I like better. I'll go back to this every few days though as it is itself a great product, I just fell in love with some other scents and creamier formulations!	1
After having a beard and using an electric shaver to shave around its edges for decades I decided to go clean shaven for a while.  At first I tried conventional shave cream along with multi-blade razors, which worked okay.  But recently I decided to go back to the distant past and start shaving with a double edge safety razor and old-time bowl soap.  I went to my local Wal-Mart and tried the Van Der Hagen soap at first.  It was very inexpensive and felt good but did not lather well at all.  After reading reviews about Proraso shaving soap I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  It comes in a nice plastic bowl with a lid making a separate shaving mug kind of unnecessary.  It lathers well, and I like how it feels on my skin.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems like I could shave a lot closer with it.  Since I only just recently started using it I can't say how long the soap will last, but the amount supplied appears to be about 1-1/2 times the amount in the Van Der Hagen product.  I would expect it to last 6 months or more at least.  The price is about 5 times as much, but I think it's worth its added cost.  If you try it, I think you will like it.	1
Cool	1
Have never used this brand before but saw an instant difference in my hair!  Softer and silkier.  I will purchase again!	1
so good for my dry and thick hair :)	1
If you want the best sulfate free shampoo this is the one!!! Buy it is so good, and if you use the treatment and the conditioner you will get the best hair you can imagine!!	1
I have coarse, curly hair and this isn't really making it sleek or manageable; it's making it wispy. I've tried using it was damp hair and dry hair. Another reviewer compared it to baby oil, and that seems exactly right. You could probably buy a bottle of baby oil for $2.00 and get the same results. Initially, it gives my hair a nice sheen, and within 20 minutes or so it's as if I'd used no product at all (i.e., the sheen is gone) and my hair has become flyaway and wispy.  Unlike some reviewers, I had no trouble with the pump. Also, the smell is pleasant---it's just not helping my hair in any way. I received this product for free in exchange for a review, but I would not pay money to replace this down the road.	-1
This is the first product of this type I've tried, so I can't compare it to another.  I use it at night before I go to bed, but haven't noticed any oily residue on my pillow cases.  My hair is fly-away and this tames it, which is a great help.  No noticeable scent.  My complaint is that the oil is so thick it doesn't flow through the pump.  I have to unscrew the top and pour it out onto my hand.  Kind of a nuisance, but I can live with that.  I'll have to use it longer to see if my hair's texture improves.	1
This product bears a great resemblance to baby oil.  Very similar consistency, with a fresh, flowery scent.  My "beauty regimen" has always involved starting each day with squeaky clean hair.  Recently I've been reading this may not bet the best thing for the health of your hair and scalp.  This oil does a decent of of replacing the oils that frequent washing strips from your hair.  I found that it made my hair a little too greasy if I applied it from the scalp to the ends.  I have better luck starting from the ends and working my way about 2/3 back to the scalp.  It does make my hair feel sleek and moisturized and helps tame the fly-aways.  As an alternative, you might consider using it as an overnight treatment you wash out in the morning.	1
Cool	1
Smells amazing and my hair drinks this stuff up. Wish it was less expensive, though.	1
Love love love my Agave Healing Oil Treatment!  And so does my hair!  This is by far my favorite hair oil treatment.  Following washing and conditioning my hair,I pump it into my hands, rub them together, then slather it into my hair for a manageable lovely look.  My hubby is using it as well!	1
First off, I didn't order from the specific seller currently listed.  But I can say if you get a genuine bottle this hair oil is awesome.  I had tried several different brands and types of hair oil before trying this one so I wasn't expecting it to be special or different.  But my hair, which is normally under control with my existing routine, seemed to be more dry and frizzy than usual so I decided to give this a try.  It definitely gave my hair the boost it needed and while not a miracle cure, seemed to cut down on the frizz and dryness.  Based on that experience I'm pretty impressed with this oil!	1
Love It!  Doesn't make my hair oily...but soft and silky!	1
This Agave Healing Oil Treatment WORKS!!! That is a HUGE statement because I feel as if I have tried almost every shine and anti-frizz product out there under $100/bottle or tube and have had lackluster-to-no-results at all. I first tried this when we had NO working humidifier in our house, in the middle of winter with the heat blasting day and nightmy hair was floating through the air with static and dryness. Agave completely took care of that problem while giving me soft, manageable hairand it even has some shine! I did use a large "quarter-size" squeeze of it out of desperation, but it didn't make my hair oily or heavy. I am giving this product a GLOWING RECOMMENDATION!	1

I don't know how well it works because the pump doesn't work hence I can't use the product.	-1
Who knew? An oil that volumizes! (Texturize might be a better word). I had been given a sample and tried it on a whim. I have fine, oily hair that I color (all-over) to cover gray. I only use a small amount of this oil, and I spread it very lightly across my hands. Then I pat it only the outer layer of my hair. I do not use a conditioner, but do use a color-safe shampoo (I like ISO these days). Who knew that an oil could do this? Plus it adds some shine and helps tame the frizz I have in a few spots. And it helps detangle. (Probably not conditioning enough for course or very frizzy hair. But those kinds of products would turn MY hair into a flat oil slick!)  A note on the ingredients: unlike, say, Argan Oil, this product contains more than oil and, surprisingly, a lot of silicone in various forms. But it works, so I'm hangin' with it!  PS - I tried using a little more product through my hair to see if more would be better. Didn't happen. Went back to applying as I wrote above.	1
Is the last thing I do when I finish to dry my hair, is the last touch! It work wonders!!	1
I love putting this oil in my hair. Just a squirt in my hand, and then through my hair. It smells so nice and leaves my hair shiny and soft. There is no greasy feel. In fact my hand does not even feel greasy from the application. I took off a star, but not for the product or the seller. For the packaging. I wanted to travel with it and I was afraid of the pump. I contacted the seller who told me to push down the pump and turn to lock it in. But, this isn't so easy to do and you can pump out a lot of stuff trying. I ended up putting some in a travel container. It worked just fine.	1
Awesome	1
Love it!  I felt and the difference right away!	1
This product has been one of the greatest out there for my super thick coarse hair!!!	1
Do the treatment , use the shampoo and this conditioner!! and you will see the difference in your hair!! You will be the next one to recommended!	1
Don't waste money on pricier shaving creams.  There is a generous about that lasts a long time.  Great for men and women.	1
Some good classic Sandalwood with long lasting protection and use.	1
Husband's favorite:  some at home, some in his gym locker.  A little goes a long way for a smooth glide.  I like the light masculine scent.	1
I found the fragrance of this to be offensive and very unpleasant.	-1
Proraso is the standard by which all other shaving creams are measured.  This product is just outstanding.  I personally didn't like the sandalwood very much.  That's not the product's fault, it just speaks to my personal taste.  If you like the sandalwood scent, pick this one up	1
I love Proraso shave products. I am an avid wet shaver and I love the Proraso Shaving Cream. It whips up to a great lather in my scuttle and treats my beard to a great shave. I have all of their different types of Shave Creams and shave products and all are great. I change depending on how long I have been without a shave or what the situation is at the time. This is a Italian product. It is FANTASTIC. If you haven't tried Proraso, you don't know what you are missing.	1
The smell is very nice	1
Smells good, lathers well and does a good job.	1
Love the smell and just a little goes a long way.	1
Without a doubt the best shaving cream I have ever used.	1
What can you say about a classic?  It's not the most expensive or exotic, but it is a great product.  Love the smell and the feel of this shaving cream.  I prefer the red to the green and blue formulations due to the pleasing scent.  A tube lasts a long time and looks awesome on the sink/shower ledge.  Recommended.	1
I love all Proraso products. I think this smells fantastic but, as some other reviewers have remarked, it is quite different from many other products that are described as Sandalwood. Try the green cream too - lovely lather. Bellisimo!	1
Does a very good job, especially when used in conjunction with Proraso pre-shave and after-shave. I use all four flavors: green, white, blue, and red. Spice is the variety of life and I enjoy rotating through different products and experiencing what each has to offer. Buy Proraso products with confidence.	1
I have a pretty rough time shaving, as I have rather thick beard growth and sensitive skin.  While the green label Proraso was quite impressive, this red Sandalwood formula really does the trick!  Its meant for heavier beards and take it from me: it is without a doubt the thickest, richest lather I've ever experienced.  It really does soften the skin and provide a more comfortable shave.  My wife also likes the sandalwood fragrance too, so that's a plus as well!  It might seem a tad pricey compared to a normal can of cream, but there's no comparison with the quality and the tube will last you months as you only need a pea size amount of the cream to lather up.  If you've had a tough time shaving your thick beard, give this stuff a shot, its nice!	1
Ever since I got turned on to using a safety razor I have used proraso products.  The scent and lathering abilities are great.  Love the Proraso product line.	1
I tried this as a change to the Proraso Eucalyptus & Menthol shaving cream.  I like it.  The scent is nice and the consistency is identical to the Eucalyptus & Menthol.  One of the things I like about brands such as Proraso is that the scents don't blow you away and stick around a long time.  They go away after a while instead of constantly reminding you all day that you shaved.  The Sandalwood is no different.  Plus, I've found that I like these tubes much better than the more solid style shaving creams.  They require much less effort than the pucks.	1
I have a thick beard and this sandalwood cream is designed specifically to deal with thick beards. Of course Proraso is legendary among wetshavers as a cream that rivals other shaving creams that are double or triple the price in terms of quality. It is also known to be a good cream for those new to wetshaving as it is more forgiving in the lathering process than other creams, which can easily be too dry or to soupy if you don't use the exact right amount of water to mix it. Some people do not like the sandalwood scent of this product, but I like it. It is not overly scented, but it is more peppery than what you usually get with a sandalwood scent. Some say this a truer sandalwood scent, I cannot comment about that, but I do like this particular scent and think it smells manly. It is also a scent that lasts, which I take as a mark of Proraso quality. They seem to really care about the quality of their products.  The Green menthol cream is the original Proraso and many people swear by that cream. However, I did not like the smell of that cream at all, as I thought it was just awful. I would bear it in order to use the cream, but I hated the smell. Also, I do think this is better at taming a thicker beard than the original (though that could just be their marketing working on me). It definitely doesn't dry your skin out as much as the menthol original and that is a big deal to me. This is now my new favorite Proraso product. I just wish they had come out with an aftershave lotion that matched this scent at the same time. Hopefully, they will do so soon.	1
I had been using the Proraso menthol shaving cream for years and love it but switched over to Jack Black beard lube for a change and didn't like it (and it it twice as much as the Proraso). When I saw the Proraso sandalwood option I thought I would try it, so back to the Proraso line. The sandalwood is the same as the menthol product in terms of generating lather. I use it with a Panasonic wet shaver and man, the lather it creates is voluminous. As long as there is some water applied via the shaver head the lather never dries or dissipates. It can lead to a mess but if you want plenty of lather this is the way to go. I don't agree with other reviewers who say the scent is too strong or bothersome. Both the menthol and the sandalwood imo are pleasant and definitely not overpowering.  A great product, highly recommended.	1
This spray is the first and only Wen product I've ever used and it's the best leave in spray I've ever used! When sprayed into my hair after showering, my hair is easy to comb and manage. I do use 3 other products in my hair after using this, but the combination without this spray is definitely not the same. My hair absolutely loves this spray. I have naturally straight hair with certain areas that are naturally wavy. Finding products that tame my frizz and wonky wavy bits effectively without weighing down my hair with product has been a constant battle until I bought and tried this for the first time. This spray is so lightweight and manages to tame the areas that wanna do their own thing whether I air dry or blow dry my hair.  This spray smells amazing. It's not too sweet, and has a clean minty scent that is light, clean, and herb-like fresh. It's not heavy or cloying.  This really makes my hair look fantastic, feel fantastic and makes such a huge difference in my haircare regime. My hair is easier to style, feels nourished, is shiny and healthy looking, and retains body and bounce. I used this spray on my friends hair for her wedding before setting her hair in curlers. Her normally fine, wavy and frizzy hair was full of luscious, smooth and glossy curls that lasted all day. She looked like a princess. It came out better than I ever could have hoped.  It's completely expensive yes, but it does last a long time. I just ordered my second bottle. My first bottle I got back in the beginning of April of this year and just recently finished that bottle. I use a good 6-8 sprays in my armpit length hair and I wash my hair 3 times a week. To me that feels like a worthwhile amount of uses for the price. The price, IMO, is a little insane but the price of Wen is a little insane anyway. It did make me cringe a bit when I had to repurchase, but all the things I was trying instead weren't working anywhere near as well and I'd much rather pay more for something that works instead of keep buying cheaper products that don't (and end up adding up to the original cost in the first place). This is definitely one of those products I just can't live without and is definitely a HG product in my book.	1

It is always difficult to read a description of perfume because everyone's chemistry is a little different.  I think that is the case with this eau de toilette.  My attention was drawn to the product for a few reasons, it is a good brand, I like citrusy/fruity scents and am willing to try something new.  At first spray I was a little disappointed because it definitely smelled more woodsy, like sandlewood with a little vanilla, but as I sniffed my wrist throughout the day I found that by the end of the day it took on a more citrus scent, not sharp by any means, but moreso than when I first sprayed it on.  It stays on all day and I would say it is a pretty smell.  No one note really takes over, so it it seems to have many layers to it and is a more sophisticated/elegant scent.  My husband tends to like fruit/citrus scents on me the most but said he thought this was a pretty feminine scent and not overpowering, just right in his words.  Overall, I enjoy the perfume and have worn it for a few days now.  It won't take the place of my favorites, but it definitely has a place in my perfume rotation.	1
I don't know how people could say this is a weak scent, but I guess that could be true if you like your fragrances really, really powerful. I don't. So, this was even a little too fragrant for me right out of the bottle. But once it was on my skin, I found it to be really nice. Definitely feminine, but not in a ridiculous "give me a headache" kind of way. It's a little deeper and more powerful from my normal sweet and light scents, but I'm happy to be changing it up.  The only thing I don't like about this perfume is the way it sprays on. It's a little too concentrated of a spray instead of a mist like I'd prefer. However, the bottle is really sleek and pretty and would look nice left out on a bathroom counter.	1
Burberry Brit for Women EDP is a lovely scent that I found to be long lasting on my skin. The top notes of the scent are fruity - greenish citrus fruit - which is refreshing. After the green notes wear off, the scent becomes floral and softer. The final scent is a vanilla, woody scent that is warm and long lasting.  Burberry Brit is great for daytime and evening wear. I have a number of old stand-by scents that I wear and it's difficult for a new fragrance to break into the line-up. This scent has managed to do so. I have enjoyed wearing it and having people ask me what perfume I am wearing. It seems to agree with my skin.  The bottle itself is attractive with the well-known plaid design of Burberry covering the outside and the bottle looks nice on my dresser. All in all, I am pleased with this Burberry Brit scent. I would recommend someone looking for a new and lovely scent to try it out.	1
The box and bottle are draped with the signature Burberry pattern. The bottle is very stylish. The scent is just a tad strong for my taste. It's a little on the spicy side. Smells earthy. A small amount goes a long way.	1
This is a lovely fragrance if used sparingly. I am surprised by the reviewers who say this is a "light" scent as I find it to be quite robust. This is a classic fragrance that seems to improve as the day (or night) goes on.  I'm not sure I'd call it spicy or floral but some combination of the two. I can't pinpoint exactly what this smells like but it feels like the perfect fragrance for the fall and colder months. When I spritz this on, I want to wear herringbone. Don't ask me why!  This is a quality fragrance, clearly labeled "Made in France" so you can be assured this is the real deal.  Very nice. Competetively priced.  Recommend.	1
Perfumes can be a hit or miss proposition when given the chance to try a particular model out, but the Burberry Brit variety was an extremely pleasant experience. The overall scent is very pleasant and light without being overpowering. The perfume scent holds well throughout the day without coming off as too strong as long as a reasonable amount has been applied. I would definitely recommend trying this at a department store first if you have any issues with the specific tones I will list below.  The tones below come straight from the Burberry website (unfortunately they were left out from the Amazon product description), which knows better than anyone what this scent was concocted from.  Top notes: green almond, icy pear and Italian lime Heart notes: sweet sugared almond and lush white peony Warm undertones: mahogany wood, amber and vanilla bean	1
I've smelled Burberry Brit before in department stores but I've never gotten a bottle before now. I really love it. It comes a nice box and the bottle is so beautiful. It looks gorgeous on my shelf.  The scent is lovely. You don't need a lot to be able to smell it. I never want to overpower people with my perfume and so I would recommend no more than two sprays and it's strong enough but not too strong. The smell is lovely and can go from day to night.  I love this and I think it is my new favorite perfume.	1
I'm picky when it comes to perfumes, so I was delighted to discover that this is exactly what I've been looking for! The scent is clean and classy, avoiding the highly alcohol-y undertone of old lady perfumes and the over-wrought forced brightness of a lot of the perfumes targeted towards younger sets. I love that the scent is feminine and alluring without being blatantly flowery or "exotic".  I am also thrilled that this perfume is perfect balanced in strength. It's subtle - it won't knock anyone over when you walk into a room or cause grief for people who don't tolerate fragrances well - but still strong enough to be pleasantly noticeable and to last the day. I love it, my husband likes it, and it's balanced enough for daily wear. This is decidedly my new favorite, and I will be highly recommending it to others!!	1
BURBERRY Brit for Women Eau de Toilette, 3.3 fl. Oz  This is a lovely scent for the lady in your life. It being an eau de toilette, it is not over-powering, for you. It has floral and citrus notes and a touch of vanilla. It is beautifully packaged for gift giving. The bottle with the gray white and red striping is quite elegant. I like it very much and am quite pleased with the effect. It is joyous to say the least. I know you will enjoy the effect. If you have any doubt try a smaller size first but I think you will be pleased.	1
I've tried the Burberry perfumes before, more specifically Burberry Weekend. I loved that it was a light floral scent that wasn't overwhelming and could work in most situations. I've never really gotten into some of the other scents as much because I tend to like lighter scents more and they tend to work better on me with my body chemistry. I'm both blessed and cursed by the fact that most scents will become 3-4 times as strong once I put them on. It's good because I can use less of it than others do, but it's bad because some of the stronger, muskier scents just won't work regardless of how sparingly I put them on.  This was supposed to be a lighter scent, so I decided to try this one.  So far I really like the scent. The alcohol scent is fairly strong when you first put it on, but wait that out because that goes away after about 30 seconds. There's a nice floral tone to this backed up by a deeper scent, which gives it a little added maturity in my opinion. It's the type of scent that you can wear if you want to put off a more serious countenance, although it can easily lend itself to a lighter atmosphere. This is an all purpose type of scent for the most part.  The one thing I'd warn you about is that a little bit of this goes a long way. The Burberry scents tend to work better with my body chemistry than others so I can put a normal dose on (about 2 squirts) but this is one that I'd recommend testing out around the house first. It smells great, but one pump was about all I needed with this. Take in mind though, that this is with my body chemistry and the average person will likely be able to do the normal dose or maybe a squirt or two more.  I really like that this doesn't fade away easily, something that can happen with some of the body sprays that I tend to use on a regular basis. This is probably due to the difference in how they're made since the B&BW sprays are mass produced to be sold on the cheap while Burberry things would likely be made to last longer.  So would I recommend this? Yes. It's pretty hard to go wrong with Burberry scents and while I still prefer my Burberry Weekend, this would make for a good alternative.	1
This fragrance is the one that gets the most questions about what I'm wearing. It's light & timeless, if you've never owned a Burberry perfume this is the one to start with. After your first purchase, you will always remember  and distinguish the Burberry Brit.	1
I have purposely not read the adjectives they used to describe this scent, in an effort to go in clean and describe just what I smell in this fragrance!  Words I'd use to describe Burberry Brit: Sweet Feminine (definitely feminine!) Orange Jasmine Vanilla (just a hint, I actually don't care for vanilla scent, but it's a very light touch) Floral -- maybe hyacinth, hibiscus, a hint of sweet rosewater Light, not musky or spicy A hint of Asian influences (I don't know what I mean by that, just that it has a touch of "exotic" undertones) Reminds me slightly of a grown-up version of the scent "Exclamation," a popular teen-oriented fragrance in the early 90's!  (But in a good way...this isn't a Walgreens scent like Love's Baby Soft or anything!)  This scent is absolutely impossible to stop smelling!  It is even nicer as time goes on -- an hour or two after applying it, it smells just heavenly.  SO feminine and refined, but not your grandmother's fragrance by any means.  It plays well with others -- it has a distinctively beautiful scent, but will mingle nicely with other unintended scents vying for attention (such as my mango shampoo) -- it just seems to blend nicely with other scents, and with your body's natural scent.  It lasts a good long time -- I hate it when you can't smell your perfume an hour later!  It's not overpowering, but it can easily become a "signature scent" that people associate with you, because its sweet, pleasant scent will still be detectable several hours later.  I am really in love with this scent, and I have gotten so many positive comments on it, even from coworkers who usually hate perfumes!  It always seems to be the same reaction: closing their eyes and inhaling deeply.  I have done that myself so many times with this Burberry Brit that I was in danger of fainting once after inhaling the scent too deeply over and over.  :-)  I think this is a fragrance I would "risk" giving as a gift to someone -- I haven't found anyone yet who didn't love it!	1
My wife uses this Eau de Toilette and was thrilled that Vine offered a bottle to try.  I like it on her because it's a lite kind of sporty smell that's still feminine and very very sexy.  She's used it for a long time so I don't have to waste any time finding out if it's worth it...it is.  I hope every lady out there will give it a try and in the process give her husband or boyfriend or girlfriend or life partner (have I left anybody out?) a real treat.  I get randy every time she wears it but I control myself in public because I know she won't wear it again if i don't!!  A bit embarrassing an admission I guess...but the truth.  :-)	1
I LOVE THE SENT! ARRIVED ON TIME	1
I like the classic Burberry for Women for it's sensual practicality but I love Burberry Brit even more as it's lighter and more wearable. Burberry Brit is a great perfume for a woman who is transitioning from the more casual drug store or flowery variety of perfume to an older more defined and distinctive fragrance. She wants to smell more mature but not too old. Burberry Brit is perfect. It's flowery but fresh and sporty at the same time, musky but subtle. I've been a fan of Brit for the past 12 years, ever since it launched and always have a bottle handy. I love it in the summer, it smells fresh but not too flowery and sweet. It's got more staying power than D&Gs Light Blue, which has a similar flowery, lemony fragrance. This is a great fragrance for those who want to avoid heavier fragrances.  There is a Brit Sheer version that's just too mild, and a Brit Summer version that adds Green Tea for a lighter effect. If you ask me the original Brit is the best as it has more staying power. When you spray it on you smell the lime and pear, and then the middle notes of white peony, and as it dries down it leaves a delicious musky, vanilla finish. Top Notes: Italian Lime, Icy Pear, Crisp Green Almond Middle Notes: Sugared Almond, White Peony Base Notes: Amber, Mahogany, Vanilla, Tonka	1
I really liked this perfume. My biggest problem with Burberry is that a lot of their scents are cloying and flat, often with a chemical tang that I can't stand. However, this scent is really nice. It's a little bit spicy, and to me smells sweet without being childish. I think it's a nice, professional scent. Its a little bit stronger than I usually like, but Brit makes it work.	1
You gotta hand it to people who write the descriptions of perfumes.  Apparently, my nose is nowhere near as sensitive as theirs, and I'm not sure I caught the "fresh and playful top notes with Italian lime, icy pear and crisp green almond," nor the "sensual notes of vanilla bean."  I did however notice the sweetness of the scent, although I couldn't say if it has anything to do with "sugared almond" or not.  My wife and daughters use this, and when it first goes on it has a very *clean* smell, but after a moment I can definitely sense a sweet scent to it.  And I realized for the first time last night that as the evening wore on (we were at a friend's party) I could still smell it on my wife and there was definitely a floral feeling to it.  So, I guess they really do know what they're talking about when they describe it as they do.  Regardless, I think it's a very nice fragrance and it lasted very well outdoors on an evening where temperatures stayed in the mid 80s.  A very pretty bottle, too.	1
Design is something I don't understand..the name either..Brit?  The fragrance its self is pretty luscious to me.  Flowery but not overwhelmingly so..peony, pear, lime..vanilla + amber..a little woody, earthy even.  This is the lighter version of the actual perfume but it does last several hours.  Nice size bottle for the price.  Made in France :)	1
Both my daughter (19) and I LOVE this scent.  It is very light, not overwhelming as some fragrances are, flowery, sweet, spicy.....I'm not good at picking out exact scents, but this one is very pleasant.  One little squirt and you're set for the entire day.  Many perfumes give me a headache or make me sneeze, not this one.  The bottle is beautiful as well!  I would definitely recommend this, would make a lovely gift.	1
Very nice light fragrance!  It smells great on my wife.  The sugar/spice scent is very pleasing.  I would buy this again.	1
My wife is a fan of Burberry perfume, and although I dislike the scent of perfumes in general, I have to admit that this fragrance is quite nice. She applies the perfume lightly, which is a good thing. After all, too much of anything is not always good - this especially applies to this perfume - too much and the scent is overpowering.  My wife loves this stuff because even  with a light application, the scent stays strong for hours.  Speaking of which, she has described the scent as "airy" and "summery". She also likes the container and it is prominently displayed on the bathroom counter.  All in all, this is a nice fragrance that my wife loves. I find the scent to be pleasant and light - assuming that it is applied sparingly. This is perhaps the highest compliment - most perfumes drive me out of the room.	1
This is a very British scent.  It's a classic scent, with strong tinges of nostalgia.  The notes I smell most significantly are lime, pepper, vanilla, and some faint woods.  The opening is mostly lime and pepper, but the vanilla is quickly apparent, and rounds out the scent.  This is by no means a sharp lime.  Given those notes, it's hard to really imagine the experience of the scent, and I've found that what it evokes is more important to me than the notes.  This scent reminds me of an old manor house, classy and classic, but slightly down at its heels.  It needs repairs, but it is still putting its best face forward.  It brings to mind the old wood parlors, the sprawling grounds, and the titled family living inside.  For an interpretation more in keeping with those of us living stateside, it brings to mind New England college campuses in the fall, not at the beginning of the semester, but around November, when the leaves are falling off the trees, and everything is dampened by a cold rain, and people seek shelter in a wood-paneled library.	1
I really like the way this smells!  It seems to go on very strong though so a little bit will go a long way.  It comes in a very nice looking spray bottle and looks good wherever you choose to keep it.  I really can't think of anything negative to say about this product.  If you are looking for a cologne that smells great and is not feminine at all, this will fit the bill!	1
I liked this scent, it is musky with a hint of citrus. I sprayed it on my arm and it lasted for hours.  The only problem is that my 28 and 33 year old sons did not like it and stated it was for an older generation and my 30 year old daughter agreed. My overall impression is this for a mature man that enjoys a musky scent with a hint of citrus.	1
I enjoyed the scent, thought it was very manly. Too many men's perfumes are citrusy and that's pretty much it. This one has a musk to it that I prefer. I think the gift box is gorgeous dark blue, with a velvety finish.	1
I really like this scent on my husband and smell both the woodsy and citrus notes. He probably wouldn't wear cologne at all if not for me, so it's important that it's not overwhelming. Of the few bottles of cologne that I've given him, this Boucheron is the one he send to prefer most.	1
Viva La Juicy is a wonderful EDT, it just doesn't last very long.  It's predominantly flowers, and it smells well, purple, to me.  No gardenias, lilies, or other white flowers, and I can't put my finger on the ones that are there, but it's definitely floral without being cloying.  Usually, I find floral perfumes are too juvenile for me, but this one isn't.  It's sophisticated and appropriate for night or day for a lady of any age.  It's a great summer fragrance; I just wish it was longer lasting.	1
I gave this to my little sister for her birthday & she loves it.  She wears it everyday & it smells great on her.  It has a soft sweet floral smell.  She doesn't go overboard on scent, so I expect this should last her a while before she's hinting for another bottle.	1
I can't get enough of this scent! It's awesome!  I've been a fan of Burberry Brit in the past, but I wanted a change.  This is great!  It's a pretty large bottle so should last a long time!  It's not too overwhelming but is strong enough to not go unnoticed.  Definitely nice if you are looking for a change! Love it!	1
I've never tried this brand of perfume before but I am using this as a spring/summer fragrance on muggy hot days. This fragrance is heavier on the gardenia scent and is perfect with the subtler mix of mandarin, wild berries, and honeysuckle base. It dries down to a musky clean scent of gardenias with the mandarin top note and I do reapply after lunch as it wears off quickly. The bottle is easy to handle and the design of the pink flowers are subtle and eye catching and I love the cap's geometric jewel-like shape.	1
I was somewhat surprised to find that this was not a cream.  It took some getting used to, but I like it now.  I was not sure about its fragrance and have come to the conclusion that I like it.  It reminds me of the sea.  I take turns between this company  and another that I really trust.  So it does not get steady use.  I have used it under makeup and since it disappears so fast and so well, I am not certain that it is working.  The serum is light, not greasy and that is where my confusion lies.  However, I will continue to try it for another month or so and update this if I notice any real changes.  It took me a long to time to get this way and magic is not available yet, even on AMAZON.	1
This is a nice serum. Two pumps should cover your face, another for your neck. This is a clear viscous lotion that goes on easily and absorbs well. It is not sticky or tacky and the skin feels plumper and soft, lasts a few hours.  Nothing is going to make me look younger though :^D	1
This feels so good on your skin. It makes it feel so smooth and soft. I have been putting it on my hands too. It has a very fresh scent . I have only used it two weeks so I haven't noticed too much. I have a lot of dark pigmentation around my forehead and this seems to be lightning it. It might be wishful thinking but it looks lighter to me. I have not broken out with this like I normally do with skin serums and that is a big plus.	1
When it comes to serums there are ones that work okay, ones that don't work at all and ones that you can FEEL working and see results rather quickly. Im somewhat of a skincare fanatic. Ive used the $50 serums and the serums that cost twice as much as this for a single ounce. I have to say that this is one of my favorites and well worth the money if you can afford it. It goes on very nicely, quickly absorbing into your skin and you can feel it working almost instantly. It takes days, not weeks, to see the effects. Definitely does away with fine lines and gives skin an overall healthy and more youthful appearance as well as improving elasticity. If you're looking for a highly effective serum and this is in your budget, go for this product without reservation. Its one of the best Ive used.	1
A Clear serum that left my face feeling amazing. I use it in the morning and at night and the fine lines on my face are less noticeable. This is a very high-end product and the pump dispenses just the right amount. It is luxurious and makes me feel pampered.	1
Erno Laszlo brand of cosmetic products offers high quality products.  The Phelityl night cream is light weight so it only takes a small amount to cover your face.  I use it nightly and simply put very small dots of product on my cheeks, forehead and chin before smoothing it in.  After a few nights I noticed my skin was softer.  Even though this is night cream, I also use it in the mornings before applying my makeup.  I use other Erno Laszlo cleansing product and have found them to be very delicate on my fair skin.  This Phelityl cream has a pH level nearly identical to that of the skin, which maintains the fatty acids essential for skin function.  I love how nice my skin feels after using this night cream.  It's a little pricey, but since I use such a small amount this jar will last for quite a while.	1
Fragrance, and other irritating, sensitizing ingredients like limonene and linalool?!?! Seriously? If your older skin, and face it, that's who's likely to be wearing night cream, isn't touchy yet, this will make it so. Now, if you want a "glow" I suppose this would maybe irritate you into one, but there are far better ways that won't leave you itchy and flaky! Skip this!!!--bad for your skin!	-1
I wanted to love this cream.  I'd heard about Lazlo for years but could never afford it, so when I got the chance to do an Amazon Vine review in exchange for free product I jumped at the chance. But it doesn't perform any better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Max-Care-Anti-Aging-Collagen-Cream/dp/B071VW89Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super-Max Care Anti-Aging Collagen Cream</a>&nbsp;at a fifth of the price for 10 times the volume and is not nearly as good as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H2O-Plus-Oasis-Ultra-Hydrating-Cream-1-7-Ounce/dp/B01G8UTA9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H2O Plus Oasis Ultra Hydrating Cream, 1.7 Ounce</a>&nbsp;which is my favorite of all the creams I have reviewed for Amazon.  The cream went on well, felt synthetic, but appeared to be sinking in.  But after a while I rubbed my face and waxy residue rolled off.  It was worse in the morning when the petroleum-based gunk had to be rubbed off my face before I could wash it.  The cream is white, from Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, and has a very synthetic feel.  No wonder!  It contains mostly synthetic ingredients including petrolatum (Vaseline) and parafin wax.  The ingredients: Water, Glyceryl stearate, PEG-8,Cetearyl,Alcohol, Parafinninum, Mineral Oil, C10-13 Cholesterol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Imazodilyn, Urea, Carbomer, Methylparaben,  Sodium hydroxide, Polyparaben, Parfum, Benzyl salicylate, Coumarin, Citral, Eugenol and some other coloring and fragrance agents. in decreasing proportions. This is a cream based almost exclusively on common synthetic ingredients. The Amazon ad says that it is formulated without Phthalates, synthetic dyes and pigments, but it does contain parabens, petroleum-based wax, mineral oil and synthetic fragrance (which the Environmental Defense Fund suggests avoiding since the term "parfum" hides a panoply of potential toxins.) My DIL, who has sensitive skin could never use this cream.  More importantly, it lacks essential compounds that I rely on for my skin:  Hyaluronic acid, Collagen, Vitamin C, Ferulic acid, Niacinamide, Retinol, and peptides.  Save your money. The H2O+ cream I mentioned above is my favorite, but is not all natural.  Mix some shea butter with coconut and olive oils, especially infused with herbs if you want an all-natural oil.	-1
Very light. Not greasy at all and makes your skin feel wonderful.	1
Feels nice but not a fan of the fragrance or the price. Origins and other products feel just as good for a fraction of the price	1
As I've gotten older, I've tried to take better care of my aging skin. I used to wear Olay night cream but found it to be too oily. Because I do have oily skin, this too was a bit oily, but not as much as the Olay. I wake up and my skin is soft and not dry and itchy. There is a nice fragrance to this. Besides making my face soft, I really haven't used this long enough to see any other results (just a few days now). I will update my review once I'm done with the entire bottle.	1
What a rich, luxurious night cream. I applied a small amount using an upward motion from my neck to my face. I could feel the moisturizer sinking in. It is not greasy and feels smooth on my face within a few minutes. This night cream also has a lovely light scent of sweet birch and clove oil. You know when you are using a night cream of quality, you can feel it when you apply it to your skin and when you feel the softness of your skin. It is indeed luxurious.  There are no sulfates, phthalate, or parabens. This is a rich skin product awaiting your skin.  Recommended. prisrob 11-17-17	1
A classic deliciously moisturizing cream. This very lightly scented super moisturizing night cream felt wonderful when I applied it and my skin felt smooth and soft in the morning. Unlike another reviewer, I did not find this oily, at all. It was absorbed extremely quickly and really hydrated my skin. With winter coming that's especially important for me.	1
This is a unique night cream. It feels great on and has a very distinctive spicy scent. Nothing floral at all. It is not greasy and doesnt stain my bed linens. Its very nice.  I need to use retinol for age spots and discoloration; I add that on top of this. I prefer an all in one but it works fine using retinol with this. In terms of the tactile feel on the skin, this is one of the nicest Ive tried. My skin looks better in the morning.	1
This cream is a medium thick texture with a slight fragrance.  It can be felt on the skin for a long time, after applying.  A little bit sticky but not overly so.  A good texture for a night cream.  The ingredients: Water, Glyceryl stearate, PEG-8,Cetearyl,Alcohol, Parafinninum, Mineral Oil, C10-13 Cholesterol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, etc. etc. in decreasing proportions after these initial components.  So this is a cream based almost exclusively on common synthetic ingredients.  The box says that it is formulated without Phthalates, synthetic dyes and pigments, but it does appear to contain paragons, wax and synthetic fragrance.  It is a nice moisturizing cream but in my estimation not worth the price and not better than many others that are priced lower.	1
I was hesitant to buy this as it is not the cheapest primer on the market by any means.  However I am glad that I did.  it feels great on my skin and definetly adds a brightness.  I am a fan of Jane Irdeale make-up, but not all of her products are worth the money.  This one is.	1
Hypoallergenic. Smooths application of foundationa and shadow.	1
This is an awesome primer.  It's light and glides on easily.  I use it with a Clinique foundation and my makeup lasts all day looking great.  And it doesn't cause any kind of irritation or breakouts.  I wish I had discovered this years ago.	1
This is a light primer that works well with the Iredale base.  If using another brand of products, I would you another brand.	1
This product is fantastic! I am a beauty addict with problem skin that I am always trying to improve upon. I got a large sample of this and am glad I did, as I am not familiar with Jane Iredale products. The first time I used it, I mixed a few drops in with my foundation and was blown away by how much more evenly the foundation went on, and how "glowy" my face looked. I had followed my typical pre-foundation routine (serum, moisturizer, primer, then the foundation w/the Jane Iredale primer mixed in), and since then have been repeating these steps for a more natural looking face with great coverage. I have acne scarring (rolling/boxcar) which makes foundations tricky as they can highlight the indentations. This mixed into the foundation does a great job of tackling this particular issue. I'll be sure to buy a full size once I run out and am so impressed by this that I'll be checking out other Jane Iredale products.	1
Feels heavy like a thick lotion when you first start to apply - absorbs quickly and really keeps the powder in place. Very nice!	1
Great primer.  No color to it.	1
I love the consistency and fragrance of this primer.  You only need a small, pea sized amount for your whole face.  Makeup goes on and stays on better using this product.  Even though it costs more than other brands, it is well worth it and it's a large bottle that will last months.	1
This product seems to make application of makeup evenly easier. I would purchase again.	1
A another great product from Jane Iredale.  Every time I wear this under my make-up, some one will remark how nice my make-up looks.  I wear this under Dream Tint (I use peach brightner).  Makes my skin look smooth with that polished look you see on women who have that flawless look - you know they are wearing make-up but it is barely noticeable.	1
Great under makeup primer that leaves your skin feeling so smooth!  Smells so good and feels wonderful!	1
Smells great and goes on smooth.	1
Works very well to hide wrinkles!!	1
Another great product!!	1
Quick delivery and packaged well.  I have been using this product for about a year and love it.  I will definitely  order again.	1
Recommended by my dermatologist. Cleaner than other cosmetics so I don't feel concerned when using this product.	1
I have used Jane Iredale makeup for over 10 years. A Plastic Surgeon that used it on his face lift patients recommend it. I had a real problem with my skin when I turned 50. He was the only one that helped heal my skin with Jane Iredale skin care/ makeup. I have even started my 16 year old daughter using it. You can never start to early taking care of your skin. Customer Service is wonderful!	1
Not as creamy as I remember from past use but good coverage	1
This is a lovely primer, smells great, feels great and does the job. Definately recommended, helps your makeup go on smoother and you end up with a smooth finish.	1
I love Jane Iredale products and this is one of their best products.  Feels so good on my skin! Thanks	1
Just got this a few days ago, and rally like it.  it is silky, not greasy.  I truly hate cakey feeling make-up and generally prefer mineral Jane Irdale, but got this for evening.  It is one of the best liquid make-ups I have used.  It seems pricey, but you use very little.  ( I put on WAY too much the first time I used it.  1/2 pea size works well, especially when used with the JI primer.  NOTE.. this is the Light-Medium, and it is almost too light.  I can use it because I am fair skinned, but I may get the medium next time.  If you have any natural color to your face, go medium.	1
I thought I'd give this BB cream a try since I  really like Jane Iredale products and I always use  BB creams.  I like BB creams because I don't like to wear heavy foundations and I like the often one-step process of BB creams.  This review is for the Jane Iredale shape BB 5 in light-medium.  I was so disappointed for several reasons, the first being the color itself. It is incredibly yellow. I put it on and I looked very sallow and sickly. This looks nothing like the way it does on the Iredale website (or on Amazon) and it makes no sense for a medium-light look.  Also, for a BB cream it goes on very heavy - like a heavy foundation. The good thing is that it really covered all of my red marks and any other discoloration; really that was great. But it also looked like I had a heavy layer of paint on my face and for aging skin this is quite unflattering.  I am still a huge fan of Jane Iredale and think her products are of high quality, but I am going to have to give a big thumbs-down to this one. It's entirely too yellow, and too thick for a real BB cream which ideally could be used all by itself.  I love you Jane Iredale but this one gets a pass.	-1
Too light for me.  Returned.	-1
Best foundation for over fifty! Natural look too.	1
Daughter's favorite - recommended by dermatologist, better price in Amazon.	1
This is the only make up that helped me with my rosacea. It covers well and doesn't cause me redness.	1
Full coverage but not masky. I got the color 6 for my light medium toned skin and its a bit too light. 7 might have been a better match esp in summer. Easy to spread over sunscreen. You really need to use a good sunscreen under it (I use Bioderma Laser) since this won't be applied thickly enough to give adequate UV protection. I only need about 5 tiny dots on my face then blend well with fingers. It helps to warm the tube in my pocket before applying so that the product thins out better. No powder needed and I apply the tiniest dots under eyes and sides of nose as concealer. The only problem I have with it is the cyclopentasiloxane which is a known acne trigger for me, but so far so good as long as I cleanse it off well.	1
I received a sample of the product & I found the foundation to be full coverage & very thick. I set with a powder and sprayed with a setting spray & it stayed for most of the day. One and only downfall is that it's somewhat hard to get rubbed in evenly as most heavy coverage is.	1
I love this product and wear every day. I put a moisturizer under then I mix my glow time with equal parts smooth affair and a little missha  perfect# 23 and finish with J/E ( latte) amazing base... Flawless  skin for being 50 I get complements all the time!	1
very good coverage and good for my skin!!	1
This product produces great coverage and protection from the sun all day.	1
I use this product everyday, and I love it!	1
This is extremely thick- so I add a little moisturizer and it's perfect	1
Loved this when I first started using it, does give a lovely glow to the skin. I have recently stopped using it however because I think it accentuates the lines on my face (in my mid 50's). The colour range is a bit strange, I was using the No. 7 which is a tad too dark (&very yellow) so bought No. 5 which is a tad too light (&more pinky) so ended up mixing the two. I think this would be great on younger skin. I think the problem is with its very thick consistency which I have found makes lines worse.	1
The best product for your skin out there!!! I have a problem skin. This an amazing tool that helps to cover all your spots. Easy, breathier, beautiful. I even can sleep in it(it is not good though) but what I want to say that it is so hypoallergenic so nothing happens with your skin even if you leave it on over night!!!! You need just a little bit , and it will last long long time!!!! Love this product! will recommend to anybody!!!	1
My dermatologist recommended this and I haven't been disappointed.	1
Over the years I have had to go to a full coverage foundation. I love the BB foundations. Some have said that it was hard to find the right shade. I found that if I bought the two shade that were the closest to my color I could mix them together with my primer in two travel size jars. One mix would be for summer a tad bit darker & the other for winter a bit lighter. Works great & much faster to apply being the primer is already mixed in. You have to start with a little and play with it. Looking Good with Jane Iredale!	1
I like this Jane BB cream , tried another brand , it was greyish . Jane has great skin color tones , but could not get the BB in a color that suited my skin , so had to get the med. and med light , and I put a dot of each on the back of my hand , swirl it , and apply it on my face , as it says to . ya dot it , and apply by blending the dots in a downward motion ! not like traditional makeup at all . its very thick.  it keeps the skin moister feeling	1
I love the results I've been getting since using this product.  This makes my skin look so smooth and healthy.  Great coverage and sun protection also.	1
I like the bb cream by Jane , cauz its actually good for your skin . It looks nice , once you get the hang of application , it's very thick , and diffirent to work with. But its easy enough to get the hang of , a make up egg or sponge is key to the finish , unless you like a wet , or shiny look . I don't so I dab the sponge around , actually applying the cream , with the sponge works really well also. it leaves a good natural looking finish.	1
This does give a little extra glow and a little extra coverage.  If people have problems with it settling in lines, etc., they may need to moisturize more in that area and apply a little less product.  A little bit goes a long way, and you can always add more.	1
Jane Iredale products once again came through as being tops for great coverage.  You only have to use a tiny bit to get excellent results.  This is the best I have used.  I highly recommend this product.	1
Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Foundation/Contour Brush and Line Smoothing Micro-Exfoliation Tool applies mineral makeup beautifully. It feels good going on without any drag, and the powder has a nice smooth appearance on the skin. I usually only get this from new brushes; after a few uses the brushes pull. So far, this brush hasn't done this. As far as exfoliation, I don't know about that--wouldn't any brush do that? Maybe because this brush is so dense and the bristles are shorter than a traditional brush? Exfoliation or not, it is a nice brush.	1
I don't often ding a product for its price, after all, prices here are in a constant state of flux and everyone has a different definition of what is "expensive" or "too much money" for me to righteously make a judgement call.  So, I won't bring down my rating of this brush because of its current price....it may be different tomorrow.  I won't even ding this brush for its claims to "micro-exfoliate":  Who's to say?  I'm no expert, but I do know that using a gentle rotating brush on a motorized handle is just fine and very helpful.  What's to say that a makeup brush can't do some minimal exfoliating, too.  So if this company wants to give this brush some hard-to-define-and-analyze capabilities, I say, "Go right ahead.  I won't debate it with you."  (Which does not mean that I buy into the hoopla, but that it is not what I am concerned about in a makeup brush....)  What I will say is this:  This brush's bristles and the thickness of the bristles and the trim work on the bristles is superior in quality and workmanship.  It is a beautiful matte black brush with good balance and a bulge in a perfect place for my thumb and two fingers to grab hold.  And this brush reminds me of the size, shape and thickness of my "Korean-style" brush set.  And I love that set for its thick bristles, thick handle and short stature.  This is a better quality, though--by a long shot.  This brush is very easy to hold and not fatiguing.  Its short handle makes it easy to be very exact with my application.  And the thick concentration of very fine and soft bristles grab hold of foundation, blush and concealers.  But, when I apply it to my face, the bristles release their contents smoothly and evenly.  I could not ask for more from a brush, and I think that a quality brush like this will last a long time (with proper TLC and proper cleaning).  What I hoped for, but was disappointed to find missing:  Instructions for proper use and cleaning procedures and more info on the ambiguous claims.  It would have been nice to learn how to achieve the results that this Scott-Vincent Borba line promises.  But I can wing it well enough, because it's a really great brush!	1
I'm not a scientist. It sure seems like a lot of unnecessary hype was added to get this brush to sell. Anti fatigue? Micro-exfoliating? I don't think it does any of that, at least in my limited sample size... but I have to think it probably does some exfoliating if you were to use it more like a shaving brush with some sort of soap... but why would you? What this brush does well is be stiff enough to allow you to get make up on in less passes, especially if there are parts you want to go a little heavier on or if you use a lighter foundation. In fact in a lot of way it reminds me of a shaving brush in terms of its stiffness and feel, as opposed to other makeup brushes that are a little more like water color paint brushes and are good for lighter dustings and applications. This brush also holds a lot more make up in it, so if you wash it a lot you'll notice you're going through makeup much faster. As to the question of price... who knows? It seems to me a high quality natural shave brush is just a little more and probably 10x the bristles so this should be less, but compared to the brush my gf recently brought home from Sephora that was a little bit more expensive, this is a lot more bang for your buck.  Whether or not you like this brush will be dependent on a couple things: if you're expecting any obvious results of the anti fatigue properties (will update if any are found); how heavy a layer of makeup you like to put on (it worked exceptionally well when applying mens stage makeup cause we needed more); and how much better you expect this to be than brushes you can buy on amazon on the cheap. Its not a miracle brush and if you're expecting that, as with most beauty products, you'll be disappointed. But it is denser and thicker and stiffer than most other brush out there.	1
soft enough to be gentle on your face and eye area.  Yet the brush is firm in the area you move it, I was surprised by the non spreading of the bristles, which is great as you don't end up touchING an area that you were not focused upon.  I am going to replace an expensive blusher brush for this compact, yet very effective brush.  I use it for light foundation, blusher or soften two colors on my eye lids.  Surprisingly versatile.	1
I don't wear a lot of makeup, just a bit of foundation and some blush.  I had never heard of applying liquid foundation with a brush but I thought, "Why not?"  I was amazed at the difference this brush made.  It gave me an air-brushed look, and my foundation covered my facial imperfections much better than my normal method of applying foundation with my fingers.  I didn't think a brush could possibly be worth what this one cost, but trying it out has changed my mind.  It's worth every penny!	1
Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Foundation/Contour Brush and Line Smoothing Micro-Exfoliation Tool  Its nice. Its smaller than I thought it would be so I tucked it in a teeny ziplock and have been using it on the go. I really don't notice any exfoliating going on via this brush. Maybe its just me?	1
used this to apply powered foundation to my face. It gives great coverage, the brush fits nicely in my hand as well. I like the angled bristles makes application around the nose area easier. What I did not like is the face the black bristles kept falling out on my face as I swirled the foundation around. That got annoying but as for ease of use and coverage it is a great tool.	1
This is what I've been looking for, but I didn't know it. I have a drawer full of assorted foundations. I've been striving for that airbrushed look I see on other women, but my application with my fingers or a sponge never gets me that medium to full coverage. Right out-of-the-box, this changed everything. The brush is very soft. I dampened it, then put foundation on my hand. Then I dipped the brush end into the foundation and stroked it on my face. The foundation I've been using for awhile looked totally different. It had a much smoother texture, yet looked very natural. The quality of the brush is much higher than what I've been looking for in stores like Ulta. Because the bristles are so short, I assumed it would be stiff, but it is extremely soft. This changes everything.	1
No part of this brush is scratchy or stiff.  I tried it out with liquid tinted moisturizer, powder eye shadow, powder highlighter and blush.  Changing colors hasn't been a problem; I just tap the brush on the edge of the sink to dislodge extra powder and then move on with blush, bronzer, etc.  All my makeup falls in a complementary grey-brown-plum range.  Colors that don't fall in the same sort of realm might be problematic; blue to light beige for example.  The brush handle is easy to grasp and allows for grip adjustment with one hand--the handle is a bit under 2" around.  The brush was designed with function in mind! The angled top is perfect for getting under cheek and brow bones--given the size of the brush head, it's remarkable how it is able to apply eyeshadow in the crease of my eye but still accommodate liquid tinted moisturizer all over my face without taking a ton of time.  I love this thing!  I highly recommend it!  It's perfect!	1
This is a nice firm bristled brush that is great for applying makeup.  It is rather expensive though but Scott-Vincent Borba products are generally of high quality and for those able to pay for such quality.	1
OK. I read the fine print on the package that says this wonder brush is specifically designed for use with the Borba Anti-Fatigue pressed mineral powder. While I'm interested in seeing how that foundation does work with the brush, I have to say that the bristles did not reject La Prairie or Bare Minerals. In fact, the brush gave me the most even application of both and made my skin look as if I'd just used airbrush makeup.  The gentle contour of the bristles works with the natural shape of the face--which explains why the brush feels so good when I use it. It's a small but powerful piece of equipment that, along with my Sephora BeautyBlender sponge, will be a permanent part of my skincare routine. To think this is from the same guy that produced the Borba water!	1
This is my first experience with products by Scott-Vincent Borba.  The brush is a little small to be a foundation brush for everyday use, but it might serve well as a foundation brush for travel.  However, it is very soft and plush, making it extremely comfortable to use.  A clear benefit is that it works with powder, liquid, and cream foundations.  I used it with powder foundation and was pleased with the smooth coverage I experienced.  I did not notice any settling in lines or wrinkles.  The brush is slanted so it is very good for applying coverage around the nose and eyes.  This also means it can do a good job if used to apply bronzer to contour the cheeks or chin area.  Overall, I would recommend this product with the caveat that the brush should really be larger to use as your go-to foundation brush.	1
I admit I was a skeptic when it came to recognizing the value of a foundation brush.  Why purchase an additional brush when I had ten perfectly good fingers with which to apply my foundation?  Then I tried the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Foundation/Contour Brush and Line Smoothing Micro-Exfoliation Tool and discovered why I needed a brush like this!  I tried the Scott-Vincent Borba Foundation/Contour Brush using a tinted moisturizing cr&egrave;me and with a liquid, moisturizing foundation.  The ease with which I was able to apply my foundation evenly and smoothly was amazing.  There was no streaking or blotchiness; my skin looked as if I had received a professional makeover.  However, I did feel as if I was using more product than I used previously; the tinted moisturizing cr&egrave;me usage was about double that of my fingertip application method.  Because there was less chance of my fumble fingers dropping the bottle, I felt this brush was better suited to my using it with liquid foundation.  The quality of this brush is evident.  The bristles are tightly packed and the cut surface is smooth and even.  The ferrule fits snugly on the smooth, easy-to-hold handle.  The Scott-Vincent Borba Foundation/Contour Brush is an ideal size for ease-of-handling and for travel.  The total length is approximately 4 ; the brush head angles from  down to  and has a 5/8 diameter.  The circumference of the handle is about 2.  The one downside I see with regard to the Scott-Vincent Borba Foundation/Contour Brush is its price.  While I believe you get what you pay for, it is still much higher in price than other well-reviewed flat-top foundation brushes.  Although I am very pleased with the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Foundation/Contour Brush and Line Smoothing Micro-Exfoliation Tool, prospective purchasers will need to determine whether its cost is worth it to them.	1
First of all, let me say that I'm completely in love with this brush! I've never used a brush to apply liquid foundation before--I usually use my fingers or a beauty blender sponge--and this is a revelation! My foundation goes on so much more evenly, and it's very easy to build up coverage in certain areas. The bristles do tend to suck up the liquid, so I am using more foundation than normal, but with these results, it's worth it! The brush seems to be very good quality, too--I expect it to last a long time.  Here's what I don't like: There are only minimal instructions for use (you can see them in the pictures of the product by the description), and there are NO cleaning instructions. I've been washing mine with a little hand soap, and that seems to be working fine for now, but I would have appreciated instructions. Also, I have absolutely no idea if it really exfoliates like it claims to, and I'm not sure how I would even be able to tell.  Overall, it's a great brush, and I'd highly recommend it ... if you can justify the price!	1
Good can be used on lids too, got at DERM DR then found here	1
good product	1
Good to moisturize the area	1
The best skin care I have ever used!	1
Good standby for someone who is allergic to everything.  Good under concealer.	1
Gentle and effective product.  Did not cause my eyes to burn.	1
I am not an unrealistic person in that I  realize that no product will take away my dark circles or lines, but I do want a product that will moisturize the delicate eye area and not break me out. I am in my early 30's and my skin is a zit machine so I am obsessed about not putting stuff on my face that will break me out. That's what lead me to this product as it says it's oil free. To be honest, I am really surprised on how much I like this product. I feel safe putting it on my skin since it's oil free and I love the way it feels plus I do see a slight difference after using it for a week now. Compared to other products of this caliber out there, this product is fairly priced and can be found cheaper at other websites (that is where I order it from). I also love EltaMD's commitment to not test on animals and they have even earned PETA's seal of approval for a non cruelty company. My only complaint is the air tight packaging as I like to be able to open a bottle to get every last drop. Overall a great product and far superior to the Teamine eye complex I used to use.	1
No idea how this stuff got so many rave reviews. Seriously. I'm very fair completed and it looks like crap. Maybe if you already have some color it looks ok, but otherwise, fonky. It's orangish and doesn't cover well at all. Just makes my legs look orange tinted, especially out in the sun.  So disappointed. Wouldn't recommend this at all.	-1
Contrary to some other reviews it was very orange. It's too bad because the scent is nice. I'm going back to Lancome's Flash Bronzer.	-1
Have used for years and love it!	1
The color is beautiful and shimmery for a night out. If you want a more natural daytime look, the color may be too "pinkish" and glittery. I tried mixing it with plain lotion and it helped tone it down to provide a tan glow. Great to use on legs!	1
Love it.  Subtle glow, easy to apply.  Leaves your skin looking great.  If you already have a tan, makes your skin look even better.	1
Works well especially with a little lotion and does not  rub off easily if allowed to dry thoroughly.  Good color if you don't have really fair skin.	1
What I like about this iron: The cord swivels around, which makes it easy to handle. It heats up very quickly and the power light stops blinking so you know when it is ready to use. When I put it down, the heated part naturally lifts so I don't need to worry about it touching the counter. I also appreciate the glove that is included so no burned finger tips.  What I don't like: there are no options for heat settings. The worst thing though is the bumps. They might sound good in theory to keep your hair from slipping off (which never has been a real problem for me in the smooth wands)--but unless you get your hair to land only between the bumps which is pretty impossible, you end up with little bumps in your curls which look really weird.  I'm sorry to say that I don't recommend this product.	-1
There's a lot to love about this curling iron. It heats up very fast (less than a minute) and it's easy to use once you get the hang of it. It's not the same as a "traditional" curling iron with a clip, so that takes a bit of practice. But the curls are cute and last all day.  Because their isn't a clip, you have to wrap your hair around this curler by hand. So that you don't burn yourself, they include a heat-resistant glove that you can wear. So far this works great and keeps my hands safe without complicating things.  I'm happy that they included a long cord.  My only complaint is that I wish they sold a thicker version because if you have a lot of hair, it takes a while to curl because it's wrapped around such a thin wand.	1
The Sultra heats up quickly and is light enough to handle. I haven't used it enough yet to be skilled at it and I think it will take a fair amount of practice to get the results that are on the box.  The cord swivels easily and doesn't get in the way.  I think it would be better if the barrel was slightly longer for my below the shoulder hair to fit on it but it could be my less than skilled usage of it.	1
I've been experimenting with this product for about a month now.  My hair: My hair is naturally wavy  but will either look flyaway, frizz, puff, or get curly depending on the weather.  The unit: The product has one power switch that slides either on or off. It does not accidentally turn off during use. There is no temperature control. The cord is super-long allowing a better range of motion OR a second person to assist with styling.  The glove: There is a glove to use. This is not meant to directly touch the wand with as it isn't 100% heat proof...more like 75%. It serves t prevent accidental burns when holding the air in place. The glove is HUGE.  I find this an issue as I have small hands and it makes it difficult to comb through a section of hair before wrapping it.  Use: The directions indicate to wrap the hair around the wand, hold it for 15 seconds and then unwrap and hold until the curl is cool. I personally do not have enough time to do this so I do let the hair hang to cool. I have not experienced any problems with this.  Results: I've used this to make various types of curls and waves. Larger sections will make it wavier. Obviously smaller sections will create shorter springy curls.  I've had excellent results with all types of looks that I have attempted.  I never wrap the ends of my hair.  The results have lasted two days.  They would probably last longer but I prefer not to wash my hair less often than every other day.  Cons: The glove, while necessary, is awkward to use because it doesn't fit right. I am suspicious of any product that does not trust my ability to judge what temperature is best for my hair. It is my hair, after all. I have had it my entire life so I'm pretty sure I can make an informed decision about settings. The reasons above are why I gave the product 4-stars versus 5. There is no way to control the temperature	1
This is a good, heavy-duty curling iron. It heats up quick, and curls well. I like the textured wand, which I've never seen before, that keeps my hair from slipping.	1
This is a quality curling iron that can be used to make beautiful curls even if you don't have really long hair. My hair is shoulder length and not completely straight but I used this iron to put curls in my hair the way I wanted them. I do not care for perms because of the chemicals so I decided to try this iron out and after following the instructional video and papers I was able to get a really nice style with tight even curls that made it look like I had just had a perm. The iron is a bit more expensive than a regular curling iron but worth the price when you think about how much it would cost going to the salon to have it done all the time. It pays for itself in very little time. Again this is quality iron that does not damage your hair and you do not need to put a product on before you curl your hair. The video shows using a hair product but I found the product was not all that necessary. I can even say that my hair looks and feels better. The handle is easy to grip and hold and maneuver. The chord did not seem to get in my way and the instructions were easy. Highly recommend.	1
This curling wand works great and creates long lasting curls. For me, I only need to leave the hair on about 10 seconds and a beautiful curl is produced. I do not feel that this is damaging my hair and the preset heat setting is enough for me. It also comes with a pad to lay the wand on, a glove to protect your hand (which I do not use), and an auto shut off.  So while this wand works great for me, there are a few things I am not crazy about:  >No heat setting (it automatically heats up to 360 degrees so you cannot go higher or lower if you wish). While this setting works for me, I know a few folks who would prefer higher / lower.  >The on / off button is a bit odd. You switch it on, and it will blink. Once it stops blinking , that is your sign that it is ready to use. The blinking light is a little bit hard to see and the button is located where my thumb constantly hits. Not a deal breaker but just something I noticed.  >Price point is very high (currently at $130)! While this wand produces beautiful, long lasting curls  I have achieved the same effect with a $40 ceramic wand	1
Love this color	1
I am in love with this toxic nail polish. I understand that nail polish isn't good for you but this color is brilliant. Nice soft perfect for fingernails. Professional color.	1
One of my favorite nude colors. My Very First Knockwurst is a pinky taupe, it has a creamy/white base underneath so goes on clear and bright. COOL not warm. No yellow undertones at all. But definitely goes on neutral taupe not pink. LOVELY coverage, covers in 2. NOT sheer, it is not good for a French manicure; if you want a beautiful sheer fro a French Manicure get OPI Bubble Bath, which also has a pink undertone and is sheer and lovely!	1
What can I say? It's OPI! Beautiful, long lasting color. I get lots of compliments!	1
I really like the color of this gloss. I got yummy mummy. It is such a pretty shade of nude. Looks way different on the lips than in the bottle. Will probably look good on all skin tones. The gloss tastes like fruit. I like it. But I don't know if everyone will.	1
It is a nice color but it is NOT a liquid lipstick! It is a lip gloss.	-1
I got this in Toff and absolutely love it.  I have light strawberry blonde hair and medium/fair skin that is neutral in tone and I find this mauve to be very wearable.  I'd describe it as nude mauve and on me, it's like my lip color, but better.  (It's slightly darker.)  I find it very easy to apply and it lasts about as long as a lip gloss.  That said, 'liquid lipstick' kind of seems like marketing speak to me.  The texture reminds me of thicker, more opaque glosses like Buxom Full-On Lip Cream more than it does a lipstick.  For me that's absolutely okay because I've always been more of a gloss girl and find thicker, opaque, creamy glosses to be more forgiving than a typical lipstick.  However if you're looking for a more typical lipstick finish, appearance and wearability you'll probably be disappointed.  I also found myself wishing it was more like Smashbox Be Legendary Long Wear Lip Lacquer which goes on with a similar texture and finish but also adjusts to a lip stain so you still have color even when the glossiness has worn off.  But even without that I still really like it and find myself reaching for this as a go to color.	1
Love the color and it has great staying power.	1
Very nice liquid lipstick.  Color is true.	1
love	1
I am hooked on butter London Lippy's and the Liquid Lipstick collection is no exception. I love the application and coverage. It easily glides on like a thick gloss and then the consistency eventually becomes like a lipstick. It's doesn't dry out my lips, which is what all the Lippy's are consistently about, and somehow it lasts longer than your average lipstick, gloss, balm or stain. This color is a sheer deep red so is not as deep as a matte and can go on by itself or used to layer over another color. It has a very yummy vanilla scent and a doe foot applicator.	1
Butter London makes some delicious lip gloss. Thick and vibrant. This color is a bit brighter than you expect, but it smells great and feels wonderful on your lips.	1
Wonderful product.. Does what is says it will do.. It's a "sensitive skin" product.  I've been using this and other Avene products for many years.. They WORK	1
This has not caused any bad reaction from my skin or eyes. I have only used it a few times, so I can not report on the efficacy of the product; but, I do not see any immediate issues of irritation.	1
I purchased my first Avene product from a dermatologists.  I have since purchased other products from Amazon and I like all of them.	1
This stuff is AMAZING.  I've been using this for about a week and I love it.  Old age was,slowly creeping up on my eyes crinkles, dark circles just plain old tired eyes.  Well i started using this faithfully every night and the dark circles lighted up, the fine lines around my eyes disappeared.  My eyes are rejuvenated.  I will purchase this again.	1
Tried quite a lot of brands, the best so far for my very sensitive skin. Avene products are great	1
This unscented, thick cream provides instant soothing to dry and irritated skin. I'm using it after hand washing in colder months when my skin is dry. The tube size is perfect for popping in your purse or car console. My boyfriend uses it too since there's no girly scent to prevent him.	1
Great product, expensive but very soothing. It's terrific for very dry, itchy skin, like you get in winter. I'd prefer if it was a 100ml size, so it could be taken along when you travel. Five stars.	1
Very nice, thick & creamy hand cream with a light verbena scent. It's thick and oatmeal-colored, but not too thick to easily blend. Leaves your hands smooth and not sticky at all.  I really like this hand cream and would definitely purchase in the future for our family, who suffers from heat-inspired eczema. It's cold out now, so we don't have any outbreaks, but will continue to use in summertime.  Normally use "O'Keefe's Working Hands" at night, but really like this for daytime.	1
I have eczema on my elbows, and I have yet to find a cream that takes away the itching and dryness. I have used vaseline in the past, but it is very greasy, and it doesn't really help. This cream really takes the itch away, and it seems to keep my skin softer. I also like that it is unscented, so it doesn't interfere with any perfume that I am wearing. It doesn't go on greasy, it goes on pretty smooth, and lasts most of the day. I like this cream better then anything else I've tried so far.	1
First of all...I don't have skin problems but I do have really dry skin...especially in the winter months.  This hand cream soothed my dryness with its first application.  What I also love about it is that it is not thick or greasy.  Lots of lotions are very oily and it takes a while to get rid of that oily residue.  This just left my hands soft and smooth without any heavy residue.  Would I buy this?  I think I might.  I love products with Ahava.  I love the feeling my hands have...soft and smooth without a slippery feel!	1
Wow!  I have really high hopes for this cream!!  I have suffered with severe eczema for years and have used countless treatments.  I always end up turning to a steroid based remedy when the flare ups get really bad.  I'm trying to break that cycle.  I've been using the Eucerine Eczema relief and I do like it for moisturizing, but it doesn't do a lot for clearing the eczema.  The minute I got this cream I put it on my hands and arms.  I always worry about a product making my eczema worse, so I waited, and waited. Luckily, no adverse reaction.  The cream is thick but not as thick as the Eucerine.  There has been zero burning or irritation, no itching. GREAT sign!  Also, my skin feels nourished.  There is a smell to it and that worried me.  But it is absolutely non-irritating to my skin, which is surprising.  I always feel like anything with a scent will trigger my eczema but this doesn't!  It smells kind of like an essential oil or earthy tone.  I don't mind it at all.  I can't wait to continue using it.  I will post updates and let you know if it continues to be a winner.  So far, the areas that I have used it on has decreased redness AND no itching whatsoever.  That's pretty huge in my book.  Highly recommend!	1
This might be a great product for the skin, but I cannot get past the chemical smell. It stinks.. and the stench lingers on. My husband walked in after I had put this one, wrinkled his nose and said "what's that smell?" I had to admit it was me.  It did dissipate in 45 min or so, I didn't wash it off to see how long it lasted, but that was 45 minutes to long for me.  the one time I put it on it didn't seem to irritate my skin and it did feel softer but the smell is a deal breaker for me.	-1
This hand cream reminds me a lot of Aveeno in scent, texture, absorbency and effectiveness.  My hands are always dry year-round but super dry in the winter.  Applying lotion to them during the winter is about as effective as trying to cool a hot skillet with a drop of water. Hand creams typically last about as long as that drop as well.  Hand washing, particularly with antimicrobial soaps,  really dries them out, so I need intensive hand creams that can resist at least two washes  This cream softens my hands and keeps them soft for a while. It does a good job of maintaining moisture after hand washing and my hands don't really dry out until after a couple washes.  The cream is a little on the thick side and leaves a slightly greasy residue for a few minutes before fully drying into the skin.  It's a good cream and softens hands nicely. It compares favorably to Aveeno or Eucerin.  It's more expensive than those two but there are definitely benefits that justify the premium price.  Those benefits include the inclusion of Dead Sea salt along with being free of paraben, SLS/SLESl, synthetic fragrances, petroleums, harsh synthetics and GMOs.  The manufacturer AHAVA also does not participate in animal testing. If you're hypersensitive to synthetic chemicals or insist on cruelty-free products only, it's worth the price.	1
I don't have eczema, but I garden year around and my hands get pretty beaten up. This lotion works well to protect and heal them. I am using it before I start (under my gloves) and again when I am finished. It is really making a difference in eliminating the raw feeling they sometimes get. It leaves a light coating on my skin at first, but the feeling goes away. Good product.	1
To be honest I am not a big fan of using hand cream and even any type of lotion. Because I don't like the oily feeling. This AHAVA hand cream totally changes my view. The cream is thick but easy to apply. Only couple pea size of cream is able to cover the hands well. The best part is you can feel a nice and thick cover on your hands but it gets absorbed very quickly so there is no such oily touch. Usually I only use hand cream in the very dry days but with this I have no problem using it every day. Also the smell is really good, not intensive just a light and elegant smell. Highly recommended.	1
The thickness of this hand cream does wonders for skin. It's not a wet liquidy type lotion, but a thicker hand cream that when it gets into the skin keeps my hands and feet moisturized for quite a while.  I don't really smell any kind of fragrance in it. Not to say it doesn't have a scent of any kind to it. It's just not what I'd called perfumed with anything.  This cream will be wonderful for the upcoming cold winter months when my hands get so dry they feel raw. The winters here get well below zero and the dryness of the air sucks all the moisture right out of your skin, making the cold feel like it's burning it your skin. A long lasting lotion is the only way to get relief from the dryness and this hand cream will be perfect for it.  If you're looking for a super thick long lasting hand cream to help with painful or itchy dry skin, this works great!	1
I have two little boys so change a lot of diapers and wash my hands a lot. The back of my hands get very dry and chapped. I also get occasional eczema, especially in the winter. This cream helped alleviate the dry skin but didn't help with the itchiness as much as I thought it would. It's nice smelling and a creamy texture. The color is a dark beige, which is darker than other creams I've used. It's an overall good cream and in league with some other high quality creams I have tried.	1
I work in an environment with near zero humidity in the air, and frequent hand washing makes my hands extremely dry and prone to looking chapped and older. I've tried many hand creams with varying results; some very thick offerings are longer lasting but feel greasy and less dense creams seem to wear off too quickly and need frequent reapplication. I've heard of the benefits of the minerals in certain types of mud and especially when they're used as masks at home or in spa settings. Not sure if it's the mud content or other ingredients in this cream, but the effect after just a few applications was amazing. It's easily absorbed and my hands look more youthful and healthy than they have in years. The cream seemed a little expensive at first, but the results speak for themselves. My skin doesn't have that delicate, thin appearance, but look moist and healthy again!	1
I have super dry hands due to my work and have issues with dermatitis. This cream is very appealing to me for a number of reasons. It seems to calm the irritation immediately and works better than other creams I've used. It's very light, and penetrates quickly (I have dry skin, so it may be different in your case). It DOES have a scent but it dissipates quickly. It's sort of a tannish color (instead of white), more like a flesh tone color which may work better for deeper skin tones.  I do plan to use it as it is recommended; "after every hand washing" since washing my hands is what soemtimes triggers a breakout of dermatitis. I haven't had the opportunity to use it long term, so I'll update my review if any allergies or concerns arise. So far I'm very pleased and will continue to use this lovely soothing cream. I'm also using it on my feet and it works well there too! 5 stars.	1
This stuff REALLY moisturizes!  It's kind of gross smelling; very plain, and it goes on as a tan mud that you have to rub in.  Plus it leaves a bit of a greasy feel. But it's wonderful in the moisturizing department. Just a few applications of this twice a day for a few days and it eliminated a ton of the dry skin bumps (keratosis pilaris) that I had crop up with a vengeance since the heater has been on.  Since it IS greasy, I would put it on at night when I was relaxing or just before bed; obviously you don't want to put it on before you go out somewhere unless you want to look like a greased pig! LOL  But it works awesomely for eliminating stubborn dry spots.  I not only used this on my arms, but my hands and feet as well. It soaked in and made my feet SO much softer.  Definitely recommend it, just be aware of it's drawbacks I listed above	1
If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I've had problem skin since I was a kid. Even though it's under control, I still have large pores. Yes, I use all kinds of primers and foundations that will minimize them, but this product actually made my pores appear to be way more reduced than anything I've used before. Fantastic! Buy it!!	1
I was skeptical that anything would make the pores on my nose look smaller and less visible.  I've had oily skin since I was fourteen.  I dislike wearing foundation so I wanted something that would simply make my pores invisible and this does that.  It uses a combination of ingredients that actually shrink the pores, as well as absorbing the oil that is embedded in them.  Other products meant to hide or shrink pores have been terribly drying to the skin, but this leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy and the oils seem to be balanced, without getting stuck in the pores.  I've noticed that with daily use, this actually improves the texture of my skin so much that I have started to use it on my entire face in the T-Zone.  The oil production is lessened and the texture has a smoother appearance.  I wear this at night also under my night cream, and wake up to perfect looking, smooth skin.  I know Bioderma has been around a very long time, but this was the first time I've had a chance to try a product from this line.  I'm  impressed.  This is a high end skin refining cream for oily skin and enlarged pores.	1
This product is from the sebium line It is meant as a treatment product to regime poors Ive been using it 10 days so too soon to see a difference Like all Bioderma products it is elegant and nice to use	1
My teenage daughter has combination skin. She has been using this for a couple of weeks and has definitely noticed a difference in the presence of pores around her nose area, especially. It's light weight and doesn't feel heavy. It absorbs up any oil that's left on her skin after cleansing it. It doesn't irritate or leave any redness. This has become a regular part of her morning routine since discovering it.	1
I'm a bit obsessive when it comes to my skin. My pores, for the most part, are perfect - except for around my nose area. Now I've been told they aren't that large but compared to the rest of my pores they are and I've hated that. I have a long and excessive skin care routine and nothing seemed to refine them away. This product was the exception. I rarely give skin care products 5 star reviews but this one really impressed me. It didn't work overnight by any means, but after about a week of use I noticed a huge difference and now my pores are all barely visible. Very good product. If you have stubborn pores that just won't reduce in size this is definitely worth a try.	1
This works just fine for me about 60-70% of my visible pores- all but the largest ones.  I mainly have noticeable pores on my nose and on the skin around it, and my forehead and chin- My "T" zone.  Many of my smaller, but visible, pores fade into oblivion and the skin looks great with this. This really blurs the pores on the skin across my nose really well, though I can still see the ones on my chin and tip of my nose where the larger ones are with no change.  The ones on my forehead look noticeably smaller. This comes out like a white lotion that's a bit thin, and it is very easy to apply.  My skin starts to absorb it immediately.  It doesn't feel drying to me, though it seems to really cut down on oiliness and shine. THE ONE DOWNSIDE is that I notice in a couple of areas where I have some very fine purplish short spider veins, right around my nose and one on my chin-, they appear more defined and visible after I use this.  My solution is to just avoid using it in these areas. It doesn't have a scent and seems very gentle. The SeBium Mat Control product, when used with this, really work well together to control shine and pores all day.  These two products, used together, seem to amplify the mat, smooth appearance each one of them has on my skin.	1
From my daughter: works nicely to smooth skin and make pores smaller before applying makeup. It is lightly scented and didn't irritate my skin. Goes on smoothly and feels nice on skin.	1
I am on a constant mission for the perfect primer. Kept hoping someone would finally just make skin care that would help my pores, without piling more make up on my face. Bioderma is that thing that listened to me & I'm sure many others.  I don't know quite how to explain it, as it does something, nothing has ever done before. It mattes your skin without drying yet it feels soft & taken care of. And pores, on a clean, no make-up face seem to blend into your skin. Under make-up, with no primer, it doesn't peel or roll just gives a flawless base.  I have huge pores on my forehead & nose from years of oily Tzone. I have become an expert at make up coverage but always just wanted my best face, naturally. I've used glycolic masks & microderm scrubs but once the pores are there, they are there.  I used this 2 ways. Daytime under make up & Nightime to sleep. Both times, washed with Cetaphil foam, then patted (not rubbed) Bioderma into forehead & nose only.  At night, applied eye & face cream before bed, woke up to smoother texture on Bioderma areas. No burning, itching, irritation & I have annoyingly sensitive skin. The weird part was, it felt like my skin's natural oils were actually helping my skin with the Bioderma.  Did a couple differerent daytime routines. One with full make up and the other, brush & go. Full make up, patted my primer/ foundation on top of Bioderma areas Got same wear. The Bioderma performed just like any other moisturizer I would use yet, made pore areas disappear.  Brush & go was impressive. No primer, just Bioderma, under eye concealer & OFRA banana powder. (See note * on banana powder.) All I can say is, I ran into a work friend at Costco who thought I looked photoshopped. May be my new favorite go to combo.  *If you never used banana powder, try it. Even a novice can make it work with cotton ball application. It hides every flaw on your face & somhow doesn't settle in even eye area lines.*  This is the perfect skin care product that helps your skin while giving you high end make up results, naturally.	1
I am 55 and  have started dealing with drier skin.  I may not be the best market for this product.  I liked the feel and smell and it did not irritate my skin.  I felt like it did improve my pores but not as dramatically as I hoped.  It did not dry out my skin but I didn't find it especially moisturizing either, but, again, I feel like I am at the stage where I need a lot of moisture.  Overall a good product	1
I am a huge fan of Bioderma! I just cannot get enough of their products! This is something that I use on people that have oily or combination skin tone. This does an amazing job of holding back the oil and filling in the pores. If you have combination skin, I would use this in zones. I usually put this where the person would have larger pores or oily areas, which is usually in the t-zone. I don't think I could live without this in my kit!	1
Does the job.	1
good stuff	1
This stuff kept me shine free during a 90 degree day at Disneyland. If that doesn't sell it, I don't know what will	1
Eternity Aqua is a light and fresh fragrance. Subtle but distinctive and is redolent of being at the beach gathering shells with the wind whipping through your hair with it's sweet aquatic smell.  It is a lovely scent for someone who really like clean smelling and not over powering fragrances.  I prefer strong white flower (jasmine,gardenia, tuberose), but this is a beautiful change for summer since I no longer live in a beach community.  The only downside is this faded very quickly on me. Like within a half hour quick.  I do have some weird body chemistry, but with a high end parfum I expect it last a couple hours.  Overall, it's lovely. If you like sea breezes, clean linen and light florals you'll love this!!	1
Whether you like a perfume or not is such an individual preference, it's impossible for words to tell you if you're going to like it, especially as it blends with your own body chemistry. A quick glance through the reviews on Amazon (and elsewhere) of Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua (and every other fragrance) proves that some women adore, while others loathe, the very same product.  That said, I got this for my wife, who is a mature woman (not in the trendy 20-something youthful market). She has had a few weeks to try this perfume while we move into the warmer months. Her analysis is that she enjoys it, finds it refreshing and not overpowering, and feels it is her daytime, go-to, summer scent. As one of her choices for going out in the evening, she prefers Calvin Klein Euphoria. I happen to like the Euphoria better, both in scent and the bottle itself -- a little more creative in design.  It's hard to beat those Manhattan copywriters for description! "A fragrance like a clean crisp ocean breeze. Top notes - White peony, crisp pink lady apple and cucumber water. Mid notes - Tiare, magnolia, gardenia, jasmine. Base notes - Sundrenched woods, cedarwood, transparent musk." Those things are important to read! I saw one woman's review where she said she hated it, because it smelled like peonies. LOL! The first "top note" is "white peony," so if you despise the flower, you are not going to like this perfume! In fact, both my wife and I note the apple as a highlight. This fades after an hour or so to more of the mid-notes, which include flowers we both enjoy, including magnolia, gardenia and jasmine. Some other reviewers hate "something woody" in the base-notes. Not our experience. Cedar and light musk are both fine.  By the way, Calvin Klein's fragrance line is famous for "Eternity." This won a coveted FiFi Award as the top women's fragrance back in the late '80's. It was inducted into the Fragrance Hall of Fame in 2003. You could be forgiven for thinking that Eternity Aqua is something similar. Not so! They were created by different perfume makers and have little other than (part of) a name in common. I was a little surprised to learn that the male versions of these eau de parfums also bear nothing other than name relationship, also made by other designers. Therefore, if you like "Eternity," you will have to try "Eternity Aqua" for yourself, as it has no scent-relationship to it's famous older sister.  You might not know or even care that Calvin Klein has not owned his perfume companies for a long time. The CK fragrance lines used to be owned by Unilever, which owns billion dollar brands including Axe, Dove, Lipton, Hellman's, Becel Margarine, Fudgsicle, Popsicle -- and even Ben and Jerry's ice cream, just to barely scratch the mega-corp surface. In 2005, Calvin Klein fragrances were acquired by cosmetic giant, Coty, Inc. Coty also owns Adidas, Chloe, Davidoff, Marc Jacobs, and even Playboy. Coty also sells you the beauty products fronted by Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Kate Moss, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Vera Wang, Lagerfeld, Guess, and a whole galaxy of celebrities. Very big business indeed!  Just thought you'd find that interesting!  Eternity Aqua (for women) -- "an aquatic floral scent."  Recommended with this caveat: you'll have to try it for yourself.	1
At first glance, I kind of expected a "cool water" fragrance.  Fortunately, this is nothing like that and instead more like the smell of a lovely  lavender bush with a hint of cucumber. In saying this, It's not overwhelming, just strong enough to mask normal body odor. It's a great outdoors fragrance.	1
Very crisp scent. Perfect for all day wear or that special evening occasion. I like the fact that this is not too overpowering. Nice highnotes that ride on a warm foundation. Love it!	1
I'm giving this four stars in general, but only three stars for me. The scent is soft and subtle, but not my taste. I was hoping for something a littler crisper and more summery; this is very floral. I do appreciate that the scent is overbearing, but it's not for me. This would a great pick for anyone who likes a whisper light, sweet, baby soft scent.	1
One of my favorite scents and one I am quickly adopting as my signature scent is Calvin Klein's Euphoria. It's got this woodsy, yet feminine and floral scent that I just love.  I loved Euphoria so much, I thought I would expand to try Calvin Klein's other scents. Hence why I chose Eternity Aqua, a scent that's been around since 2012.  Top notes - White peony, crisp pink lady apple and cucumber water Mid notes - Tiare, magnolia, gardenia, jasmine Base notes - Sundrenched woods, cedarwood, transparent musk  When I used Eternity Aqua, the words that came to mind were "fresh summer breeze at the beach" and "clean". The cucumber was definitely apparent to me, not so much the peony or the apple. It almost smelled more like clean towels or blankets without the nasty chemical scent. After a while, it settled into light, airy floral mix - I can't say that I detected gardenia and jasmine, but it was a light floral scent, not too heavy and still harkening to spring and summer and sitting by the beach.  The scent lasts a decent amount of time. The initial spray isn't too strong, and it lasts about the standard 15 - 30 minutes. The next few hours, the scent is much, much more muted - I found I had to sniff the application spot to detect it (though to be honest, isn't that what adjusting to your own scent is all about?). I think I can go about an entire work day with the scent on. One of the things I do love about the scent is that it isn't too strong and in your face. It smells clean and breezy, not too girly, not too husky.  That said, I don't know that I would put this as one of my "signature scents". I like girly scents like "Intimately Beckham", but it smells just a wee bit too "clean" like detergent for my tastes. But it's a great scent for a day on the beach or for summertime or to give yourself a nice aroma without burdening your coworkers with a nasty scent.  Brought to you by: *C.S. Light*	1
The minute I took a sniff of this in Macy's I fell in love.  Actually, owned the original Eternity which now can be viewed as overpowering and a bit cloying.  So Calvin Klein, jumping on the "blue water" trend, switched up this classic fragrance into an "aquatic floral."  Being this is indeed an eau de PARFUM, was quite surprised that the lasting power just isn't there!  Love a fragrance that lingers (and who doesn't?), so I was very disappointed how quickly this seemed to evaporate.  A wonderful fragrance that just needs a little more PUNCH.	1
This is a very nice light and clean smelling women's perfume.  To me it smells slightly floral, but not overwhelmingly so.  It's not as strong as something like White Linen, but a cleaner and lighter smell - very nice.  My wife loves it and it seems to last very well.	1
I have always liked the Calvin Klein fragrance line, as I have found their scents to be high quality and generally long-lasting as well. I have had tried ETERNITY, but not ETERNITY AQUA, so I was excited about the opportunity to sample this new-to-me fragrance.  Upon application, ETERNITY AQUA gave off what were both watery and powdery notes to me--a very soft, pleasant combination.  I can't say that I picked up any of the particular notes listed in the scent description.  I definitely would not describe the fragrance as "cucumber water," which is go for me since I don't like the smell of cucumber.  I may be picking up on a bit of gardenia/jasmine, and the more powdery note that I detect might be the musk undertone.  I will say that compared to some of the other CK fragrances (such as the original ETERNITY and OBSESSION, both very powerful scents), ETERNITY AQUA is VERY subtle.  It is quite light going on, and just about three hours after application, I can hardly detect that I am wearing perfume, even when I put my nose directly to my wrist.  This is a bit disappointing--my fragrances don't have to be strong, but I do want them to last, especially when I enjoy the scent.  So, in the end, this is a fragrance that I like quite a bit, but I gave it four stars instead of five due to how quickly it fades.  Still, it is an attractive light scent that would work well for summer, and I would recommend it.	1
This gets better as the day passes and it does last all day..on me anyway!  At first I thought this was too light, watered down like, and the first smells seemed real woodsy.  As time goes by, happily, the floral starts coming out and it's not overwhelming.  Very nice for day wear, save the intensity of Eternity for days not at work :)	1
sticky, and gooey. Does not define curls, but just hardens your hair up. Its like applying paste to your hair.	-1
This is a very light weight moisturizer with a fragrance that is so pungent, that I had a very difficult time wearing it frequently enough to review it on it's moisturizing properties. I even shared it with our daughter to test the hydration benefits. It absorbs very quickly, and is not oily at all, but I would have to recommend avoiding this face cream for those who are sensitive to fragrances. I'm not especially, but this is probably the most 'perfumed' face cream I have ever used and just don't experience positive enough moisturizing benefits to tolerate the smell, or the $46 price tag. (Reviewed by my wife)	-1
I tried this on a few different people in addition to myself and came to the conclusion that it is not too great on any of us.  IS IT MOISTURIZING? The title of this is Matte Moisture Tint, that implies to me that it is moisturizing somewhat.  In applying it to a variety of skin types and ages, I did not find it at all moisturizing.  In fact, it applied sort of like a very lightweight paste.  Every person I put it on made some kind of comment about how dry it felt going on- even the one with normal to oily skin.  COVERAGE The coverage of this tint is okay in that it evens out skin appearance, that is if you are about 10 feet away. Once you get closer, you can see that it sits on top of the skin.  This tint amplifies facial hair, creases, little lines on skin, and really does not look natural at all.  If you feel old or icky some day, you will probably not feel any better after putting this on.  WEAR As time went on, despite the lack of complimentary appearance when wearing it, this tint seemed to become a combination of silicone-ish and dry patchy feeling on the skin.  I really didn't like it, and neither did anyone I tried it on.  BOTTOM LINE Some tints or foundations are better on one type of skin than others, or a particular age group, but this didn't seem to work for anyone I put it on, from teen to mature women.  The idea is good, but the product does not seem to deliver moisture or natural looking tint.	-1
I recieved the color AAL, upon opening I immediately decide I wasn't a fan of the packaging or the look of the tube. Small but bulky? The lipstick has that classic lipstick smell, and the color looks like it could be okay.  Wrong. AAL is VERY orange which does not work with my tanned olive skin tone at all, but if you're looking for a solid orangy color -- this might be it,	-1
Expensive and dries my skin out. I had higher expectations for the product at this price.	-1
There are a multitude of soaps available on Amazon and this is one that I will not purchase again. The scent isn't even worth describing due to the fact that it is close to being non-existent. I used this as a "body bar" one time. It left a residue and dried my skin. Now it sits in our mud room for people to scrub dirt from their hands.	-1
I have been using this product for about a week now, and I believe that is enough to provide my opinion for this specific "soap bar". The scent of this bar is not something that I find to be that good. I don't really even know what to compare the scent to as it is something that I have never experienced before. It is very strong and isn't very masculine at all. I would never leave the house without putting on something to mask the scent. This bar will last a different amount of time for nearly everyone. If you shower under the water with this bar expect it to disappear quickly, if you don't, expect it to last longer. Personally, I shower under the water because if I don't I find this bar to really "drag" with resistance and it's very uncomfortable. The little specs on the bar do a fairly good job of exfoliating, but this will dry your skin out. I found my skin to feel on par with the common "hotel experience". By this I mean that sticky feeling you get when you shower at hotels with hard water and cheap soap bars. This feeling disappears after you dry off, then the dryness hits you like a brick. I experienced the itching and tightness on my back, and it was very uncomfortable. Ultimately, I will not purchase this soap bar again because I highly doubt it will even last me a month, it feels like a cheap soap after rinsing off, it dries you out, and it only exfoliates decently at best. With the huge market of products out there it is very difficult to find ones that really impress you, this is one of those products that you simply mark off the list to try. Not worth it!	-1
First, the tube ended up ripping, causing the cream to leak. I only got three shaves or so before it ripped and I was forced to discard it. I am thankful for this mishap -- I ended up trying some US-made artisan shaving products, which have worked much better for me. I admire the tradition behind Proraso, but I am convinced the cream's prevalence of preservatives -- something my new artisan-made products do not contain -- caused me irritation and redness. Proraso is a cost-effective option if your skin is neither sensitive nor prone to drying. For my sensitive skin, however, this was not conducive to a good shave. The cream dried my skin out, caused me irritation, and did not properly lubricate my face so that I might easily cut my thick, coarse facial hair. Clean, subtle scent. But I will never buy this again.	-1
Though I like quite a few of the Obagi products. . .  First, of course, is the crazy expensive price.  I know that this is just par-for-the-course with Obagi, but still.  What I really don't like about it is the fact that it does not absorb. . . at all.  It just sits on your face.  It feels a bit like paste.  I also don't care for the pump container.  As with all such containers, every now-and-then, you get a chunk.  I would prefer a tube.	-1
This left my face really shiny, which I am not fond of.  It dissolved into my skin quickly and was definitely hydrating, but I didn't like the shine.  There are other Obagi moisturizers that are matte, but this one is most definitely not: shea butter, avocado, glycerine...  it's too much for my normal-to-oily (with some dry spots) skin.	-1
I don't get it.  I have two Obagi moisturizers and I love one and can't use the other.  The one I love is this one -- [[ASIN:B01M0EP9EM Obagi CLENZIderm M.D. Therapeutic Moisturizer Glycerin 20% Skin Protectant].  It's great. No tack feeling and my skin adores it.  This Hydrate formula feels uncomfortable and burny.  At first I thought maybe my skin was just super dry so I waited and used the other Obagi moisturizer and waited.  I've tried 3 times to use it over the last month, with days and weeks in between each use and the same thing happens.  I end up rushing off to wash it off and apply a thick layer of heavy lotion to neutralize the effect.  I should add that I have very sensitive skin and this even burns the inside of my elbows when I tested it there. No obvious allergic reactions.  I also got my husband to finally try it and he said it prickled the moment it dripped onto his skin.	-1
I have tried many moisturizers. In addition, I don't know how this one differs from the ones in a doctor's office. Yet, if it is the same than I would be upset. The smell is a little off-putting. Not that it is a strong smell. I thought because this cream was thick that it would not go on smooth but it did. What I was very disappointed in this moisturizer is that it did not give me the hydration that I wanted. It felt like halfway through the day if at that I needed to put more on as my face was dry. In fact, I used this after recovering from a cold and a sore nose that had been peeling due to lots of blowing. It did not sting, so that was good but my nose was still dry. I went and put a different moisturizer on top of this one to give me the hydration I was looking for.	-1
This product is so thick it feels more like a body lotion than a facial moisturizer.  It is odorless, except for a slightly off odor, like it's old.  The bottle is dated 2012, but there is no expiration date.  The list of ingredients include shea butter and mango butter.  That probably explains the thickness of the product.  This 1.7 ounce pump style container will not last long as it's simply not a large amount of product.  It's called "Hydrate" but I don't see how all these heavy butters and gums can hydrate my face.  It feels like a lotion one should put on their skin when out in the sun, but not something to use as a facial moisturizer.  So I don't like the consistency, and really do not care for the odd odor.  I don't like it.	-1
Color was off and it is cumbersome to apply.	-1
Smells pine and synthetic. House of Burberry has this acent accord that gives me a headache of I smell too long. Ill save for Christmas time and try on a cold day/evening.	-1
Unfortunately I don't love this.  I can use my own round brush and hair dryer better.  I love the instyler much better.	-1
Tacky and do not like the taste.  The color was quite sheer too.	-1
I've been using iS Clinical Youth Eye Complex for a little over a month now, at least once a day (sometimes twice).  In that time, I've seen no noticeable difference to the appearance of the skin around my eyes.  I'm 42 with some fine lines, but this product had no effect on them.  The directions do not indicate whether to use this product once a day or twice, at night or in the morning.  I usually applied it at night.  There's no noticeable scent and the product goes on easily.  The pump does dispense about twice the amount you need, so I would suggest only pressing the pump halfway down.  This moisturizer didn't irritate my skin at all, but it did tend to look a little shiny/oily after application -- although it doesn't feel heavy or greasy.  It just didn't do anything for me to justify continued use.	-1
I really wanted to like this product since I am 49 and I have noticed bags under my eyes. This is a recent development but one side of my family has bags under their eyes. I was fighting my own DNA. I figured that since it is an IS CLINICAL product that it would be a good quality product that I would have success with. One pump was all it took and it was more than enough to be able to dab under both eyes. It went on smoothly and had no greasy feel. There was no sensitivity as a result of using this product.  It has been close to two months now that I have been applying this for a month; I have not seen any results. Perhaps, it takes more time to see results but I do not want to go through half the bottle to find out that it needs more time. I was fortunate enough to get this item free to try and review but any other person might not be thrilled to try this expensive product to find out that it doesn't work. I used this eye complex only once a day so maybe if I used it twice a day I might have noticed a difference. However, I have had better luck with increasing my water intake. Dehydration can cause bags and fine lines to appear too.	-1
I don't mind using this, but I just don't see any results after using it daily for a month now. It claims you will see immediate or rapid results, but I haven't even seen any slow results after all this time. The eye cream itself is fine as a light moisturizer and I had no problems with it as far as any irritations. It is like a light cream or a cream serum texture. It absorbs nicely and very quickly with no shiny skin afterwards. Previously I had been using kinerase extreme lift eye and extreme lift face, which are very hard to find now that they've been discontinued, but those do give immediate very noticeable results. I guess I was hoping this iS Clinical would be a good replacement.unfortunately it is not and I cannot justify to continue to purchase it with no results other than just being a decent moisturizer. Theres so many more cost efficient products for that purpose. Also, I do not have any major eye problems.. no deep wrinkles, no terrible under eye bags and I do not have any excessive dark circles. I just have fine crows feet at the corners of my eyes and occasional crepe-y look right under/along  my lower lash line. I also feel like I have some drooping at the corners sometimes. This product doesn't improve any of that, except the tiny crepe lines right along the lower lashing, but any eye cream or moisturizer takes care of that.	-1
This is a lightweight lotion to help reduce puffy eyes and dark circles. You only need 1 pump for this lotion to cover around both eyes. I put this on after washing my face. For the time I've been using it, I have not noticed any difference in my eye area. It has helped with some dry skin I had on my upper lids. This is a very expensive eye cream with no results.	-1
I love Mustela products (generally speaking) but this cream's scent is far too strong for a product intended for sensitive skin.  I can't really speak to the long term performance of this product because I simply couldn't get past the scent and didn't want to use it on my little one.  A reformulation may be in order if Mustela wants a better seller on their hands.	-1
Okay this iron has a problem. I don't know why the reviews didn't mention how the barrel clip is short. If you have a long hair, more than half of your hair won't curl. Clip needs to be longer in order for it to curl well.	-1
Something isn't right about the hot tools on here.	-1
after just 3 years the wire came loose in the handle and now blinks on and off. Poor design!!!	-1
At first this was great - heated up nicely and made great curls.  But less than a month later, it doesn't heat up well at all; I thought I accidentally changed the temp setting but it was on the highest setting and doesn't do a thing.  Too late to return it, I wasted 30 bucks.  Don't make the same mistake I did!	-1
Great brand but the clamp crimped my hair so badly I returned it and ended up buying another one without it.	-1
Get's hot quick, but does not curl my hair. I have a older one that takes forever to get hot but when it does, it gives me a tight curl, but for some reason no matter how long i keep this iron in my hair, i can't get a curl.	-1
Didn't not work at all didn't get warm at all! Do not buy save your money and buy a NuMe wand instead!	-1
works amazingly. This is my second one. the first one broke after 5 years of use. it makes my hair so shiny... Update: Bought my second one through amazon and it broke less than one year.. The barrel does NOT heat up anymore ... Makes me question the quality control ...	-1
I normally love this curling iron, this one MUST be defective, it does not clamp shut, so therefore it does not curl properly. waste of money	-1
I tried it on the middle setting first after reading all the "my hair melted off" reviews.  Nothing impressive or scary, not even close to hot enough so cranked it up bit by bit to the highest setting.  Yes, the want was hot.  No it did nothing to curl my hair. Mind you, I had just tried the Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron and while it curled (really curled) my hair, the Hot Tools one left a bit of a wave with a smidge of a curl on the end.  Meh.  Returned it.	-1
This is not working for me. Comes off during day.	-1
This mascara has a deep, black finish that applied smoothly to my lashes. I didn't notice any significant clumping, but it did seem to take a lot longer than normal to dry on my lashes. It washed off with soap and water without trouble. I was less happy with how it smudged under my eyes, and that it took two coats to equal one coat of my usual Benefit They're Real! mascara. The brush is really annoying, too. I'm not sure how the ball at the end is supposed to help anything, but it sure makes the wand harder to get in and out of the tube. A couple of times I ended up flicking mascara on my clothes trying to get it out. That's a first for me since I started wearing mascara in the '80s!  It's worth noting that this tube holds a lot less mascara than other brands, too. It's 0.22 fl.oz., where Cover Girl is twice that. Event the Benefit mascara is 0.3 fl.oz. So while the price seems competitive, it's actually not very - especially since I have to use twice as much to get the same lashes I get with Benefit. I'll pass on this one.	-1
The butter London Iconoclast mascara tube made a good first impression but as soon as I applied the formula to one eye, I had a terrible reaction. This was quite surprising since it has less of a sent than other mascaras, but for some reason, my eye itched and watered so badly I had to immediately wash off the mascara. The wand was very very flexible and the unusual brush design with a bristled ball tip will either be loved or hated. I like the design, I just cannot tolerate the actual cosmetic which is very unfortunate.	-1
I don't really like it.  The brush is divided into two parts.  The main section and the tip which is rounded or bulb-like.  The rounded tip on the end gets in my way and it didn't really carry enough mascara to do my bottom lashes.  The mascara made my lashes clump together which is the main reason why I don't like it.  So instead of 100 lashes to flutter, I had 30 stuck together.  I may give it another try, but my first impression is not good.  However sometimes a mascara is more liquid at first and then settles down and then it doesn't clump.  But I still don't like that round ball at the end.  I had to go back over my lashes with my Cover Girl mascara to try to separate the lashes which didn't work well since they were already clumped.	-1
Disappointing.  I have normal lashes - not long, but not too short.  Like all people, I want thicker, longer lashes.  This product just doesn't deliver well for me.  First, the weird shape of the wand makes it almost impossible to apply to all lashes - in fact, not even sure what the "ball" shape on the end is for because it seems useless.  Second, I don't like the mascara gel - goes on really thin and smudges easily - takes FOREVER to dry so it makes it easy to mess up application from the beginning or for it to smudge before drying.  I tried to put several layers on to make thicker, longer lashes but I just simply couldn't get it to cooperate. I just don't think I will purchase this in the future.	-1
Product goes on well but skin appears greasy/oily after application.	-1
Not up yo it's reputation	-1
I got this serum from vichy website am using it for already a month and got 0 difference	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
This product was hard to review because of the color.  It wasn't so much that it was too dark for my tone, but very orange.  I'm not sure what type of skin you would have to be able to use this.  The formula felt nice, but it was just too orange for my skin.	-1
This La Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint in "Golden Beige" is darker in tint than I expected.  It dispenses and applies easily, but there's a strong alcohol smell and it feels tight and drying if you have dry skin.  It's definitely not hydrating as advertised and like other reviewers have mentioned, it feels chalky.  The primary ingredient, after water, is silcone (dimethicone), which I don't think is ideal since it can feel heavy.  Also, there's no SPF.  I found the coverage kinda of grainy, too.  I like that this is made in France, but I don't see any other reason to get this when there are other mid-market and drugstore options that are better.	-1
I ordered this thinking it was going to be a good match to my complexion.  I have warmer skin with yellow tones and I have used Loreals honey beige true match foundation, which matches really well.  This honey beige is really dark and more peachy than honey. It did not match well with my complexion at all.  It was also rather thin and did not cover very well. I couldn't really use it to see how long it lasted because my face looked horrendous with on (as it was too dark) so I cant comment on its staying power.  A plus was that it was fragrance free, as promised.	-1
This was bright orange and nothing like the color sample provided. This went on smoothly, but then I looked like a Cheeto-faced maniac. It didn't smell spoiled or unpleasant, so I assumed this is the color they ship intentionally -- which is a sad and misleading shade of nuclear fake tan.  I suggest that you find a store that this is offered at and try it on first before ordering, otherwise you may end up looking ripe for juicing :P	-1
I'm a huge fan of La Roche-Posay products. I was excited to try this one because it said "hydrating" which my skin needs.  I have extremely dry skin and love a moisturizing foundation that will make my skin look less dry and hydrated.  Well, this is NOT hydrating.  It actually sticks to my dry skin and makes it look dull and shows every line and crease. It's very chalky and lays on top of the skin horribly.  Not a fan.  I do use a LOT of LaRoche products and love the fact that they do not irritate my sensitive skin and usually work perfectly for me, but this is not a winner.	-1
This review is for the 05 Dark Beige color of the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint Mattifying Mousse Matte Foundation for Oily Skin and Sensitive Skin.  Disclaimer:  This review was written by my wife!  We ordered "Honey Beige" and received "05 hl&eacute; - Dark beige", which is not one of the colors offered on the product page. Hl&eacute; means sunburned or tanned, and it is for darker skin, not for the darkest skin tones.  Its too dark for me, as I usually use the second lightest color for foundations.  PROS The foundation is not fragrant like some of their products Does not irritate my skin at all Does not give a cakey look Covers pores and uneven skin colors well Looks beautiful right after the application  CONS In less than a couple of hours, my skin, especially forehead area, looks almost exactly like the texture of "saffiano printed calf skin", with numerous fine straight-line wrinkles going both vertically and horizontally. I could not believe that, so I tried the foundation with and without moisturizers and foundation bases, but my forehead still ended up in looking like the material with which my purse is made. I don't even have visible wrinkles on my forehead without the foundation, so it ended up making my skin look far worse, rather than better.  Not recommended.	-1
La Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint Mattifying Mousse Matte Foundation for Oily Skin and Sensitive Skin. This matte foundation makeup for sensitive skin is presented by LaRoche-Posay, a French firm with a long, honored presence in womens cosmetics that is recommended by 25,000 dermatologists worldwide.  The firm states that it offers a unique daily skincare line developed using a strict formulation charter, stringent clinical testing for efficacy, safety, even on sensitive skin. This foundation is said to be a large pore minimizer; it claims to  cover blemishes, absorb oil for matte even skin tone. The firm recommends it for daily coverage; states that it is suitable for oily skin, sensitive skin, will visibly cover skin imperfections blur pores, instantly absorb oil. La Roche adds that the cosmetic contains cutting-edge smoothing mattifier Airlicium that will absorb oil for all-day matte skin.  It is, furthermore, fragrance-free, Paraben-free, oil-free, non-comedogenic.  Ingredients: Dimethicone, Undecane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tridecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Silica Silylate, Perlite, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Retinyl Linoleate, Aluminum Hydroxide, May contain Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides. It comes in five different shades: ivory, light beige, sand, golden beige, honey beige.  Well, Amazon Vine sent this foundation to me in a shade, 04 Honey Beige,  that is too dark for my skin, doesnt look good on me.  They can, of course, hardly be expected to know my skin tone.  The foundation does serve to minimize pores. But: this foundation turns a distinct orange color on my face, and, aside from the current American president, few people want orange skin. Perhaps a more suitable shade might not do this; Ive no way of knowing.  Meanwhile, I agree with other reviewers that youve only got to look at the foundation cross-eyed to get blank spots, holidays, my dad used to call them.  And its a bit tricky to fill them in.	-1
Had a similar experience as with their double repair face moisturizer - just seems to go on but almost instantly starts to be cakey and the end result looks like you're trying to exfoliate your skin. Bits and pieces seem to break off with movement or touch too easily.	-1
This La Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint Mattifying Mousse foundation went on very smoothly.  It was a nice color that I Believe could work with several different skin tints.  The problem was that it rolled up or beaded up on my skin.  I hope I'm explaining it right.  I thought maybe I had put on too much moisturizer, so I started over with less moisturizer.  That didn't help.  The Mousse would bead up & not stay smooth on my skin.  I'm not sure why, but I just didn't work out for me.	-1
When I saw that one of my favorite skincare lines started making foundation, I was naturally very excited! That feeling quickly dissipated when I tried this product. The formula is bizarre. It doesn't blend into your skin, it kind of floats on top. It won't set with powder, and looks super cakey.  My biggest qualm is that the lightest version of this formula is at least two shades too dark for my skin. The color is really muddy and just looks extremely patchy. Be wary of the high reviews of this.  Big swing and an even bigger miss from La Roche  Posay.	-1
I love this brand but this product does not work for me at all. At first, I thought it was going to be the dream foundation I'd been looking for. Perfect color match. Perfectly light and airy. Perfect coverage - my pores appeared to disappear. And then, moments later, it was if the product sucked all the moisture out of my skin. It looked like a caked on, crumbly mess. It magnified every tiny wrinkle, every imperfection.  I applied this on one of the coldest and driest days of the winter, but I has used a moisturizer first, and let it set.  I will try again when the air becomes warmer and more moist because I loved the ten minutes of bliss I had with the coverage and airy light perfection.	-1
This product causes a lot of dandruff and dries the ends of my hair	-1
Leaves my hair super thin.	-1
My hair's texture is right in the middle of fine and thick-- just medium, but there's a lot of it. This weighs my hair down, seemingly no matter how little I use. For such an expensive product I was expecting a little more oomph. For my money, I prefer Aveda's smooth infusion line. I read in Amazon reviews of this product that it helps prevent/correct split ends. For me, not so much-- I fine camellia oil or regular old olive oil more effective for that purpose. Also, this Oribe product smells just like the cologne my high school boyfriend used-- CK One. So, if you want to smell like CK one, I guess this is for you? I would imagine this might be more effective on thicker/curlier hair.	-1
I didn't care for this product. This particular color was not complimentary to my skin  tone. It was chalky on my lips and eventually  made them very dry. I think I'll pass on this one.	-1
I love the Jouer powder blush and lip glosses, but I was disappointed in this Jouer Tint. It was the shade more than anything as it made me look ruddy (I'm fair, cool toned). It stayed on all day as a blush (I wasn't wearing a primer). As a lip tint, I didn't like it; it made my lips very dry.	-1
i just bought this from a store a week ago.  The sales people swore by it and said I would love it. Here are my initial impressions:  cons:  Improvement is not immediately obvious.  It is quite a time consuming routine - more like 20 mins than the advertised 5 mins.  You have to use it everyday.  the gel dries too quickly.  VERY Expensive gadget for what it is.  There are other attachments you can buy for about $150 each.  Just too expensive all around.  Pros:  simple to use.  the device fits well in the hand. Portable.  Rechargeable.  the charge lasts a long time --- weeks.  i had occasion to call Nuface customer service, and they were very nice and helpful. You get to speak with a human.  Notes:  Forget spending money on gel.  The salesman told me that I can use plain water without the gel.  I use just water and it works -- no need for any gel.  Update:  I have been using this daily for about 10 months... I don't think my face looks different but feels different -- maybe harder/firmer? If I stop using it for just a few days, I lose that hard feeling.  Still takes about 20 mins to do the routine. Kind of time consuming, but you can do it while watching TV, reading etc..  So far, nobody has told me they notice anything different.  I look in the mirror and don't see any difference.... so, I don't think I would tell anyone to go out and buy this $$$ gadget..... I continue to use it but I don't hold out hope for any great improvement.  I recently started using RoC Lift Serum (drugstore product) and saw actual results in a week.  I thought I was dreaming. Cost about $20 and available at any drugstore. some vendor on Amazon is charging $75 for this serum -- don't go there.  Note : in the instruction booklet, it says this cannot be used if you have a pacemaker or if you are epileptic or pregnant-- amongst other things.	-1
Used for 8 months. I don't any improvement.	-1
Will not charge and the company will not refund your money.  BUYER BEWARE	-1
Honestly, I really can't see the difference. People praise this product like its a miracle cure, yet I find no diffence from one week to the next. When mentioning this to the doctor, his comment was, "if you want wrinkles gone, don't age". That's all I have to say about this product. Use it if you must, good luck.	-1
I thought this would smell great but its not for how expensive it is!	-1
Very pretty, subtle color.  Goes on easy enough with a scent that I didn't care for at first but diminishes quickly.  I didn't notice any real enhancement or increase in fullness of my lips and didn't care for the feel of the gloss after applying it.  I kept rubbing my lips together because I could still feel the gloss on it.  Not crazy about that.  I want to put the gloss on and forget about it.	-1
I was excited to try this out since I've always wanted to try out Jane Iredale products, but was disappointed to see that it contains a few different citrus oils.  If you follow Paula Begoun at all, you'll know that citrus oils can dry out lips and cause irritation, and that's exactly what I've found to be the case the few times I've used this.  The oils do cause it to smell nice and it's not sticky or tacky, but when I've been wearing it a lot, I definitely notice that it dries out my lips, instead of moisturizing them.  If this were re-formulated, I would definitely try it again, but as it is I can't recommend it.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1

I really love how this makes my facial skin feel.  The serum is silky and feels wonderful when I put it on.  The problem I have is that the scent is extremely strong.  It's very perfumy and it makes me uncomfortable to have it on my face.  The scent lasts and lasts, too.  It doesn't go away.  I've tried putting the serum on and waiting and waiting for the scent to dissipate, but it doesn't.  I have to wash it off.  Too bad it's so highly scented because it really does make my face feel wonderful.	-1
This goes on white. Have to rub in good. Leaves skin shiny. Seems more like a straight sunscreen than a hydrating cream w/ sunscreen. Not very appealing for the face	-1
Like another reviewer mentioned their product arrived with a date of 2011 and like the product i recieved on the bottom of box on the flap it says 3-10-11. I am not willing to take the chance and have my face destroyed. I don't know if this means expiration date or the date it was manufactured, either way im not taking the chance.	-1
I started itching love me crazy and realized it was this product when I stopped using it. I use the AM moisturizer and it's fine.	-1
There are some ups and downs with this product but ultimately it's not a Sunscreen that I would buy.  PLUSES  Organic, which I love  Lasts 80 minutes  Is water resistant!  SUMMARY Despite the fact that it's winter there are days, especially at higher elevations, where there is bright sun.  I really wanted this to be a sunscreen that my family could use that would prevent sun burn, and which would reduce wind burn.  What I found was a not-so liquid product that felt heavy, like zinc sunblocks, but which didn't sooth or go on easily.  It felt like it was abrading my skin.  After I put it on my skin felt raw. I don't know if it's a reaction to one of the ingredients --I have quite a few allergies and super sensitive skin-- or a reaction to the non-flowing, non-liquid and slightly gritty nature of it.  If you have younger, less delicate skin it might be worth a try, but I don't recommend it to older gals or those which super sensitive skin.	-1
I recently tried and liked&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Juice-Beauty-Blemish-Clearing-Mask-2-fl-oz/dp/B005I4119W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Mask, 2 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;so I was very curious to try this product.  First, it is worth noting that this is sunscreen, not just lotion that happens to have SPF in it.  I say this because the name initially threw me off since it is called moisturizer and not sunscreen.  But from reading the packing and applying it is definitely sunscreen.  I say this because I regularly buy both and while lotion with SPF is my go-to on a day to day basis it's usually not waterproof enough or applied in a large enough quantity to provide adequate protection if you're wearing a bathing suit.  First, I'll start with what I like about the product.  I like that it is waterproof for 80 minutes.  I also like that it is natural.  That said, I'm not sure this product is meant for my needs.  First, it has a very pungent smell.  Admittedly, I tend to be sensitive to smells so if you are not, you may find yourself less bothered by the scent.  But I had my boyfriend, who is less sensitive to smells than I am, try it and he too found the smell strong and unpleasant.  It reminded me a lot of household cleaner, which I wasn't expecting since the other Juice Beauty product I've used has no scent at all.  It also seems to sting my sensitive skin a bit.  I wasn't expecting that because again, I've really liked the other Juice Beauty product I tried.  It's also quite thick.  I got this with the intention of using it on my face, but it feels too heavy.  It also gives no indication of whether it is appropriate for acne prone skin so I'm a bit nervous it could clog my pores.  Because of that, it seems more appropriate for my body, though functionally I have an easier time applying sunscreen with a spray.  Based on my experience, this just isn't the sunscreen for me.  While it's not natural, I've been much happier with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neutrogena-Clear-Face-Break-Out-Free-Liquid-Lotion-Sunscreen-SPF-55-3-oz-Pack-of-2/dp/B00BZABKPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neutrogena Clear Face Break Out Free Liquid Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 - 3 oz (Pack of 2)</a>.	-1
I work outside a lot, use sun screen daily, and with living in Southern CA, I am always on the lookout for sunscreen that is more natural instead of chemicals. I like the zinc sunscreens, but I do not like how they make your skin look chalky and are hard to wash off. Especially for day to day use, going to meetings with a chalky face, is not the professional look I am going for. This sunscreen is great because it has zinc, but it also has oils that helps it spreads smoothly, so you do not get that chalky buildup.  So why the one star? Well, I am not sure that everyone else got the same sun screen that I did.... it smells awful! It smells like if you ripped open a smelly leaf, rubbed it in kerosene, then added some lemon zest. It gave me a headache after 2 mins, made my sister sneeze uncontrollably after one sniff, and I could not get any of my co-workers to try it after one whiff. The only good part, is that it washed off easily, no residue, no smell. Makes me wonder about it's waterproof ability -- the other sunscreen I use is the scentless Blue Lizard which is great for swimming -- it's so waterproof that you can see the water bead up off your skin once you apply it. Which also makes it impossible to scrub off. Alas, you can't have it all!!	-1
The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.	-1
When I first applied this, it felt wonderful.  My skin felt moisturized and dewy soft.  By the next morning, I had whiteheads all over my forehead.  It was hideous.  This might work for others, but my face didn't like it.	-1
Mustela makes a big thing about their products being natural and hypoallergenic. Since I have sensitive skin, I always try a dab of any cream on the inside of my arm (where the skin is thin) and wait for a few hours. It only took a few seconds to realize that the Stretch Marks Prevention cream was problematic for me! It made my skin red and irritated, even on the back of my hand where I rubbed the leftover portion when more came out of the tube than I expected. I immediately washed my skin but it stayed red for a while and felt like it was burning.  So what is in this prevention cream? MustelaUSA says "AQUA/WATER/EAU, DI-C12-13 ALKYL MALATE, ETHYLHEXYL COCOATE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CERA ALBA/BEESWAX/CIRE DABEILLE, LAURETH-23, GALACTOARABINAN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, GLYCERYL STEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), XANTHAN GUM, CETYL PALMITATE, COCOGLYCERIDES, SCLEROTIUM GUM, ZINC GLUCONATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FRUIT EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED AVOCADO PROTEIN, MALTODEXTRIN, CITRIC ACID, LUPINUS ALBUS SEED EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL." (I apologize for the caps but I pasted this from their site.)  None of these are among my usual allergens but many of them I have not heard of.  I have had problems with some fragrances and a few fruit products. Fragrance can be anything so it is hard to judge but it is noticeable as soon as you open the tube. In EWG's Skin Deep Database, fragrance is the ingredient that keeps this product from getting a high rating, along with Laureth-23, which they say can cause irritation and organ system toxicity, and zinc gluconate, which can bioaccumulate and also has organ system toxicity.  The Mustela website claims good results based on a "Clinical trial conducted on 26 pregnant women who used this product throughout their pregnancy."  But personally I cannot recommend it. I did not dare to try the second product in the package after the bad experience with the first one. It also contains fragrance.  This set is made in France.	-1
The bust cream is particularly absurd. I bought it for my wife. The bust cream is a silicone-like, clear cream, with a slight scent that dries clear. There's a big difference between a slightly tight feel on your skin and actually firming breasts. You need several pumps (each pump is not much cream) to have enough to cover your breasts. The stretch mark cream is a thin, white cream with a stronger scent. There's nothing remotely medical about these cosmetic lotions.  I really like the Mustela brand for their Stelatopia unscented moisturizing lotion, and we've used a ton of their milky bath oil when bathing our child, but these lotions are being marketed with pseudo scientific nonsense. The firming agents are a joke, with trace quantities of avocado that have no medical action.  It's a shame when a brand builds trust with one product, just to erode it with false claims on another.	-1
Am I the only one who finds the idea of a "travel" shave brush a tad ridiculous?  A normal shave brush takes up, what, like three cubic inches?  This brush has a hollow handle to conceal the brush head in, compacting it all the way down to a size of (wait for it) TWO cubic inches!  Wow!  Now I have so much more room in my travel bag, I'm going to grab my extra floss!  If you're the kind of person who wants to travel with a spare *cheap* brush they don't mind losing, well, this thing costs FIFTY dollars, how much did you spend on your *good* shaving brush?  Now don't get me wrong, this brush works well.  It lathers really nicely, though its bristles are just a bit soft imho, but it is a good, very functional brush.  But FIFTY dollars?  FIFTY?  One of the other reviewers said of this product, "Although this brush is expensive, you are getting what you pay for."  How?  All it does is apply shaving cream to your face, and don't tell me its cause its badger hair,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/badger-brushes/dp/B003WR3QSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">badger brushes</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/do-NOT-have/dp/B00B1TKY8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">do NOT have</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/to-be-all/dp/B000G647Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">to be all </a>&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/that-expensive/dp/B00A2GPDAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">that expensive</a>.  Sure, the hollow aluminum handle is nicely crafted but its also HOLLOW ALUMINUM.  They use aluminum to make SODA CANS, for pete's sake!  There's no way this thing should cost what it does.  Again, a good brush, but the pricing is ridiculous.  Even as a pure luxury item, there is way cooler stuff to spend your money on.  In short, who is this for?	-1
This stuff is the worst. It dries super fast, but that's it's one good quality. Has peeled off the first day all 3 times I have tried it. I asked myself if this was user error, but after trying multiple times I'm thinking, I am a scientist and this stuff clearly sucks.	-1
Doesn't last longer than regular polish, chips same day...  Disappointed.	-1
does nothing different than Salley Hansens	-1
Do not enjoy this at all. Thick and floppy. Applied exactly as directed. (I shellac my own nails and I am not a nail tech.)	-1
I used thus according to instructions and the Polish came right off. My regular polish with vase and top coat stays on longer.	-1
My Daughter used some of the polish and Lacquer at her Mother-In-Laws and thought it was good so I ordered some. It didn't work well for me and I would like to return it.	-1
Not only does my polish only last 2 days before it chips, it takes forever for it to dry. Waste of money.	-1
Came right off. Really should be applied by a professional manicurist.  I followed the directions, too, using the cND Vinyl top coat. Did not work.	-1
When I first got it, I was a little surprised about the color and didn't think it would look good, once I put it on I did like it. I think it compliments my skin :) I only one coat without a base. After I washed dishes later on that night I noticed that my right hand (I'm right handed) the polish was chipped. I wouldn't expect for a polish that costs this much to need several coats, but I guess I will try it again. After looking to see the price, I noticed that there are other "steps" available from this line. I have never paid more than $5 for a nail polish that I put on myself. I am going to try using a base coat and top coat to see if that gives it more staying power. If it does, i may up the stars.	-1
First of all, I use many different Jack Black shaving products so I was excited to get to try something different through the Vine program.  In my experience, even though Jack Black is pricier than most, it's been worth the extra money.  In this case, I can't say that.  The lotion is ok, but even when applied as directed on slightly wet skin, it just doesn't seem to stay with you throughout the day as advertised.  I guess smell is a personal thing, but I really don't like the smell of this particular lotion... again, personal preference.  Regardless, even if I liked the aroma, it seems way overpriced compared to some of the other skin products I've tried.  If I could split the rating I would give it 3 stars for quality and one for value.  Sorry Jack Black.  I remain a big fan, but I can't recommend this one.	-1
This is a very thin, clear oil.  It isn't as thick as baby oil and runs almost like water.  I would never put oil or an oil-based product on my skin because it clogs the pores.  Some people might be able to get away with it, but even though I have dry skin, my skin will break out if I put oil on it, so I have skipped that test.  I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.  What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.  Ill stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.	-1
This is a genuine piece of junk. The instructions are impossible to follow; Looking up the web site and trying to understand the usage is a hopeless task, My recycle bin accepted this with open arms.	-1
I purchased this item directly from the manufacturer, so I know it was genuine. I was super excited to try this product bc it looked so exciting and different. I also loved the potential anti-aging effects with this item. BUT...the big but is whether or not it cleans better than my Clarisonic Mia. It doesn't. I alternated using the Mia one night and the Luna the next night, several nights in a row. Whenever I used my Luna, my face still had grime on it - it was not as clean as the nights I used my Mia.  Also, I find it an oddly shaped and designed device for the face - it's hard to get it to fit everywhere. It's basically like taking a flat-ish rock and trying to clean your face with the tip of that rock. Not always a good fit.  For now, I'm sticking with my Mia and will be returning the Luna until the design is much improved....they should've waited to bring this product to market, in my opinion; it's just not up to par as the excellent face-cleaner that it's meant to be and marketed as.	-1
I own all the CND shellac equipment as I believe you get best results when you don't mix brands, however, when I tried this remover it wasn't any better than the normal nail polish remover's I've used in the past. It's supposed to be a more pure acetone, but you can just go to the store and find a nail polish remover that isn't too diluted with other chemicals and is half the price... It'll do the exact same, at least it does for me. The only reason why I'm not giving a one star only is because I have noticed that CND shellac colors act differently when you remove them, for instance the red (wildfire) is so easy to remove, but the black (black pool) is whole different story, so maybe I tried this remover on a hard to take off color.	-1
I expected this to work better than ordinary drug store polish remover. While it works, it's definitely not better, and I'm not certain it's as fast. I won't repurchase. Not worth a higher price, plain and simple.	-1
Very simply put, this product while seemingly making my lips more "smooth and moist" is so ridiculously overpriced, it is the epitome of the make-up industry pushing overpriced, make you feel younger, make you look younger products on the population.  Not to mention, if the opposite sex, or same sex for that matter is looking at your lips to determine the viability of a long lasting relationship, then you know what, move along from that individual.  You lips, should be the LAST thing anybody is concerned about considering anti-aging.  How about you handle those sagging eye lids, or wrinkles around your mouth, face, neck, forehead, whatever.  For the current price of nearly $85, you get just over 1/2 TBS.  Yes that is correct.  You get the luxury of paying $85 for a company that sends you just over 1/2 tablespoon of product.  Think about that.  Go look at your measuring spoons, pull out the 1 TBS and 1/2 TBS and figure you are getting something in between those two amounts for $85.  Honestly, my Burts Bees, or some other higher end lip product will make your lips feel just as good.  I seriously can't imagine anyone paying $85 for such a small amount of product and thinking that perhaps the smallest surface area on your face (your lips) are even in the conversation of anti-aging products to make you look and feel better.	-1
The jar is quit small but since this is for your lips, you don't need a lot. It has an odd scent/flavor to it. Kind of reminds me of cucumber but not quite. It's also not something you can put on your lips then immediately apply lipstick.  After using the treatment, I didn't notice any real difference in how my lips looked or felt. The treatment left my lips feeling a bit dry.	-1
I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars for this review.  After reconsidering back and forth, 2 stars is the way our personal assessment of this mens Eau de Toilette goes.  We didn't like it and would not purchase it.  This fragrance was for our review for the Amazon Vine Program.  As a woman, I have enjoyed and repeated purchase of Burberry Brit for women. Every time I wear this fragrance, I am sure to get compliments.  Anticipating the same for the Burberry for men, we were excited to try this Eau De Toilette.  Our impressions: When first spritzed it has a nice fragrancelightly assertive and crisp.  However, this scent faded quite quickly.  I kept inquiring if my husband had it on.  My husband then applied an extra spritz or two.  It again faded quickly.  I tried it myselfsame outcome.  It also seems to fade to a very light non-memorable scent.  From all I have read about personal scentsit is just that.  Chemistries are unique.  Hence, varying impressions ensue.  For us, not a winner, but for some others, it could be a wonderful.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
Made my hair feel waxy and gooey. Will stick with It's a 10.	-1
This bronzer is two things: it's too dark for my light complexion and it's as orange as it can be.  I can't figure out why it has so many positive reviews.  It goes on smoothly and looks fine for the first hour, then it oxidizes and turns pumpkin orange.  The last thing I want is to look like an oompha-loompha, lol!  I bought it in San Francisco and at the time I swatched it, it didn't appear orange at all.  In fact, it was a nice bronze color that appeared perfectly matte (which it is despite the color shift) and would have been perfect.  My skin is not oily but is normal, so I can't blame the oxidation on oil.  I also use a mattifying primer under my foundation, so it shouldn't have been an issue at all.  When first applied, this bronzer looks quite nice and gave me a nice nude, sunkissed look.  However, an hour later, I was struck by the color shift and I saw that I had orangey brown areas all over my face.  If you want a decent bronzer, either keep looking or try Hoola by Benefit.  Hoola doesn't change color and will give you the nice tan color you're looking for in order to achieve a nude or sculpted look.  This product has totally turned me off to The Balm and despite good reviews for other Balm products, I think I'll pass.  I definitely don't recommend this product.	-1
I didn't like this eyeliner at all. It doesn't go on smooth.  It doesn't perform the way a gel-liner does.  It seems very waxy.	-1
I have recently bought quite a lot of L'Occitane products and have been very impressed - until this shampoo and conditioner! The smell is dreadful, and very strong. Smells like cheap dish-washing soap to me. It hasn't left my hair feeling any different than it normally does and I found it tangled up my hair pretty bad whilst i was trying to comb conditioner through. I won't be using it again, not even just to finish the products off. It really is that bad.	-1
Well, this diffuser is nice quality.......but it doesn't fit on any dryer I've tried it on.	-1
Prefer Pureology's Perfect for Platinum Miracle Filler over this product.	-1
Prefer Pureology's Perfect for Platinum Miracle Filler over this product.	-1
After reading reviews of how wonderful these scrubs are I was expecting a little more out of them.  I actually had to use 2 of them to just get the polish off of my fingernails and we're not talking glitter or anything else heavy.	-1
I have used other Molton products in the past and based on the price, I thought this might be great stuff. Does not lather up and there is no pleasant odor. The bottle is nice, but the contents are absolutely overpriced. If I had not bought it on Amazon, I might think the real product was replaced with a look-alike product. Pretty hard to imaging how this could cost as much as it does.	-1
I got a replacement of this and maybe it might be fake or not, although it has the same qualities reviewers described here. I did not notice any brightening or reduction in blemishes with this	-1
This was tested by a woman in her 60's every day for two weeks and she saw no visible difference to any dark spots under the eyes and no reduction in puffiness. It was also tested on a woman in her mid 30's and she saw no visible improvements either. It's a pretty bottle, although rather small, and it smells nice and moisturizes well, but for the price tag I expect to see some visible improvements but we were disappointed, I can't recommend.	-1
This creme smelled like a mixture of honey and old lady and not in a good way. The tiny spoon that helps you scoop the product out is just that -tiny. I don't like the kind of creams that you must dip in due to the risk of bacteria. I don't care how expensive this creme is or what celebrity utilizes it. I enjoyed faces creams from Benefit, Ponds, and others that smelled better. 4 weeks into applying this creme and I didn't see a difference.	-1
I simply can not get past the heavy furniture polish smell of this cream. I've been using it for about a month and see no difference in my skin, aside from the fact that it's much greasier after application.  I'm 43 with dry but fairly healthy skin and only started using a dedicated face cream this year (previously used olive or other oils, supplemented with the occasional eye cream my mom would give me, maybe as a hint?). My regular cream is Kiehl's Ultra, which made a noticeable difference in my skin within a week. I seldom wear makeup other than mascara, so I expect a face cream to do most of the heavy lifting for my appearance, and I'm doing nothing to change the effect or appearance of cream once it's on my skin.  I switched to this to road test it and was very excited to try such a fancy "miracle cream." Unfortunately, the heavy lemon pledge scent was impossible to ignore, and the greasy feel and look turned me off even more.  The best thing I can say about this cream is that a little goes a long way--a month of twice-daily use barely put a dent in it. I'd estimate that it easily goes 2-3x as far as the Keihl's. If I had liked it, it would have definitely helped rationalize the additional expense (ounce for ounce, this is 4-6x as expensive as my usual, depending on the size jar).  But I didn't like it. Besides the heavy scent, the cream is very greasy and was slow to absorb, even into my dry skin. I didn't like the shiny, greasy appearance on my face, and it did nothing to improve my fine lines to make overcoming the odor and feel worthwhile. In fact, the greasy look seemed to accentuate them, especially around my eyes. Maybe it takes longer than a month to have any effect, but I'm not willing to keep suffering it to find out.  It didn't irritate out my skin, which does tend to be sensitive, and I liked that it did not include sunscreen (usually the irritating culprit).  Because it's so expensive, I'll keep it around and try it again in the winter and see if it's less offensive in cold, dry weather. But for summer use, I kind of hate it, but I'm giving it 2 stars because it goes so far and doesn't irritate my skin.	-1
Gave this to my wife, who keeps trying to find a good face cream that doesn't irritate her skin. Granted - everything does, and she doesn't even use soap. Sad to say - this one didn't pass the test.	-1
Nice looking bottle and ingredients, but unfortunately caused severe acne break-out for my wife.  This appears to be a good quality product.  Of course, it is an oil, and it has a nice feel to it; however, my wife had a pretty intense eruption of acne, nodular, with use of only a slight amount, one time.  My wife is not particularly sensitive to anything.  One would have to weigh their decision on use carefully.	-1
I'm almost 60 years old, so I shouldn't have to worry about acne anymore.  Unfortunately, a few hours after using this oil, my entire face erupted in acne.  I tried it a few more times, just to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  It wasn't; each time, I got more acne than the time before.  Oh, this oil made my skin feel soft without an oily feeling, but I'm too old to have my face covered in acne.  I won't be using this anymore.	-1
The product appears to be very streamline and CORDLESS but that is completely inaccurate.  Although, NOT AMAZONS fault!!!  I placed an order and received a corded product which is not what I was looking for.  Amazon graciously re-ordered it for me and low and behold the same corded product arrived.  I then went onto the Silk';n web site and saw the corded and portable / rechargeable photo's as well.  I waited over the weekend until the manufactures office was open and they no longer make the cordless / rechargeable model.  So,  needless to say I am ordering another make and model.  Who wants to be lassoed to an electrical outlet!!!	-1
I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE TRIED TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT. I DID NOT RECEIVE THE BRUSH IT WAS SAPOSE TO COME WITH IT. I TRIED USING A DIFFERENT BRUSH I HAVE AND THE PRODUCT DID NOT APPLY WELL AND DID NOTHING LIKE THE DESCRIPTION SAID IT WOULD DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!	-1
Yikes!!!! I was mistaken. My faced looked more oily then anything else. I threw it away.	-1
I really don't like saying this but I received a counterfeit product here. I've used the real product for yrs with good success . It always works well. When I started using this item, nothing happened. No lashes grew.  I called my esthetician who lives in another town to order a tube from her for comparison. (By ordering from Amazon,I was just trying to save her the hassle of mailing me the GrandeLash-MD but I won't make that mistake again.) With the tube from her, lashes were growing within 3 days. This packaging all looks authentic & the price is in line with the real product but I either received a tube filled with defective liquid or they're selling a counterfeit. Review update: Someone replied that they called the company & were told it's only genuine if puchased  from amazon Luxury. I viewed my order & I purchased from amazon Luxury. To double check, I went to amazon Luxury & searched for GrandeLash. When the product was found in amazon Luxury the note, "You purchased this in 3/18" showed above the product. Amazon verifies I bought it in amazon Luxury.	-1
Got fake knock off stuff. Caused me stinging and pain in my eyes right away. STEER CLEAR!!!!!	-1
I love wearing makeup and are always trying new products in the market. I had tried other cream eyeshadows before and they seemed to disappear in a just a few hours. I had hoped that the marketplace had a longer lasting eyeshadow and I thought that with the high price that this might be it. I was completely disappointed in that the eyeshadow lasted less than a couple of hours. The color was beautiful and if you are only going out for a very short time you might want to consider this eyeshadow although the price is way too high.  I cannot recommend this product as it does not last and it is very expensive. The only thing was that the color was very pretty.	-1
I had a hard time opening this and when I finally did the top of the cream pencil got stuck to the inside of the cap and completely got pulled free of the main tube. I managed to stuff it back in and got my hands covered in color for my troubles. Really bad packaging. At least the color seems nice.	-1
I got this eyeshadow crayon in Baroque.  In the pencil it looks like a garish bronze, but on the eye it is a very flattering, soft brown color.  Since my lids themselves are very oily, I applied this shadow only in the crease and above.  Those areas I'd characterize as being "normal" (ie, neither oily or dry).  The crayon went on very very easily and blended out beautifully.  However, it never "dried" as claimed, and was almost totally gone within a couple of hours, as if I had never applied any makeup at all.  I tried again with a lid primer, but the same thing happened.  At any time, you can easily rub this right off with your finger.  I really wanted to like this, but alas, I was disappointed.	-1
I recently tried several Jourer products after seeing several beauty vloggers talking about the brand.  I'm a big fan of eyeshadow sticks (love the ones from Tarte and Mally), so I expected great color payoff (which I got), lovely satin finish (which I also got), and easy blendability with my finger or brush (I did NOT get).  This eyeshadow crayon does not blend.  The second you swipe it on, it sets and it doesn't budge.  I tried softening the edges with my fingers, brushes, and nothing.  I practically had to rub my eyelids raw to blend it at all.  Really disappointed since the color was lovely.	-1
Not worth it	-1
I really have not seen any results from this product.  I have been using for a over a month now and I cannot tell any difference.  I have used Latisse before and saw quick results. This as well burns if it gets in your eyes so I had to be very sparing with how close I put it on my lashes.  It also was causing some irritation on the eyelid (ie itching, tender red after continued use.  I am not sure if this is authentic product, because I have had several friends use Grand Lash before and it worked really well.	-1
While this shower gel does have a great smell, it doesn't seem to clean very well and after using it a few days, it felt like it was starting to dry out my sensitive skin. I would never buy this a gift for anyone or let it replace any of my current body wash.	-1
Once you've tried one cologne shower gel, you've tried them all. The scent is strong, but the bubbles are slim. No pouf in the world can give you the soapy suds you desire and it never feels like it's doing any cleaning. This is especially true of the Burberry gel.  If you are determined to buy it, I recommend using your usual bar or favorite body wash first so you will actually be clean and then follow up with the Burberry so your skin will smell like a Dillard's Men's Department for the next thirty minutes.  Admittedly I do love the Burberry Brit Rhythm scent. It's conventionally masculine but a step above your typical locker room clich. It's deep and sexual, but not especially overpowering. The gel does not linger on your skin for long, so if you aren't going to follow-up with the cologne itself, you better move fast and get someone in bed because otherwise, no one will notice.  OVERALL: I would never recommend any shower gel that is from a cologne line and do not recommend the Burberry either. They all fail as a cleansing soap, are overexpensive, and, most surprisingly, the fragrance doesn't linger. I do like the scent, though, so if you're shopping around for a new cologne, you might give Brit Rhythm a sniff to see if it fits your needs.	-1
I'm not a fan of this. I usually use Ivory soap after a run. I find it to be the only soap that can actually get me pretty clean and tame my odor. This didn't work at all. I used nearly a quarter of the bottle and it still did nothing for me. Afterwards, when I went to towel off, I saw dirt streaks all over my white towel. I had to hop back into the shower and use my standby Ivory soap.  The smell is unoffensive, it reminds me a bit of Cool Water. It does fade pretty quickly (that can be viewed as a plus or minus if you like the smell of Cool Water).  I can't recommended this. For the price, you should look elsewhere or just rack up on Ivory.	-1
Terrific flat iron.  I tried both curly and straight hair styles with it.  Usually my hair is somewhat dry after styling.  The vapor really helps.  It's very simple.  You fill the cartridge, plug the iron in,  put it on the heat and vapor setting you want,  wait about 3 min. I was afraid the cartridge would leak,  but so far so good.  I like that it comes with a spare regardless.  My only quibble is the price of the refill oil.  20 bucks.  It only lasts about ten uses so depending on how often you style your hair,  you could spend 40 a month on oil.  ***Edit*** I've nearly used the first bottle of oil. My initial cartridge is already leaking, and not where you'd expect it to, not where the oil goes in, but along the side of the cartridge. Further inspection shows there is a crack in the plastic, on the side that faces the iron. This iron has not been dropped or mishandled, so there is no reason for the crack. I could merely start using another cartridge, which was included, but I don't want to spend 20 bucks on oil that's going to end up all over my hands before I've even used the bottle.	-1
This is the worst product I've been asked to review. The texture is awful: sticky and thick, reminding me of a cross between Lansinoh lanolin ointment and  A & D diaper cream.  It creates this gross, impermeable, unbreathable layer over my skin, which not only did NOT get rid of the shine on my nose and forehead, it also accentuated the creases by my eyes! Really the worst of all possible worlds. My face felt completely yucky after applying this, and I still had to use loose powder to get rid of the shine.  You can believe that this product will have NO place in my beauty routine. I will stick to lovely face moisturizers and loose or compressed powder (or even foundation) on those shiny days.  I wouldn't even buy this at cheapo drugstore prices, which this is not. It's really just that bad.	-1
Im never certain what a toner is supposed to do, but from my use of this, Id guess that the answer is absolutely nothing. I admit that I do not have any other products in this line, but I could see no difference in my skin. When I use it on a cotton round, I don't see anything but the blue of the toner on the cotton. I get exactly the same results from using water. I even tested it out once, using water on one side of my face and toner on the other. I couldn't tell the difference by looking at the cotton round or by looking at my skin. As far as I can tell, this is just smelly blue water, as it smells a bit like play dough to me.	-1
I tested this on a 70 degree sunny winter day in Houston. This is a creme, not a lotion, it is so thick that it's hard to spread. This is the type of sunscreen that goes on with a thick pure white color (due to the zinc which blocks the sun's rays) and you have to work hard to spread it so you don't look ridiculous as if coated in white paint. It is very thick and greasy and made my skin feel uncomfortable and hot. This is a gloppy creme product that feels like a thick layer over your skin, that your skin can't breathe or sweat, and that made me feel that the temperature was hotter than it really was. I tested it also on my face and could not take it, way too greasy, so I washed that off immediately. Another negative is it has five different parabens in it. Rating 1 star = Hate It. It is unusable to me. To contras to compare I use a SPF daily face sunscreen by EltaMD in clear, just to show that you can indeed find a clear (not white) light very wearable, non-greasy facial sunscreen product.	-1
So I used this product all up and don't see or feel any different about my skin. I used as directed but nothing has changed.	-1
I agreed to review this product in exchange for recieving the product at no cost, however I have searched extensively for information on whether or not the product contains any animal products and can't find any definitive information on the Obgagi website.  It's not clear that the product is not tested on animals either.  I used the product for a week and have seen absolutely no difference in my skin.	-1
I've been using Vitamin C on my face since forever, probably 25 years. I started putting the oral liquid vitamin C on at night - the first time I saw the articles mentioning how good it is for you. I needed some and this was a Vine offer and I thought why not.  Cons: Scented - why???? Already appears to be oxidizing as the serum has a tinge of yellow. (I always keep mine in the fridge) Price $$$$  it's priced ridiculously high  Right here on Amazon you can get a stronger Vitamin C serum made the day you order it and shipped to you the next day. The cost for 3 bottles is $33 less than one bottle of this.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NuFountain-C20-Ferulic-Vitamin-C-Serum-Made-Fresh-When-Ordered-with-Free-Shipping/dp/B0039LZW78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NuFountain C20+Ferulic Vitamin C Serum.

This is a lightweight clear oil/serum.  My wife has been using it on her d&eacute;colletage to try and erase some of the sun damage done in her earlier years.  She has been using it daily for about a month and has not noticed any real improvement.  At first she was using it on her face too, but got worried that the oily consistency would make her acne prone skin break out and switched to the C complex for her face instead.  The product claims there may be a slight tingling sensation when applied, but that continued use would remedy this, however she did not experience any at all.  The bottle will last for several months as you only need to apply 5-7 several drops to your face, neck and d&eacute;colletage. For the price I would hope that it would work.  Perhaps it only works on mild sun damage and aging skin?	-1
Obagi's Professional-C Serum is a mixed bag.  After 10 days of morning applications, here are my observations.  -it basically acts as a super hydration compound with the serum successfully affecting more than just surface tissue on your face. -dryer areas and lines see minor improvements in ways you would hope for from a product like this -application leaves room for improvement.  Serum is viscous and oily and need to be worked in with the fingers.  Better for spot applications then general usage. -no apparent smell or color. -no irritation or discoloring.  This is a luxury product that is nice for minor improvements.	-1
To start, this was packaged TERRIBLY! It was just in a small box and then thrown into a regular office envelope, so by the time it arrived, half of it had leaked through the plastic seal on the lid, all over the box and into the envelope.  That aside, I cleaned off the crusty, dried residue on the bottle and dropper and gave it a try (with about the .5 oz that was left in the bottle).  I have VERY sensitive skin, but also have trouble spots below my eyes.  This claims that it is good for sensitive skin, but may tingle a little when you first use and that's OK (says that right on the box).  So, the first time I used it, it did indeed tingle, A LOT, it was a sensation similar to when your foot falls asleep,  but on my face, under my eyes, so it made my eyes red and water terribly.  Since they had said that might happen, the next day I gave it another shot to see, same thing happened. This was the case every day for a week, additionally, it wasn't doing anything to change the dark, wrinkled spots below my eyes.  So after about 10 days, I stopped using it.  Overall, this stuff didn't do anything to change my eye area, except make my eyes red and watery-no skin improvement at all.	-1
I was so excited at getting the opportunity to test out a higher end facial product, but unfortunately it does not work well for me - your mileage may vary. The product was easy to use, cleaned my lightly made-up face and no heavy perfumes that I could detect. That said, based on my own personal experiences with the after results, I can't rate this higher. After a few days, my face became very agitated and itchy and when I switched back to my lower end cleanser the itchiness is gone.	-1
Fresh clean smell, clear gel. Works pretty well and removed all my makeup including most of my mascara which is water resistant.  Sadly, I didn't read ingredients before using it. This is loaded with parabens. Won't be purchasing it.	-1
2 Stars for the nail clippers, they are super.  The nail file is o.k. but the trimmer is way overrated it is a manual trimmer, not even battery operated.  Looks like something you would find on clearance at a discount store.  For the price of the set, I'm just not impressed.	-1
This grooming kit comes in a nice, supple leather case.  However, it seems quite overpriced for what it is.  You get 1) a metal file and nail cleaner; 2) a manual nose and ear hair trimmer; and 3) a cleverly designed set of clippers with a retractable lever.  After using the set, I think the clippers are the only element that reflects typical Henckels standards and quality.  The file is fine for what it is, but it's nothing special.  It's a stainless steel nail file with a decent finish.  The real downfall of this kit is the rotary trimmer.  It is a manually operated trimmer (i.e., you have to hold the mid-barrel piece and spin the cutting shaft assembly by hand).  And it does not cut hair so much as it pulls it out.  It was an unpleasant experience to use it on nose hairs as some of them are growing from highly sensitive areas.  In the past, I have used a Panasonic battery-powered trimmer and never had a similar problem; the Panasonic cut the hairs with a rapidly spinning blade.  This trimmer, on the other hand, is difficult to operate because you cannot hold it perfectly still while also spinning the cutting shaft assembly with your other hand.  Sure, it isn't going to cut your flesh, and it feels substantial.  But unfortunately it appears to have been designed for masochists.  There is a small brush inside the base of the trimmer to help wipe away the follicles the trimmer pulls out with the hairs.  This device appears to be the principal reason the kit costs so much, and it ruins the value of the kit.  The nail clipper is fine and sharp.  You operate it by pulling the lever to extend it from the body of the trimmer and then, once it pops up, by pushing it forward to put it into position to generate leverage.  The clippers are sharp and work well on fingernails.  But they alone are not worth the price of admission for this kit.  If I were to receive this as a gift, I would suspect that the giver was trying to punish me for some (imagined) slight.  Better than being sealed behind a brick wall perhaps, but only just.  Not recommended.	-1
I LOVE Jane Iredale products, but this lipstick was a disappointment.  It smells awful on your lips and since your lips are just below your nose, you smell it a lot.  I picked a darker shade and it was anything but. When I first put it on, no change in color, 2nd time, same result, third time (pressing hard) I got some of the color to show.  It isn't that moist - goes on more like chapstick.  For the price, definitely not worth it.  I'll be heading to the drugstore to buy Revlon.	-1
I had no experience with this scent prior to ordering the sample, certainly a risky move when ordering a personal fragrance. After several applications on various models, I must say, it's not to my liking at all. It's not to anyone in my household's liking, either. In a word, it's simply overpowering. It has that old person's scent strength of roses that I don't find appealing at all. My wife doesn't care for it either, for the same reasons; it's simply too strong. There isn't a hint of subtlety in the fragrance. When you factor in the price tag, you've really got to sample this before ordering. Go to your local department store and give it a go. Maybe you'll like it, but there are three women in my life (ages 45, 24, and 18) and not one of them cared for it. Neither my 19 year old son nor I care for it, either. That's all the evidence I need.	-1

So that I could do a good comparison, I used this on only one half of my face. After using it twice, one week apart, I didn't see any change in my skin at all, so I decided to step it up and used it again after five days - nothing. I used it again after four days, then three, and still no results. In addition, the detoxifying primer has red 33 and blue 1, and both the primer and the activator have fragrance which I don't like and which does linger. I find the addition of these ingredients unnecessary and annoying.  I've gotten amazing results with the [[ASIN:B00IONTP06 StriVectin SD Advanced Intensive Concentrate for Wrinkles and Stretch Marks, 4.5 fl oz.], and was hoping that the StriVectin Glycolic Peel would be just as amazing, so I'm very disappointed that it didn't work for me. Based on my experience, I can't recommend this product.	-1
This is not an effective glycolic acid treatment. I was suspicious when I saw the ingredients: the "primer" has baking soda as a main ingredient. So you're layering an acid over a base. What's the point? I tried this on my face and, to do a better comparison, tried it a few times on one hand. Sure, skin felt softer immediately after treatment: there are moisturizers in the mix, so it's got the short term softening effect of any skin mask. But that faded within hours, and over a couple of weeks I could see no difference between the treated or untreated hand.  This product doesn't work. You can find effective glycolic acid treatments for far less.	-1
I don't have many wrinkles, but a few are forming around the mouth area.  Ive been impressed with other Vichy products, and thought this might help.  The box touts, instantly skin appears dramatically smoother and plumped and in eight weeks youthfulness is visibly improved.  My first application burned and shortly afterwards my upper lip area resembled something akin to using a bad hair removal creamred and patchy skin.  I was glad I had no plans for the day.  This is the first time I've used a retinol productis this to be expected?  Even worse, that area looked even drier and tighter as the day went on.  I didn't think my skin was sensitive, but Im afraid to try this product again.  I followed directions, used it sparingly and applied to a clean face.	-1
I have other Vichy products that I really like, all five stars, but this one fell short of the mark. The claim is that it "Visibly fills wrinkles & expression lines; Instantly smoothes & plumps skin". I purposely used this on only one side of my face, so I could see if it made a difference, and it did not. There was no difference between the two sides of my face even after repeated uses. I've been using other wrinkle reducing products for a few years now. Maybe my wrinkles are so fine that this product doesn't affect them, but there wasn't any plumping either.	-1
This Vichy product claims to instantly minimize wrinkles. My wrinkles are finer rather than deep, and if this claim is true, I should have noticed a difference during repeated trials. I did not. The serum has a smooth, silky texture, and moisturizer goes on over it very nicely. Persistent use didn't obscure any wrinkles. I feel the company overreached their claims. Perhaps that is why they discontinued this product and it is no longer available on Amazon.	-1
When I first received this, I tried to twist off the cap and it came apart in two pieces. I then saw that the tube itself had a foil seal, so I pierced it with a fork.  There are no instructions explaining how else to do this.  I spread a little of the formula on the back of one hand to test the consistency. It's very light and absorbed easily. However, my skin began to sting and burn.  It wasn't severe, but it wasn't subsiding either.  I don't have sensitive skin, especially not on my hands, so this was problematic. On the other hand (no pun intended), the skin immediately looked great. I mean REALLY nice and youthful.  With great trepidation, I applied the tiniest bit to a small area of my face, next to my mouth.  Sadly, it burned, and I had to wash it off.  If you've used other retinol products before, this might be a good step up. However, it might be too strong for a new user.	-1
Aweful coverage, like mud on my face	-1
Corrective Fluid Makeup for the Face Like Correction Fluid ((White Out))  for Paper  This Vichy Finish covered my skin like that.  In a thick Opal colored blanket.   I was looking for basic coverage that would hide some of the signs of aging.  I always wear a Natural Looking makeup.  I may be wearing foundation, blush and powder, eyeliner and mascara, but if I go heavy it's on the eyes, not the foundation.  After multiple tries I could not find a way to tone this product down so that I could wear it.  Fortunately I had&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vichy-Puret-Micellar-Cleaning-Solution/dp/B000Q388UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vichy Puret Micellar Cleaning Solution</a>&nbsp;to get it off.  That latter Vichy product works great.  Soap and water, not so much.  SUMMARY I was ready for a clown nose after putting this on.  It was just too thick and heavy for me.  BUT that might make it perfect for someone with small scars to hide.  I was looking to hide the signs of aging and for the most part, while this would hide age spots and broken veins, it presents wrinkles in a bad light.  If used around the eyes you are going to hate what it does to those crows feet.  (not me, I tried them on a friend, lol)  Don't Recommend except for special cases.	-1
When I read the description of "corrective fluid foundation," I really expected this to be more of a cover-up cream. However, all of the text on the tube actually talks about it like it's exclusively sunblock. I think that's the issue---it doesn't work well as either.  SUNBLOCK: If you look online, you are supposed to put about a "nickel-size" amount of sunblock on your face. Recommendations vary. Using that amount, you would go through a tube of this pretty quickly---and it's pricey.  FOUNDATION: Again, based on the word "corrective," I expected this to be a good cover up for some of the sun spots on my nose. Unforunately, there is a powdery component (despite the fact that it comes out of the tube pretty watery) that settled right into the pores, making it looks like I  have dry, flaky skin, which isn't even the case. My face looked so much better without this produce than with it. I am in the mid-40s, so maybe if you have younger skin it will work better for you, but it certainly did not work well for me.  GENERAL PERFORMANCE: As noted, it comes out a bit watery but dries quite powdery. We tried using it simply to cover a few acne spots on my daughter's face. It was ok for that, and I expect that's what we'll do with the rest of the tube, but I wouldn't buy it specifically for that reason, when a cover-up stick is so much more convenient, costs less, and lasts longer.  This product seems to have quite a few high ratings, but it didn't work for us and we won't be buying it in the future.	-1
Vichy Dermafinish comes in a medium sized squeeze tube, and the shade I received for testing was correct for my skin tone.  The foundation is creamy, smooth, and applies easily with fingers or makeup brush, and gives even coverage whether applied in a light, medium, or full layer.  Unfortunately, Vichy Dermafinish didn't wear well during the day; on dry patches, it flaked off (ugh - not a problem I ever have with my Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue), and on my cheeks it sank into every pore.  The foundation is a physical sunblock, courtesy of titanium dioxide, so it photographs poorly and changes color in different lighting. It also includes dimethicone near the top of it's ingredient list, so it would cause break-outs for me or anyone else sensitive to silicones.  If you need the specialized coverage of Vichy Dermablend, you'll love the texture and easy application, as well as the SPF30. For normal coverage needs, there are better options.	-1
I love makeup, and am always searching for THE best foundation. However, this is not it.  I have pale Caucasian skin, and although this shade (Opal) is in the right color family, it has that chalky look that comes from titanium dioxide.  It is very matte, but instead of looking flawless, I felt it had a mask-like effect.  On the positive side, it is non-comedogenic.  If you want a nice matte foundation, I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Too-Faced-Born-This-Way-Foundation-WARM-BEIGE/dp/B00ZCGPMFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Too Faced Born This Way Foundation WARM BEIGE</a>&nbsp;(choice of shades). It looks very natural while being full-coverage and oil free.  For a dewy, radiant effect, I love&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CoverGirl-Advanced-Radiance-Liquid-Makeup-Creamy-Natural-120-1-0-Ounce/dp/B000MVEA5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CoverGirl Advanced Radiance Liquid Makeup, Creamy Natural 120, 1.0-Ounce</a>.

Maybe it's what they use for the sunscreen, but this foundation settled into my pores and looked horrible. I tried putting a moisturizer under it, but it didn't help. Maybe it would work if I use a primer, but I'm not really into a lot of fuss. A young woman with smooth skin might not have this complaint. The opal color was exactly right for my skin tone, which is very fair. But I guess my go-to product will remain&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BOOTS-No7-Dual-Action-Tinted-Moisturiser/dp/B00BN7FCU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BOOTS No7 Dual Action Tinted Moisturiser)</a>.	-1
My daughter, 15 yo, and myself, old mom, got to play around with both the NUDE and SAND colors.  It was fun.  One thing I can tell you is that neither the SAND nor the NUDE will work for anyone with a really pale complexion.  My daughter is blessed with a peaches and cream complexion and both of these concealers looked like blushes on her.  One the other hand, I with my slightly reddish complexion did fine with both.  Go figure.  I put it on my cheeks where I have a tiny broken vein and both hid it.  PROBLEMS -- When I say that the SAND and NUDE concealer hid the tiny red line that is my broken vein I mean that if I dabbed them on that they did their job.  If I swiped them on they did not cover the spot.  You have to build up some of the slightly waxy concealer.  -- Which brings up another problem that I noticed.  The moment I put a foundation on over the concealer the concealer vanished.  It would appear to have dissolved and blended too well with the foundation.  -- I also found another test subject.  One with an age spot on her hand.  I've put up two pictures with and without the concealer so you can see it at work.  -- Pale skin.  I talked about it above but if you are pale neither of these concealers will look natural.  With my poor camera skills you might not be able to make out the difference, but I tried to show what they look like on my daughter.  SUMMARY I'm actually likely to wear this without foundation.  The reason being that if I dab-dab-dabbed it on it certainly covered nicely but it didn't stay put when I tried it with foundation.  If you a pale go with something other than Nude.	-1
useless. I returned it	-1

If I had done my research before hand, I would not have ordered this product.  I did try it before I read the ingredients and found it only marginally helped my dry, frizzy hair.  It did make it bit shinier, but didn't really tame it like the video shows so I don't feel like I'm losing the best thing ever by not using it. I certainly didn't say "wow". If you use a hot dryer and a round brush, even without products, it will smooth down and shine more so I don't think that part of the video is a good representation of how it works. Now that I have read the ingredients and done my research I can't recommend this product. The second ingredient is PROPYLENE GLYCOL, an ingredient that various websites warn against using.  It's the same ingredient that is in anti-freeze.  It works by breaking down the hair so it appears shiny and relaxed, but it can irritate the skin and can be absorbed. Factory workers are told to use goggles and gloves when handling this ingredient, according to one website.  It is a very common ingredient in shampoos and conditions, and I'm not saying this product is any worse than another, but I, personally, am trying to put less chemicals in and on my body since I'm so sensitive to so many things these days.. There are a lot of other ingredients listed as well with long chemical names that may or may not be bad, but since Propylene Gycol is number 2 after water on the list, I stopped there and won't use it again.  I advise anyone to do their own research and see if it is a concern, or not, to you.  As I said, it's in a lot of products and has been used for years, but of course that doesn't make it a good thing.	-1
This may do wonderful things for my damaged and color-treated hair, but I can't get past the fact that it doesn't lather at all. If it doesn't lather, it doesn't really spread throughout your hair either. I tried it twice, once after another, in an attempt to lather and spread throughout my hair and scalp, with no luck. I did not obtain that "squeaky-clean" feeling. Shampoo is not a winner for me.	-1
Too much flowery scent, but at least it dissipates after rinsing. I like shampoos that lather; others have said this lathers a lot, but I don't find that to be the case. My hair felt "dirty" quicker when using this shampoo compared to others I've used, most of the time it's Paul Mitchell products that I use. I also didn't notice more shine, but that's hard to achieve when you color your hair blonde. As far as retaining my coloring job longer, that takes time to evaluate.	-1
Product was shipped quickly and while I do like some SkinMedica products this one did nothing for me.	-1
it smells weird	-1
Heavily, heavily, heavily, heavily perfumed.  If you have sensitive skin, I recommend you stay far away from this.  Like most things from Vichy's parent company (Loreal) I found this product to be a horrible choice for my sensitive skin.  The serum wasn't nearly as offensive as the moisturizer (and I'm sincerely not sure if I reacted to the serum itself, but I can verify that is a very perfumed product, though not as strongly scented as the moisturizer).  I have combo/dry skin and sensitive skin, but I do not always react to perfumes.  This moisturizer broke me out, irritated my skin, and it irritated my eyes (without being applied near).  All this without feeling particularly moisturizing.  These are more perfumed than some perfumed body lotions I've bought.  This moisturizer should never go on a face.  My skin is SLOWLY recovering for this experiment. Regret, regret, regret.  The packaging is adorable, and it should be noted that these are trial gift with purchase type sizes.  I think the $30-ish pricepoint is fair since you have an option to try multiple products before committing to a larger size.  The products are just kinda crappy.  Though I do love the Lancme brand, I would  suggest that with that one exception, anyone with sensitive skin avoid ANY and ALL face products from all brands under the Loreal umbrella.  The two stars were awarded because the packaging is cute and most of my rant is focused on the moisturizer itself.  I also think being able to purchase sample sizes to try or travel with is always a wonderful option for companies to offer.  Even without absolutely hating the other two products, I would still never buy those again, and they are too perfumed to recommend to anyone, so I was still unable to bump this up to a third star.	-1
Very strong fragrance. Serum is nice, lightweight and a little goes long way. Cream is rich, perfect for dry skin or as a night treatment. I don't like the cleanser- not good in removing make up and it feels like a bar soap on the skin. Overall I wouldn't buy it. As for active ingredients they seems good, but there was no visible impact on my skin. I use Skinceuticals, IS clinicals, Dr Spiiller and Kate Somerville. Pricey but they do not make my skin feel only good, they actually make a change with clinical studies behind (especially Skinceuticals). I know Vichy from Europe when I grew up and I liked it this brand. Now I am an esthetician so I know more about skin, ingredients and importance of pH in products. My advice go to a good med spa for consultation and invest in good products. Your skin will thank you.	-1
I don't have sensitive skin  Ive used skin care products with AHAs and retinol without a problem, but this serum did cause a bad reaction.  I noticed a slight stinging sensation when I first applied it, but it passed quickly.  The following day I saw a little redness in the chin and cheek area and by day two I had broken out with tiny red bumps.  I discontinued the serum and my skin cleared up in about 4-5 days.  This is a lightweight serum and a little goes a long way.  One pump should be enough to cover your entire face and neck.  It absorbed into my skin quickly and did not leave my face feeling at all sticky, and I was able to apply foundation make-up on top without any issues.  This serum does have a strong fragrance that dissipates once youve applied it; after a few minutes I really wasn't aware of any scent.  I wouldnt necessarily let my experience deter you from trying this product.  Skin sensitivities can be pretty fickle, and just because I had a bad reaction doesnt mean that you will too.  I would suggest doing a patch test  perhaps a small spot on the side of your neck  instead of just jumping into a full application.	-1
Very strong perfume smell. The pump was broken and so was the lid.  It says it is for sensitive skin however, my face broke out after one application (the strong smell didn't help either).	-1
not for sensitive skin. irritates me, but smells very good and gives a good tone to the skin.	-1
This serum is actually a lotion.  It smells OK, and is not irritating. It goes on really smoothly but once it dries it sort of "pills" off which is why I gave it only two stars. I did one side of my face with this and one side with<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NIVEA-Extended-Moisture-Body-Lotion-16-9-Ounce/dp/B00DG8EZKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NIVEA Extended Moisture Body Lotion, 16.9 Ounce</a>&nbsp;and couldn't tell the difference. Both sides felt less dry, both sides had the "pilling" issue. I think it is a problem with lotions in general. It is good that there were instructions on the Amazon site because there were no instructions on the bottle or box. The box had tiny print and more languages than I could count, but appears to be marketed mostly to Russia and eastern Europe. The bottle says "made in France."	-1
First of all, if a company cannot figure out a way to effectively seal a $60+ product so that it doesn't leak during shipping, I really don't know what to think about their attention to detail at other levels of production. This arrived with one of those super flimsy covers under the lid that take no effort whatsoever to remove, and the cream was able to leak out. Obviously, if I had paid for this, it would have been an immediate return with a request for whatever shipping charges I had incurred. Since I got it free as an amazon Vine reviewer, I didn't have to go through that dog and pony show, but it immediately rubbed me the wrong way. This is not an inexpensive product! Though it had been exposed to air, I still tried some on my hands so I could review it adequately. The texture is thick, sort of like shea butter and a little oily but it does sink in quickly. There is a strong scent to it that, hours later, has not dissipated. It isn't awful but sort of a combination of coconut and Italian soap. I'm over it, but it isn't over me. The cream is full of cheap chemicals and silicones, so it's up to the user to decide what level of cleanliness in their face care they want. It's not the worst product ever (hence two stars), but between the overpowering scent, the dubious value, and the laxe packaging, I would definitely give this a pass.	-1
Although the texture of this therapy cream is very nice, I absolutely disliked the scent of the product which smells like coconut oil.  Never having eaten a truffle, except the chocolate ones which are a real treat during the holidays, I have no idea of what a real truffle smell like.  But, this cream is not something I'll be using.	-1
I use a self tanned. This sponge is too hard to lightly remove the lotion.  I tried it several times in different areas. I still wound up with the same results. You can use a a tissue to remove excessive over added Sun tan in the bottle. For me this did not work.	-1
These self-tan erasers are nicely shaped for getting in between toes and fingers but can irritate the skin. I tested in on my skin and did not like the itchy feeling. I had got them for erasing makeup mistakes but it seems like this is not the right product if it's so irritating to the skin.  I had purchased a big bag of mini magic erasers from a specialty Japanese store in a mall that sells everything for under $3 and found these look suspiciously like those erasers. This product could potentially work, but I will probably not test it out as I don't want to risk the same itchy feeling on my face or neck. Magic Erasers are made of melamine foam - the same melamine that is also used to make those unbreakable dishes, so it's an abrasive, almost like a super-superfine sandpaper. Some other erasers can have a higher content of polyurethane foam that is less abrasive and softer.  After the reaction on my arm I took a look at various websites including Sephora. I found that almost 80% users reported red burns on skin that took over a week to heal and are advising people to use it as a last resort emergency product as it burns if you rub skin with it. I am surprised people are even recommending it as a last resort as it seems that this sponge is made of the melamine foam that has a harsh abrasive reaction as it literally scrapes off the entire top layer of the skin to leave a raw burn. The product packaging has absolutely no information on the composition or any warnings.  Not recommended.	-1
Well, it is soft and cushiony. It is also expensive! Reading Emma's review, I pulled out the magic eraser we had under the sink and she is right! It feels exactly the same!!! The texture is the same. The look and feel is the same. Only the shape is different. My wife uses a self tanner and I have never noticed streaks, etc., but I thought I would get these for her to try. She did not like them at all. It's rough and she has sensitive skin. So, I tried it (and I don't have sensitive skin) and my skin felt irritated too. I did not press hard and followed the directions. I guess we have two mini magic erasers to use around the house....but it will not go on our skin.	-1
Very unhappy with this product. First time it was used it felt nice and smooth with ok smell. Second time I used it, the product packaging FAILED. The entire seam on one side burst open and lotion went everywhere! I am not the Hulk by any means so it wasn't that I was trying to force lotion out. It's a packaging failure. Not a fun mess to clean up out of carpet (it was in the bedroom at the time). If I had actually purchased this instead of getting it to try, I would want my money back. Glad it wasn't in my purse when this happened (I carry hand cream in my purse).	-1
It wasn't anything exciting, I prefer other cheaper lip balms.	-1
I really wanted this to work.  Unfortunately the curls just didn't last on me.  I tried it a few times , used hair spray and different products but after 30 minutes the curls were all gone.  I got the babyliss miracurl and my curls last a week.	-1
I tried this and wish that I could have liked it. The spring/clamp just did not hold my hair at all--my hair is very silky and maybe if I curled it more the damaged ends would hold better. Honestly it was very heavy to hold compared to other products out there. I returned it. Your money is better spent with a nice wand and maybe a heat resistant glove for 1/3 of the cost.	-1
I am very fair and even the lightest shade of this foundation is too dark. As with many foundations it seems to have too much yellow in the base. The coverage is not as I had hoped either. I have good skin but this did not even cover my freckles. I will not purchase this again.	-1
It is awful! The texture is not smooth enough. The color, even matched to the skin perfectly, turns it into a dead ugly shade with no vibrancy or lifelike appearance. If you want a zombie look for Halloween, go for it. I cannot imagine this can be used for anything in real life. Maybe on a movie set or at the theater there is a use for it. There are a ton of better products around the corner at a local Walgreens, not to mention Sephora and other higher end cosmetics retailers.	-1
I've had the opportunity to try several Dermablend products, and overall, I'm not a fan.  The coverage of this powder is medium at best. It makes my middle-aged (oily) skin look awful.  It highlights every pore and fine line and looks very matte and cakey. As the day wears on, it gets streaky.  I think if you're young with very soft, smooth skin, this could work, but for me it's a no.	-1
First of all, this product has much more of an orange tint to it than is normal, much too orange for my fair skin, and even too orange for my sister who is a couple of shades darker than I am. It doesn't apply very easy, as far as spreading evenly and requires you to apply it in a more caked on fashion which is very unappealing. Both myself, and my sister couldn't stand it, and it felt heavy on our face. I wouldn't recommend!	-1
This has buildable coverage if you need extra heavy coverage. It stays on just fine. I gave it three stars because it settled into my fine lines and made them really prominent. If you have no fine lines this would work well.	-1
This was not my favorite powder that I have used.  I typically use Makeup Forever which I feel is an excellent finishing powder that is buildable and leaves your face looking poreless.  After the first application I knew this product wasn't for me.  Maybe because it was just too full of a coverage for me.  I could see the powder on my face (even after tapping off access) and only putting a light amount on my face.  I also felt like it really shown my pores and fine lines.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MAKE-UP-FOR-EVER-Pro-Finish-Multi-Use-Powder-Foundation-120-Neutral-Ivory-0-35-oz/dp/B00AATMGCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MAKE UP FOR EVER Pro Finish Multi-Use Powder Foundation 120 Neutral Ivory 0.35 oz</a>.(Not the color I typically use, but so you can see the product that I am comparing it to).	-1
The effect of this foundation is very cakey.  I have older skin with lines and this foundation emphasizes them.  It does a good job of covering  age spots but  the trade off is not good.	-1
I actually expected this beige powder to be darker in nature than it is. It is closer to ivory in color. Nevertheless, I can use this but I'm not crazy about it because it does not blend well nor does it go on smoothly. It is actually very blotchy because I found it almost impossible to spread on my skin. I had to keep reapplying it. If it weren't for that negative, I would have rated this 4 stars.	-1
I had heard of Dermablend makeup, but never tried it until I saw it available in the Amazon Vine program.  Dermablend is makeup that helps hide imperfections, major and minor.  I was interested to try it because I am getting dark spots on my face from past sun exposure.  My daughter also wanted to try it to cover the few pimples she gets from time to time.  Based on description and reviews  and cost  both my daughter and I expected the Dermablend Intense PowderCamo would do a better job of hiding our flaws than our usual makeups.  However, we both found this not to be the case, whether used by itself or with a liquid foundation.  Obviously, skin types and imperfections vary by individual, and some people may find this product to be a good makeup for them to use.  However, based on its price and my personal results, as well as my daughters, I would not buy it myself.	-1
This stuff is just as bad as their foundation.  It doesn't cover acne scars or bumps, it enhances them.  I'm so disappointed in the brand & their products.  My skin looks so bad when I put this on.  It's like a neon sign pointing to my acne scars & bumps, they stand out so clearly.  I'd be better off going bare skinned than using these products.  It also feels so heavy on the skin.  I've tried blending & blending.  Nothing seems to work.  I hate it.	-1
Gave this a try as I am still in search of my Jane Irdale replacement of Golden Glow. I need something with more olive in the summer and this is not it. I found the powder to feel soft on my fingers but applied "rough" chalky and really showed up my pores. It seems a bit shiny on my face though it sure looked matte in the compact. The shade was a bit dark on me as well. Though it's a Dermablend product, I felt it did not offer much build-able coverage to wear alone as foundation.	-1
***update- I just found out they test on animals. Will never purchase again. Next time I'll try 100% PUre or The Organic Face.**I bought this at Ulta and paid about $7 more. I have always used Bareminerals...I mean always. Sadly I read their ingredients are actually quite harmful to the skin, as well as the endocrine system (harmful chemicals build up and are absorbed through the skin) The EWG ( environmental working group) gives this product a great score. What that means is its not harmful to your body. They look at the individual ingredients and score them based on that.  I miss the "glow" original bare minerals gives, however I think my skin actually looks healthier now. The coverage is moderate, not too intense. I have to cover a couple acne scars with concealer.  Pros: Good coverage Lasts long Doesnt wear off on my clothes as much as other products Doesn't pull oils from your skin=less drying Doesnt accentuate dry skin like others I've used or settle in creases  Cons: Becomes cakey if you over-apply Better when used with a seperate concealer instead of building coverage  Tips: kabuki brush is a must, the sponge doesn't provide good coverage and looks more cakey Use a primer, I love UD's primed and poreless (gives a little coverage and hides imperfections more than most primers) Finish with a mineral veil or similar product	-1
This lip gloss is light and non-sticky, but the color (which is supposed to be very light, or so I thought) bleeds easily and makes my mouth look like I have chapped lips.  I am over 50, so maybe this is a gloss that would work on a younger person's lips, but for me it doesn't do anything.  I've tried using it for two days and have not noticed any improvement to the softness of my lips or anything that makes me want to use it regularly.  The price is awfully high for a gloss that does not plump the lips or make any improvement in looks.	-1
IT is not useful and I won't buy it again.	-1
Had high hopes for this Perricone product and was again disappointed.  Apparently, his products do not work for me. I have a good complexion and thought that this would work as I don't need/want a lot of coverage.  The color is too orangey/brown and not a universal color at all.  It also has a rather stickey feel to it after applying.  If the product worked the money would not be an issue.  But when it doesn't, the money is the issue.  Too costly for such a mediocre product.  Would not recommend this to anyone.	-1
Maybe I got a bum product, but we really can't say anything good about this product.  Even from the start, it was difficult to get it out of the package.  then you are left with a tall, skinny bottle that seems designed for tipping and spilling.  We shoot the dickens out of the bottle and it was still watery thin.  We shook it again to the point of ridiculousness and still watery.  Each time we tried to apply it, it would run down the edges of the nail and bleed every where.  When we finally got something of a base layer on, the color was a little along the lines of bruised finger nail.  I really think we got a bum sample so I'll put our experience out there and let customers see if it's a trend.	-1
So it turns out that I'm allergic to the perfumey smell of this product. Unfortunately, it gives me a headache, especially since, you know, you rub it on your face and it's right by my nose. *sigh* If not for the smell and resulting headache, I think I'd actually like this product. It's smooth and seems to absorb pretty well. I only used it twice, though, because of the resulting allergic reaction. I did want to add that I have terrible allergies and that many strong scents give me headaches so I'm more sensitive than most but, if you have this type of reaction, just be aware of a stronger-than-normal scent to this product.	-1
Shades of My Great Aunt!  When I opened the jar, I had a vision of my great aunt applying what is very likely the same product.  The aroma stayed with her all day, every day.  While I loved my great aunt, I did not love the smell of her moisturizer, and I do not care to smell the same way -- ever!  The product goes on smoothly and may work to reduce visible lines, but the aroma is overpowering.  Sorry, this is way too much perfume for me!  Two Stars	-1
Oh I WANTED this to be a daily use item for me....I was excited to receive it and anxious to try it...being a woman of a certain age ;-)  Nice and thick, went on smoothly...couldn't tolerate it but for 10 minutes.  My husband was calling out for me...where did I go...lol to wash the stink-um off my face!  I really wanted to love this...and probably would have IF it wouldn't of had such a cloying fragrance that really isn't necessary OR desired.  I don't know ONE woman who wants her face cream to ALSO be her cologne.  Gave it 2 stars vs 1 as there are people who aren't sensitive to scents...for them this might be a doable product...just not for me.	-1
Ahava means "love," so I'll start with a couple of positives associated with this product:  * Attractive jar design, includes instructions in Hebrew, French, and German, guaranteed to make your bathroom countertop appear more cosmopolitan than ever.  * Fragance is mild and mostly inoffensive. If you have visited the Dead Sea and worried that this gel cream would smell like sulphur, fear not. It doesn't.  The negative: I have never tried a moisturizer of any kind that seemed so ineffective. I've slathered it onto my arms, used it on my face, spritzed water on, then applied cream, but the experience is the same. A slight stickiness, and then...nothing. Two minutes later, my skin feels exactly the same as it did before I used the product. I've now gone through about a half jar and remain mystified as to how this product ever made it to market. Maybe it works on people with super delicate skin? That is not me.	-1
I am allergic to most under eye creams and this was no exception.  But it seemed like a decent product.  I think the more a cream attempts to do, the more I am allergic to it.	-1
I'm not sure how La Roche can claim this product reduces the dark circles.  I thought the metal applicator was the revolutionary process plus maybe the caffeine.  Not so.  It may be used as a concealer and, as such, it's not light enough for me.  I tried it several times, morning and night and found no difference.  I added a concealer on top of this product and it seemed to work better but, honestly, I couldn't tell if it was the combination of the two with the added enhancement of another texture.  The pigmenatclar has a smooth texture and the actual case is sturdy and of high quality.  Unfortunately, it was not the miracle to erase years of genetics, age or irregular skin tones	-1
I did not see much difference with this products performance versus products like Cataphil's moisturizing lotion or creams which are much cheaper. The bottle will look nicer on your dresser and has a slightly sweet apple smell, which is probably pentyll pentanoate which can be used as a solvent for fatty acids, that some might find more appealing. My wife did not like the smell.	-1
Read reviews saying it works so I bought it. I use sunscreen everyday religiously. I put pigmentclar on my skin morning and night time. Didn't see any change. I'm Asian with light skin but not super pale. I have mild freckles and some darker sunspots. I'm almost 40. Sadly, this didn't do anything for me despite using it liberally as directed and also using la Roche Posay sunscreen. Very disappointed.	-1
This did nothing for any of my dark spots.  I saw it recommended in a beauty magazine and thought I would give it a shot but it didn't work.	-1
Am sure this is a nice product if it did not come broken in pieces. My wife cut herself with the fine broken glasses while trying to throw the product away. Its a pity as my wife love her Burberry touch perfume and thought that this would be something that she might have like to get.  Would not recommend to get it online but rather just pop over to the nearest store to self-pick up this fragile product.	-1
Don't know where my previous review went but let's start over. First, after many uses, the changes I noticed were great and so worth it! Maybe 70% of hair gone and what was left grew in really slow and I shaved way less often. Time passes. Lot's of time and today, the hair has filled back in. Granted, it still appears slightly more sparse and it grows slower still, but all bald spots that I thought were done for good have regressed. The hair isn't has thick and dark appearing as it used to be, so that's a plus, but not the permanent result that I wanted. Maybe I'll try for round 2 someday, but for now it's nice not spending the time on it.	-1
I used to love Super Goop but they changed the formula, I think.  It is now super stinky and the consistency is strange - runny and not lotion-like.  Its a shame because I have had three of these pumps over the last couple of years but I'm not buying again.	-1
This is a pretty color red lipstick. It's on the bright side, and goes on very thick (full coverage). However, it doesn't last at all. Certainly not if you eat anything, but it comes off if you even talk too much. I used it with a lipliner and it still got kind of smeary and feathery. I really wasn't impressed (except with the packaging, which is beautiful). As much as I love a good luxury lipstick, I don't care for this one and don't recommend it, especially at a $40+ price point.	-1
This is a generous supply of a premium skin face cleaner. It is a gel and has a very verdant (grassy/green) scent which is somewhat sharp and refreshing. One point about this that I did like was the scent. It comes in a squeeze bottle that doesn't have any other air inlet/outlet so, if you don't squeeze out a lot, it tends to get sucked back into the bottle. I found that I had to squeeze out more than I needed and had to waste the product because of the distribution method. The cleanser is a thick, clear gel which lathers a little when you rub it between your hands. It's not especially soapy and rinses off cleanly.  I will say that I am older (52), fair-skinned, with skin that tends toward dry rather than oily, but overall tends to be closer to average or normal. I do not wear any kind of make-up. I usually wash my face with fairly generic soap (Ivory or Kirkland) and then apply a fairly heavy moisturizer after evening showers. With this product, I stopped using soap on my face and only used the Obagi cleanser for about 3 weeks.  During the first week, this left my skin itchy, dry, and flaky despite my having applied the same heavy moisturizer after washing my face as I do when I use soap. After about three weeks, this abated some, but was still happening to some extent. It also was leaving a residue on my skin or not exfoliating as soap did as I could scratch off a white substance when I was either scratching my dry skin or scrubbing my face with my fingers. I had to start using an abrasive exfoliating mitt after using this cleanser to make sure I got everything off. On the plus side, my skin was left feeling soft and pliable compared to soap (which can often leave skin feeling dry and tight). However, in the long run, the itchniness and lack of exfoliating as well as the higher price make this a product that didn't work out for me.	-1
I really don't like this cleanser. It's hard to squeeze out a really small dab, and anything marble-sized or bigger ends up being way too much product.  It neither lathers well nor is a creamy cleanser, plus it's kind of slimy, so it's kind of the worst of all worlds.  It does leave my face clean, I will give it that, and my skin hasn't been irritated.  I need a separate product for eye makeup.  I have no idea why it's called "rejuvenation" because my face does not look younger upon use, but if anything feels dry and tight, and really crying out for moisturizer.  So it's not a fantastic product for me.	-1
I do not recommend this conditioner. It is not a lightweight formula as advertised. I found it to be thick and sticky. Also, it smells like sour milk. Not good.	-1
Hello everyone and hope everyone is okay.  I tried Ouidad leave-in conditioner, and the Botanical Boost, and the Climate Control.  The only one that did a little bit for my hair was the leave-in conditioner.  It took out most of the tangles, but it weighed it down alot.  I have oily, down past my shoulder length hair and I was not happy with the products at all.  First, the Climate Control was supposed to do just that, but instead of making it bouncy it came out extremely dry, crackly and frizzy!  The Botanical Boost just made it limp and flat and not at all shiny.  Now, maybe someone with hair that is not oily and more curly than mine would be happy with this product, but I was not.  I'm going to give them away to whomever may want them and like them, but I would not purchase again.	-1
I didn't care at all for this product. I didn't like the scent or the stiffness. I wouldn't buy it.	-1
Highly ranked by dermatologists and doctors for its protection.  I wasn't that impressed.  It left a slight residue (besides being greasy) to the skin.  Made your skin look slightly gray and if hot outside it seemed to melt into the creases in your elbow area and turn white again.  Not something I would recommend.	-1
The tube is extremely hard to get anything out of. I have used this product for a week and my skin is very flaky and dry after using. I will be sticking with my usual product and throwing this in the trash.	-1
I read all the reviews and was a bit concerned about breakouts, but so far I guess I've been lucky.  I've been blessed with "good" skin but have begun noticing some deeper lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows so that's where I'm focusing right now.  I do think I see some slight improvement which makes me very happy. I'm not looking for miracles, just improvement.  Yes, it's pricey but no prescription needed, and the tube should last me quite a while.  I wish it was fragrance free because I'm quite sensitive to smells, but thankfully the scent dissipates after a short while.  It definitely appears to be the actual product and not fake as some reviewers have mentioned.  Honestly, I don't know how the tube could be emptied and refilled anyway.  Yes, there are quite a few chemicals in this, and I am careful not to overload my skin with artificial ingredients, but I'll continue to use this if I see results.  UPDATE  03/04/17: Well, I cannot use this.  After applying nightly for probably two weeks (per directions), suddenly I broke out in burning, red, dry skin where I applied it between my eyebrows.  Researched retinol and discovered mostly recommended to apply every few days to build up for sensitive skin.  Redness has not subsided after 4 days.  And because it makes the skin hyper-sensitive to sunlight, this will definitely not be staying in my house.	-1
If you have very sensitive skin you might want to stay away from this product. I use other retinol products without any problems but this one really made my face break out. I'm sure it works fine for other people, but for me, I'll have to pass on this brand.	-1
This just didn't seem effective to me. I should have purchased the stronger strength but my mistake. Anyway I am not new to Retinol but I decided to give this a try and with most Retinols I have always had a slight burning sensation at first and with obagi I had nothing at all. I haven't had this long but long enough to know this isn't gonna cut it for me. I am back to using the Image brand at night .I have been using image Retinol for a few years and still get the slight burning sensation which is what I expect with good retinol. I do like other products from obagi and wouldnt say I wouldn't try the stronger strength  but as far as I can tell from this it's basically a weak moisturizing cream. I hate to leave negative reviews but this did nothing for me. Also the tube is a pain ,it's not easy to squeeze out at all. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with Athritis in hands. Still may consider the stronger one.	-1
The second time I tried this product, my eyes started stinging, and my left eye dried out as well.  I had to wash my eyelids to stop the stinging.  I will not be using the product again. If you do use it, be careful not to get any in your eyes.  Not recommended.  Will update this review after my wife tries it for a bit longer, as she has not had any stinging in her eyes.  02/02/2017.  After 3 days of use by my wife. she now says that she's having a mild stinging sensation.  I encouraged her to discontinue use of the product.	-1
1. Given the expense of this product, you want to use as little as possible for every application. However, the pump on the tube facilitates getting more than you need.  2. It's going to take many weeks if not months to find out if this product has any effect whatever. If this were a cheap eye cream, I'd recommend taking the risk. But given the expense of this product . . .	-1
It's cool and all but way too little for the cost. Not only that but it's harder to come off when I'm done. I'm constantly wiping and rinsing my face. I've since gone with another brand that gives way more product for the money, comes off easily and has not caused any problems with my skin. Will not be ordering this again. It's a rip off to me.	-1
I didn't care for this product. This particular color was not complimentary to my skin  tone. It was chalky on my lips and eventually  made them very dry. I think I'll pass on this one.	-1
I love the Jouer powder blush and lip glosses, but I was disappointed in this Jouer Tint. It was the shade more than anything as it made me look ruddy (I'm fair, cool toned). It stayed on all day as a blush (I wasn't wearing a primer). As a lip tint, I didn't like it; it made my lips very dry.	-1

Makes my skin super itchy!!!	-1
Crap. The sprayer bottom was filled with what can only described as solidified wood glue. Terrible.	-1
This color was a much darker purple than I was expecting. Unless it is in bright sunlight, it looks quite dark. The color on my computer monitor looks like a bright vibrant purple/fusha. I was disappointed.	-1
When I read all the flowery descriptions I think oh WOW, I think Id love that.  Im speechless!  This stuff is really awful. It reminds me of some sort of bug spray with an overtone of wet cardboard. Sorry, Nuxe, wish I could say something good.	-1
Fragrant water?  Oh, please. This is just a run-of-the-mill perfume, and a cheap one at that. It's not light or relaxing, and even one spritz left me reeking of baby powder and aging flowers.  It brought on a headache within 10 minutes, and I'm not susceptible to that.  I wear perfume every day,  but expensive ones and this one does not measure up.  Honestly it reminds me most of my daughter's Axe body sprays, which I also hate.  But if you love Axe, maybe this is what you're looking for.	-1
I was SO excited to get to review NUXE Relaxing Fragrant Water, having been absolutely and totally in love with Nuxe Dry Oil for years.  It comes in a lovely glass bottle with a solid acrylic cap.  I couldn't wait to get it open and try it! One spritz on my arm and I knew this was not going to be for me.  The fragrance was completely overwhelming, almost headache inducing.  I left it on to see if I would grow to like it, but unfortunately, I did not. In fact, I liked it even less as it mellowed on my skin.  I will admit that I'm very sensitive to scents, and maybe this product wouldn't bother most people like it does me.	-1
I was curious to try this.  It sounded like a total luxury.  Well, I'm not sure what this is or what it is for.  The scent is chemical and unpleasant.  ( I have many perfumes and love scent but this is just commercial, artificial and awful).  It leaves a shiny sticky icky layer on your skin.  I received this in exchange for my review and it pains me not to be able to say nice things about it.  But it would have pained me a whole lot more if I had actually shelled out cash for it.  Scent is a very personal thing, I realize, but this reviewer thinks this is just awful.  (For reference, I hate most mainstream perfumes.  I like niche fragrances like Safran Troublant, Le Labo Rose 31,Annick Goutal Rose Absolue.  So, if you hate perfumes like these, and prefer things like Blue Water, you might actually like this.)	-1
Although I buy everything fragrance free that I can, I have a large and well-loved collection of rare, vintage, and high-end niche perfumes. I remember experiencing some other NUXE product and found it pleasant. I had a Shiseido Relaxing Water years ago that was really quite lovely, like you had just been in a room where Japanese incense had been burning. This: a potentially head-ache inducing (if you are susceptible to headaches; it might just make you lash out at some someone if politeness is your weak link, or trigger an asthma attack) brew is bad. Why? Why was it created? It's just an overpriced bottle of strong chemicals that you should never wear around infants. If you must wear it (I will try to extend tolerance), ONE spritz is enough! Well, actually too much. The scent is an insulting clich&eacute;, with notes of baby powder, plastic toy pony, fruit Twizzler and musk scratch-n-sniff. Frighteningly bad.	-1
Just wow. I thought it would be  a clear liquid in the bottle but it is a cloudy liquid that made me think of a body fluid.  I held it at arm's length and pushed the button and a bug bomb went off in the living room.  This lets out a huge blast of mist that is in an almost 180 arc and hovers in the air in visible droplets like a toxic chemical  cloud.  The smell is the strongest thing out of a bottle I've ever smelled aside from the bug bombs you pull the plug on like a grenade and run for your life from and leave it in the garage or shed to kill the bugs and anything else within ten feet.  So I gave it two stars because it is a potent, powerful blast of pure alcohol and citronella, and is exactly what I was hoping to find to keep the zida mosquitoes off me this summer.  And it accomplishes that perfectly.  An added bonus is neighbors don't hang around to chat.  Everyone smells me coming.  And I continue to walk around in a citronella cloud for hours with JUST ONE BLAST.  The marketing for this is totally wrong.  They have a huge money maker here if they market this as a mosquito repellent and I say that with all seriousness.	-1
The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.	-1
Because the base notes are bamboo, sandalwood, bare musk accord, I thought this would be a more natural, deeper scent.  When first putting it on it is very strong, even the littlest amount is very overwhelming and it actually gave me a headache.  After a couple hours the scent is more subtle, but still very flowery.  I was hoping that initial floral scent would fade away and the musky undertones be left, but it's just flowery and too strong for me and I only put a tiny amount on.  If you like strong floral type scents and perfumes, you'll probably like this.  The scent is lasting and the bottle it came in is pretty.  It's not the scent for me though.	-1
did not realize it was frosted, I wanted matte	-1
The cream has a pleasant texture when applied - and the tightening effect may please some older women - but that effect is achieved by drying the skin and the long term effects are not beneficial.	-1
I didn't find anything with this product that even remotely justifies the price.  Additionally, the product I received expires in less than 7 months.  That seems like a very short shelf life for something like sun care.  The spray is quick to go on but as one other reviewer has commented, it is thick like a primer.  I will probably not continue to use this as it feels as though it may cause me to break out.  I recommend sticking with normal sun care products and avoid overpriced sprays that do not provide any further functionality.	-1
The Elta sunscreen products were recommended by my dermatologist.  I chose this tinted one because I was hoping for a tiny bit of coverage to help even out my skin tone.  Instead it went on practically clear and very shiny. I also wanted some sunscreen protection for the delicate eye area.  I could not use this anywhere near my eyes because it burned like crazy and I had to wash it off after about 10 minutes.  I tired it a second time and the same thing happened. Also I was disappointed when I read in the instructions that for it to be effective for sunscreen protection you need to reapply it every two hours.  It was not that expensive, but it was a waste of money for me.	-1
I found this full coverage stick not that easy to apply. It is hard to glide on to get full coverage and the directions say to tap it to get more coverage. In order for it to do that I would have had to have tapped it hard enough to break the stick. Just not a successful coverage.	-1
I'm not a fan of this. I got it to hide some pernicious spots and it doesn't look natural at ALL.  Once you blend it in to make IT look better and less noticeable, the spot shows through again. Frustrating.  Overall I am very, very disappointed in this one.	-1
I used this over my tattoo and it didn't even come close to fully covering correctly, you can tell you have a thick coat of makeup on and it doesn't look somewhat natural at all. This might be good for something small, but I would highly recommend you stay away if you have anything larger than half dollar to cover up.	-1
Well, I can't say that I'm overly impressed with the coverage or the blending. I used this on a burn scar on my leg. The scar is over 20 years old. The first pic is the scar. The second pic is the application and the third is were I blended the product on it's own while the last photo I dusted mineral powder over it.  Either way it is pretty sheer and I can't help but think that advertising this product to cover tattoo's is misleading.	-1
This didn't work at all.  Whether it was for a spot or a tattoo, it came out clumpy from the tube, and following directions still wouldn't work as it should or cover anything well at all.  Definitely not up to the quality we've come to expect from Dermablend.	-1
After having heard about Dermablend for many years, I was eager to try this product. I was disappointed. It does cover marks, but only if you use a huge amount. But if you do, you have this big weird patch of highly textured skin under a blob of makeup. Very obvious! Rubbing it in so that it blends with the skin only gives medium coverage. I don't know what all the hype is about. It's just a regular stick concealer, in my opinion.	-1
This product would be pretty good... if the color looked anything like it does online. I am using a calibrated monitor on a MBPr and also compared it to color on pc. The actual product is both darker and orangier than what it seems like it should be. Even holding the actual shade up to the box it has much more orange to it, and no real bronze. We thought this would be great for a darker skinned latina with a nice rich tan... but alas no good. It might work well for people with spray tans though. It was easy to apply and seemed consistency wise to work well. Hard to keep going with how it worked when the color looked terrible on everybody we tried it on.	-1
I got this in bronze figuring it would go well for my tan time of year. It's a lot darker than I thought it would be and more of an orange-y tone. I tried it to cover a tattoo - if you put it on and don't try to blend, it covers. But the moment you blend it at all, you can easily see the tattoo through it. I found it difficult to blend and it would need to be reapplied a lot. I didn't like this dermablend stick at all.	-1
This product was too thin to do it's job.  My under eyes didn't look any less puffy.  I put it on one eye ,waited, compared  and you couldn't really tell I put anything on.  I did have high hope for this product but I just don't think it is very effective. On a positive note I have sensative skin and this product did not irritate it.	-1
dries my hair out. not worth ur money. wouldnt use it if it was free	-1
I am using the same review as I did for the conditioner because I am not sure which product contributed to the end result.  I heard so much about this product that I wanted to try it.  It didn't work well for my hair type, which is naturally soft and hard to style.  It left my hair soft but really too soft.  I found it was difficult to style no matter how many styling products I used.  I ended up giving it away after a few uses.  It might work for someone who is looking to wear their hair in a straight style or someone that has course hair.	-1
Top expensive and leaves residue in my hair.	-1
Made my hair frizzy. I found this hard to use. Some of the bristles look like they are fixing to fall out, and I've only used this a few times. I was wanting to love this, but I don't.	-1
This dries crispy and crunchy.  This should be sold as hair gel, seriously.  I'm not giving up on this brand though as I haven't tried their petroleum based pomades yet.	-1
I'm 30 years old. This should have worked wonders for my soft lines. I was willing to ignore the list of ingredients (terrible!) if it would erase my fine lines for a wedding I was attending. The cooling felt nice for like a second and that's about it. I didn't see any appearance difference and lets not even talk about long term use. I used it all up and nope, nothing. My suggestion: don't waste your money. If you want to know what has worked wonders and you won't even believe it: bone broths. Google it. Probably better than any product.	-1
I'm always highly skeptical when products give a specific number of minutes of how quickly it will work, or how many years/months of damage are rolled back.  The product claims that doing weekly 10 minute treatments will work like an injection filler and will smooth out your face and also prevent future issues.  On those claims the product seems to produce almost no results.  Maybe a slight improvement immediately after the face gels are removed, but then it soon fades (probably just because the skin is being firmed up by the 'cool').  As a face gel and 'spa' treatment they are pleasant and soothing, unfortunately giving it a poor rating for it's seemingly exaggerated claims.	-1
Nope. This did absolutely nothing. I'm in my mid thirties so I am starting to see wrinkles in my forehead. I thought this might 'diminish' them as the product claimed, but not so much.  I'm not even going to bother posting the before and after pics I took because I legitimately can't tell which is which.	-1
This product contains a total of 8 individually packed face gels. Four are forehead gels, and 4 contain a pair of smile line gels. So that gives you a total of 4 treatments. The current Amazon price is $35 per package, so that comes to $8.75 per treatment. That is very expensive in my opinion.  These gels are fairly easy to use. Just peel back and apply to freshly cleansed skin. Leave on the skin for 10 minutes and remove. The instructions say to use once a week or whenever you need a quick fix. That, to me, implies the results will last up to one week. While I did notice a little plumping of the skin and diminished lines, the results only lasted a very short time. The results for me were completely gone within an hour or two. That was disappointing. I kept using it once a week for 4 weeks. That continued use made no more improvement in my wrinkles.	-1
Tested the kit on my husband - it did not do much for him at all. He got a few acne, which is something that does not happen very often for him, and doing the whole regimen did very little. Maybe salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide works on teenage skin, but it is not for adults. Teenage son outright refused to use it, though I suspect it is because the box shows a girl, not a boy. I did not even try using it because I know what the ingredients will do to my skin with rosacea, no, thank you.	-1
This three-step process is a little arduous. Now, subscribing to a multi-step process is pretty easy when the results are spectacular. In fact, one person in this house has so many Proactive elements in his/her regimen that it nearly seems obsessive ... except for the fact that his/her skin is baby smooth and completely gorgeous. Such results were not seen here (at all). So, I think the take-away here is that consumers should stick with the original and the best. For the price of this kit, you could pick up some Proactive and truly, justifiably expect the beginning of clear skin!	-1
I have sensitive skin with occasional breakouts around my chin area so thought I'd give this a try. Only tried it once because it stung so bad and it sort of smells like bleach. Decided to give it to my son's girlfriend who has mild to moderate acne. She was only able to use it for a few days because she said that she had a stinging sensation from day one that intensified. She gave up after four days because her skin was so dry and burning that not even putting on lotions helped. (Even putting on sunscreen felt irritating). Based on both of our experiences I'd say use if you have normal to oily/very oily skin and expect some irritation. This is because of the active ingredients in the products but not worth the hassle for us.	-1
I have been using a 15% vitamin c serum for months, and I've seen improvement in my skin. This product, however, does not have a percentage listed, which makes me believe it is a low percentage.  I don't get a slight tingle upon application as I do with 15% serums. If there was a significant amount, why wouldn't that be noted on the package? And that makes me think there's a negligible amount of the other vitamins as well.  This serum also does not feel like any serum  I've tried before. The first ingredient is a silicone, which  makes this feel more like a primer. It has an almost powdery smooth finish, which does mean you can apply makeup without waiting for it to absorb.  To me this seems more like a really overpriced primer than a serum that will actually improve skin.	-1
To be fair, I haven't had this long enough to notice a big difference in my skin.  My concern is two things 1. Very high price, and 2.  This is full of silicones.  As far as the silicones go, of course it makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  It leaves a thin layer of silicone over the top of your skin, smoothing over pores and fine lines...just like a makeup primer that is 1/10th the cost of this product.  Maybe I am not giving this product enough credit, and in a few weeks I will be thrilled with the newfound luster of my facial skin...but I'm pretty sure that isn't going to happen.	-1
I gave this one star because the St. Tropaz that I bought was garbage and this mitt just spread around bad product.  Better off going for a spray tan.	-1
Absolutely awful I've only used this mit twice and it has completely fallen apart! Now I have to spend more money to buy a new one and hopefully I find a more durable mit	-1
Did not work as well as kits from other companies we have tried in the past.	-1
I bought this to go with the St. Tropez Bronzing mousse. The mousse is great, this mitt is not. After two uses, it's beginning to wear.  I rinsed between uses and let air dry. I guess this item is just meant to be a throw-away mitt. Not worth the money in my opinion. For the price, you should get a few.  I will say using a mitt makes it way easier to apply though.	-1
After 2 uses it already started cracking and separating. There aren't many other mitts (the ones that I have tried are as bad, if not worse) on the market so I don't really have a choice but to get another one of these...	-1
I pretty much can't stand anything about this product. First, there is SO much packaging. Second, you get a whopping six applications for $75. Wow. Third, the process for using it is a) poorly outlined and b) messy.  You start by opening the package of under-eye pads. Then you pour the activator liquid all over them, There's really more liquid than you need, so you have to wait for it to absorb. The pads turn to sheets of slime. You pull them apart, they stick to themselves and your fingers. Finally, you get them on your face. They stick in place okay, but they drip all down your cheeks. You wait the 15 minutes the package recommends, all the while wiping drips with a paper towel. Finally, you pull the sheets of not-so-slimy-anymore slime off, and....nothing.  The only thing positive is that the ingredients are organic.	-1
I am pleased to say that the product is not causing any skin irritation or discomfort but at the same time it is not really producing any noticeable results. One tiny vial container contains enough activator fluid for mere one application with the included pure marine algae Eye Masks. These eye masks are very fragile and tends to tear and break apart when you pour in the activator fluid. In the end the areas around the eyes does feel hydrated but nothing spectacular improvement that was noticeable with the suggested 10 mins.  Having said, The main reason for using the included pure marine algae Eye Masks is to apply the applicator fluid without using cotton based puffs which may contain pesticides that causes skin irritation but this also causes a lot of wastage of the applicator fluid since it drips and causing a messy waste since you are doing it at home alone and not in a professional SPA where someone else applies this for you while you lie down and sleep.  What I have discovered is that the applicator fluid is good for the skin around your eyes. It does make skin softer and feels well moisturized. Does this remove the black circle marks around the eyes - Maybe but that means you need to keep spending a lot of money and wasting a lot of these applicator fluid & pure marine algae Eye Masks each time you use them.  Instead I suggest that to make most use of this package and the six tiny vial containers by applying the applicator fluid directly around the skin of your eyes by your index finger just enough to moisten before you go to sleep every night and you will find positive improvement around your eyes. Not only because you are not wasting the applicator fluid but also long time application for 2-3 weeks every night does make the skin clear, tight and rejuvenated.  For the price & wastage of applicator fluid and messy difficult to use algae Eye Masks I am forced to rate this with two stars. Otherwise the product does not cause any harm to you other than raising eyebrows looking at the price-tag :)	-1
Messy...very messy. You open the pack, set of two pads, pour the vial into the little container holding the kidney bean shaped pads (one for each eye) and let it set for a minute or two while it sops up the fluid from the vial. Then place each pad under your eye. Be ready with a paper towel or something to sop up the fluids that will continuously run down your face during the time you are supposed to leave it there. At the end of the time take the pads off and supposedly you will see less wrinkles. The wrinkle and puffiness reduction...totally not sure on that account but very sure on the messiness. Really quite pricey. It also doesn't smell all that great, however the scent really doesn't linger and is not all that strong. The product tells you to use it for special nights out and special occasions, but honestly, the results were minimal.	-1
I've been impressed with some of the Juice Beauty products, so I was interested in trying their instant eye life.  My undereye area tends towards dark circles and slight bagginess, and this product promised to firm and brighten.  Now, I knew some of the claims were ridiculous.  Rubbing stem cells from plants on your face does absolutely nothing.  I don't know why they're trying to claim that as a selling point.  But some of the other ingredients are good, and topical patches are proven to temporarily help with the undereye area.  I was underwhelmed.  The first time I used this product, it left my face very sticky.  The second time, I let the patches soak in the activator less, which worked better.  But I really didn't see any difference.  Plus, you're supposed to buy a second product (and eye cream) to use after this one.  (The package does include a small sample.)  The best part was playing with the patches as I put them on and pulled them off.  They have a delightfully gummy texture.  This package includes six uses.  I like that Juice Beauty is organic, but I was very turned off by the packaging of this product.  It is very wasteful and mostly non-recyclable.  Not impressive for people interested in the environment.	-1
A lot of money for what? I have never spent $75.00 for any beauty product. I liked the idea of this product. When this came, it came in a box with six vials and six packages of 2 moon shaped pads. The pads are really big. They go from the corner of my eyes to my hairline. The vials have lots of liquid. So no worries of not having enough. However once you put the liquid on the pads, the real fun begins. Trying to apply the soaked pads is a real messy job. They are so thin and with the liquid they do not hold their shape. So you have to pat the pads to get them to stay so that you do not tear them apart. Also too much handling makes them turn to glue.  Next time I think I will apply a little bit of the liquid and then use a q tip to apply the rest of the liquid so that I can control how much I need or it just runs down my face. Plus, I doubt I will see any effects from using this.	-1
Not anything to write home about.  1. Not that easy to apply; have to go back and forth for coverage. 2. Even though it's cacao, it's not that dark. I expected chocolate brown, but this is a wishy-washy brown. 3. Coverage is more transparent than opaque and I don't think most women like this. I don't. 4. Rather pricey for this quality of eye pencil.  Would not recommend this product.	-1
Quite possibly what I received was a defective bottle, or one that was badly affected by being shipped during the recent heat wave.  The cans dispenser just never worked properly.  By the third use, it wasn't reliably dispensing product.  By th fourth use, it simply didn't work at all.	-1
I love the sensual fragrance of Ritual of Ayurveda (Indian rose and sweet almond oil) but getting it to dispense properly and in small amounts is a real pain.  The button is very hard to pushwhen I finally do get it to work, it expels way more than I need per shower or bath.  There's enough foam to wash my entire body (and probably someone else) and I still have enough left over to shave my legs.  Not exactly economical.  To make it even worse, the bottle is a mess after the foam comes outmust be rinsed off after each use.  This dispenser needs to go back to the drawing board.  As much as I like the fragrance, the hard-to-use cap and messy distribution is enough to make me not get it again.	-1
This is my second attempt to try something from this brand because I do love their packaging. Unfortunately I think the products are not for me. This particular eye shadow had zero staying power although it applies nicely and looks really cute when you put it on. It is a very nice shimmery champagne color that is sort of nude on med skin tone (like mine). The first time I used it it creased like crazy and it felt like my eyelid was sort of greasy, but I thought that maybe it was because I had worked out. The second time I wore it to school (did use primer) and by lunch it had already creased into a thick line so I had to wipe it off. I use other shimmery shades and haven't experienced the same problem, in spite of having a little bit of a hooded eyelid.	-1
I wasn't super impressed with this product. The curve of the lipstick itself is unique, but I didn't find that to be an asset in application. The packaging is cheap-looking for such a high-end product. The color I received, Shade 07, is more brown than I anticipated and is just okay. The color also wears off easily after eating/drinking. I will not purchase another one of these lipsticks.	-1
Whenever I try a new mascara, I apply it to only one eye and then apply the mascara I had been using to the other eye and compare. I do this because all mascaras enhance the lashes to a certain extent and it's easy to be dazzled without another mascara to compare it to. So, up for comparison is this Japonesque "lash loading mascara" and my number 1 favorite mascara so far: Loreal Miss Manga. Both mascaras are about the same size Japonesque is 0.3oz and Miss Manga is 0.27oz. Japanesque is manufactured in the UK and Miss Manga is manufactured in the USA.  Well, after applying one to each eye, there's a huge difference in performance and Miss Manga is by far the winner. Lash thickness appears the same, but Miss Manga makes lashes look a solid 50% longer. I'll also say that the Japonesque brush is horrible and I had to pick two clumps off my lashes. By the end of the day I had blacks black smudge under the eye wearing the Japonesque. I would describe the performance of Japonesque as "below average", like something that would be alright if I had bought it at a dollar store. But it's not a dollar, it's $20 which is just criminal!	-1
Lash Loading? Talk about a hefty claim that seriously does not hold up. This mascara is more like "smear" loading. I usually use a volume mascara since my lashes are so light and thin. When a product promises :  High definition volumizing mascara. Inspired by the runway and behind-the-scenes tricks, JAPONESQUE Lash Loading mascara creates incredible lash drama and a super-charged false lash effect"  It better come through especially when its twice as much as the mascara I usually use (covergirl). First when I took the brush out, huge glob of mascara was at the brush end I had to quickly plunge it back in a few times to get rid of it, or risk it being all over my face. First coat was weak, second coat was the same. It gave no volume, it loaded no lashes, every time I brushed it on a bit would "dink" right onto my eyelid cause the formula is so runny. I was using make up remover left and right. In the end I probably used 4 coats and it was like using one. I would not ever buy this again.	-1
PROS: This won't clump!  CONS: It won't clump because the formula is basically black water!  The big brush has been well covered in other reviews, but sometimes big brushes can be great. The problem here is that the brush is that spiral kind with tight, fake hair-- think a giant sized version of the $1 e.l.f. mascara. I personally like bristle wands because of how they grab the lashes, but the newer plastic kind has it place. This one finds a weird, unhappy medium.  I miss L'Oreal Featherlash, as I think light formulas can be fabulous for avoiding clumps. This isn't just lightweight, it's literally the consistency of water. Even with careful application, this flicked little black dots under my eyes and onto my eyelids every time. This stuff doesn't seem to love lashes, but they LOVE the skin around them!  If this was a $5 mascara, I'd recommend it to people who wanted more of a tint and maybe the illusion of length (its "lash loading" but didn't make my lashes look any thicker, but didn't do a bad job making them look longer) but isn't worried about thickness. Even using multiple applications between the lashes drying just seemed to "trace over" the lashes, but never built thickness.  At $20, it's absolutely ridiculous that it has the problems it has. Right now I'm using a Makeup Forever mascara and a $5 Revlon "Grow Luscious Plumping" mascara I picked up on a whim, and both prove you can do MUCH better than this in every price point.	-1
I was curious to see how this mascara compared with my favorite mascara (Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lashes). I read what some of the other reviews said and a couple said that that brush was too big and awkward. That wasn't the case for me; in fact, that's one of the things I liked about the mascara:  the brush. Many mascaras, when you pull out the brush, are filled with heavy clumps and you almost have to scrape the brush in order to use it cleanly. Japonesque's mascara brush came out cleanly and without clumps. I tried the mascara over a seven-day period; on the first day, I noticed flakes.  On another day, I rubbed one of my eyes and the mascara smudged all over and I looked like a raccoon. It took three applications before it actually made my lashes look volumized and thick. The box didn't indicate if it was waterproof or not; I used water to wash the mascara off, so it's not waterproof.  I prefer waterproof mascara. So, while the brush was nice and clean to use, I didn't like the flakes or the way it smudged. I'm not sure how long the tube will last if it takes three applications to make eyes truly volumized. This mascara was good --  but not great.  I wouldn't purchase the Japonesque Lash Loading Mascara.	-1
I don't like this mascara at all! It took a really long time to dry, I kept blinking little dots onto the area under my eyebrows, and it didn't make my lashes look any bigger. Then somehow it ran down over the course of the day into psycho-looking raccoon rings under my eyes. A mentally ill man oogled me at the Trader Joe's and that was the highlight of my experience with this mascara.	-1
I apply eye shadow with a soft brush, and this stuff was so hard just to get on the brush, I'd hardly call it velvet. The colors are nice, I just don't find the texture of this compact easy to apply at all. The shadow is hard and chalky. Maybe it is best applied another way. It's hard to say when no applicator is included. For the price, you'd think they could swing that. Overall I've liked Japonesque products, but not this one. I don't expect to buy their powder-based products anymore.	-1
As a preface, I am a huge makeup collector and I have eyeshadow from many companies.  I can appreciate different textures and pigmentation.  My favorite eyeshadows are from Urban Decay, Lorac, Tarte, Bare Minerals Ready, Smashbox (Photo Op only), Too Faced, etc.  Sorry to say, but this palette was a miss for me - especially considering the price of $34.  This is Elf quality makeup.  If you are used to high quality, easy to blend, creamy eyeshadows you WILL not like this.  At $34, I couldn't help but remember that my beloved Too Faced Natural Eyes palette was $36 - $2 more for 9 shadows (as opposed to 4) and all are far superior in quality.  On the positive side, the packaging is beautiful and sturdy with a nice mirror.  The size is great for travel and the colors look very nice.  I love warm neutrals.  Unfortunately, however, the quality of these shadows is sub-par.  The two top shadows have virtually no pigment and leave a virtually undetectable wash of shimmer on the eye.  The bottom left shadow is a bit better, but is still kind of dry.  The matte brown is the most pigmented of the bunch but is stiff and dry and hard to blend.	-1
This highlighter is labeled Luminescent. It certainly is that - meaning it is shiny and sparkly. I expected glowing, not almost fluorescent. I guess I am old school and feel that shininess on my face looks like it needs a bit of powder - back in the day when a shiny nose was expected to be alleviated. This make up, makes your cheeks shiny. The colour is nice but quite frankly it makes me look like I've been sweating. Perhaps in a nightclub setting with special lighting it would be attractive, but in normal conditions it just does not look right in my opinion.	-1
Before ordering this product I was unfamiliar with the Japonesque brand. I'm pretty minimalist when it comes to makeup (my go-to is tinted moisturizer and loose powder). Per the product description, "This innovative light-reflecting liquid glides on to refresh the skin and enhance the complexion's natural glow -- creating a beautiful shimmering incandescence." I was excited about a product that would enhance my natural skin tone without caking on a bunch of heavy makeup. Unfortunately this product fell short of my expectations.  My single largest gripe is the color: this product can be best described as an orange-inspired metallic bronze. Considering the purpose of the product, I thought perhaps the orange hue would fade into my skin tone when applied (which is classified as medium with orange undertones). Sadly, it doesn't. I applied it to one side of my face and the orange hue completely took over and never really blended in.  All in all it just wasn't for me. Perhaps someone with a deeper skin tone with more orange undertones could appreciate this shade more than I did.	-1
I was hoping this primer would help hide 2 tiny scars I have near my eye. This did nothing to fill them in. Make-up/base does a better job in filling in the scars. I did apply this with my fingertips and even after washing my hands with soap my fingers still had the bubbles of water on them and my skin - face and hands felt smooth. What really bothered me was that it seemed to draw my face and the tightness made me look tired. This just didn't seem to work and was an extra layer of something on my skin.	-1
I'm honestly not sure that this company really even knows what a primer is supposed to be...  It doesn't look or feel like one.  It feels and looks like skin cream.  It does go on smooth, but it doesn't help to mask pores and things like that like a primer usually does.  (I typically use Bare Escentuals or Smashbox or Too Faced for primers).  The part I REALLY hate is that it's white!  And glittery!  It LIGHTENS my skin tone!  It shouldn't be changing my skin tone at all, it should be either clear or flesh tone.  The absolute worst part is the glitter.  I don't know if they wanted to give your skin a more "radiant" look or something, but I look as if I'm trying to wear makeup meant for a teenager.  I really don't want to look like a stripper with glitter all over my face.  I wouldn't recommend or purchase this product.  It is NOT what a primer is supposed to do.  My absolute favorite is Smashbox's pore-refining primer.  It is excellent.	-1
I really was looking forward to trying this primer. I have never used any before and really do not like the heavy look many brands of makeup give. I tried it without foundation, with and just using a blush over it. My charming daughter said that I looked like the character Data on Startrek when I had it on without anything else, even with just blush it really left my skin with an unnatural shine - yes it did look like Data's make up. When I tried it under a foundation - it made no difference in my appearance, except that it was just more make up on my face. I was really disappointed in this product.	-1
I enjoyed this product for two months.  I followed instructions and did not abuse it.  It has now completely conked out for no reason whatsoever I am most unhappy that I have to begin the tedious return/replacement process with Amazon because of this.  If they are a growing business worldwide, they need to stand behind the products they endorse.  Ugh! .	-1
Photos-two weeks ago and today. I honestly think a full 30 to 45 days every day will achieve the best results, after that period of time manufacturers suggest use three or four times weekly. It's very important to start with a clean face! I've noticed a degree of improvement in fine lines and wrinkles but mostly I've see results in the tone of my skin and a major reduction in my pores which was almost ridiculously noticeable after three day. It's become an easy part of my morning ritual and really requires little time, but it is important to follow the instructions on handling and swiping (there is a correct way to move the NuFace --using it incorrectly will not bring about the results you want!) It really is a magic wand when used regularly. Anything that can add some tone and firmness to aging skin (55) is appreciated and worth it. I also used KY or aloe Vera gel (you want a moderate amount, not skimming, not generous) since it was much less expensive than their product. UPDATE: 4 Months later the device has stopped working, which is unacceptable! Will attempt to contact customer service and if successful will add an update. UPDATE: Customer Service contacted me via email and gave me a list of instructions to follow: to continually charge the device for 16 hours (if I had not been charging it regularly) until the light no longer moved on the device etc. I followed the instructions and the NuFace still does not work. I went to down load the return form to return the device (I will have to pay for shipping) but since I have no proof of purchase I can't just send it to them? Last laugh on a free product review. Did love it while it was working but so glad I didn't pay for it!	-1
To get thorough coverage with this my face turned white, this is not suitable for wearing anywhere where other people will see you. As my husband said, "you look like a ghost and you are getting ready to go to a costume party as a ghost". It absorbs well but leaves a white cast on the face due to the zinc oxide. It is not greasy. I find this unusable. Rating 1 star = Hate It.	-1
I am always looking for alternative healthier sunscreens. The ingredients in the sunscreen are not too bad except for the perfume. This made my skin dry, red and itchy.  So this is definitely not for sensitive skin. The perfume in here is horrible. It started to give me a headache on top of the itchy skin. It also leaves white on your face. If you put it on too thick it looks like you have diaper cream on your face.	-1
This stuff gave me a terrible rash on my chest. Definitely not for use if you have sensitive skin. I started out using it every day. Then went to once every other day. Rash didn't start to clear up until I stopped use altogether.	-1
The only nia24 product I don't like. Not only does it leave white film on my skin but it also irritates it  I prefer all natural think baby sunscreen and andalou naturals skin perfecting beauty balm.	-1
I couldn't use it.  It burned my skin - it's a no go for me.	-1
Im giving this two stars for the lack of self tanner smell and ease of Application but this did nothing for my pale skin- so disappointing. I bought the mitt to apply it with too and was hopeful but even after 3 hours + and two applications no difference. I feel robbed because it seems like everyone else seems to have had a great experience and I followed the directions (exfoliated before, applied w mitt, waited appropriately) and NOTHING. Im going back to my LOreal self tanner towelettes which have never let me down.	-1
The primary reason that I am disliking this is the odor.  It has a weird, grandfatherly smell.  I can't decide if it's more Aqua-velva or shaving cream, but it's unpleasant and slightly stranger.  And very non-girly.  And not *attractively* masculine.  And it lingers.  Constency wise, it feels completely different that the other dr brandt serum I've tried.  This is more of a light lotion, somewhat thick.  Disolves INSTANTLY into the face, yet doesn't seem to really moisturize.  Also, when followed with moisturizer, the combination felt a touch minty/tingly.  I *don't* like it.  I don't like it at all.	-1
I am 40 with oily skin, no deep wrinkles, but my forehead has an uneven texture. I was hoping LaserFX would help with the texture but after 20 days, I have seen no change.	-1
Luxurious cream in an attractive package. So far I have seen no results after applying it diligently twice a day. No difference in my skin texture or tone. I have very oily skin, and it feels drier after applying this product, and I definitely need to use a moisturizer afterwards. It maybe even worse, for people with dry skin. Will update my review after using the entire bottle	-1
