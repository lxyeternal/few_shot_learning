GOOD STRINGS	1
Packaged well and shipped fast. D'Addario has been my favorite strings for many years now. It's good to find affordable offers such as this in a quality string. Thanks D'Addario! Keep it up!	1
nice strings	1
Awesome!  Fixed the tuning issues I was having on my Epiphone Dot.	1
These are my favorite tuning machines. Simple, hold great and simple and they hold great and there simple plus they hold great as well as being simple.  Easy to install, headstock drilling may be required in some cases. Dont let that scare you, just use masking tape and drill slow with a sharp new drill bit.  I have put these on 2 les pauls and my j-45.	1
The automatic locking mechanism is fantastic. Just pull the string through the hole in the tuner post, start tuning, and the locking cam licks the string in place and puts it in tune in less than one rotation.	1
You will not regret getting this Grover 106C Rotomatic Machine Heads. Smooth rotation, very solid, and this is as good as it gets!	1
I bought these for my Epiphone Dot and they were a drop in replacement. Wow they are EASY to use!! They get into tune and hold it fantasticly!! I'm probably gonna buy some for my acoustic Alvarez Yairi. Love these.	1
I have played guitar close to twenty years now, (i still try new strings and stuff that gets my interest) but for my martin and gubson acoustics, these and the bluegrass daddarios are the most frequent strings i keep on them and seem to always keep a couple extra packs around.	1
Satisfied.	1
Very good string's.	1
Always the right choice for my acoustic instruments.	1
These strings are a very exciting change of pace from the regular guitar sound. They have completely reinvigorated my playing. The sound is chiming and bright. Kind of half-way between a regular guitar and a twelve string. I have them on a $50 Rogue and they sound incredible. Note - the sound is quite different from a regular guitar. Some chords will not work. But youwill find that the ones that do work in acompletely new way. Well worth giving a try.	1
so far these are my favorite strings	1
These strings lived up to the many positive reviews here on Amazon. Nice sound and I'm happy that I made this purchase. Very much recommended!	1
Sweet strings! Sound great!	1
Arrived on time and exactly as expected.	1
Good strings	1
Works as advertised	1
Always reliable.	1
Good	1
Great tone, stays in tune. Very nice strings at a very good price.	1
I don't like having to change strings frequently.  If you don't mind that, these have a great bright sound.  They just lost that too quickly for me to keep going back to them.	1
Fast ship great product	1
These are great and I appreciate that they're made in the USA.  Good tone.  Can't go wrong with a set of D'Addario's on a Martin.	1
D'Addario so what else can I say the best strings out there .	1
item arrived very fast and was exactly as described!	1
Cant beat the "box option"  but even so, strings are very strong in quality.	1
Good enough for the Breedlove factory, good enough for me	1
Cant go wrong with Daddario	1
Exactly same as OEM strings. Very nice quality.	1
The best 12 strings	1
Not as amazing as my Elixir's but for the price I love these strings.	1
D'Arddario always makes  a fine string. These are no exception. I like the way the feel to the touch, the highs are pleasant and the lows are deep.	1
I really like these on my Gibson HP 635. Nice and clear. Each string projects well and resonates nicely.	1
I HAVE NOT USED THEM ALL YET SO FAR SO GOOD.	1
nice sound. feel good to finger or pick.	1
great	1
The custom light gauge fits my playing style perfectly. I use them on both of my acoustics. Decent life and awesome tone.	1
As I rave on, D'Addario has the best strings. Don't hesitate to get their products.	1
Surprisingly, these are amazing strings. Little skeptical at first, but these are worth getting for any acoustic guitar.	1
Stringy!	1
Some customer reviews on non-Amazon seller websites say the Heavy Gauge (.014-.059) strings will harm the guitar neck when tuned in Standard E. I've repeatedly bought these for over two years and can say that has NOT been my experience. I play weekly, live on a lower cost acoustic ($160). After a few days they've stretched out and will hold the tune. Shipping is not always bubble wrapped and have sometimes arrived with slight bend on the E or A string but they must stretch out because they sound fine and tune fine. They are harder on the fingers if not played at least twice a week. I've seen faces in an audience look up and notice on the first strum with these quality strings.	1
Thanks to these strings, I can still play like someone that can't play a guitar.  It would be unfair to deduct stairs due to my own inability to play.  Bought a guitar that needed strings and the reviews were good and the price was right.  Sorry, I can not offer a legitimate critique.	1
What is there to say?  All strings are well made, but these feel and sound great to me on my guitar.	1
I decided to do a bit of an "upgrade" on a poor neglected Yamaha guitar I had that was a gift from a non-guitar playing friend (which is why you shouldn't give instruments as gifts to people if you don't know much about instruments or the preferences of the musician to whom you wish to gift the instrument--but I digress).  Putting a better grade of strings did improve the sound, especially after I managed to fix the loose tuners that caused the strings to constantly slip out of tune. I also managed to lower the action and do some basic tweaks and cosmetic makeovers ( a bright blue pickguard), and now I am playing the guitar whenever my arthritis and my neighbors will tolerate it.  D'Addario is a good standard brand of guitar strings, and they make various strings for both steel-stringed acoustic guitars and nylon-stringed acoustic (classical) guitars.  String choice and response is very subjective, so you might need to try various kinds of strings before you find the strings that make your particular guitar sound the best to you.  HOWEVER, make SURE you only put steel strings (and despite the name, "Phosphor Bronze" is considered a type of steel string) on a steel string guitar, and nylon strings on a nylon stringed guitar.  While no real harm will come to your guitar if you put nylon strings on a steel stringed acoustic, they may not tune properly because of the difference in tension. No matter how "light" steel strings are, they are too much for a nylon stringed guitar that typically will not have a reinforced neck and the added tension will damage the neck of the guitar--even bending or snapping it. Don't do it.	1
Only thing I use .. hatleyband.com	1
my ear likes the sound	1
Great warm and bright tones been using these for years.	1

After using these on my guitar and was happy I would put them on a guitar I found near the trash. I put the strings on but the guitar was not good enough for these strings so I kept me light strings. I painted the guitar I found and repurposed it . I included a song I made with photos of family and San Diego	1
Same as always,great ultra light set	1
Great sound.  Very good for bluegrass and most other acoustic styles.  Highly recommend.	1
Great Strings	1
These strings are great and sound awesome!	1
Excellent strings always crisp and responsive.	1
I've always been a fan of D'Addatio phosphor bronze strings for acoustic. They make my Breedlove dreadnought just sing... smooth and pleasant to the touch.	1
Great Sound	1
Feel good about the value... Have always loved the strings...	1
Only strings that I ever use on my 12s.	1
These are good strings.  I didn't love them on my particular instrument but that was about a particular sound I was going for.  But these are good bluegrass strings with a lot of bite, good tight bass and good balance.	1
The sound of strings is very personal to each guitarist and his respectful guitar. Try several strings, and make your choice.  Initially I rated these strings for 4 stars, because they get stained frankly quickly. But they sound way more natural and crisp, compared to laminated. These strings have to be replaced (due to technical conditions) quicker than laminated. But honestly, laminated strings have to be replaced somewhat about same time + they cost way more. How do I understand that it's time to replace my strings? Easy. This is the moment when your strings tuned perfectly, but you don't like how they sound. It may happen because of your own mood. But it happens frequently - it's time:) Usually laminated strings get worse in about one month, D'Addario 3-4 weeks.	1
Nice sound.  Bright, bold sound.	1
great string great price	1
I've tried a lot of strings over the years, but have settled on D'Daddario strings for their sound and consistency.  It's maybe my imagination, but they seem to want to go into tune after I change strings.	1
I have since switched to 80/20's but these strings have a longer lifespan before sounding dull and they squeak alot less.	1
This review is for the Heavy gauge set. I play 1/2 step down (Eb) tuning, and for that these strings are phenomenal. The tension is right, and the sound is FAT and ENORMOUS. I play a McPherson, and McPherson recommends mediums for their guitars. For 1/2 step down tuning, these heavies provide about the same overall tension, which is important for the McPerson tone. I found out the hard way, waiting far too long to make the change.	1
I play in many alternative tunings,this brand hasn't broken a string yet while changing tunings.	1
These about my favorite strings on my D 18 Martin	1
Great strings! Great price! Fast delivery!	1
These are great sounding acoustic strings. Very good quality. This is the first time I've tried them, I'm very pleased with the sound. They make my guitar sound better then it really is. I've tried coated strings, they just don't seem sound as good to me. I'll most likely keep using these strings on my acoustic guitars and try their electric guitar strings also..	1
I use these all of the time.  They re fairly long lasting and have great sound on all mt acoustic guitars. I would recommend them.	1
Thank you!	1
Perfect, Thanks!!!	1
i've been using these strings for years.  i also like ghs and ernie ball	1
Used these on a cigar box guitar and they worked well.	1
excellent  product and service	1
Great! And good price.	1
Great strings. They work and sound great.	1
Nice strings, in good shape.	1
Two strings broke before I ever got to play on them. I love D'Addario, which is why it makes me sad to only give them one star. I wouldn't be surprised to find out these are fakes, because this is not the D'Addario quality standard I know and love.	-1
I bought a set of 10 of these strings.  They sound great.  However, I keep breaking the D string at the saddle even though I file off any rough edges.  I thought it was the guitar, so I borrowed my friends guitar and put a set on that guitar.  Broke the D string within a week.  I replaced all the strings again.  Broke the D string within one day in the middle of a gig.  Very frustrating.  I'm going to switch brands.	-1
I buy, restore and sell acoustic guitars. I personally use Acoustic Science but are expensive. I wanted strings that would sound good but not as expensive. These sound great and are easy to play b	1
Perfect for my Ovation guitar. These strings are light enough to be easy on the fingers, yet heavy enough to stay in tune.	1
When Im playing my acoustic, these are the strings to use. I love the tone that these strings put out. Ive tried some other styles and brands, but always find myself going back to D'Addario for my stringed instrument needs.	1
I purchased these strings along with the EJ26-3D's, a pin set stage rocker, guitar strap, capo, string winder and guitar tuner as a Christmas present in 2013 for a guitarist friend in Canada and completely forgot about leaving a review.  I have used D'Addario strings on my own guitars and been happy with them. I know he was thrilled with the items and was pleased with the quality but sadly he passed away in 2015. I am grateful to have found items that he enjoyed from companies that shipped to Canada as so few on Amazon did at the time.	1

Nice sounding strings for my acoustic guitar.  I have bought others but so far I like these the best.  They seem to stay in tune very well.	1
When my teacher told me never to leave these in the clarinet (they hold moisture,) and to use a swab instead of getting miniscule fuzzies stuck inside the bore from these, I immediately stopped using them.	-1
I only wish I had these when I was playing years ago. My old clarinet might have lasted longer. I recommend these as a must for all clarinet players.	1
These "pad savers" are great products, but only if used for the right purpose, and (unfortunately) that purpose really shouldn't be for "saving" your pads by leaving these inside the instrument (any instrument -- plastic, metal, or wood).  Instead use them for cleaning tools to get the spit/moisture out of your instrument.  They work better than the majority of cleaning swabs (piece of cloth on a string with a weight), and this way you're using one "saver" per section of your clarinet instead of using one small cloth swab for the entire clarinet (which ends up pretty wet/saturated after one pull through the entire instrument).  Leaving these inside your instrument when stored in the case is not good.  Sure, they soak up most (if not all) the spit/moisture, but then when you leave it inside your clarinet, guess what you have?  Yep, a spitty, wet, microfibre cloth in your clarinet.  Use it to clean your clarinet, and store it outside of the clarinet, preferably out of the case or in another compartment of the case.  Remember, just like with the swabs on a string, you'll need to clean these every once in a while or even replace them.  You can't keep using the same spitty cleaning material for the life of the instrument.  A good practice would be when you bring your clarinet home from school on the weekends, rinse off each of these, wring most of the water out, and let them air dry.  Then you'll be good for another week of use.	1
just like you want it to,Shorter one for the top half and the longer one for the bottom half, one hour and you all dried up	1
Before getting this, I used only the little fabric swab and string to wipe my clarinet after using, but I knew my instrument was still being put away wet. These seemed reasonably priced and they fit well.	1
I ordered this for my daughters clarinet and she loves it. It helps keep her clarinet dryer and cleaner she uses all the time!!	1
D'Addario's are hard to beat, this 12 string set EJ41 are easy to play and produce a great sound.	1
I always use these strings on my acoustic. They are such nice strings.	1
Awesome price for decent quality.	1
great strings	1
I put these on my Martin GPCPA5... sounds great :)	1
I think these are a 5 star string. They compare nicely to Martin Acoustic SP but have a little bit more mids and a tiny bit less bass. Very organic, not overly compressed like Elixirs (which is what I mainly have used the last 10 years!) They sound balanced strummed or plucked on my 000-15m, not too twangy and right in the sweet spot for brilliance. They also seem to carry a note / sustain better than other strings I've used in a very good way, unless my mind is playing tricks on me. I like and dislike the packaging at the same time - it's cool that all the strings come in one bag and it takes up very little room, but the first couple of times you end up spending time deciphering the color coded strings instead of looking at them by number, and they wrap two strings at a time. I tried EXPs a few times before and thought they were terrible, odd how much better these strings are!	1
Great quality strings for my twelve string guitar.	1
Phosphor bronze EJ's are classic go-to budget strings. I love their sound right out of the package. I used to work at a world-renowned instrument shop and we'd send a pack of EJ's home with every new acoustic purchase, can't go wrong. Their tone doesn't hold up as long and they don't hold up to abuse as well as my go-to set that I use on my main instrument, but I always recommend these for folks on a budget or who don't really know what they're looking for.  That said, for Nashville tuning you're largely dealing with unwound strings (only one string is wound phosphor bronze). The difference compared to higher end strings is far less significant. Also, you're string up for Nashville so you're either 1.) Gearing up for a recording session or 2.) trying to find something interesting to do with a spare guitar.  For either use these are 100% the set to go with.  If you're looking at these reviews to figure out whether you want to try Nashville tuning on your second guitar - yes you do! It's a neat sound and fun to play around with, can add an interesting depth to your recordings, and I even have a guy in our band playing one on a few tunes at a show this Friday.  It's worth a couple of bucks to try it out.	1
Decent strings, great price.	1
great strings great price !! always re buy these	1
Good quality guitar strings. Been using D'Addario strings for years.	1
Very Pleased	1
Great strings, sound great, and last a while!	1
I love these strings , glad after 40 years of playing I settled on them.	1
excellent strings very bright sound	1
Sound great	1
D'addario strings are always a good bet. These work well for alternate tunings like DADGAD or Drop D. Would like to see a coated version however.	1
sound wonderful	1
Best strings available in the extra light gauge.	1
the only way to go.	1
They sound great and they came at a great price.  I don't have an expensive 12-string, but they do have a great sound compared to the previous set I was using.  The old set wasn't bad, but it wasn't quite on this level.	1
They are nice strings, a little metallic sounding, but they're pretty good. I like them.	1
When the reviews said "bright", they weren't kidding !  The G, B, and high E (bottom 3 strings) are clear, BRIGHT, and produce a FANTASTIC sound.  Additionally, they stay in tune (it's been a month and I have not had to re-tune my guitar, and I play / check it every day).  The low E, A, and D (top 3 strings) are much more muted, but still produce a great sound.  If you are finger-picking a lot, you might be very happy with the higher notes, and a little less happy with the lower notes, as there is quitter a difference in the authority of sound.  It doesn't make that much of a difference to me, because I have an acoustic-electric and I run it through an amplifier, and just turn up the bass a bit.  That levels-out the sound I want.  The extra light strings SAVED my finger tips !  I could not believe the difference between Fender "light" and these D'Addario "extra light"...HUGE !  I am able to press much more lightly to produce a good chord / note, and the pressure on my finger tips is much less as well.  I've VERY pleased, and until I have a reason not to, I will continue to buy THESE strings.  HIGHLY recommended for beginners and advanced players alike !	1
Nice sounding strings, I'm still shopping for the best though.	1
I've never had this number of strings at once. Whenever a string would break I'd always have to rob one from a new set. No more. The price was fair and the packaging was good. I would recommend this seller to anyone.	1
I like these a lot. Gives my Tacoma a very nice depth of sound which can be changed appreciably with picks of different thickness and material.	1
Great sound.	1
sound great but seem to get oxidized pretty quickly	1
Shipping time and quality was perfect. Strings sound great. Installed on my Yamaha FG 800. Much nicer sound than stock strings.	1
Probably the overall best string -- I've tried many (as an advanced player).	1
New strings, hard to beat the price.	1
Super light 12 string set. Good quality. Use these if you want to have less tension on the neck and easier to press down but will not sound as loud.'	1
The strings work great.	1
Great strings! I don't think these could ever break easily. Great bright sound. Recommended!	1
Great acoustic strings. Best sound out of any tried so far including Martin, Ernie Ball, DR, etc. Very warm sounding, good volume depending on gauge, wear is normal for bronze strings.	1
I've had to order more of these for any guitarist who heard mine. Great buy.	1
Good product. Thank you	1
Tried a lot of strings over my 44 years of playing in at the end of the day these work	1
smooth.	1
Good product	1
Good strings.	1
Set of three at a really good price!	1
Strings produce the sound that is indicated on the package. They don't last as long as elixir strings but are a good value for the sound projection they produce.	1
These strings will not die. I am not sure what I do to my strings but they usually break quite quickly but this string has yet to break on me.	1
When I'm not using D'Addario EXP17 coated, I'm using these. While I have the floor here's my take on coated vs. non-coated: With coated strings you don't have to change strings as often, and that saves wear and tear on the bridgeplate. If you play or gig regularly, that's important. As far as the cost, at least for me anyway, it's a draw. Coated lasts twice as long but cost twice as much, so I don't save any money by going with non-coated. It boils down to just how much money I want to spend at the time. Okay, now back to these strings. Medium gauge produces much better tone. I've been playing for fifty years, and gig regularly. These are great sounding strings and they don't break easily. Just give 'me a try!	1
Excellent deal on sale at Xmas. $2.50 a set!	1
You will love this item when you get it.  Great sound	1
Great sound I usually use dr string black beauty or erine ball ever last. So I decided to try these strings I was surprised how Good they sounded.	1
Good quality.	1
Very good product	1
Good product	1
A good product	1
D'Addario strings are always consistent and with a pleasant tone. Buy them in bulk.	1
Nice strings.	1
I love these strings...  they have that bright brushed sound.	1
These are the strings that ive been using for years,and the three pack makes it much easier to change strings,What a great price on my favorite strings!	1
D'Addario EJ16-3D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic...; great cost for quality;  item comes as described	1
Sound great on my Simack	1
Quick delivery. Quality product.	1
Good strings	1
Very light strings with a bright tone. I have issues with my joints and these strings make it possible for me to play for long periods of time without much stress. The tone is bright and I really love them!	1
I'm an electric guitarist 1st so being able to bend means I don't have to change my play style to play campfire gigs.	1
Excellent product and arrived as expected!!	1
The strings arrived quickly. I put them on a mahogany acoustic guitar and they sound fine but they are not quite what I was looking for. They are a bit mellower than the standard Phosphor bronze but not as mellow or loud as I was wanting. I will try a set of aluminum bronze and see how they work and then try silk and steel. The strings song good but not exactly what I am looking for.	1
I do a lot of Guitar setups and use a few different types of strings. These are light enough to make playing fun again and still retain some of the low end sound of more heavier strings. They last about as long as most strings and are a real bargain if you change strings a lot. I recommend them for professionals that need good sound and change strings often to keep that brand new string feel and sound.  You can't go wrong with them unless you sweat all over them and don't wipe your strings but then again they are cheap enough to just throw another set on.	1
sounds great	1
Great price, basically 3 sets for the price of 2 sets. Always great to have extra sets on hand.	1
Excellent	1
They sound way better than the old strings!	1
Good strings	1
Great strings	1
grandson loved them	1
good quality however tone was not the same so reordered EJ17 for a little better tone	1
The perfect guitar strings for me.  They make playing the guitar a little easier.	1
Great strings. D'Addario does make great strings, and I use several dozen sets of various strings each year; Guitar, Mandolin family, etc.	1
I purchased both their Medium gauge and Heavy gauge strings.  (This review is for the Heavy gauge).  For my guitar, I wanted to bring out more bass so the Heavy works best, although is a bit hard on the fret fingers.  I'm a lifetime fan of D'Addario though - lots of good choices.  I buy their nylon strings for my classical guitar also.	1
good product decent price	1
So Good Item.	1
I've been playing guitar on and off for about 10 years now, and every time I pick up the guitar after a long break, my fingers get incredibly sore and painful. Although I understand the importance of calluses, if you take a break from playing every so often like I do, they will eventually disappear. These guitar strings make picking up the guitar after a long break much more enjoyable.  What's nice about these strings is that the bulbs at the end of the guitar are all color coded. This comes in handy to ensure that you put the strings where they belong.  Now when you first install them, you'll notice a slightly mechanical sound when playing the guitar. This is only because they are new. After about a day or so, I've found that they give off a very bright and clear tone. I would highly recommend these strings! They are light enough that they don't hurt your fingers, yet give off a beautiful sound, and have a very nice feel to them. I'll be purchasing these again for sure!	1
These are the strings I've used for years and will never waiver from!	1
RECOMMENDED Light and sweet toned. Not as heavy as standard, but good if your vintage instrument needs lighter strings. Easy on the fingers for those new to 12 string guitar. Long lasting. These did tune right up, and stayed tuned pretty well from the start. I do recommend wiping down your instrument and the strings to remove the acid from your fingers. This will improve the durability of the strings. 5 Stars A++ RECOMMENDED VOTE thumbs UP IF YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL	1
I have used D"Addario strings for years and love them.  Great tone!	1
Full and bright sound, and not much conditioning needed after putting them on my acoustic. Likely my go-to string from here on out.	1
D'Addario quality is superior. I have used their product on 5 different instruments for years with no issues.	1
Good strings	1
These are heavy gauge and it has a slightly less bright sound, which I like. Also, I play heavy handed so these are great for me.	1
I like the lighter gauge.	1
As the brand , it's so great, and the price is excellent, keep up the good work	1
Great strings	1
We have purchased a lot of strings while trying to learn how to string a guitar...these...probably our favorite. They are color coded...that made the process much easier!	1
This the only way to get number 9 strings, take out the stuff you need. Toss the odd stuff. I have MS and my hands are not as strong as before I got sick.	1
D'Addario strings are the best, hands down.	1
As always, these are the strings to get! Quality feel & sound. D'Addario is simply the best choice for my money.	1
Im a D'Addeario acoustic string guy. Their strings are the most consistent and long lasting. They slip and slide easy under the fingers and feel soft.	1
I've always been a D'Addario guy. Find what feels good to you and use it. I personally don't pay attention to these "guitar tech" reviews...whatever a guitar tech is. Also, if you feel the need to change your strings once a week, you must f-ing shred like Satan or like to blow money. Strings don't sound good until they get through their break in period. If you are changing your strings once a week, you are doing something incorrect.	1
They are acceptable but too much on the bright side for me. I much prefer the exp11 strings. I will not be buying these again.	-1
These strings were cheap, and my guitar badly needed them.	1
They are guitar strings. Love them.	1
Great strings won't have to be replaced for a while now.	1
great deal	1
Excellent strings, I love the quality and price. Would highly recommend.	1
good strings as usual. Be sure and get size appropriate for your skill level	1
Great strings and quick delivery	1
The strings sound great on my guitar.	1
Exactly as described	1
These are my go-to strings for my Martin. and Guild.	1
Jingly AND Jangly, these strings are the best deal anywhere, and sound just swell.	1
Great quality, love D'Addario brand strings.	1
Put these on a $50 Ibanez that I bought off Craigslist.  Heck of a fun guitar.  These "High Strung" or "Nashville Tuning" strings are fantastic on my old acoustic.  If you haven't tried Nashville tuning, give it a shot.  I think you'll love the way it makes your guitar sound.	1
Nice bright strings at a good bargain.	1
Always liked these strings for my older Yamaha acoustic guitar	1
Great Price and package.	1
Staying in tune well	1
This is a must have, your guitar will stay in tune, even using the whamy in a beasty way, great value for the money! I bought them as direct replacement for the PRS SE series, no drills at all, just take the old ones off and put this new ones, very simple and fast.	1
One of the tuners on my old Yamaha acoustic guitar broke, so I hunt for replacement and decided to go with Grover 406C Mini. I am happy with my decision.  They are easy to install, and the guitar stays tuned even though we have some climate swings in our area lately.  One problem I have is the location of the screw hole.  The picture shows that it is in the middle, so I thought I didn't have to drill holes.  However, when they arrived, it turns out to be on the corner.  Anyway, new screw holes might keep the tuners stabler.	1
Great deal with these tried and true brand	1
Thanks++++	1
Right out of the box, great! Beautiful sound even on my 18 year old Seagull guitar.	1
great string replacement for my 12 string guitar	1
Great!!	1
good strings for the price	1
I love these strings. Pull one out. Plug it in...	1
Great strings at a great price. Seem to last a long time as well. These have been my go-to strings for past 10 years.	1
Good sound, easy to install, exactly what I wanted.	1
Greatest locking tuners on the market. This thumbscrew/locking pin free design is awesome. Previous locking tuners that use a thumbscrew that I've used eventually stopped holding perfectly, or you drop the pin and are out of luck. With these Grovers you just pull string through and begin tuning. The post itself has an inner/outer cylinder design which grabs and locks the string in.  Not only are these the fastest tuners for changing strings, they perform the best as well. I have since switched all my guitars to Grover rotomatics.	1
Just wow. Such a huge night and day improvement of the stock prs tuners on my Prs SE custom 24. I rarely have to tune now. No string slippage or breakage as of yet. Help if you put some good tension on the string as it pinches in. Installation was a breeze. Seriously, a great drop in improvement (as shown on left of picture)	1
They work great, I've had a little problem with my B string on a PRS, cleaned the guitar piece by piece, top to bottom and changed the tuners to these... Problem solved, these little things keep the strings in tune really well. Great purchase, no doubt.	1
works perfect on a PRS SE pattern is the same no drilling required just do one at a time, in 30 minutes you will be done all you need is a screwdriver	1
Bought these to replace factory tuners on a '06 USA PRS. Barely long enough to reach through the headstock. Main problem was the high 'E' string would snap off at the tuner before reaching pitch. Tried a different tuner from the package... slightly better, but still cut the string. Went though 6 strings before giving up.	-1
this product eliminated the need for me to buy new mic clips or to change my mic stands!	1
These belong on a guitar.	1
I've tried every brand conceivable. Hands down, these are tonally crisp, clear and bright, play the best and don't corrode as fast as any of the others. I was with D'Addario for a long time and then tried other strings. There are none out there better and the Phosphorous Bronze  and they sound great just in a small room or in a large venue on an acoustic/electric guitar!	1
They fit my PRS Platinum SE. Not good for larger string gauges like 11-52 but work well with 10-46. Small holes and small pegs. But they do the job. Also slight wiggle after install. Snug them down good but not for far, Might split paint and wood near hole if to tight. If anyone knows of a good set of non mini's that would fit well let me know. Thanks.	1
I love these things. Have not had any string breakage like one reviewer noted.  I did notice that the tuning pegs need to be in the correct position before inserting the string. Installed these on  my Ovation 12 string.	1
They are so easy to install! My PRS SE has improved tremendously after I installed these locking tuners.	1
No thrills. Just works. Great build quality.	1
Arrived on time, well packaged and as described.  These screw onto the top of a standard microphone stand and adapt down so you can use LCD mount on the stand.  See stellar labs LCD mounts for details	1
ORDERED = 09/07/2016 || SELLER = Amazon.com LLC || PAID = $1.95 (Beware of Seller changes! That's when you may get burned!)  Items like this make long reviews unnecessary ... it's a great adapter, it works fine, needed for mic stand re-purpose.  That's it ;)	1
This is exactly what I needed, and good quality.	1
As advertised..........	1
I have used EJ42's for several years.  Everytime I try another brand of dobro strings, I'm glad to change back to EJ42's.	1
Durable and sounds good.	1
The best acoustic strings for most of my needs.	1
Great sound I love these strings. Won't tarnish that fast. like some others guitar strings.	1
Thanks	1
Good product	1
buying these Again ....cant beat the price	1
Need a light set of stings for a vintage Epiphone 12 String, More volume than I expected for light strings. They do not appear to stress the vintage body standard tunning.	1
Great	1
simply great; I switched to these on my all stratocasters (4 of them); and even better looking on the back side not like Fender locking tuner--they look ugly. These Grover don't have that screw thing on the back.	1
I purchased these to go on a vintage B.C. Rich with offset tab and wanted to use the factory holes. I also purchased some Grover/Hipshot Imperial Deco style buttons. Every thing fit perfectly and installation was a breeze. I love the fluid feel, quality and gear ratio.	1
To small	-1
weighty, decent threads.	1
Very pleased	1
As Advertised.	1
Threads and all. Mic stand to camera thread. Nicely chromed and all.	1
Nice nut	1
exactly as advertised and a decent price	1
Perfect	1
does what it is supposed  to do.	1
good quality	1
Love them. They lock perfectly and are very precise and easy to use.	1
These are great. Used them in my PRS se Santana as a direct upgrade	1
One of the 6 tuners, the automatic mechanism is broken and the tuner slips. I will have to replace these. The "rotomatic" feature or whatever makes the tuners "slip" until pressured is a nonsense feature. I don't know why they tinkered with something so reliable.	-1
These strings sound great and were very affordable.	1
Very fast shipment, very good product.	1
I use these on two high quality guitars.  I really like the sound.  They keep a new sound for about three weeks.  But if I get lazy and don't change them they still sound good for months.	1
Can't go wrong with D'Addario! I've used many different string manufacturers over the years, but find that D'Addario works best for me. But then, I'm new to this guitar playing thing...only been at it for 44 years. ;)	1
I use this to connect my Mic and ShockMount to my boom arm. Seems to be great quality.	1
Does what it needs to.	1
I got mine yesterday and installed them on PRS SE Custom 24 30th Anniversary.  The stabilizing screw holes were off by a smidgen (Grover ones are just a bit short), but wasn't too bad.  I screwed in the screws most of the way first, tightened the bushings, then tightened the screws.  All set.  The Grover screws were just a tiny bit too thin.  So I ended up using the screws from PRS,  I was a little apprehensive because I've read other reviews stating the PRS buttons won't fit, but mine were a perfect fit.  One note, tho, I have a set of Grover non-locking tuners I took off Epiphone Les Paul, and indeed, PRS knobs will not fit on those, but PRS knobs also fit on the Grover locking tuners I put on that same Epi LP.  So maybe Grover changed the shaft dimensions? (pic posted)  I've also read the reviews stating string breakage.  The instructions included is different than on Grover's website which shows the string holes should be more or less parallel to the strings when you start to tune/tighten, the instructions in the package shows to have the string hole line up perpendicular to the strings.  And so far I've not had an issue with D'Addario 095 - 044 set. (pic posted)  I installed them late last night, and this morning, I find the strings have already mostly stabilized and I'm getting pretty decent performance from the locking action - not as good as Floyd Rose, mind you, but even with dive bombing the trem, it stays tune well enough to finish a song.  So far, I'm happy.	1
Perfect drop in fit on PRS SE 30th Anniversary Custom 24.	1
Perfect for upgrading a Taylor GS Mini.  Of course added the new holes to secure the tuners.  Also switched out the buttons from the Taylor tuners to give them that "factory look".  Easy peasy and VERY good locking tuners for the awesome Taylor Mini!  You will like I think!	1
helped to solve my PRS SE tuning problems	1
Daddarios!,strings!,wipe em!,Keep em clean!,Make em WAIL!!	1
had one break on me putting them on, figured it was a fluke, had three packs so it didn't bother me much anyways, good sound from the mediums.	1
the adapter fit my mic stand but was too big for the camera shoe.	-1
ok	1
Well made. Works excellently. Timely arrival.	1
Works great!	1
You can really never go wrong with Grover tuners. They are a well made and top notch product. Help keep your guitar in tune with better tuners!	1
Very good.	1
Great for PRS custom 24. Note that higher e string needs to be threaded in, wrapped around, and threaded in again before winding to avoid breakage or slippage when bending the string.	1
These are very nice little machine heads. They are a bit small for my Les Paul type guitar. I think I should have bought the larger size for a few bucks more. These would be excellent on a telecaster or stratocaster type guitar. The fit and look would be better for that type guitar. That having been said, they are pretty nice. I like them and recommend them to anyone that wants a quality self locking tuner. If someone gave me a set of full sized rotomatics I would take these off and put those on my guitar. But since that is not likely to happen I will stick with these and be reasonably happy.	1
Exactly what the doctor ordered.	1
The best	1
Husband likes these strings.  He has stayed with this brand for years!  Might have to buy stock in these as much as he goes through strings!	1
I use these, and ONLY these strings on my Fender Hot Rod, Acoustic / Electric Guitar..!  I am a working musician and I have been playing for over 30 years.! I have tried a lot of other strings, and I stopped looking for the "best strings", when I found these. They are, in my opinion, the best strings for the money, period.!  Yes, you can pay more for strings, but you DON'T get more. When you change strings as much as I do, and as much as most working musicians do, then you are just flushing your money down the drain when you buy the more costly strings.. Why waste the money..?  These work well, hold the tone well, and the company stands behind the quality..!  I know from personal experience that D'Addario stands behind the quality of the product(s) they sell... Buy them, you'll be as satisfied as I am..!	1
Worked great for adapting my very old Sennheiser MD421's to fit on typical mic stands.	1
Worked perfectly.	1
nice, solid quality product	1
I don't profess to know why some microphone clips are made for a 5/8" screw and some are made for a 3/8" screw, but I do know that every microphone stand I've ever owned had a 5/8" screw on it. This tiny little add-on is essential to deal with that, and is a lot cheaper than buying a whole new set of matching clips.	1
Great sound, and quality. over all great price.	1
I've been using these strings for many years. I like the custom set of light on the top strings, but heavier bass strings. They also have a great recycling program!	1
Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Great quality. Easy to install. Good looks.	1
Use these to replace the garbage machines that came on my (older model) Gold Tone banjo ukulele. Smooth as silk, work great - as all GROVERS do!	1
Put these on my PRS SE 245 and I love em. I can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe 2. They were a perfect fit. No problems whatsoever.	1
Fully met expectations.	1
Used to adapt recorder with tripod threads, to mic stand threads, and the like.  Does that job well, and is priced reasonably.	1
This adapter worked well to connect a medium ball head with 3/8-inch thread to a piece of microphone gooseneck with 5/8-inch thread.	1
Fit perfectly so i could mount my mix cube to a mic stand. The speaker came with a thread mount but unbeknownst to me it was not the same size as a conventional mic stand thread. This adapter fit perfectly.	1
Great String warm and nice to play	1
Good brands	1
Loved these strings!	1
They call these mini tuners, but to me they are just right. Some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho. I installed them on a PRS SE Santana in just a few minutes. They were direct drop ins. To use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks. Then you line the hole up with the center of the headstock, insert the string and then turn the tuning peg. You'll feel it "lock in" then about another quarter turn and the string is in tune. They are really good tuners and I think anyone will be pleased with the tuning stability they offer.	1
I have had a possibly earlier set of these tuners on my Schecter Diamond Series C-1+ for many years. The guitar is from somewhere between 1999 and possibly 2001 but I'm pretty sure I got mine from Amherst, NY Guitar Center in 2000. Shortly after, the instrument was completely modified. I did NOT have to enlarge the factory holes but the set screw on the grovers did not line up with the factory tuners' set screw, which was at a 'west' and not 'southwest' orientation to the peg. So I taped a drill bit up(as a depth guide) and made some new holes. Yes, I put these on a hardtail guitar, and the tuning stability with Graph-Tech nut and saddles was wonderful. After a set-up (by me, no gauges, just used a tuner and worked by feel), the instrument played effortlessly, in tune, all over the neck. I used this instrument for several different original bands and in a situation utilizing some really fat "lite top/hvy bttm" strings, maybe 11-52 for downtuning, the low E would not fit through the peg unless the cam and sleeve were PERFECTLY aligned and it was Tuesday. Even after I got it started, I always felt like the windings on the string were sawing away at some surface inside the peg as I pulled the slack through.   Fast forward to 2009. The sleeve on the "D" string cracked at the tip, where the offset hole through the sleeve had left less material to one side of the bore. Result: Tuner will not hold the string at pitch, or even get nearly high enough in pitch before slipping, rendering the machine useless. So, I replaced the dead tuner with the original factory machine and that string won't stay in tune as well as the other five any more... I'm pretty easy on tools, instruments, vehicles, etc., so maybe I broke it and maybe I didn't. Minus one star but way to go, Grover.	1
These are much better than the thumb screw kind of locking tuners (Schaller).  These were a direct, drop in replacement for the stock PRS tuners on my SE Santana.  Along with a Tusq nut, they solved my tuning problems.  They also make string changes a breeze!  If nothing else,my mistakes are much more likely to be in tune.	1
These really are direct replacements for the PRS SE line. Only the machine heads are somewhat smaller. A great product.	1
This adapter works great! Rode NTG-1 shock mount on to a mic stand YEAH BABY! Rode should have included one with their product, duh.	1
What I needed was a 3/16 male with a 5/8 female to the mic stand, 3/16 is the size for your standard small digital camera like the Canon powershot, and since this adaptor fit my mic extension bar I kept it anyway.	1
These 5/8-27 to 3/8 inch mic thread adapters are well machined and sturdy.  They work as intended.  They are chrome plated brass and are easy to install or remove.	1
Good to have around.  I'm using them to screw into the metal 3/8" adapters that came installed in the plastic 5/8" stand fittings on 2 Samson microphone shock mounts.  By leaving the original metal 3/8" adapter tightened in place, it protects the plastic 5/8" threads from wear.  It is also good for those that have mic clips with a 3/8" European thread adapter installed, and can't figure out how to take a coin to remove the 3/8" adapter.  Buy one of these & screw into it so it fits 5/8" mic stands.	1
I'd purchased this to use with a Scarlett mic and it worked great! Nothing more to say as it's sturdy and did the trick.	1
All good	1
I just slapped these on my Larrivee, and they sound great!  Normally stings take a while to break in and sound the way they are suppose to, but just after a few minutes it sounded very good.  Right after putting them on and tuning it for the first time, they sounded a little bit twangy and warm. But after a bit of stretching and playing, they sounded warm, balanced, and responsive. Additionally, they felt very slick, and felt very easy to slide up and down the fretboard - more slick than over acoustic strings out of the box.  Having tried Earthwood Strings, Martin Acoustic, and Elixer Nanoweb. These D'Addario strings are on my short list of strings to buy in the future. I like these about as much as the Earthwood strings, however Earthwood strings cost much more. Maybe I'll like these D'Addario more than the Earthwood strings as they break in.  Only downside I can think of right now is how the strings are packaged. The strings all come in one plastic baggy inside of the paper package. So you have to really pay attention which string to put on because they are all in one bag. Luckily the strings have color coded balls on the end to differentiate which string it is. I think this packaging is inferior to those used by Earthwood, Elixer, and Martin Acoustic. But hey, its probably more eco-friendly.  Sound: 5/5 Price: 5/5 Feel: 5/5 Packaging: 4/5	1
As advertised	1
Not much to say about this adapter except it works perfectly.  Highly recommended if you use these things.  It's a good value and it works well.	1
I have purchased two sets of the Mini Locking Rotomatics.  No more winding string wraps around the tuning post. Fastest string change ever. Insert string, wind about a half turn, and the string is locked in the tuner. No more slipping out of tune. Rotomatics will go on every guitar build I do.	1
I am a huge fan of locking tuners.  Every guitar I own (6) has had their stock tuners replaced with locking tuner because the guitars stay in tune much better, and it is no longer a dreaded chore to change strings.  I chose this model because Paul Reed Smith guitars told me it is the model that fits my guitar without modifications.  I don't mind modifying but if I don't need to, I don't.  The Grover Rotomatics use a dual shaft system where the inner shaft has a smaller hole, and the outer shaft has a larger hole.  When you rotate the inner shaft by turning the button, this created a binding between the two shafts and locks the string in place.  It works, but I prefer the other style whereby you turn a nut on the back side to loosen or tighten the grip on the string.  Schallers use this other method.  Again, these do work, and the advantage is they are stealthy.  They look original from the back as opposed to being obvious locking tuners.	1
These were a direct, drop in fit on a PRS SE guitar.  They're easy to use, lock the strings, and are smooth and easy to turn.  What's not to like?	1
I exchanged these for the 502 tuners. Both models have the same great Grover quality and features, but the 406 knobs are more suitable for 6 inline or small 3x3 headstocks.	1
As advertised	1
Beautiful strings, brings the ol' resonator to life.	1
Great strings, they really sing.	1
I was very pleased with the tuners, they work great.  They arrived sooner than expected and were just what I wanted......I did have to bore out the hole on my guitar but that was no problem.......they work great......thank you for a great product and service.	1
I was looking for a direct replacement for my son's ESP LTD Viper-50.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Viper-50-Electric-Guitar/dp/B0002M6A8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Viper 50 Electric Guitar</a>&nbsp;Something that would not require drilling of either the post hole or locating screw on the back of the headstock.  These fit the bill nicely.  Remove the originals with a small Phillips screwdriver for the screw and a 10mm socket for the nut.  The new tuners drop right in using the same tools and locating hole for the screw.  The tuning heads are slightly smaller than the original but look just fine.  Quality is great too.  Since this type of tuner does not have a locking thumb screw like others I've used, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to get the string in and locked down.  There is a little cap on the top of the tuner post you need to rotate till you feel a slight click. Next you will need to rotate the tuner key until the string hole in the shaft, which is slightly off center, is on the opposite side from the tuning key.  I did run into an issue with the large E-String (#6, the thickest one) not fitting in the hole.  The guitar is set up for drop tuning and uses very thick strings.  In the end I used a 1/64" drill bit to very slightly enlarge the opening for that tuner only.  It worked out fine.  I've added some images to the product page	1
Well, I'll be damned. These tuners replaced the stock ones that came with a PRS SE model with a stoptail. I've got to say, they fit right into place and have a great feel when tuning. They've definitely improved the shoddy tuning stability of this guitar. Very easy to string as the tuners lock the string in the peg well, so forget about that whole winding thing you used to do! :)  For the money I think I did good last Christmas. Great buy if you have a guitar which uses these mini tuning machines.	1
I ordered these keys to replace a set on an 1980's model Cort electric guitar that had been damaged from heat due to an housefire years back. I had to drill out my headstock with a reamer bit because of the different size of the keys. They fit great after I got my holes drilled and they work wonderfully. I would recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade or replace a set that has went bad. Great deal fast shipping.	1
Nice!	1
Excellent Tone! Have been using Elixir 80/20 Bronze Light and they sound really good but I think these D'Addario strings have a richer (for lack of better words) fuller tone. They are cheaper than Elixir and will see if they hold up as well as the Elixir strings. Recommend they highly! [Using them on an Alvarez AD60S and a Alvarez AF60S]	1
good deal on strings didn't have to go get them worth the price for delivery sound good pretty durable thank you	1
I always loved .010 80/20 bronze but These are NOW my FAV strings. LOOK for "D'Addario EJ15 Phosphor Bronze Extra Light 10-47 Guitar String REVIEW VS EJ13 80/20 Bronze .011" and listen to how they sound and my thoughts. Then buy these!! My playing improved with these.. incredible strings	1
nice sound and great price	1
Decent middle of the road strings	1
Was for someone else	1
wonderful tone. . .	1
Gosh they felt really good for a longtime	1
Be careful for the quality. I get 3 packs and missing 1 string(5th)	-1
Martin Fan Is Impressed. I've played Martin strings on my Martins all my life. But recently I read some reviews of these D'Addarios that made me try them. I'm impressed, like really impressed. Blown away impressed. I was in the studio and just not getting the clean sparking sound I wanted for a really fast acoustic guitar song. I replaced my main string, Martin 80/20s,  with these and the guitar just sang. We had to cut the highs a little because it was so sparkly. We didn't cut the lows, though, who would even think about that... and when we listened to the takes, the bass notes were so boomy we couldn't even cut it enough with 4 different EQs. We had to re-record the takes after meticulously resetting the mics EQ on the pre-amp and board. That's amazing. This never happened before. These F'n strings SING! They blew me and everyone away. WTF? I got a case of Martins I don't want to use now.	1
Always great sounding strings from D'Adarrio.	1
With these strings, and a 12-string guitar, I'm sounding better than Clapton.	1
Fast shipping. Just as described.	1
These work every time!	1
I usually use Slinky Guitar strings, but after playing the D'Addario's......I'm hooked. Love the tone over the Nickel wound with these Bronzes. cannot see spending less for less. I am a new D'Addario Fan!	1
These play very well and have a great feel. I mix and match between the .010 and .011 packs on my Washburn.	1
I love the sound of these strings	1
Great strings for drop c tuned acoustic.	1
Really good vibrant strings !  Never tried them before and now I'm switching for good to these brand.  Except for my less Paul. For which I use vintage Les Paul strings.  But for acoustic and start, these are the best !	1
I tried these string on a lark. I've been using Earthwood Rock & Blues (hybrid [53-10] fatter bottoms, thinner tops) for years. These string just kick their ass in every way. I needed to get used to soloing on an acoustic with thicker strings but overall the experience is HUGELY better. I play outside all the time in the Florida heat and humidity, if you keep these wiped down they don't corrode as fast. I was previously having to change my strings weekly... now I get about two weeks out of a set (that's 12-20hrs of playing).	1
Stay in tune because of the way the string is wound and knotted. Pretty sure all guitar strings are made in like 5 factories worldwide.	1
Great strings. Very inexpensive, easy to install.	1
I buy most of the time DAddario string and no complaint for the quality and sound compare to the price I paid.	1
Rebuilt an old student guitar and threw these on it and the sound has never been nicer.	1
excellent for acoustic, great weight , feel, and sound	1
Sound amazing on my new guitar! I used to buy Ernie Ball strings, but these will be my new go to strings!	1
These strings are bright and expressive.  I've tried many different brands of acoustic guitar strings and find these to be solid.  Use them on all of my acoustic guitars--from a big strummer to 12 fret to parlor.  My only complaint is they wear out fairly quickly if you play a lot.  To me, this is not an issue because of the relatively low price of these strings when buying in quantity.	1
D'Addario does it again	1
They are easy on the fingers, sound good, and really cheap!  What else do you want in a string?  Hey, when I play my guitars, I don't worry about squeaking.  When you slide down, take the pressure off the strings, silly!  If you like the sound of the strings on Yamahas and Michael Kelly guitars, those are 80/20s.  Most guitar strings are made by either GHS or Ernie Ball and just rebranded, so I would worry less about who's name is on them than what they are made of.	1
D'Addario are great	1
good strings	1
I bought these because I have used this brand for years, and I wanted a custom guage for my acoustic guitar, so I could play leads easier, but still have a strong sounding bottom. So far, I have been very happy and will probably stick with these.	1
D'Addario EJ15 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Extra Light, 10-47 My Ibanez PN1 parlor guitar came with a fairly heavy set of strings, 12 - 53;  which seemed like overkill for that little guitar.  I tried the extra light set and it plays and sounds tons better.  Ordering a set of three now and intend to try them on my acoustic electric next.	1
good buy	1
Thanks	1
Love these strings	1
NIce strings	1
Very pleased with the sound and quality.	1
high quality strings. would buy again	1
I love these strings man, ill probably be buying more soon :) (yes, they're that great)	1
Very high quality strings!	1
I've been using these light gauge strings on my 3 acoustic guitars for years. I like them, they're inexpensive, and to my ear sound really good. I wipe down the strings with a dry cloth after each playing and occasionally wipe them down with alcohol to remove skin oils. When I do this, I use a very thin plastic sheet (actually a thin, flexible plastic kitchen cutting sheet, 2 for $1 at the dollar store) to slide under the strings to protect the fingerboard. I occasionally treat my fingerboards with Linseed oil (not Lemon oil), and feel that the alcohol would tend to dry out the fingerboards if I just rubbed the alcohol rag over the strings with the fingerboard exposed. At least that's how I do it, I feel this extends the life of the strings, I'm sure others have their own methods. I decided on Light gauge strings because, to my ear, and on my guitars, they give me a brighter tone, which I like. And I have set up all my guitars for neck adjustment/ string clearance, etc using this gauge strings, so I'll stay with them.	1
Great price for the set of 3. Just replaced the strings on my Rogue guitar. It sounds awesome. I have higher priced Accoustic guitars as well. The company has been around for years. Great product.	1
nice sound and price	1
Sound great, although these rust faster than the coated variant. My hands are super sweaty so I think I'm gonna stick to those. If your hands aren't sweaty, then these strings are perfect.	1
I've been using these strings on my acoustics for almost 10 years since i was 18. They always have had the greatest tone feel and redponse you want in an acoustic guitar.	1
love these strings	1
nice price, great sound	1
good sound , good price	1
right strings @ the right price	1
A LOT!!!!!!!	1
Put them on a cheap little Fender FA100 acoustic and they did well to improve the sound. More than expected, actually. Can't speak much for how they last, cause I sold the guitar (to fund another purchase), but judging them by the time I had used them, I will be buying them again. They gave the guitar a considerable boost to it's warmth and volume. I enjoyed it while I had it.	1
D'Addario makes great strings. Nice and light for my old Gibson 12. Typical very light G though. As usual of any string manufacturer. Phosphor Bronze is a plus, long lasting, easy slide on the strings.	1
WORKS GREAT	1
Great!	1
sound great	1
exactly as described, great purchase and timely arrival.	1
Great strings; I use them on two of my acoustics and they always sound stellar. These are my go-to for recording.	1
String are good...good spare set.	1
Good strings.	1
Awesome clear sounding strings. Easy on the hands and easy on the ears. Trust me, it's worth spending a little extra to buy these nicer strings.	1
price is right and good strings	1
Warm sound, good tune retention	1
Great sound and feel on my acoustic, at least when first installed.  They do seem to "dull" faster than Ernie Ball strings, hence the 4-star rating.  The price is right though for this pack of 3.	1
i love it	1
Warm leaning toward bright,with good projection. Dependable too! week play a few hours a day and no breaks(till we wear them out lol!)	1
good	1
OLD TAYLOR SOUNDED BETTER WITH THE DADDARIOS	1
i love ernie ball slinkys  so i thought i would try these big mistake i changed out the john pearse 80/20 bronze strings i had on my guitar and i regret it immensely. these strings sounded pretty thin and lacked the tone i had with the afore mentioned strings. of course your guitar might sound great with them .	-1
great quality fast shipment no problems	1
The only brand to buy.	1
Great value	1
Great value	1
Great strings!	1
Great strings!	1
Sounds great. Easy to key, they don't kill my fingers.	1
Excellent!	1
I like these strings.. Easier on the fingers than the Martin strings I had on my guitar, and sounds just as good if not better.. When I first opened one of the packs I was afraid I'd get the strings mixed up, but I noticed that the ends are color-coded, and on the pack it tells you which color each string is, so that's nice.  Not really much else to say.. I'll be using these strings from now on.	1
I love these guitar strings. Worth the price :]	1
These sound good and seem to hold up well! I'll be tapping into my second pack tonight after a few months of using the first set. I'm excited to play the new strings! Will definitely buy these again!	1
I would not use any other brand of strings on my guitars.  The D'Addario last a long time and give me the perfect tone I need for Blues. I've used this brand for years !  love them.	1
When my luthier did a setup on my Larrivee LV-09, he didn't carry the coated strings I was used to using and asked me if it was OK to use these EJ26. He put them on and I was hooked. It seems that I can hear the restricting effect of coating. I didn't realize how audible it was to me until I went back to a non-coated string. I tried going back, just in case my luthier's setup/repair was the main source of improvement to my guitar's sound. It wasn't. I am sure I could hear the coating restrict string resonance. The lower price enables me to buy these in bulk and change them a little more often if needed. Not sure if its needed more often though. I gave away my remaining coated sets that costs around $15 a set. I use custom light. I've never broken a string, although I am not a super hard player, I let the electronics do the work. I buy 10 sets at a time and like the bulk packaging - it's quick and easy by paying attention to the color of the ring that goes under the bridge.	1
Great strings	1
great price, great strings	1
Decent strings.	1
good strings	1
Fiiyaaaa <3 Love the natural metallic sound!!!	1
Good price, fast service. High quality.	1
Exactly what my hubby wanted!	1
good price	1
Great service and great product!	1
Great service and great product!	1
great!	1
great sound!!	1
The best acoustic strings you can buyand the price is great. They actually ring and resonate, the sound is great and crisp. I have them on a sub $100 Jasmine and they make it sound like a Martin. Definitely recommended.	1
These are great strings, thank you so much.	1
very bright sound	1
Good strings, sound great and settle in quickly. I've typically used Martin strings in the past, but these seem to be a little better to me. They do seem to tarnish faster than Martin strings, but the sound is still there so I'm leaving them on for now. Typically I change Martin strings every 2 weeks, sometimes monthly. These have tarnished after half a week. They are a little more expensive than Martins, but they're made in the USA and if the sound lasts I don't care too much if they tarnish quickly.	1
I'm an active musician and have used D'Addario strings for years. I change strings weekly on my working guitars and go through a minimum of two or three sets weekly.  In the past, I purchased strings in single packs which wasn't very economical.  It's so convient to have stings in bulk where I can have fresh strings at my fingertips and for half the costs of buying separately.  I love D'Addario strings.	1
Great quality.	1
good strings- good price.  I always buy my strings online from amazon.  never a problem.	1
Very good! The sound is very good. I love the very bright and clear sound. Happy with it!	1
Zager strings are my choice over any other I have tried.  Zager.com	-1
Used to re-string a guitar for a friend.  Looks and Sounds like a Brand New Guitar!  Nice and Shiny!  Impressive! Great Sound!	1
Great sound, great durability, great strings. Sometimes it feels like they're wound with gold.	1
got what i wanted	1
excellent	1
Sounds good for months..holds tune..clean and pure	1
D'Addario are the only steal sting i use. the heavier, the better. boom!	1
As Advertised	1
there is a reason that this is considered industry standard, while i like EXP's better these are better value. And I don't mind changing them more often	1
They sound just fine.	1
have used these strings on 6 and 12 string guitars for close to 35 years now	1
I have tried every brand string on the market.  I will admit that these strings are NOT the most comfortable strings I've tried.  I had always used then on my Takamine.  I stopped using them when I purchased a Taylor 314 ce thinking that surely Taylor had done significant research and that the Elixirs would produce the best sound.  Wow was I wrong.  My Taylor sounds best with these strings.  Every other brand sounds dead.  In fact even though there are strings that are easier on the hands to play, in reality they are not.  I find that I press harder with every other brand trying to get a solid sound.  These stings are stiffer than others but this works to your advantage.  It is actually easier to play them.  The short of it is that they sound Brilliant.  I would imagine they would make any guitar sound better.	1
Good price for solid stings.	1
They're strings by D'Addario... 'nuf said :D	1
Love these strings for dobro.  Crisp clear and stay in tune.  Been using for long time now and I still keep coming back to same ones.	1
What can I say. They're D'Addario! THE BEST!	1
I am a working musician playing over 200 gigs per year. These are my go to strings after trying many other brands including coated strings and different materials. I have a percussive playing style and I play in high humidity in hot temperatures, so breaking strings is a very regular thing for me. These strings last the longest of the many brands i have tried. Until they invent unbreakable strings, these will be my string of choice.	1
My favorites	1
Sound great!	1
Easy to install. Easy to tune. Bought for my son, who tries to learn guitar and he likes it. They were recommended for a beginner.	1
Nice acoustic sound.	1
Excellent in every regard. I go back and forth between these and 80/20's. The 80/20's have more punch and these have a bit mellower. I like both sounds.	1
great tone!	1
Use these for acoustic jazz and folk jazz. Perfect lightness for fingerstyle. I also play silk and steel for bossa nova. Just great string all around	1
Strings are great	1
These are great! We love them!	1
Good strings with nice sound quality. I have an extremely cheap guitar and these strings make it sound a teeny bit better (that's saying a lot!). They are well worth trying out.	1
Good strings!!	1
nice  good product!!!!	1
Good product	1
Strings as expected and competitive  pricing.	1
Excellent D'Addario quality as expected;  I love the color-coding and humidity-proof wrapping. Prompt shipping, 1st Class seller.	1
I love these strings. Very happy with their sound...	1
Work good	1
as expected	1
great deal	1
Love these strings on my Alvarez....Sound great and last....	1
No complaints.	1
Been using these for years, and will continue to! can't beat em!	1
I think these D'Addario EJ17-3D medium phosphor bronze/steel strings are very decent for the price. They are made here in the USA and seem to be of very good quality. They have made both of my fairly inexpensive Yamaha and Silverstone acoustic guitars sound as good as they probably ever could.  Very nice set of strings overall and I will definitely purchase these again when needed.	1
works fine.	1
Very nice full warm sound	1
The Ej16-3D strings brightened my 1974 Alverez (yes it's that old). The strings are responsive and have a great feel. They convey the volume and tone dynamics and bring the best you and your guitar have to offer!!!!	1
They seem to leave a bit of a residue on my fingers.  Not sure why.	1
Love these strings! Have been using D'Addarios since the mid-70's. They sound great, they're very consistent from set to set. Best bang for the buck, in my opinion.	1
Great Sounding Strings At A Great Prices	1
Nice sound.  Great price.	1
These are great strings. Sound fabulous and last a long time.	1
Great sounding long lasting strings .  the light gauge ( .012 to.o53 ) are a great choice for pickers who have had a little experience , but for beginners might be better served by extra lights .	1
As promised	1
As promised	1
Not a perfect balance of playability and tonal depth, but they are superior to other "light" strings.	1
These are my string of choice, always.  Long lasting, great tone and great price	1
Great strings, decent price. Probably not any cheaper at your local guitar store, and while I am all for supporting local business it is nice not have to a hipster up-sell you. Also there is always that guy shredding metal poorly, Amazon doesn't make you deal with him either..  These are lighter strings, so they won't be as loud (this will vary on the body of your guitar also). Additionally they may be a little easier to play on if your fingers are not in shape, or if you want to play quietly. Conversely, though, you will not be able to beat on them, because they will break more easily. High quality strings though.	1
I almost always use Ernie Ball strings, but thought I would give these a try.  Very nice sound.  Just is out on how long they will last, but so far so good.	1
They are not the string of a couple years back... they changed something or cheap'in the string.... less copper maybe. I don't know but they lack volume, a little muffled.	-1
Good sounding strings. Made a $60 guitar sound really nice.	1
Beat stings...only kind I buy!	1
These are great. They are the only strings that I have found that can compare to Adamas Phosphor Bronze, which isn't made anymore	1
Real guitarists use D'Addario	1
Came quickly. Works Well!	1
Really nice tone... hadn't realized how much I needed new strings until I bought these and heard the guitar sound great again	1
After trying numerous brands of strings, I have found these to work the best on my acoustic guitars.  I also like the way D'Addariou packages their strings which give them a longer shelf life.	1
item works very good. Happy with it	1
Good price	1
Great, price . Really brought back a great sound out of a old guitar!	1
These strings are my go-to favorite for bright, rich, clear tone.  They are brighter than coated strings.  If I play every day they stay bright for about 30 days.	1
Nice sound, appear to be good quality.	1
Amazing strings for the money. It amazes me what you can get for so little.	1
Great buy, great service!	1
Great product, easy to put on and was not broken. I will be buying again from D'Addario & Co. Inc. in the future.	1
Just what I needed and did not have any problems from ordering to receiving them. Every string was there and was not broken which is always a plus in my book. Will be buying from D'Addario & Co. Inc. again in the future.	1
Good strings but I should have gone with the ultra lights. These sound and play great but really not my preference.	1
Great case! Fits my Bach Stradivarius pro modrl and my Allegro Flugelhorn! Has slots for 4 mouthpieces and room on the outer pocket for mutes!	1
My daughter loves this case.  It is light enough for her to easily transport both instruments to school.  It protects the instruments well and has ample space for music and mutes. Cross body strap is a fantastic addition.	1
as expected good price fast shiping	1
Great	1
Works Great!	1
The color-coding they did on the bottom of the strings is awesome, they hold up well too!	1
The item came just as described. Well made, and recommend to get for the price.  SW	1
I think people should mention the brand of flugelhorns they fit into these cases. Probably most Bb trumpets will fit, but possibly not all flugelhorns. My Schilke fits perfectly. It's like it was measured for it. The case is well made. I guess it's canvas over plywood. It's not a soft-sided case. It's a hard case with a padded top and bottom. The bottom corners also have rubber scuff protection. The zippers appear to be heavy-duty. The exterior is well made and provides good protection. Inside, the horns fit well, even with having a portable floor stand inserted in each bell. There is ample padding. I really like that it will hold four mouthpieces. I carry two for the flugelhorn and two for the trumpet. There's also room inside, secured by the padding near the mouthpieces, for a bottle of valve oil. There's not room inside for much else, but the outside pocket is handy for music, the included shoulder strap, or some small accessories.	1
muy buen producto	1
I like it a lot. Horns fit great. I love the pouch on the side. Holds lots of music and stuff. Protects the horns in a relatively light case. Easy to carry with handle or strap. 4 mouthpiece holders in the case.	1
The item came just as described. Well made, and recommend to get for the price.  SW	1
Very nice string for me! I brought two at once!	1
GOOD PRICE,GOOD STRINGS	1
Delivered on time and looks and works as described.  Great sound at a reasonable price!	1
good value unfortunate.	-1
I loved the idea of this pack immediately and purchased them. But unfortunately, G string (009) broke while tuning just after I put it on. (Bonus: It scratched my hand.)	-1
Broke open and lost half the beads on one of the first uses.	-1
Broke first gig, fell apart. Looks cool, worked great for less than an hour	-1
ok	-1
The strap should just be an elastic material rather then the complex time consuming Velcro that is supplied with it. It is also extremely quiet. The beads inside should be larger and heavier so they could be heard over anything but the quietest music. It is well made though.	-1
Ridiculous little piece of equipment. Can barely hear the sound when attached to the ankle.  It's nothing more than a sand-like material in a 1/4 moon device that attaches to your leg.  II made a better one by far by  placing pebbles in a small vinyl box and attaching it to my ankle.	-1
If you like the sound of new strings these aren't you're best choice for your guitar	-1
I play a Taylor 614ce and I decided to try these out and I was majorly disappointed.  They sounded very harsh in the attack, they felt sticky to the touch, and the balance was way off.  After a few hours the tone was already dying and the 4th and 3rd strings sounded like old nylon strings.  I remember why I stopped using these several years ago.  They sound as cheap as they cost.	-1
Great string! BUT.... Gave two stars since 3 strings popped within 3 weeks. I understand it's extra light gauge yet I still think it should last longer.	-1
I bought this from guitar center. I'm glad they come in three packs because I popped #1 #3 and #6 all at the  same time I was replacing my old strings. I use to buy this brand. I wonder what had happened to quality. My Taylor deserves a lot better.	-1
These are horrible. I can't believe D'Addario would have these out on the market. When I played electric, I wouldn't use nothing but their strings but as far as their Acoustic ones are concerned, these are total crap.  They lose their brightness after a couple of days and they don't stay in tune very well either.  I just ordered some Martin SP's which I know from experience , are worth the price and long lasting. Stay away from these.	-1
I don't like the feel of these strings or the way my guitar sounds.  Trying something else!	-1
I use elixers but was looking to save some money. Well I should've just gotten the elixers. One set of elixers will last 2x longer than this entire box.	-1
The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.  Luckily I bought the three pack.  But I can't recommend this product.	-1
D'Addario,what's up? These didn't last long at all. I don't play my Martin very often,(too busy with electrics..) but these were trashed in a month. Guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? Never purchase again.	-1
I have used D'Addario's for years now, and this was the first set I was immediately disappointed with. They developed corrosion patches on several of the octave strings within weeks of putting them on my guitar. They do sound fantastic, feel great, good resonance, but once the corrosion starts the sound quality and feel of the strings deteriorates quickly. I will not be getting another set of these strings, and cannot recommend them.  As a baseline measurement, I have several other guitars with D'Addario strings on them and none of them, have shown such rapid corrosion.	-1
This is nightmare! I wish I can put zero stars for this product- they sound very unpleasant below 5th fret and is squeaking like hell when move your fingers. Very disappointed.	-1
Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like. Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\	-1
My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly. But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route, but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also, since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings.	-1
the sound of the strings is very low, without presence, with little brightness and they oxidize soon.	-1
I picked this up for my recording studio, with the intention of being able to toss any three guitars in it at a time.  It's sturdy, but I have to give it 2/5 for one reason only - it's too compact. I realize that with a design like this it's inevitable, but if it was just a bit wider it would be a lot better. Reason being, if you have three standard scale guitars in this, and one of them has a headstock that angles back/away from the fretboard, that headstock is going to bonk into any other guitars that you put in this stand. The guitars also need to be almost completely upright when sitting in them to avoid hitting each other, which makes it a bit perilous, especially if someone were to accidentally bump into it.  If you put an Acoustic in this stand, the guitars next to it need to be small (and electric), because the acoustic body will smack the guitars adjacent to it as well. It does fit three six string Ibanez guitars just fine, but with a seven in there I have to constantly keep an eye on things when I put the guitars away so that the headstocks don't "joust" with each other. I decided against putting even a small chambered nylon string in this stand, and am using it with three of my straightest-headstocked guitars. It works, but honestly I wouldn't buy this again. It's fine for my small home studio where I can always have the same three guitars in it, but for a gigging musician this would be an accident waiting to happen.	-1
I have a Galaxy bag (which I love) but needed a second bag and decided to try the Meinl as it's priced the same as the Galaxy (at least on Amazon). Big mistake. Although the fabric is substantial, the zipper is incredibly noisy and it tends to bind in the corner -- a disappointing contrast to the silky smooth and quiet Galaxy zipper. While either bag is definitely superior to the Zildjian (an embarrassment for a great cymbal maker), I'd recommend the Galaxy over the Meinl.	-1
Take off one guitar, and the other goes crashing to the floor.  Ludicrous design that was obviously never tested, by people who don't play guitars.	-1
Well, i've had this bag for a year and a half, used it for probably 6 shows or less. Turns out the straps are the first to go.  The stiching is coming out of the top and bottom of both straps, it will probably rip off and fall on the ground in the next month unless i sew it up my self. As it turns out, cymbals are heavy, Meinl.  Maybe try adding heavier reinforcing stitching? Am annoyed that it's been over a year and i can't return this.	-1
Too thick a base.	-1
Quality control issues...  I use these in my work frequently, and within the last year about 33% of them are failing completely, the threaded section either pulls free from the base or sheers off...The little stamped flange on the underside is utterly inadequate for the leverage that a a mic extension, gooseneck or other wise can exert upon it.  The idea is good, the shock mount is good, and the strength of the base is good, but the threaded rod needs a different attachment!!	-1
Speakers for guitar amps are a very subjective subject, and one mans "sparkle" and "shimmering highs" can be another mans "shrill". But based on trying this speaker in a Fender Blues Jr, I found it to be entirely too shrill. I'm talking tin can, ice picky, solid-state sounding, loose change on a concrete floor, tinnitus iducing 'brightness'. Even if you like British-style jangle in your guitar tone, be advised that the highs this speaker produces can be downright unbearably bright. For a more balanced speaker with good high end, I recommend the Eminence "Cannbus Rex" or the "Red, White, and Blues" for a little extra top end. Do yourself a favor and avoid this junkyard tin can speaker. Your ears will thank you.	-1
It sounds flabby no matter what amp head i drive it with full or attenuated. The attenuation stinks as well.	-1
Not happy with these, even though I love Schaller. They keep loosening, which defeats the purpose of a strap lock for me. Flawed design for my needs. I have since found another that is working light years better.	-1
As others have said, if you don't tighten the nuts frequently, they can unscrew and pop right off.  This fatal flaw makes these "locks" totally useless.  You'd be better off with no locks at all.  There should be an additional pin to keep the nut from falling off.  I hear the Dunlops don't have this problem.  Go ahead and reply "keep the nuts tightened, fool" , but this is totally unacceptable and hopefully unnecessary with the Dunlops.	-1
I ordered because the photo showed the new style Schaller strap locks, but I received the old style AND they are not real Schallers. The packaging clearly says a different manufacturer name, and Made In China. Fraud.  The replacements were not much better. They were made by Schaller (yea) but they still weren't the new style. This is a huge disappointment. Amazon usually does a great job, but they totally screwed this up - twice.	-1
These are not Schaller strap-locks - the listing should be changed to reflect this. These things are cheap copies, and poorly made, packaged as "Madina" brand (???). Also definitely not nickel plated - they're obviously chrome, and barely. Use at your own risk.	-1
Bait and switch. Made in China. Not Schaller. No felt washer.	-1
What I received were NOT Schaller straplocks.  Instead, I received cheap Chinese knock-offs branded as Madina.  They did NOT include the felt washers that go between the strap-button and the body of the guitar.  Also there was a large burr on one of the "horse-shoe" slip-over pieces that I had to file down to avoid possible gouging of the finish of the guitar.  The fit is also looser that of real Schallers.  They do, however, fit real Schaller buttons and the plating seems decent enough.  Those are the only reasons I'm not returning them.	-1
Not Authentic Schaller Strap Locks. They are from china knock off fake. Do not buy!.	-1
They squeak like crazy and I am not happy about waxing or oiling or lubing or doing anything to compensate for this. They simply should not squeak.	-1
I got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass I had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses. Also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use. I had never used strap locks before and don't think I will again.	-1
These are not genuine Schaller German made strap locks. They have no marking and are in fact repackaged in a nice plastic case with a homemade looking retail sticker saying Schaller. They look identical to the cheap Asian knock offs. They have absolutely no markings whatsoever the spring mechanism is cheap and can fail. It happened to me when I bought some cheap Asian knockoffs. These are not made by Schaller.	-1
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.  The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.  We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.  We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.	-1
I debated with 2 or 3 stars. It will not hold up an Audio Technica AT2020 properly. I have to tie down the weighted end to make it stay in place. Admittedly the AT may be a little heavy but I'm still surprised that I need to tie it down.	-1
This a get what you pay for situation. It's a wonderful mic stand in many ways. It's light weight. It's good looking and it's made so so cheap that don't think for a second you can get away with using it full time as a professional. The fittings are so so so so cheap. I would say it's not road worthy and will break if you try and use it on the road. But for the money so cheap it's just great. Would not buy again. If you need it in a situation that it won't get taken down and up all the time it's going to be great. I have 2 of them. The one is hard to tighten tight and the other is trying to loose parts every time I use it.	-1
I have made the mistake of ordering inexpensive microphone stands that are so poorly made and last only a few gigs.  Perhaps the more expensive On Stage Stands might last a few years. The plastic supports on the MS7701B have lost their support after less than 6 mild performances. Time to throw them out and invest in a better quality stand or two. Any suggestions?	-1
It's too cheaply made. it works but barely. Buy something else, for the price it's expected, but you're taking a chance with a good mic.	-1
These would be ok  if the base where the legs attach was not plastic.  I wasn't expecting much for $24 but I was expecting a metal base.  One of the stands I received would not even stand straight because one of the legs would not seat properly in the plastic.  These "look" like some of the better made stands, but they are pretty flimsy and I would not trust a decent microphone to one.  The plastic in the base tends to make them more top heavy and less stable than all metal types.	-1
Spend more money to get a heavier, more durable stand than this one if you are a gigging musician. The screw on the boom wears out after 15-20 gigs, and the stand is wobbly if you extend the center pole more than half a foot. it seems like the quality of On Stage Stands in the $30 price range has decreased significantly in the past few years. The microphone stand would probably work fine for light use at home, but don't expect it to last long if you take it on the road.	-1
We bought several of these, and the t-bar assembly keeps falling apart on them.  The company's website wants $6.00 a piece for replacement parts (three t-bar assemblies would almost pay for a new microphone stand).  The boom arm at the top of one of the stands won't stay screwed in any more, and we've only used these a few times a year.  They may be inexpensive, but they'll get their money out of you in replacement parts. I won't buy any more of their stands, they're junk.	-1
Pros: Cheap value  Cons: Poor build quality (The top part of the stand snapped from the bottom stand) Will not support a microphone with a shock mount (pole leans down to the ground) Annoying to adjust (Clunky adjustments)	-1
This is the first stand I have bought that DID NOT come with the microphone clip.  Now I have to go back to amazon and buy extra microphone clips to use.  They need to put that in the description that it does not come with a clip.  The stand gets about a 4 star review, but because they chose to be cheap and not include a clip, it gets a 2 star rating.  Update:  They are cheap, and the wing nuts strip out very easily and it doesn't get tight anymore.	-1
Recieved item promptly. However, after only 30 days and 2 uses the stand no longer holds my mic up without sliding down. Because I've passed my allotted time to return I guess I'm stuck with a product that nolonger work.	-1
Not very good.	-1
I'd only recommend it for light duty.  For a while I've been using it without the boom to hold a small Yamaha mixer, two iPads, and a Rolls headphone amp.  But I've been worried from day one that the base was going to give out -- the thumbscrew that tightens the base around the lower shaft has never held it securely; it's always had a slight wobble.  And when tightening it, it feels like the plastic is going to give.  Recently I switched to an older OnStage stand I had and the old one is much more solid (I'm not sure what the model of that one is though).	-1
Maybe it's just me, but I bought this as an amazon lightning deal around christmas. I'm using a larger, heavier mic, but not unreasonably heavy (AKG Perception 420). The stand feels like it locks in, but even though i've cranked it down as hard as I can, the main boom has no way to solidly lock in such as interlocking teeth, and even when held close to the stand it will slowly fall down over the course of 10-15 minutes. It's pretty much useless for anything but lightweight mics. Steer clear of this for heavier equipment.	-1
Legs are too short to support a heavy mic when the arm is extended sideways. With a heavy mic you are restricted to a short arm, and even then it will fall easily.	-1
It says it's a microphone stand. So why is there nothing on it that will hold a microphone?  Silly me	-1
Listen, this thing is cheap.  When you need a stand, NOW, and you need it cheap, buy this one and it will, for the most part, hold your microphone up. Problem is, it's really, really light duty.  I use this stand next to a Tama MS205, one of the great microphone stands I've ever used.  This one is just not even close in comparison.  It's too light, it isn't inherently stable, you have to really crank down the fasteners to keep them from being too lose.  For in-studio use, this might be OK, but if you need it to stay put, spend the extra money and get a more heavy-duty stand.	-1
Ok enough for band practice in the basement, but not a very sturdy stand for gigging out.  This particular one I got had a loose peg end that connected to the boom for the purpose of tightening the boom.  Apparently after a gig during tear down, the end fell off and the peg came out.  So now I have to find some long thin object that fits in the hole (such as a screwdriver) to tighten the boom.	-1
Not sturdy fell a few times cheap quality i guess you get what you pay for  if you need an emergency stand i guess you can buy	-1
The screw which allows adjustment of the angled boom stripped out within 2 months of light use. Simply not worth the cost of manufacturing. Definitely not reliable for gigging or studio use at all.	-1
I hate this stand.  It's advertised as having a telescoping boom, when in fact it actually has a sliding boom.  The product description is a lie.	-1
I bought this after seeing all of the good reviews. Went to tighten the boom knob and the knob and fitting disintegrated into a dozen pieces. My crummy product may have been a fluke. Seller replaced right away, but the recording session had to be rescheduled and that cost time and money that cannot be recovered.	-1
I second another reviewers' thoughts that these are of inconsistent quality. The one I got will not tighten down enough on the boom clutch. There's just no friction and the boom arm will not hold any weight at all. Basically useless. I guess that's why it costs $23. Save your money.	-1
Very disappointed.  Purchased 2. Just set it up for a Christmas party and the stainless rod with 2 balls that is the main adjustment had a ball fall off.  I assumed it just needed to be screwed on and found that it was not threaded.  I am shipping it back. Thinking about returning them both.  Wish I would have invested in something more durable.	-1
No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included.  The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item.  There's no instruction (which is fine). But in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it. I bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I can't because it doesn't come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping.  The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip.  But without it, I felt cheated.	-1
Arrived 3 days after I ordered it, the bent welding should've clued me to what would happen. 2nd time I tuned it the inferior quality tension bolts started stripping, making the macho (small drum) useless. Mostly good materials (oak, steel, rawhide) + terrible craftmanship = drum being returned. Lay down another $30 and get some Aspires, I've gotten 2 sets of those (1 for me, 1 as a gift) and they won't let you down, or you might want to check out similarly priced bongos from Meinl, Gon Bops or Tycoon, but avoid this hunk a junk.	-1
The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. NOPE. This pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. AVOID.	-1
I thought I would try these picks - I tried the Delrin first and they are good in that they are consistent out of the pack. The problem was that they wear out quickly, especially the medium or light ones (I am quite happy with the Delrin jazz picks though . They wear down but actually quite nicely). So I thought I would try these Duralin medium and light picks because they were supposed to be more durable. However they seem to warp easily. This is not good because there is no way to finesse your up to sound the same as your down.	-1
no good, doesnt fit my size 10 left ring finger, cant use it. you can have mine free	-1
I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out.	-1
although they look cool, they soung like crap. The tones are dull and the fingers do not slide very easily across the strings. I hope this review helps..	-1
You're not missing much if you skip out on these strings. The one's I ordered came in the mail with the package opened on the inside,like someone took out the B string for some reason and stuffed it back in the box. It didn't sound as bright as the other string's. I can accept that it was a shipping error,but other than that it didn't take very long for the brighter string's to dull down in tone. Plus,it took just as short of an amount of time for the black finish to wear off the string's. This is just my personal experience,and it wasn't a good one. If the novelty of colored string's interest you,by all mean's consider other string set's first. For brightness,I'd recommend D'Adarrio Pro Steel's or Rotosound's. Much better value,in my opinion.	-1
Update: Nope. I am a big fan of other DR strings, mainly low riders. These are just not worth it. The grounding issue renders them useless without some kind of wire harness to ground them to your body, which I have done, and it works, but is a pain in the rear. Do you want to tie and untie a wire from your wrist every time you put the bass down? I don't. The older coating from 10 years back or so did not have this issue. And even when plugged into my high end gear, I'll still get an electric pop or 2 if I don't run a wire ground, rendering tracks I record useless, I prefer to play tracks all the way thru with no punch ins. Beyond that, the tone and feel just isn't the same as the old coated strings. Frankly, these suck for passive basses that require a body contact ground. 2 stars for staying in tune like DR's always do for me, but I'm going back to low riders. Might try nickel low riders for kicks.  Original review: Hmm. I am a big fan of DR strings but I'm not digging these so far. I used to use the peacock blue coated strings many years ago, I really liked them, the coating seemed smoother and more comfortable on fretting fingers, and I don't recall the "non grounding" issue with those older strings. This coating does prevent your fingers from fully grounding the bass (the hum does get cut a little, not all the way), which is an issue on the cheaper practice amps I have around the house and studio. I haven't used it for recording yet but through my DAW interface I don't notice much hum. If I had tape wound strings that have the same issue, we will see how that works out. I believe the older coated strings were also based on low riders, where as these are based on highbeams. Maybe I just like the feel of low riders better. Anyway, I'm surprised at how rough they feel on the fretting hand even with the coating. Not a big deal, but surprising. The sound is still bright and new after a couple weeks, so that's nice, the coating does seem to keep the strings sounding fresh longer, although I do like a more broken-in sound overall. I don't play a ton of bass so I assume if I played it more they would break-in, and as any experienced recorder knows, it's easy to dial out brightness, but it's tough to add it back in if you want to it, so this isn't really a big problem. The jury still out for me, at this point I'm lukewarm, if I change either way I will update my review.	-1
Stiff...course feel....not as smooth as the chromes....I forgot why I stop using them.	-1
I purchased the Gator 12u standard rack case. I am not very satisfied with the quality. I think OSP makes a much better case. This one seemed like it was made out of cheap material. I returned to for a OSP SC12U-20 (spend a couple extra bucks for the shock absorbing foamyou will be glad you did).	-1
Arrived with missing parts had to return	-1
Very flaky intonation with these strings, couldn't get any of my guitars to stay in tune with these. Loved the way they felt, loved the way they sounded, hated the way they intonated and keeping any guitar strung with these was a pain in the neck. I tried for a year, multiple batches, I won't spend money on DRs again. I went with GHS Nickel strings and haven't had any problems.	-1
disappointed one of the strings only lasted one performance. The G-string pop in the middle of a performance. I had just changed the strings.	-1
GHS has a good brand reputation, so I wanted to try these on my P bass. The strings are smooth, and do have a clean, "precision" look to them. I strung them through the body, and still found an issue with the E string. As others have said, it is indeed too long for a Fender-style headstock. I didn't think it would affect the sound, but it did. On the E string, the Open E through G are obviously dampened. The notes past that aren't affected too much, but it's enough of a problem for me to decide to go ahead, after a week, to replace them. $30-something down the drain. Too bad we can't return bass strings.	-1
I had round rounds on my 08 Am Std J Bass. Thought I'd try some flats. Turns out, the tension of these GHS strings must be a LOT higher than my rounds because when I put them on and tuned to pitch I thought the neck would snap. The action went so high the bass was unplayable. I quickly pulled them off and put the rounds back on. I would have sent them back but now they are used so I'm burnt. Research the tension you need because these could damage your bass if you're not careful.	-1
The packaging states these strings are appropriate for a 34-35" scale bass. These are not long scale strings.  These are extra long scale, and too long for my 34" scale SR bass.  The color protector on the string ends is not long enough, winding bare metal on the G string.  Also, the winding is excessive, and I am concerned the E string is going to pop off due to winding and winding the thick string (no wire cutter handy and the pliers I always use to cut strings does not work on these strings). The G string's tension is so tight on the otherwise low tension set, that I consider this set not even playable. Will try to return to Amazon, may be a defective set as far as tension.  Do not suggest buying for your 34" scale bass.	-1
I don't get it. People rave about these strings. I've played bass for 30 years. I love flats. TI flats are great. GHS also are great. Why? Because they sound good and are designed well. Why are we writing D'Addario a pass on the Chromes. The thread issue is a big problem. Any string that has to be "modded" to fit through any part of a Fender bridge is a very poorly designed string. Why are we making excuses? I love D'Addario strings for electric guitar. I use them all the time in my shop. Check out the pic of how the string sits on this USA Fender. Inexcusable. Makes it impossible to set up the instrument. That D string in my pic, btw, is a GHS. Used it because the brand new Chrome D broke at the tuning peg well before reaching pitch.	-1
I'm a big fan of D'Addario bass strings. I have Nickel Rounds on my P-Bass and Flatwound Chromes on my Jazz. I bought this set to replace the tapewound flats that came on my Violin Bass. Violin basses are shortscale and naturally thumpy, so I bought these hoping to brighten things up a bit.  I was disappointed in the tone because it was so dark and thumpy. I don't know if I received a defective set but they were only slightly brighter than the tapewounds I replaced. The strings also felt rougher than my Nickel Rounds. They're definitely quieter in terms of finger noise but the nickels were surprisingly easier to slide on.  At first I thought maybe Violin Basses would have this tone no matter what strings I used. To check this I replaced the half rounds with some Chromes, and what a change it made! It really made the bass sing. They were warm and mellow but still had enough brightness. The Chromes had better sustain, increased output and really made the pickups sound good.  I don't think I'll try half rounds again. If I want something with a lot of punch to really cut through I'll get rounds. Otherwise I'll stick with D'Addario Chromes. Even though they are flats, they're incredibly versatile. They work with a lot of different styles and have a much greater range than these half rounds.	-1
installed these set and they feel and sound great. Except for the smallest string, the G string is bad, it doesnt sound like the rest of the strings. Kind of muted or dim, no sustain of whatsoever, just bad tone,. i removed just this one string and replaced it with the old one. Now im playing with 3 new halfround strings and an old full round G string. Much better. This set could have been 5 stars if not for that bad small string.	-1
Was to short and no pick pocket	-1
tyhe pick does not stay in pocket	-1
When my pedal is off my guitar is very quiet and fuzzed but makes no sound when the pedal is on. Didn't last for very long. Must of gotten burned out or something?	-1
it powers up,no sound	-1
It's HUM HUM like HELL, can't use it, waste money on it.	-1
Not very comfortable. Looks cheap. Don't recommend.	-1
I got this pedal for $10 used and tried it with a tube amp. The tone is good at the low end but diminishes after 1 or 2'oclock. There is a ton of gain with the pedal and turning the gain down and adjusting the tone to taste was the only way I didn't get total tone loss with a Telecaster and Les Paul. Turn the gain all the way up and low end diminishes. It sounded like a Line 6 modeling amp with the metal settings on high.  This pedal is cheap and may work better on a solid state amp, I never tried it. Some of Danelectro's pedals are gimmicky. I own the distortion and the echo pedals which are good for what they are, but this one misses it's mark for me.	-1
As other reviewers said, Cheap nylon strap that does not hold the guitar, but will like hold luggage fine..  No string, holes too stiff, too short, very stiff nylon/plastic that cuts into your body and left black marks on my new spruce/ maple guitar.  It fell off the guitar playing for about 10 minutes and my guitar is light!  Even for $7 is's going back.	-1
This strap is just to small.  You get what you pay for.  I gave it away as an inexpensive Christmas present.	-1
ok	-1
The seatbelt material is so smooth that it has almost no friction.  The result is you have to spend time and energy keeping your guitar in front of you.  Let go of your guitar for a half second and the neck slides down to the ground.  Someone below wrote they liked being able to move their guitar all around and found other straps caused the guitar to cling.  I'm the opposite.  I like a well balanced guitar with a strap that holds it in place so I can get to work.	-1
it doesn't come with the strap that ties up the neck of the guitar	-1
I normally use D'Addario EXL-125 strings, but one of my guitars is a replica Hentor Sportscaster - the famed hot-rodded Strat that was the #1 guitar Alex Lifeson of Rush used in the 80s. Even though I've had good luck with the EXL-125's, I learned that Lifeson used these strings in these gauges on the original Sportscaster, so I decided to give them a try just for the heck of it, and in the spirit of seeing if I could get the replica to sound more accurate.  At the end of the day, I can't tell a really big difference in sound between these and the D'Addarios.  But the Blue Steels break *way* easier than the EXL-125's - and I don't break strings in normal changing and playing. I can't remember the last time I broke a string playing out. These broke just stretching them after putting them on. Now, I break the occasional G, B, or high E when stretching, even D'Addarios, but even being extra-careful with the Blue Steels, I broke a brand new B while stretching after changing strings, and then broke the B out of the NEXT pack I opened to replace it. So I used all three packs I bought in one string change.  So these strings are great if you have a guitar tech and a Dean Markley endorsement and you get as many packs as you want for free, because eventually you'll get a set of them on a guitar without breaking, but for the guitarist on a budget or the stereotypical "starving artist," I find that the D'Addario EXL-125's sound almost exactly the same and stand up to normal usage a lot better.	-1
Ends were too stiff to fit over the buttons on my guitar. I had to return it.	-1
I wanted to try these strings out on my Les Paul Special.  I wanted to try a lighter string as some have told me that my guitar is hard to play.  I also play acoustic guitar so I am used to more resistance in the strings.  I tried lighter strings on an acoustic and they were bright and shiny, but lacked the volume and sustain.  I might have expected something similar from these, but what I found was a complete lack of soul, tone, character, anything.  I guess if there is anything positive to say, it would be that they are easy to bend, but lack character even in bends.	-1
nice	-1
I've been using Blue Steel strings for more almost two decades. They've always had the best tone, according to my own ears/tastes, and they've always lasted far longer than other strings. When I lived in FL, this was especially important as between the sweat from my hands and the humidity that crushes human beings on daily basis, normal strings would corrode, even rust in less than a week, even with me doing my best to keep them dry/clean. Blue Steels would last a couple of weeks if we weren't practicing regular, and about a week if we were prepping for a gig. In all those years, I've had maybe two E strings break on me, and if I remember correctly, that was waaaay back when I used Floyd Rose tremolo bridges.  Ordered my first new pair of strings since I had John Bolin do a fantastic setup/custom tuning on my favorite Jackson. The first four strings went on without a hitch, but the B string just snapped in half with barely any tension on it. It surprised me and my roommate, who was changing his strings as well (his weren't BS's, he tried the Drop-C DDT's). I shrugged and said, meh, whatever, it happens sometimes. I popped on another B from a brand new set of DR's that were the same size as my BS's, then began to tune again.  With barely any tension on the high E, it too snapped. It isn't like I've never changed strings (again, almost twenty years of doing it very regularly), so I know it wasn't my fault. I MIGHT have decided I'd done something wrong when the first string broke (in fact, I did, I've broken strings before). But when the second one did the same thing, again, with barely any tension, I got pretty angry.  Since I was right in the middle of changing out strings on three different guitars, I wasn't in the mood to remove all the BS strings and replace with those from the DR set. So now I've got a 4-string DR set, and a 4-2 BS-DR mix on the Jackson.  Overall, I'm very disappointed. I'm extremely forgiving of a product having a defect once in a while, and guitar strings can be delicate creatures. But two strings from the same package with barely any tension seems like a QC issue. I'll have to think very hard about whether or not I'll buy BS strings in the future, as this has soured me for a while, not to mention I'm simply in love with my DR DDT strings.	-1
Bad quality.	-1
Well, I can't give it any higher review as they were corroded or rusted right out of the package. I tried to clean them, but it didn't work. I put them on anyway since I was curious about the cryogenic steel. They seem to accentuate the highs and lows, and are harder on the fingers as others have said. I had a set of Dean Markley Helix strings I was going to put on to replace the Blue Steel  but when I opened the package, they were corroded as well. Both boxes were still sealed before opening.	-1
Did not attach on the guitar.	-1
This is one of the best sounding strings on the market. The problem is, with 5 sets, the high "e" string broke when tuning. The string does not brake, it uncoils at the ball end, really strange. This happened with 4 sets when tuning, and with 1 set after a while playing.	-1
This is my first guitar belt, it is not a good fit, the connection to the guitar is far too thick, I try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage.  Other than that it is usable, sort of, but I am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead, the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with.	-1
The strap was everything it claimed to be but; I found it very uncomfortable to wear.  I finally broke down and bought one made from cotton, it is much more comfortable. Incidentally the color is stated as blue; but anywhere other than in the brightest light it may as well be black.	-1
Cheap crappy strap. It's too stiff, not comfortable at all. I regret purchasing this... Save your money, go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar. They are expensive but worth it.	-1
This is more of an army green than a tan.  The great thing about Amazon is that they make it very easy to return something if you don't like it.  I have one of these in black for my other guitar and it is a nice solid strap with a good price.  I'm not into fancy straps or straps with a guitar mfg. name on them.  It's the guitar that counts, not the strap.	-1
I'm probably going to return this.  How can they advertise a pick pocket and then send one that has none?  The strap is uncomfortable and pretty slippery.  I tried going the low-cost route and this outcome has failed.	-1
If you are above average height it might be too short (even whet it is fully extended), otherwise decent quality for a price.	-1
I don't like the way in which the switch on the device works. It sort a DOESN'T work. Once ypu plug-in to an outlet...It's ON! No in between. Not manufactured very well in my humble opinion.	-1
In my case, induced massive distortion and amp oscillation. Almost destroyed some speakers.	-1
I have no idea how to use it, and there are no directions explaining it.	-1
I have 1/4" TRS cable going into the input. I have XLR coming out of the output. Both -20 decibel attenuation switches are absolutely in the off position.  The volume level is lowered by a lot with this thing. Too much, in my opinion.  If I go straight into my powered speaker from the music source without this box connected, the sound level is much louder.  Yes, I detect less noise, if you will, when the box is utilized...but perhaps that is just because the box naturally drops the volume level as the signal is passing through it.  And again, the two attenuation switches are off. This box has the capability to attenuate the signal either -20 or -40 decibels by either pressing in one or two of the attenuation switches.  I doubt the box is defective. I think it was just designed to lower the decibel level automatically by default. Now, I guess if you have a powered speaker with enough headroom to make up for the volume drop, and if you do not mind running your speaker's volume knob much higher than normal, this natural volume drop via the box might not be an issue for you.  For example: Without the box I get great loudness from my powered speaker with its volume knob at its eleven o'clock position. With the box connected I have to turn the speaker's volume dial closer to the 3 o'clock position to get the same volume level. (Its maximum position is 5 o'clock, just for reference). This is way-too-big of a decrease of the sound level with this box connected.  I also find the clarity of the sound a bit muddied when going through this box. And it is to a point where as a DJ this would be unacceptable...and that means I cannot use this box.  The only positive thing I found with the box is that it did successfully eliminate the ground hum when I tested that feature specifically.	-1
Honestly, I read some reviews that said this ligature won't "stay down," and I should have believed them.  I tried it anyway, because I used to have a Bonade ligature, and I am experimenting a bit with my equipment.  So...I tried this one on two mouthpieces with a half dozen reeds, and it was completely frustrating.  It will not stay in place.  No matter how tight I screwed both screws (and they really shouldn't be so tight to begin with) it would slip upwards ...way upwards...and move the reed.  My mouthpieces are normal...I have a Reserve X5 and several Grabner mouthpieces....in my entire clarinet "career" I have never had a ligature do this.	-1
Well  just about every XLR cable that I have bought  on Amazon has either stopped working after a few uses or hums, making the cables unusable...and not just Audio-Technica...I have Planet Wave and GLS cables too that have doe the same thing too. I love Amazon but feel totally ripped off!	-1
Ends are very loose and came apart. Poor quality. No more bargains for me. We gig way too much for that	-1
As others have said this is NOT a Martin product. I also followed the directions, wet it, wrung it out and still got a drop of water leaking out of it onto the guitar. Pass this up for another solution.	-1
I have to agree with other posters - this works OK, but it is NOT a Martin product and Amazon should stop listing it as such. Amazon claims it is a "Martin Guitar Humidifier by Martin", despite complaints going back over 1 year that point out the discrepancy in the manufacturer listed. Time will tell how well it holds up, but it is frustrating that there appears to be no attempt by Amazon to rectify the misleading information listed, or actually ship the product that was advertised.	-1
the padded part left black marks on the neck of my natural colored Les Paul and my white schecter. i was able to sand and buff them off, but forget that, it's not cool at all to have a hanger damage the guitar!!! what's the point??  I traded to the string swing 3 months ago and it doesn't leave any marks on their necks like this thing did in a few weeks. Plus the string swing feels sturdier holding an LP custom and was half the price and Made in USA, not china. I found out String Swing is the brand SamAsh chooses to hold their guitars and amps  skip this, get 2 of the string swing.	-1
Saw these and thought I'd give them a try.  Not for me.	-1
I wanted a good thumb pick for fingerstyle playing and I agree with some of the other reviewers that these things feel like torture - way too snug fitting and I definitely wouldn't say I have massive thumbs. I think they will give some over time and use so not a complete loss.  Overall though I think the quality of the pick isn't that great either so I will be looking for an alternative.	-1
I don't even know what these other people got. They can't be talking about the picks I received. these are inconsistent, all heavy and the colors are from a 50's circus, but each is a different thickness, stiffness, and tonal character....they fit like low level torture devices, except for the one that just spins around and flies off every time you touch a string.  The others nearly draw blood, leaves cut impression in your skin, the pick angle is just plain off, and the material sounds very marginal hitting strings.  I can't say I like them as well as any other brand I've used; in fact much much worse.  Get a dozen decent picks for the price of this garbage bag of 3.	-1
Too hard!	-1
I have small fingers and these mediums are very tight. I also think the "pick" portion is a little long and the plastic too hard.	-1
Way too small to be useful. Maybe OK for children or adults with very thin fingers. Buy largest size available if at all and hope for the best.	-1
I've been testing out various thumbpicks to accent my fingerpicking style.  This particular version falls short for a couple reasons, the first being that the "Large" size is still too tight for someone with large, manly hands.  :)  Second, the stiffness of this design leaves little room for play or dynamics while picking.  Third, the length of the pick is just a bit too long, getting in the way of having a natural fingerstyle experience.	-1
It says in the description good for keyboard players...the extention is short and I can't use it for practice or stage. Be sure to measure for your needs:)	-1
I ended up buying what seems to be a bootleg. buyer beware of receiving mounts not related to that of the image. I contacted and will change review if I get a more expected product; but, my stand was different than the image. So Until then, kinda false advertising. And if this is official, it should not bend and crack at the base. Very poor design.	-1
Not that great because it is not well balanced.  If you don't use a sturdy tripod base stand, a heavier mic on this little boom will cause a round base stand practically tip over, which means you can't extend the boom and have to keep it at less than 45 degree angle.	-1
This mic extension does everything I need, except for the most important thing - clamp at a 90 degree angle.  The teeth in the clamp do not permit it to be clamped at 90 degrees, which makes it of only very limited usefulness to me.  Wouldn't you think that would be something they'd make sure it does?	-1
The female 5/8 socket is not properly threaded and will strip your stand mounts.  Possibly a serious manufacturing problem w/ On Stage because I also bought On Stage MY320 and MY325 mic clips, and the MY320 has the same incorrect thread spacing while the MY325 does not.  Also, the boom extension adjustment screw is welded on crooked, not lined up with the Posi-Lok tilt adjustment knob.  Not a big issue, but is very noticable when setting up or looking past a mic and down the boom.  note: I tested the fittings with various equipment, and am positive that the female 5/8 thread on this (and the MY320 mic clip) is bad.  Stupid thing is that the male 5/8 screw on this is threaded fine.	-1
Neck came apart and broke after 2 or 3 weeks.	-1
Guitar looks and sound ok, but cheap hardware made it break in less the 2 months. The nut on it broke and my student  ended up needing to take 2 months off of guitar class trying to find somewhere to get it fixed. Not worth the $30 you save. Go ahead and buy a better one!!!!!! BE WARE!!	-1
I've try bending this mount several different ways and it just seems to hang the violin by the bottom most tuning peg, though maybe that's the design. The bow holder again does its job but kind of points the bow out at am awkward angle. Since finding the sweet spot where it holds the instrument I had to close the holder so much I must turn the violin to get it in. I can hear the strings ring as it must be slightly wedged. Again it does its job but the must be a better way	-1
I've two of these stands. On one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. Mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor! UPDATE: 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND. BEWARE! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................China. That may explain why it failed, but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it. I guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. Well, that's his policy. That's okay, he's got competition, and I'll be purchasing from them instead.	-1
these things are crap.   the sound is very quite. I wouldn't recommend this at all.	-1
Over my 16 years playing music I have wasted a lot of money and made poor decisions when buying equipment, but no single item stands out more than this one, by far the worst investment ever. These rubber feet will only work if you have a very delicate touch on your drums, they fumble even at moderate playing and I don't know what people play out there but in my world "Latin Percussion" is played rather hard and with confidence, whether miked or not. Another problem, not LP's fault, is that 100% of people out there when they grab your drum, ignore or don't know how these feet work and would drag the drum or move it in a circle as you normally would, and there goes the feet all out of place or even popping out of the rim. Trust me folks, whenever I have used these I have spent more time repositioning them, bending my back and lifting heavy drums, and trying to come up with a perfect spacing that just isn't possible. Do me a favor, if you want stability, keep them on the floor or better yet buy a sitting metal stand.	-1
Too Light Weight for me.	-1
If this did nothing more than consistently mix volume levels this device would be of value.  However, as noted by other reviewers, it sometimes actually LOWERS volume levels and reduces tone levels.  Here are my experiences:  * Despite being powered by a 9v battery, it doesn't seem to work with condenser mics at all. * I tried to use it to moderate the volume (or even increase it, considering it's powered) of my passive-pickup classical guitar.  While it sent the signal through and did control the volume (to an extent), it actually lowered the overall guitar volume and clarity.  The guitar actually performed better when jacked straight into the amp. * Hooking up a self-powered condenser mic to this unit resulted in distortion and "clipped" sound. * Several users report hooking this up to a stereo output results in one of the channels being cut.  That's inexcusably bad design.  Although advertised as a mono unit-- it should still play the same sound through both channels.  This one flaw alone places this unit on the Z list of equipment.  So basically, all this is good for is... uh.. well, I can't think of anything it would be good for on a practical basis.  Using a non-condenser mic and standard electric guitar?  (dunno, I don't own one).  Whatever, it is extremely limited in function and even when it does work, it tends to lower and distort the original signal.  I rarely compare one product with another, but to be perfectly honest the Behringer 302 or 502 mini-mixer-- although more than double the cost-- is greatly superior to this unit and would be worth the extra money, since both models serve as preamps and have phantom power supply.  Significantly more versatile than this unit-- which doesn't even perform the limited function it's supposed to perform.  It's a shame.  If this unit actually worked as a versatile mini-mixer, the portability would make it very useful for street performers.  As its stands, I honestly don't know why they even produced the thing.  I had high hopes for this device, but I'm sorry to say the low reviews on this product are accurate.  Believe the negative reviews.  This is a poorly-designed, badly-performing product. As with many others here-- I'm still looking for a decent, basic-function battery-powered mini-mixer.  We don't need much; plug in three or four devices, individual volume controls (tone would be nice but not essential), preamp the output, provide phantom power for condenser mikes.  If no one in the USA can seem to do this, anyone in CHINA listening?  ;D	-1
Garbage. First unit didn't work. Second is super noisy. Output is in mono, so if you attach headphones to it it'll just play out of one side. The adapters to fix this on Amazon were all crap. Don't waste your time. Just get something decent. You bum!	-1
I mean, hey, it's a four channel mixer.  If it mixes well, you gotta give it 5 stars. If it doesn't, then why keep and what else can you give it but 1 star?  I wanted a battery powered mixer that I could use at farmers' markets. Unfortunately, this mixer introduced hum into the system, so I sent it back.  Still looking for a simple battery powered mixer.	-1
well, it mixes the sound.  Unfortunately, it sounds bad after it's mixed.  There is no bass response.  I have an older version of this mixer, same model but looks a little different.  The older one sounds much better.  I may try to send this one back and get a replacement to see if this one is just defective	-1
Wow!! Saw the reviews, and was glad to order this device. The situation is that I am running a Yamaha Motif Xf8 while controlling VB3 (via a VST player called Cantabile. Nice job guys! Great interface)from my laptop in a live scenario playing for about 1,000 people at a time. I struggled to get an even mix using the Motif Inputs to receive a good signal from my Berringer UCA202 (a fine sounding little monster, if I must say so). So, I thought I would get a yamaha submixer and just balance it from a little mixer board, so I wouldn't spend a bunch of time trying to get a stable signal from my laptop through the Motif Xf inputs. Along comes this device showing up for about the cost of the Berringer UCA202. The reviews were great! It looked small and compact, and I wouldn't need another power cord for a sub mixer. Got the item. What a piece of crap!! The knobs, to begin with, did not turn smoothly. (two of them by the way. They felt like they were having some resistance to movement, badly) Oh well, no biggy. It looks like something you would build out of the '70's from Radioshack. (Yes I saw the pictures before I bought it. I know, but it was much more dorky when it arrived). None of that really mattered to me at all. All I cared about was the functionality of it, because it would sit on the floor by my keyboard while I performed. So I plugged it in, and got right to work balancing a decent signal to send to the soundman. It clips like crazy!! The peak indicator (means it's clipping. That bugs the heck out of me, and I won't stand for it), lights up when there is the slightest variation in volume (velocity change for piano or swell for the B3 Organ). VB3 is a fat, rich sounding Softsynth organ created, not from samples, but from the genuine sound architecture of the original Hammond products using pure tones and effects (Thanks Guido from Italy! You are awesome!!). Alright, so I will turn down my gear. It resulted in sending a weak signal even with the master up considerably. Okay, so I will increase the channel volume, since I don't want a hot signal from my gear to cause distortion. No go. Clips again. I'm not done working with this garbage. I don't give up that easily. I just have to say, that the hardware is not good, and the signal routing/handling is sketchy at best. I know that this would not be the case had I purchased what I was originally intending. I will pay the other 40 bucks for a real piece of hardware. Maybe I'll have a better update later. For now, I am very disappointed. Sorry Nady, but I say NOdee.  Update: My son just educated me on the rating issue. When people's good reviews include the term "...for the price" it means "better than I thought for a cheap piece of junk."	-1
Very cheaply made. I am sorry I bought them. I would not recommend them to anyone. I am ordering some other bags from a competitor and for around the same price.	-1
I have owned bags made by Beato in the past (1990's) and I still have them around!!! However these are nothing like those ones!!!!!  I have had these less than 6 months and already there is a rip in one bag and several holes caused by minor scratches in the others.  These are thin and weak little bags. there is no padding, insulation or anything resembling a second layer inside. Needless to say I pack my drums into these approximately one times a week for 4-6 months (to bring them to church and back) and these are not the protection for my drum I thought they would be.  These cases are little more than simply putting a handle on each of your drums to make them easier to carry.  if something bumps up against your drums while in these cases make no mistake it will still leave a nice scratch or dent on the drum inside. I dunno, for the price I just thought they'd be made of a little stronger stuff.	-1
Very light weight, almost no protection except from dust. Great for storing an extra kit. But invest a little more for travel cases or bags.	-1
I read both the good and bad reviews and decided to take a chance on these.  In the end, these bags were made even more cheaply than I initially expected, and that is taking into account I paid only ~$50-60 for the whole set. They are nylon, but not in the fabric sense, in the "these are pretty much oversized shower caps" sense of a nylon product. That is the main distinction I would make. They are very thin and hardly protect drums from scratches or bumps. Two of them are already ripped from sliding them into my truck. They are a little bit of a hassle to get on the drums, too. It's almost better to leave them off and not trick your brain into thinking the drums are protected as you carry and pack them into the car.  On another note, Beato makes a higher tier of drum bags that are fairly decent. My friend has them, and although they are ripping in some areas, they have withstood years of abuse. I was naive in thinking I was getting a "slightly" cheaper version of his drum bags when I ordered these.	-1
Just okay quality...replaced them with Gator cases.	-1
Fair	-1
I wouldn't give these to my little kids to practice on	-1
A waste of money. These are more of a kids to. You can never learn the proper ues techniques with these. A couple of them went dead right from the box. I only got them for the case.	-1
I needed them as a reference to see which keys i wanted to buy.... They sound terrible and it hurts my little lung to blow them. and i been practicin. On guess what? A much higher quality Hohner!! So i think Hohner should step it up cuz im about to buy a D harmonica from you and its 45 DOLLARS! thats a lot compared to this set.. so like i always say You Gotta Pay The Cost To Be The Boss	-1
Junk.  Someone else said, "good for the case".  That's about it.  The instruments are the poorest quality.  Hard to blow.  Some notes don't work at all.  A friend once said, "you get what you pay for and then hardly ever".  I should have learned by now.  I will use the case.	-1
The case is nice, but the harmonica's have a lot to be desired, they are cheap, but so is the price, so what should I expect. They lack tone quality.	-1
These are pretty cheap-o.  About 1/3 of them have reeds that don't work.  Too cheap to waste my time to send back.	-1
I should have realized that, given the low price, these were low quality instruments. Some of the reeds did not produce sound, for instance. Igifted them to my grandkids because they are really more toy-like.	-1
Terrible, cheap, wheezy harmonicas.  They are difficult to play and probably take twice as much wind as a better quality harmonica.  If you are a beginner, you will be quickly discouraged by these harmonicas.  About the only thing they might be good for is keeping in the car to grab and see what key some blues song on the radio is in.  And that's only if you've been eating peanuts and don't want to ruin a real harmonica.  If you want an inexpensive harmonica of decent quality, try the Hohner Blues Bender, or, better yet, the Blue Midnight Line (gig-worthy quality for a very reasonable price).	-1
Opened the package and it smelled like cigarette smoke.  I've left the case open to air out for 3 months now and it still stinks.	-1
This set could have been great. The price is excellent, the harmonicas are well-packaged and look sharp. They seem to play OK, as far as I can tell -- but the thing is, I can't tell much, because I can't use them. They have a horrible, noxious, chemical, oily smell and taste, and when playing, you breathe that stuff right in. In my case, it makes my lungs feel a burning sensation.  I left them open to the air, hoping they'd off-gas, but so far they have not, and so to me they are unplayable. Maybe I should return them since I am not able to use them, but I keep hoping the problem will go away and I'll get to enjoy them eventually.	-1
I bought this for the case, but the one I received is not what is shown in the product photo.  However, it works for me as it matches another hohner case I have. Mine came in the case shown here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GF9AS6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1  I was going to give these to a kids charity but I decided to try the Bb harp when my Marine Band Bb developed a bad reed. So now that I tried the actual harmonicas, I have to downgrade my rating to 1 star. The volume of these harps is about half that of a "real" harmonica. They feel very cheap when you play them. And on the one I tried, the 3 hole made no sound at all.  The volume difference between draws and blows is significant, and the volume differences from hole to hole are also noticeable. This harmonica is not suitable as a musical instrument. These not only look like toys, they ARE toys, plastic made in china. Literally non-playable junk when brand new. Don't buy these unless you plan to throw the harmonicas in the garbage and just want the case.  If you are just starting out but don't have much cash, I'd recommend just getting 1 higher quality C harmonica.	-1
These are horrible. They lasted about a week before they went dead and they sound like someone playing a banjo with screws. If you are not a serious player get the 80/20 and save a dollar or two. If you are serious about guitar spend the extra 50 cents and get some d addarios	-1
I purchased this set because I'm a beginner. Bad mistake. They are not very good quality and have dead reeds. It's difficult to learn on an instrument that doesn't work well. I contacted Hohner and they offered to fix them, if I "paid" to return them. I wasn't willing to spend more money on a poor product. The Piedmont Blues set is manufactured in China. To top it off, they taste bad. For the money, you'd be better off buying a Hohner Special 20, Key of C instead. That's what I did. The Special 20 is manufactured in Germany. The Hohner Special 20 is about the same price and works well right out of the box. I recommend buying one good harmonica instead of 7 poor quality harmonicas. You get what you pay for. Get the Special 20. http://youtu.be/Z4irOcohieg	-1
Played the 1st one out of the box and 2 notes did not even work. Do not waste your money.	-1
Disappointing; was looking for to receiving these. But; mostly they are unplayable. Leak air badly. Easier learning bagpipes than these things. Save your money and get some harps that actually work. Decent case though.	-1
My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps.  I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings.  These harps have no volume.  Don't waste your money on them.  I guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.  5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle, well I take that back.  There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat.  I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it.  With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside.	-1
Good company to do business with, but don't buy the string unless you plan on replacing them in 2 weeks.	-1
I can't believe this is marketed to people who want to learn to play. Terrible sound, leaks air everywhere, weighs about half as much as the nearly as cheap $8.00 Chinese made Blues Band or the Old Standby. Don't waste your money on any of them. You will never play it long enough to learn anything. They take too much air to play, lose notes, and sound cheap. Piedmont is the worst. If you even THINK you might want to learn, spend the $35.00 +/-, and get a good one. Blues Band MS, Marine Band, or Special 20. These are pro models and sound much better, very nice tones. They take less air to play also. Those cheap ones are cheap for a reason. Kids toys. P.S. Don't buy a used one. You don't want to put a stranger's spit in your mouth, do you?	-1
I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.	-1
they don't last long found myself starting my own collection of different harmonicas after about a week of using these so just spare a little more money to buy a better one may seem like a good idea at first but you'll realize all you bought was a case	-1
When I first started to learn harp, I saw these and bought them. I figured, Hey, most of all the keys are used are in the case, so that will save me some money. I found out that the harps are cheap plastic ones, made in China. Yes, they have the Hohner name on them, but these are made in China, not Germany. Not everything made in China is bad, but I feel that when you are a beginner on harp, you need to find a good quality harp, like a Hohner Special 20 or a Crossover or mayby a Lee Oskar, in the key of C, then branch out into other keys. A beginner and pro alike needs a good solid quality harp, one that is airtight, and makes bending easier,which these harps do not. All in all, I would not recommend these harps. The only thing that is worth the money is the nice case they come in. Spend your money on one good harp, and if you want to buy these, give them away to kids to play with.	-1
Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two "D" strings, instead of two "E" strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again.	-1
Cheap toy.  Low volume and low quality tone.  Cheap, lightweight plastic.  Requires more wind than a normal harmonica.  If you have ANY experience playing harmonicas or are a musician in ANY capacity spend the money for a better set.  If you are looking for a toy for a child to play with you found it.	-1
I ordered one of these because I was looking for an inexpensive banjo to learn on.  Because of the great reviews and the price, I jumped on this one, which was being sold by Austin Bazaar.  The order was supposed to arrive within 10 days or so.  However, after 8 days my order still said "Shipping Soon".  I contacted the seller and was told that the banjo was actually out of stock and would not be arriving until 2-3 MONTHS later.  As a result I cancelled the order (there were no problems with the seller in doing this).  So if you order one of these be warned... just because the ad says the banjo is "in stock" doesn't mean it really is.  P.S.  I ordered a Mastercraft Player Deluxe the next day instead... the reviews are just as good, and it was shipped the day after I placed the order.  Update - after having the Mastercraft for 3 months now, I LOVE IT and would highly recommend it to someone looking for an inexpensive, quality banjo.  Sorry Oscar Schmidt... you snooze, you lose.	-1
I bought this instrument because I was helping a friend  to learn the banjo.  It looked great and didn't sound too bad until I started working my way around the neck and found it way too loose.  The slightest pressure at about the 3rd fret pulled the strings because the neck was moving. I couldn't keep it in tune and pitch is important. Also, once taking the back off, discovered an unsettling bow in the truss rod under the head. The thumb screws didn't seat the resonator back on correctly and 2 were completely stripped.  Bad construction, the manufacturer or assembler "made it fit."  I sent it back.  Save a few bucks and buy a basic Deering and you are way better off.  This one really was impossible to keep on pitch and it was unplayable.	-1
Of all the Chinese low end banjos this one seemed to have the best review so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Fist of all it was shipped fast but arrived SNAPPED IN HALF. Upset, i sent it back and got a replacement in a couple days.  I did my research and but it together quickly, but quickly ran in PROBLEMS  1. Tuners: horrible and turn back, will need to be replaced 2. Head: complete garbage even if it has a Remo stamp on it. Replace immediately with a Fiberskyn 3. Strings: again, worthless, got a new set on after one day 4. Tone: stock, is painful, but with some tweeking can be acceptable.  Overall, i made it into a decent (and barely decent) sounding banjo with about 100 dollars more invested into it. For what I paid I could have bought a used Deering Goodtime off Craiglist.  So people out there, just suck it up and BUY A DEERING or be prepared to do a lot of work to get an okay-at-best sound.  Just my 0.02  Gets two stars only because it can be made into something with work. Deserves nothing more.	-1
Sounded great at first,  but were completely dead after 4hrs of playing on them. They have almost a chalky feel to them.  Not worth the premium price.	-1
I am very disappointed. The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body. It is unusable until repaired. Update: It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (Amazon), and have not received any communication.	-1
I have purchased several of these flexible rubber mic clips and each and everyone has left me down!  After maybe a dozen uses the sides start getting loose and before you know it your mic has just fallen to the ground and has a huge dented grill! The mics used were run of the mill SM58 like mics that have never had issues since in other rubber clips. The rubber just splits near the bottom.	-1
The right side of this broke after one day of having the very base of the microphone in it. I didn't even stretch it out or anything... it just... well, it broke. I posted a pic on imgur: [...]	-1
I was using this to hold my Nady Starpower SP-1, and the clip randomly snapped in half, causing my mic to drop to the ground. I would avoid this, fine a better quality clip.	-1
I bought this on speculation and after a few tries found it no better than my standard Rovner ligature, which is far less trouble to situate on the mouthpiece.	-1
I'm not at all hard on strings.  I've got strings on some of my guitars that haven't been changed in many months, and they still sound fine.  I tried these Black Beauties because of the coating and because of the black color.  The strings do feel fine, and they do look cool on a black guitar, but they were dead sounding and projected very weakly after less than two hours playing on my black Ovation.  These are the first strings I ever had to change out because they simply stopped working and I couldn't stand to listen to them after about an hour and a half playing them.  At first they were fine, nothing outstanding, but very acceptable.  I liked them okay.  But then, as I said, they just quit on me.  Never had that happen before.  Oh yes, and the black coating started coming off in the strumming/picking area, and looked really shabby.  As I said, after less than two hours!  Maybe I just got a bad set, but I've been playing over 40 years and these were the worst strings I've ever used.  I replaced them with a set of Dean Markley lights, and the Dean Markleys still sound great (and feel great) after a good eight hours on them.  Too bad.  Had the Black Beauties worked (much) better, I'd have bought more.  Just being honest.	-1
better choices on mkt nowadays	-1
not very durable ...  mine .. the sound no longer works ...  when the sound did work it was weak and pathetic ..  must be a new model .. this is the old junker	-1
Junk. Headphone jack messed up on arrival. Tama Rhythm Watch is way better in many ways.	-1
I ordered this product on this website after seeing all the good reviews about it.  It has been used as a tuner for the past two months with no problems till today when the violin teacher wants to teach my boy how to use it as a metronome---------it just shuts itself down completely every time she pushes the "start" button.  After going through the whole user's manuel and package box, I don't see any warranty or contact information anywhere in the U. S. besides one phone number for Japan.  I should have bought it here locally so that I can get replacement more easily.  Now I can only hope the merchant I bought this tuner/metronome from will take care of me.  It's really not worth saving a few dollars buying on-line.  I should have known better.	-1
Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.  I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.  Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.  So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.  If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else.	-1
The picture shows a sound hold cover of some dark material which I hoped would be more flexible  than the brittle clear material that the last one I bought was made of. That one cracked and split. I couldn't be sure what that dark material was, but I hoped it would be better - it couldn't be worse. I was bummed when I got another clear, brittle plastic cover, just like the last one. Also, there is no clip on the tube like in the picture. You have to make do with putting the loop of string around the end of the tube.  this is the first time this has happened to me buying from Amazon.	-1
I was expecting more, because I really like BBE products, but this one is a disappointment.  Basically, when I used the low process knob, it did help my sound, slightly, but when I engaged the high contour, it added nothing but extra hiss.  It might work for a bass player but for me ... no thanks. My rig telecaster > pw tuner > mxr super comp > bbe soul vibe > bbe green screamer > proco ydr > Boss AW-3 > combo with reverb	-1
Does not work on battery. Works great otherwise, but want to lose the added power converter and cord.	-1
Not what Is pictured here. I assume what I received is pretty much the same product, electronically. But they probably have some old stock to move(old logo). I did not receive this picture. Was a different version. Like I said, I'm sure exact same product but I like to get "exactly" what I pay for. Don't you?	-1
I went through two of these before giving up.  Both had noisy pots and I found the effect more trouble than it was worth.  This is a very old and broadly-misunderstood effect that still stirs much controversy.  I think it still may be of limited utility in certain studio mastering functions -- where it is best applied as a VST -- but it has little place with personal stage gear.  It is generally reviled among more experienced musicians and especially by FOH sound techs, who find the effect disruptive to the house mix when used on individual instruments.  In converting the chip to work on 9VDC, numerous compromises were made compared to the 120VAC rack units.  According to BBE, the unit has less headroom than even the cheapest rack version, now discontinued.  Pass on this.	-1
It did not for me change the tone of my acoustic electric for the sound I won"t	-1
Don't believe the hype- it's simply an overpriced EQ unit- and not a  Rey helpful one for jazz or acoustic - IMHO	-1
IS NOT THAT HOT	-1
I loved this guitar stand at first b/c it held my Guild & Martin acoustics securely. After about a year of stationary use, the plastic housing which was responsible for holding up the neck support cracked and cannot be repaired (see pics). Since I'm past any warranty period, I'm stuck.  Additionally, all of the rubber developed a gummy residue which was sticky to the touch. I often had to go try to wash it off after touching it, even accidentally. I had a Hercules mic stand which developed a similar problem before it also broke.  Gave it a 2-star review because I got a year of use out of it, but I probably won't buy another Hercules product.	-1
Stand was pretty nice out of the box,and held my basses pretty well. Then they start to suck. 1) The yoke handle/lock gets gummy and your hand sticks to it, or you set it up at and outdoor gig and take 5 lbs of dirt or lawn home with you if you lay it on the ground when loading in or out 2) gummy tightening knob on the legs. 3) the lock handle snaps off on the yoke from the degrading plastic, and shoots 20 yards into the audience, the yoke collapses, and your $2000 Rick crashes onto the stage. Someone at Hercules needs to review their manufacturing process and vendors, and throw their plastics guy out the nearest window. DO NOT buy this stand until these amateurs figure out how to produce a long lasting, reliable product. They're sure as heck charging enough for it.	-1
The stand was amazing for the first five years or so. No issues at all, worked perfectly. Then the plastic on the handle literally started turning to goo. Then the handle broke. I noticed it was breaking down at both hinge points. Find something with fewer moving pieces. This thing literally starts melting after a few years.	-1
This is a basic metronome with a few useful timekeeping features, but overall, it is just a basic metronome. It is not the best metronome on the market. The MIDI features are probably useful to some folks, but its not at all useful to me, it just makes this a very over-priced metronome. For example, you cannot program this unit to click 8 bars at 116 bpm, then 8 bars of 44 bpm and then repeat. It does not come with a printed manual so you need to find one on the internet. If you really use the MIDI functions, this unit might work for you. If you need a metronome, there are plenty available under $50 that do the same things as the DB90. There are free software programs that allow you to program tempos, like Audacity, so that's going to be my solution for now.	-1
I am a piano instructor and one of my students has this metronome. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. My students have a difficult time hearing it when they are practicing and feel as though those students struggle more with steady tempo than my other students who use Wittner MT70 Unfortunately in less than a month, the MT70 has increased in price by $20 and has become increasingly difficult to find online at a reasonable price, Amazon or otherwise.  The ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does have beat subdivision (i.e. eighth notes, triplets, etc) which is extremely helpful for my students, which the Wittner MT70 also has.  If you can find it, Wittner MT70 is the way to go, I've been using now for 5 years and is the metronome we buy exclusively for our students.	-1
I put these strings on my bass, the red color looked cool they played nice and sounded good at first. But after about 5 minutes I started hearing a loud hum when I waved my hand across the pick ups and also when the strings touched the frets you would hear a sound like you would when touching a live electrical wire to metal. I brought the guitar to a local repair shop thinking I had a ground or shielding problem. They told me it's the coating on the strings causing the problem. Switched to a regular pair of strings and the problem went away.	-1
Says in the description that it WILL FIT a Fender Blues Junior III, which is the most current model.  Well, it does not.  Waste of time and money.  Would have looked nice, but does not fit.	-1
They still fall off!!! Ugh	-1
Finally got a chance to use after sitting in the box for a year and plays for a couple minutes then just fades in and out. Replaced battery, same thing. Very cheap. Get what you pay for I guess I paid for a shelf decoration.	-1
Not what I expected, but it works.	-1
Really not particularly happy with this product. It sounded good at first. I could use it plugged into the wall or with the 9V battery. A couple weeks after I opened it and started using it, it started working poorly. If i use it under battery power, the led flickers and the volume cuts in an out, but I have only used it with the battery for a total of maybe an hour if that, so it shouldn't be dying yet. But even with the battery disconnected and the amp plugged into the wall, the amp will occasionally produce a scratchy, noise. It sounds almost like radio interference, but it happens regardless of whether a guitar cable is plugged in or not. This sound is not created by the speaker though because i can plug it into headphones and still hear it. It's not a pretty sound and it's quite annoying to play with.	-1
I bought this keeping in mind that if it's not good I can always return it.  Somewhat expected, didn't not meet my expectation. I returned this, but the liquid I bought couldn't not be returned as I used a bit to test this one.  Money wasted.	-1
I  bought this mostly to backup my one year old Chauvet 1300 fogger in case the Chauvet failed to work - the Chauvet pump failed and I just replaced it under warranty (self installed).  It costs a little more than the Chauvet and does not include a timer remote.  The Chauvet comes with a timer remote but neither of the two remotes I have ever worked properly; only the auto continuous button works. That function is alone is good enough though to not have to man the button all night. I let the Chauvet run automatically all evening through my homemade fogger chiller and used the American DJ for intermittent extra dense fog.  Since both foggers have comparible specs I'm surprised that more people have not reviewed them together.  They both claim about the same wattage.  The American DJ 1200 is much smaller than the Chauvet 1300 and is quieter.  The Chauvet has a much more powerful pump and the fog blasts out farther.  The American DJ puts out fog for a longer amount of time when the on button is continuously held down but it takes it a lot longer to warm up again.  The claim on the box and their web site that there is no warm up time in between blasts is not even close to being accurate.  All foggers in this class have to warm up again after a long  blast.  I used the manufacturer recommended fog juice. The $33@gallon standard American DJ juice fog worked well.  I did try Spirit Store fog juice (less than half the price)in the Chauvet and it did not hug the ground like the Chauvet juice even when I used my vortex style cooler chiller. Unless you want smoke style fog I would not use the Spirit Store juice.  Next year I'll probably purchase the remote timer for the American DJ fogger.  I'll update the review then.  Update Oct 19, 2012:  I ran the unit for about 20 minutes of intermittent blasts and then the output gradually went down to a very low level and started making noises.  The unit had a total of one gallon of American DJ fog juice run through it last year and this year I'm using American DJ ECO juice. I'll contact American DJ for support tomorrow and will update this rating based on their response.  Taking off 2 stars for now; if American DJ has decent support I'll change it back.  Too bad, I was just about to order the timer remote for this thing. Now I need another fogger before Halloween.  Update Oct. 22, 2012: I have not contacted American DJ for support. I found that the fog juice filter seemed to be partially clogged.  There was some white stuff in the fog juice tank so I strained the juice (it had a full tank and the stuff is too expensive to waste) through a coffee filter and flushed out the tank.  It ran for a few minutes afterwards and developed the same problem as before so I removed the filter.  It seems to be working ok for now.  Update Oct. 30, 2012:  The unit completely stopped working.  It makes noises but no fog at all. I disassembled the pump and it seems OK.  I don't know whether the pump failed or the heater unit.  Obviously, it won't be of any use on Halloween this year.  Disappointing product that did not last a year.\  Update Oct. 9, 2013: I removed the output nut and found junk behind it. I blew it out with some blasts from the fogger. Then, I ran a mix of vinegar and distilled water through the system. Also, I soaked the small part behind the output nut that is used to reduce the flow to make the juice become fog in vinegar for a few days. The fogger outputs fog now but I think it is a reduced amount. Anyway, I'm glad its working again with no real money spent yet. I just ordered the remote control.  Update Oct. 9, 2013 continued: My Chauvet 1300 fired up again for its 4th season. I like it a lot better - it costs the same as the American DJ 1200, it came with a semi useable remote, puts out much more fog, and has been more reliable.  I've run Chauvet, Spirit, Chauvet high density, and several Froggys products through it.  My American DJ 1200 has only had American DJ juice in it. I am going to run Froggys juice through it (American DJ) this year. I don't recommend American DJ ECO fog juice; the fog stinks and white stuff grows in it if it isn't used up quickly.  Update Sept. 16, 2015:  The Fogstorm was useless for Halloween 2014 because it had the same problem again (hissing noises when the button was pressed with very limited output).  This year I blew out the heater line after disconnecting the pump line, cleaned out the output hole valve again, ran both vinegar and isopropyl alcohol through the heater and it worked for 5 minutes.  I fired it up a week later and it is back to the same issue.  Update Sept. 16, 2015: My Chauvet 1300 worked great last year and fired up this year for its 6th season.  In my experience there is no real comparison anymore between the Chauvet 1300/1301 and my Fogstorm 1200.  One reliably makes fog and one does not. And the unreliable model costs $50 more now with the timer remote.  Update Sept. 12, 2016: My Chauvet 1300 broke last Halloween after about 20 minutes of operation and I just got around to fixing it.  The lights were all on but nothing happened when the fog button was pressed and it did not heat up. The heater thermostat went out.  It cost about $20 including shipping for the part from Chauvet, and was easy to replace.  That meant that my Fogstorm 1200 had to handle all the fog work last Halloween, and it did OK.  It still works this year, but I have learned it has to be cleaned out after every Halloween or the output valve gets clogged.  I'd still buy the Chauvet over the Fogstorm.	-1
Broke immediately.	-1
Constantly cutting out and clipping. Replaced battery, switched cords, and used same guitar with different amp-- guitar and cord worked flawlessly on other amp, didn't work reliably at all on this one.	-1
The unit worked for the first two days (and sounded great), but while it still does power on, no sound is produced.  We figured it was something simple so we took it apart and tried to get it to work again (and it does try to make a sound when it first powers on), but it just does not work for us.  We got about an hour of use out of it.	-1
Don't buy it! This amp cuts out REGULARLY. New cord, new instrument, new amp, and it's cutting out every time you strum too loudly, unless the volume on the instrument or amp is just barely up at all. Cute color, terrible sound quality. Spend an extra $15 and save yourself the buyer's remorse.	-1
After using it for maybe 15 min it started fading in and out. Too bad I didn't try it till too late to return. Piece of junk.	-1
This speaker looks good, is small enough, but its performance is horrible:  it squeaks and screams loudly on nearly every setting; on the setting that it doesn't  sharply irritate, there is no volume.  I tried everything, but nothing worked. I sent it back.	-1
I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, "Perfect". However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.  I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. Bummer. Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?  Cheers	-1
What I have been looking for is a mini amp that you can get a clean sound out of. This amp had a barely tolerable clean sound and would overdrive like crazy. The deal breaker was that the tone knob did not work. I sent it back for that reason.	-1
I wasn't expecting much from a cheap amp like this but I did expect the options on it to be somewhat useful.  The only thing I can use  on this is to raise the volume - which is fine for a small amp.  What I didn't expect is that the overdrive would be completely unusable.  It just adds a ton of static and distortion to the tone (and not the good kind of distortion either).  This is nothing but a cheap accessory you give to an 8yr old who just started learning guitar... even then, I'd hesitate in buying it.  Returning this one asap!	-1
maybe it was just the one that I got, but I had connection issues out the ass. plus it sounded terrible, yes I get that it is a mini amp so you're not gonna get the best tone, but Marshall and Orange managed to do it...	-1
Sounds okay, but the speaker output stopped working after one day.  The headphone output is fine though...	-1
super high string tension, pretty tinny and not rich like I'd expect for a Vintage sound string. Don't like them on my Taylor 814ce.	-1
Broke as I put it on. Would not buy again.	-1
Unless the price is for a case of these units, this price is way, way out of line by a multiplying factor of 4 to 6.	-1
I read the reviews which all seemed pretty good and at the price it was worth the risk. Now I received the item and it is horrible. It can not go loud at all without going out from hitting a chord or a string to hard. It would be better to practice without an amp, that is how quite of a room you have to be in to hear it. It can be played quietly and sound bad, but its not fun at all. Please do not buy this as a little practice amp or even consider wasting your money. I wish someone left a comment like this before I bought it. Horrible buy, if I could send back I would.	-1
Terrible falls apart. Pin that hold the metal disks falls out/comes out and well...it falls apart.. be warned	-1
This is rather painful to play for more than 5 minutes.  All that force is coming down on your finger bone and there is no padding.  Would not recommend.	-1
I'm not familiar with other pocket amps, so this review is not on comparison with other pocket amps. Maybe, compared to other portable amps this one is better, idk. However, this product review is based on my expectations as a customer and my specific needs.  First, this amp does NOT come with an AC power adapter. This is not stated in the product specifications. It never says specifically otherwise, but any other peice of electronic I've purchased, it goes without saying, comes with the POWER necessary to use the item. It does come with a 9v battery, that, according to other reviews only lasts 15 minutes. This is a scam to me as a 9v battery costs much less than an AC adapter. Additionally you can use an AC adapter forever with this amp but only 15 mintues with one battery. If I had know that I had to purchase an AC adpater separately, I would have puchased a different amp.  Second, when I tested the sound with the supplied battery, I felt that my cheesy computer speakers have a better sound quality. And the overdrive, for distortion, as one other reviewer stated, is accomplished by causing the speaker to go to a level it can't handle. This simply sounds like the speaker isn't designed to perform at this level, much like playing a high bass sound through my cheesy computer speakers.  Conclusion, I would never use this mini amp, even for practice because the sound is too lousy. My feelings, save the $20 (for amp) + $6 (guitar cord) + $6 (9v AC adapter) = $32. Then apply that $32 toward a good $100 amp. So, I'm returning the amp and doing just that.  Thanks for reading...	-1
One mushy tone, totally unaffected by the settings. Plus the sound kicked off 10 minutes after I got it. Some short within. I had to return it for credit.	-1
Returned. Sounded tinny, like a toddler's toy, but that was my perspective from my ears.	-1
It does not appear that any of the reviews are for the Direct Drive version as advertised. The reviews for this direct drive pedal are actually for the cable version which is a completely different product.	-1
It sounds like you are banging forks and spoons...definitely not like a tambourine...very very disaaaappoooointing!!! 1 extra star cause it looks good.........!	-1
I really wanted to like this... but several of the disks came off after the first night of use and the sound wasn't as good as I was hoping for.	-1
this little amp looks cool and touts the fact that it makes many tones. bs. mine only makes distortion. its pretty cool distortion but with no clean this thing is rather useless. its sounds terrible with both my guitars (Epi Les Paul Special with stock pickups / Squire Strat with SD HotRails in bridge) so i cant imagine its the pick ups. also maybe im just deaf but this thing is quiet. but what do you want for 20 bucks. avoid.	-1
I had the same issue that others here have had. When its clamoed down tight, it has a tendency to get stuck.  Unscrewing the tension knob does not release the tension.  After i drag it off the neck sideways and fiddle with it it will generally release and appears to be fine until i try to use it again.  Go get the Schubb capo. It has adjustable tension and is simple and fast to release and move.  The Schubb is also made of steel rather than the cheap plastic this is made from.	-1
I really wanted to like this capo, being as light as unobtrusive as it is.  I've tried it on three different acoustic guitar necks from slim to slimmer, and it just will not work consistently without the strings buzzing.	-1
Wow, this thing has almost 5 stars on amazon.  Ridiculous.  OK, first, I've only ever purchased 2 cajons.  I'm a professional musician, though not a drummer.  The first cajon I bought was a pearl:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pearl-Canyon-Cajon-with-Fixed-Snare/dp/B00IMNCEBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pearl Canyon Cajon with Fixed Snare</a>&nbsp;which I picked up at guitar center for my kid, who's a drummer.  It was great and was pretty near $100 at the store.  We did a casual gig with it the same day.  Anyway, exactly the same price on amazon as this Meinl.  Anyway, I figured you pretty much get what you pay for.  Right?  At least that's generally been my experience with musical instruments.  So I typed "cajon" in the amazon search and pulled the trigger on this one with it's 4.7 star rating without too much thought.  It arrived, wrapped up nicely with a card that said something like "free shaker with your amazon review".  I thought that was cool.  Now I think it's complete BS.  Well it sounded like crap.  So. we loosened the head a little to try to get a little more snap...still horrible.  Didn't even realize how bad it was until I brought the Pearl in and played it to compare.  Not even close.  Not even in the ballpark.  I got on amazon, read some reviews, and tried tightening the snares as suggested.  Still, just awful.  And no, I didn't bother trying to put a towel in it, as suggested by some.  You see, I've got this ISSUE.  I've got another cajon that's (currently ) EXACTLY THE SAME PRICE on amazon and sounds a hundred times better.  It's a MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.  The pearl has better bass response and the out-of-the-box fixed snare sounds great for $109.00.  It's cheap, entry level, stuff I'm sure, to anyone who really knows, but again, it's at least an instrument.  Compared to the Pearl, the Meinl literally sounds like a box.  It has the weird ring other reviewers mention, and the snare is horrible.  There is no reason to work a hack on something when there's a better option at the same price point.  I've attached photos of the inside of both the pearl and the Meinl.  The Meinl has the 2 snares running from top to bottom.  They're "adjustable", but it doesn't matter.  The pearl with it's fixed snares (look like broom-shaped snare thingies) sounds so much better out of the box that it's just not even funny.  If you don't believe me, order both and send back whichever one sounds awful.	-1
Super disappointed.  The "adjustment screws"  do nothing.  There is no snare effect.  The snare wires are a guitar string stretched into a "V" shape.  Turning the adjustment screw loosens one side of the V which only causes a slight buzz, not a snare effect. The "bass" sounds ok, but I could just as easily be pounding on a bucket for $100 less.	-1
Garbage. Buy A SCHUBB.  There is no equal.	-1
I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. Then,it broke on me.	-1
These capo's are only good for a month or two. The tension knob breaks off or strips. I gave the first one the benefit of the doubt but when it happened with the second one I felt compelled to write a negative review. The design concept is good but I would recommend a higher quality capo.	-1
There are better capos.... This one requires you to really press down hard and accurately to make your intonation change.	-1
Fell apart within an hour of use first gig!	-1
I like the Victor/Dunlop brass capos because of their lo profile and durability so I thought this may work as well. The adjustment screw broke off in just a few weeks rendering this capo unusable. The other issue with this style capo - the rubber pads get deep string indention and wear out overtime and don't hold the strings well. After this one broke, I bought a Paige P6E capo and have been happy with it so far. The adjustment screw is solid and the string sleeve doesn't get deep string indention. The Paige also slides over the nut when not in use - making it harder for me to lose.	-1
I had good luck with earlier metal versions of this on banjo, so I got this one for a 6-string acoustic steel-string guitar with medium / light strings, and it was great at first, minimal to no re-tuning needed.  After a few months of use, however, it has warped to the extent that with the screw tightened all the way, the low E buzzes.  Somehow I missed the fact that it was made of plastic (seems I did not buy it from Amazon).  I don't know why they would even make a product like this;  it's not like capos are so heavy, and it diminishes the manufacturer's reputation.	-1
All the guitarists should read this before you make the purchase, and the maker (planet waves) should also pay attention to the bad effect of your new design on this capo.  Years before, I bought my first NS capo, which is the lite edition, though it is not as durable as the aluminum one it is still durable for use of many many years, and when I have my own high end Martin, I decided to upgrade my capo also. I still chose to have the NS capo since it is the best capo I've owned ever, no matter for the price, due to the excellent design, no buzz, extremely firm, ultimate reliability and is very easy to use.  I don't know when it is changed, the screw turns to be smaller, the tension adjustment is loose, it is tiny but more beautiful looking in my opinion, and I am glad to see the advance of something that is almost perfect. However for several days use, I'd say it failed me and made me very disappointed, the screw cap is directly contacted to the capo handler, makes the contact easily wear out, and after the finish is worn and underlying metal is exposed, you will find it very difficult to screw it smoothly, especially when you try to remove it from the fretboard. It even makes a metal version capo not as durable as the plastic one. How bad design it is! I have taken a picture of the one I just bought from another seller in ebay, which is an old versioned NS pro (yes I spent some time and finally found it since almost every seller is selling the new one), this one is much more durable since the screw is quite long thus only the end of the screw is contacted to the capo. I bet this can last much much longer than the new model.  Also I found the picture you posted for this product is not true, the one in your picture is more closed to the old model in my picture, not the new model you sent me. You should update the picture and let the customers know which model you are providing, and I think Planet Waves really need to consider to resolve the design defect in their product.	-1
Works okay, l have since purchased a G 7th Performance capo that is great...5 star rating fo G 7th Performance capo.	-1
It's baffling how these Lite Campos can fit so evenly that they allow chords to ring out strong and true yet when you bend a string they don't provide enough anchor so that the strings snaps back into place. Instead they stay wherever you stretched them to leaving the strings out of alignment. Spring capos are sometimes not strong enough to prevent a muted sound. This design is usually more effective with the main flaw usually being they don't provide the quick change a spring capo does. Why are these strong enough in one way but not in another, essential way? I don't know. But the minimum requirement for any product is that it performs its dedicated function, even if it lacks durability. There won't be much chance of determining the second characteristic if it lacks the first. Not recommended.	-1
Not the best one on the market	-1
I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the "Lite"). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.  I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.  My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the "Lite".	-1
I ordered this cajon at the last minute for a special event at our church.  I had seen and heard this brand of cajon on numerous occassions and thought they were great for the money.  It arrived in two days as promised but when I unpacked it, I am almost certain that it had been returned before because the tags were torn off and inside the body.  The top of the cajon was so rough it would likely "pick or pull" the fabric on the seat of the pants of anyone sitting on it.  It appeared to have been sprayed with finish without final sanding which makes the grain stand up and was literally "rough as a cob" ,  actually rougher.  Also, it sounded horrible... the snare wires were loose, looked stretched and the tiny adjustment screws on the bottom appeared to have been adjusted so much that the inside of the allen screws heads were stripped out so that it would be difficult to try to adjust the snares. I immediately packed it back up and reordered another one which unfortunately could not arrive in time to meet this particular need. The reason I re-ordered the same brand is because I have seen several in the past they have been fine.  I figure anybody can make a mistake so  we will see what they send as a replacement.  I will post the outcome asap.	-1
The housing for the tambourine discs was decent quality, as was the strap but the discs fell out within a few weeks of use. I am a street busker so as you can imagine, I used this quite often. I suggest anyone with the same interests to buy a foot pedal and a tambourine with an attachment. However, if you are gonna use it sparsely then it's not a bad buy!	-1
I did not like much. It broke soon after use so I think it is of very poor quality. I think this line price.	-1
I bought this Planet Waves "classical" guitar capo to use with my Takamine classical guitar. Unfortunately, it does not work very well. The capo runs out of adjustment and does not fully press the strings down when trying to use at the 2nd and 3rd frets. The result is what you'd expect, a muffled buzz on the lower strings due to not being tight on the fret. I guess maybe my Takamine has a slimmer neck profile than what the Planet Waves classical capo was supposed to work with, but it would not have taken much to make this one work. They could have built in more adjustment or made the cushion a little thicker. I'll keep it and try to modify it myself if I can, but I was sure hoping to use it without any of that. I really like the steel string capo, and for that matter, I've liked everything I've ever used from Planet Waves (polishing cloth, circuit breaker guitar cables). But this capo is a bit disappointing.	-1
The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not "lite",  I prefer that one above this model.	-1
Shipping box was in excellent condition but the cajon was not. The front striking plate/board was warped. This was especially noticeable along the seams where it meets the body of the cajon. Disappointed, but optimistic, I said to myself, "Well, if it still sounds great out of the box, I'll live with the defects." Nope. While I understand that adjusting the strings/snares would have helped some, the sound was *so* far from cajon sounds I've heard that I immediately reboxed it, setup the return to Amazon, and wrote this review. Was it crappy quality control? Either that, or the fact that the cajon's sticker indicates it was made over a year ago. ...If wood isn't stored in proper conditions, it'll warp. Maybe that's what happened in the warehouse?  I'm still in the market for a cajon, but I'll be trying the exact instrument I buy before I lay down the cash next time. ...I am not totally jaded about buying instruments on Amazon though; my last major musical purchase was a Seagull acoustic guitar; I couldn't be happier with it.  If I end up buying this model and liking it, I'll be sure to change my review. You win some, you lose some. Based on others' reviews, it looks like I was one of the few unlucky ones.  Super easy returns with no additional stocking or shipping fees. Amazon Prime rules!	-1
i have this and lp as well. the lp is much better sounding, this has a muffled grating tone. seems durable. the elastic band on this is product is also smaller than the lp. going to keep it just to have different sound options	-1
Falling apart after very little use. Bought it because I thought mienl was decent brand. I was wrong. Its "pressed" together. Not smart for a percussion instrument. Also sounds very plasticy. Save yourself and look elswhere	-1
Just awful. I'm a acoustic guitarist, and bought this for gigging. Fell apart after one session of playing. Sounds very good, though. A shame it fell apart.	-1
The guitar string snare assembly won't sound even remotely like a real snare drum. I tried adjusting and using masking tape, and I have experience playing different cajons.  I recommend going to a local Guitar Center where you can actually try before you buy--the tone is just too iffy to buy online. I found one for 50 more than this, well worth it.	-1
Sounds like a snare drum throughout.  This differs significantly from other Cajons I have played, which have a much lower frequency spot available a few inches from the top.  Disappointed.  Sending it back.	-1
Seller is great, Product is garbage, Wiring diagrams are Teeeny weeeny,The ones that you down load from their web site is totally wrong, The one their tech sent me didn't work either Product does not work at all, Cannot ever get dimarzio support on the phone so I have an expensive lesson, Then I'm going to rip them out and throw them at cars on the highway, Really the MIM stock were better,, They worked! So save your money, Buy a nice set of anything but these, Pure crap and no customer support, Unless you enjoy wasting your money then your gonna love these.	-1
Tried these after a recommendation from a friend.  Just found them to produce a very dull sound with my guitars.  No idea why, but just did not care for the sound.  Seem well made, but they're not for me.	-1
Very flimsy.	-1
Been playing guitar for over 40 years and this is my all time favorite guitar pick. (Brand....I buy 3 different thicknesses from the same brand). These are hard to drop as there are grip nubs on both sides and they really help the pick for 'staying put'. I play purple for acoustic and the black for electric. (green for recording occasionally but green is great for teaching strumming technique for people that have a hard time strumming the strings smoothly, or attack the strings too hard.  Update: Wow! I am really disappointed in the new Snarling Dogs .60 (purple) The pick feels thinner (like the green pick gage) and the edges of the plastic looks like it just came out of a plastic jig, all jagged. The quality and feel has gone to hell. Looks like I'll be looking for another brand. After all these years my search resumes.	-1
These are cheaply made, poor edges. I like to hold my pick sideways and there is too much grip to do so.  The tin is cool, and they're just guitar picks.. But I'd recommend some Dunlop's over these for sure.  I also recommend avoiding such grippy picks, you will get better at not dropping them (and having a backup ready).	-1
Grip is good, but pick is way too flexible.	-1
I have no idea how I came across this pick, but over the years, it has become my all-time favorite (0.60mm brain pick in purple). Which is why I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and instantly ordered 2 boxes - one in 0.60mm and one in 0.73mm.  The day it arrived, I opened the boxes with excitement. Weird. The 0.60mm felt filmsier than mine, and the quality control was bad. If you look at the photo, you'll notice that the edges are not finished properly - it's as if the finished product was just taken out of the plastic mould without any further processing. My old brain pick looks and feels so much better even though it has seen a few years of playing. Not only that, the new picks do not sit flat on a surface - characteristic of poor quality. My old pick still does! It's amazing.  The trademark dots for friction also feel terrible on the new ones. On my old brain pick, the dots feel subtle but extremely effective.  Both boxes had the same issues, so it is not a batch problem. The 0.73mm pick was closer to my old 0.60mm pick in thickness, so I recommend you get that at least if you are playing the acoustic guitar. But these picks are no longer the same... just feels like cheap plastic now.  Until Snarling Dogs improve their quality control and goes back to the old days, my old purple pick will remain a special pick to me. If anyone knows where I can get the old brain picks, please let me know!!!	-1
It's my own fault these are to flimsy for me.	-1
It did work great in the beginning but that was a long time ago///  Time marches on.  Believe me you gotta go for the  better stuff out there...  Don't buy... excepting if you have a museum for outta date stuff.. If  you want one I will sell it really cheap///you gotta pay for shipping though....	-1
I ordered the CA-30 but was sent a different model - they claimed the CA-30 was no longer made.  I always thought that if a product was discontinued a product of equal or better quality and cost would be sent out.	-1
I was looking for a pick that would help me keep from loosing my grip on it.  I could not find a thinner pick than this one at Snarling Dog so I got this one.  It is to thick for me and really did not help me much.  I later got the Dunlop 449P.60 Max-Grip Nylon Standard, Light... Dunlop pick and I am very happy with it.	-1
they're very limp for a .73 felt more like a .40 , if you aren't playing 9's or thinner, you won't like these.	-1

Unusable out of the tin!  EVERY PICK in two tins had a plastic "flash" around the pick from the mold where the plastic had been poured in.  I will NEVER buy a Snarling Dog pick again as long as I live!  They are garbage!	-1
ok, I am not sure what is up with these picks.  I expected better as they come in a metal tin.  Why would you bother to put crappy picks in a metal tin?  They feel like just regular cheap plastic and they have "flash" around the edges from the molds when they were made.  These picks sound terrible.  I gave it 2 stars as I have another cool pick tin now.	-1
If you keep your music in a heavier book, this stand will not be able to support it. The middle peice is not something that you can tighten. If it were the stand will be fine. It's hard to explain. But you will probably buy this stand anyway because of the hercules name brand, and then you will see what I am saying. And you will come back to this review and say, "why didn't I listen to that dude?"	-1
didnt fit, had to mode, other than that works	-1
Pure Blues (010-046) are far better than these. Tite Fits lose their pop after 2 weeks and have no life after a month. Pure Blues last me 2+ months sometimes and I play 3 hours/day.	-1
I've not tried many strings (yet!) but these strings clearly made my guitar sound worse. I had been having problem with my tone sounding muddy and not nearly warm enough.. way too much bass with no top shimmer. On a whim I decided to change out strings since I'd had these (the 0.46-0.010 gauge) on it for about 2 months. Changed to standard Ernie Ball slinkys of the same gauge. Immediate difference and definitely for the better. I think strings are all up to taste anyway, so these probably work when you want a super beefy tone without doing drop C or something. But I personally didn't like them. My style is modern and 90s punk/rock, occasional bluesy stuff, and some clean stuff. (Brand New, old Green Day, Blink 182 etc)	-1
Cymbal selection/preferences are very personal and subjective, so even though the cymbal had too much sustain for my liking, another percussionist might like that level of sustain. I would almost classify this as a pure ride cymbal instead of calling it a crash ride. If you are looking for a crash with a shorter decay, then try the Wuhan 18" medium thin crash.	-1
not good	-1
Bench is uneven and when it stands it's shaking. No clue how to make legs even.	-1
It felt uneven and so I put a leveler on it and sure enough it isn't even flat. Not only that, I ordered this and over a week later it did not arrive so I emailed amazon and they said they would send me another because it got lost in transit. They could have told me that. So 1 star for World Tour for selling uneven benches and making them in china where people work 16 hour days just to barely survive and 1 star for Amazon for losing the package before it even reaches ups and doing business with World Tour. I wish I just when to a friendly music store and got a bench even if it meant paying twice as much as this	-1
I'm a podcasting addict--I've tried just about every popular mic on the market.  Out of the other options, this one ranks very low for me.  The Blue microphones have always sounded "robotic" to me.  In fact, sometimes I listen to a podcast and can tell right off that they're using a Snowball.  However, they are reliable and I certainly couldn't say the same for the MXL 770.  For the same price, you could pick up an Audio Technica ATR2100, which I'd consider to be superior in every single way.  It's XLR AND USB, the sound signature is far more clear and natural, and it's even a little less expensive.  For about $100 you can also get a Shure SM58.  That mic truly is legendary, and it's great for podcasting.  The audio is a little better than the ATR2100 and it's more directional (cuts out room sound better).  The trouble with choosing the SM58 is that you don't get USB (Same as Rode Procaster mentioned below).  So in this case you'll need a Zoom h5 or Zoom h6 to be your audio mixer and recorder in one.  This provides a MUCH higher quality recording and is easier to do.  Compared to higher-end mics, the ATR2100 leaves a little to be desired.  At the top of the market I'd put the Rode Procaster above even the venerable Heil PR40--and I've tested all of these mics side-by-side multiple times.  In short, it's not a BAD mic, but there are better options out there for the money.	-1
Update two years after buying it originally.  It took a lot of bother and a lot of back-and-forth with the company; we finally had to ship ours back to the manufacturer for an updated chip.  Once that was done, the microphone worked fine.	-1
Poor sound and seem very thick for lights.  Not easy to bend at all	-1
I was disappointed with these strings on my Martin OM-35. I thought they were stiff and did not have a balanced sound compared to the Martin Lifespan SP's. Hard to believe Eric really uses these strings!	-1
Semi - hard; no need to scratch surface; sound much improved with this rosin.  However, the picture of the rosin is unlike the rosin that I received:  the rosin that I received had a terribly bumpy surface and the quantity was only half of what I expected to get (1/2 was missing)..  The rosin has a rubber cover that hides the real shape of the rosin.  UPDATE:  I ordered  directly from the Kolstein website, and I received a 100% full amount of cello rosin (excellent communication and service).	-1
Update from my previous 5 star review: Power jack broke after being plugged into maybe five times.  I baby my gear.  The build quality on this pedal is garbage.  It happened just after my Amazon return window closed.  I guess I'll buy a part, get out the soldering iron and hope for the best.  First review: How can you not like this pedal?  If fuzz is what you want... fuzz is what you get.  Listen to some YouTube clips of this pedal if you are not familiar with what it does.  If you want that sound, this is the only option.  FWIW, I tried the Nano Big Muff Pi, and found that I preferred the big one, even though it is a pedal board real estate hog.  Supposed to be the same circuit, but I kept picking the big one in blind tests.  The Nano sounds great too... just not that specific sound I expect from a Big Muff Pi.  Also sounds great when used in a bass rig.  Haven't tried the Bass BMPi (made for bass), so I can't compare.  I just know the guitar BMPi handles a bass nicely.	-1
My guitars have fallen off a couple times. The Neck part is sturdy. But the bottom won't stay on.... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR :)	-1
If you are looking for a plugin Mic for other device (like handheld recorder or camera) please stay away from this mic. It has compatibility issues. ITS A WASTE OF MONEY.	-1
I wasn't impressed with this guitar on any level.  My first and last Silvertone.	-1
I bought this hoping to start up with electric guitars as I have only had acoustics. I received the guitar, and the box looked to be in poor condition with scratches, and worn corners. When I started setting up I found that the strap that goes with the guitar, was missing. Not too big of a deal, but annoying. I strummed the strings a few times and it sounded ok so I decided to test the amp. I plugged in the guitar and AMP. The AMP turned on and i strummed again, no sound came out. I tested with various outlets, and sound levels and nothing worked. I contacted the company immediately.  After four business days they did not respond, so i took the amp to Guitar Center, and they said it had blown a fuse and would be expensive to fix. I bought a used fender & AMP from them for 400 and returned this set. Very disappointing. I still have not heard from the company.	-1
At first, this seemed like a decent gig bag, but then the zipper completely crapped out.  You get what you pay for.  Spend a wee bit more money and get something a little bit nicer.	-1
No padding what-so-ever!!  Looks/feels like a cheap electric gig bag. If you want any protection for your guitar at all, don't buy this case!	-1
Cheap arrived quickly, however the padded part as its listed. Yea right little to no padding except the cloth used to make it	-1
I bought 2 for the extra basses I have. I have an old Ibanez that just barely fit in one, and I have a Fender style bass the DID NOT FIT. It fits the body of the bass (barely), but the headstock and tuning keys were too wide for the top. The only way to make it fit was to flatten the tuning keys and un-tune the instrument. Plus, there's almost no padding. This would be better suited for an electric guitar. These are not worth the money. I'm sending mine back and buying something else.	-1
The bag seemed well constructed but the odor infused in the material was so bad that I returned it for a refund. I went with an SKB instead.	-1
You know I don't get it..I used Juice as directed on Sabian and Meinl cymbals noticed little and horrible breathe taking smell..I tell u what will work Ketchup! your ketchup u put on fries...spread ketchup on cymbal evenly leave10-15 mins or 20mins not to long cause it will take off ur logos....then rinse with water and get a scrubber and get the crud off..this works ..and way better than this juice!	-1
This cleaner really didn't make too much of a difference on my pearl crash or my meinls. I thought it was just the make of a particular cymbals, but on trying it on the pearl, multiple meinls, and various low quality no name cymbals there really wasn't any difference. The clean parts of the cymbal shone a little bit more after cleaning but the dirty bits I bought it for were almost completely unaffected. I'm disappointed but i guess there's a reason it was so cheap for so much cleaner. Oh well.	-1
I have to say, this little amp produces an impressively tight sound. It was enough to make me want to buy a bigger Marshall and "buy into the hype". I ultimately did return this, though, as the back metal "stand" created an unacceptable level of buzz with the volume turned up to practice levels. I bought this, a Danelectro Honeytone, and a Fender Mini Deluxe to get a taste of the tiny amp world, and while this amp definitely sounded the best, it just wasn't worth the price. Even as a "conversation piece" the plastic housing had a cheap feel to it that just didn't make sense. The Fender Mini Deluxe was a gift for a friend who wanted a Hot Rod (but never took the jump to buy himself one). I ultimately kept the Honeytone, which was a third the price and had a more "unique" voice that was fun to play with. Spend another $40 and get yourself a CF15 "real" amp if you want a good solid state model of the classic Marshall tone.	-1
Took about 5 minutes with this to realize that the only part of it that is Marshall is the logo on the front. No volume, no gain, and no useful tone control. Not worth it, unless you're setting up a diorama.	-1
Returned.  Sounded like garbage.	-1
Not much to say about it. Its pretty useless,i guess you could say it is cute as a toy or something "cool" to show off to friends. But for actual real use,it is useless. The sound is fine,but very quickly when you get the volume just a bit higher than no sound at all,then the sound gets distorted and is painfully annoying,and thats just the clean channel. If you wanted to get it as a travel/practice amp,i would suggest you save up more and get an actual amp,even a small amp will do for a practice amp and won't be much more expensive.	-1
I've only had it for about a month and it's falling apart and only works on od. Totally bummed	-1
Oh gosh .. with all respect . My girlfriend got it for me as a present and ... hmm , and pretty much that was the best part . I do love my girlfriend and I don't want to dissapoint nor disrespect her , so I decided to try so hard to like it , accept it and incorporate it in my life .. let's start from the beginning . Who in this world does not dream of having a studio , room , house , garage , man cave etc full of Marshall's ? An iconic brand , an iconic name , every guitarist's  ultimate dream . We all dreamed to big in huge , bigger than life Bands like the Stones or G'N'R so we get a lifetime endorsement by Marshall or Vox Fender etc .  But let's be honest , there is SOMETHING , something VERY SPECIAL on the logo even , the fonts , the design , the SOUND of course . ICONIC , yes Marshall the PORSCHE of amps the DREAM , the bottomline . So back to my girlfriend ... once she brought me this as a present I - as u can already tell - I loved her even more , if there is such a thing as "more" since I already loved her to the fullest . I did NOT touched the little amp the first night . I decided to practice discipline and savor it for the next night , I knew she had to work ( she's a very successful bartender ) so I knew I had the whole night to spend it with the other big love of my life ( the little sexy Marshall ).. ha ha , yes I felt a little guilty but hey a man gotta do what a man gotta do .. and the night begun !!! Tam ra tam tam tarammmm tam tam tammmmm!!!!! Fast forward to 3 hours LATER . Anger , frustration , tears , a close to heart attack feeling , anxiety , panic attack followed by depression . I felt betrayed , that thing SUCKED. Horrible is an understatement , horrific ... I tried each and every possible setting ( there's no settings really ), every level of sound , tried different rooms even and of course I tried with 5 different electric guitars , and 1 acoustic with an external pick up ... I tried 3 different guitar cables too. Nothing , nada , kaput ... the sound was a mess , mediocre , like a cheap laptop PC from the 90ies ... so I decided as a last resort to ask for some help . My last resort was of course DENIAL . So I decided to convince myself that this particular unit was a lemon . S***happen I told myself , maybe it's one of those rare occasions , maybe I was the unlucky one so I decided to SECRETLY order another one -fast / one day / expedite delivery , throw this one to the garbage and "white lie" to my girlfriend that I loved the amp . I just didn't wanna hurt her feelings since I loved her and I knew all she wanted to do is make me happy although she accidentally served  me one of the worst days of my life . And the 24 hours passed , and yes the new one arrived . And this is where the truth hit me. The new one sounded identically exactly the same . Crappy , cheap , like a 70ies Samsung transistor radio playing AM frequencies . Sad , painful , empty scratchy sound , a mess like a high school physics project went wrong . I decided to keep this one though and not throw it to the garbage since it's rude to throw away a gift . Fast forward couple weeks when my friend Kent that we occasionally throw some guitar jams together showed up to my place with a tiny little black box . It was a micro mini amp called FLY3 from Blackstar .. I remember I said to him , nahhh let's forget about micro crap and let me warm up the tubes from my Burgers and let's mess around and jam . He insisted . I rolled my eyes and I gave up . Ok ok let's give it a try I replied . AND BOY OH BOY , that 3W amp from BLACKSTAR , that FLY3 blew me away .. What a fantastic real true tone and sound came out that box , making the Marshall look even more as joke as it already felt like it is . Then we plugged the Marshall for one last test , and we laughed and we laughed and then put it to sleep . Bottomline , a powerless crappy amp ( comparing with the BLACKSTAR - similar  priced btw ).	-1
Speakers sounds fuzzy for no reason after a while	-1
This amp is relatively loud, but does not sound good at any volume. It's hard to fault the sound quality of an amp that fits in your hand, but I find few redeeming qualities in the sound it puts out. The clean channel is lifeless, but breaks up in a very unpleasant on louder settings. The tone knob covers everything from muffled to nasally. The overdrive mode is harsh and unforgiving.  Overall, I would rather play my guitar acoustically rather than plug it into this.	-1
Damn !!! It arrived in one day - love Amazon one day prime shipping - but sadly - its doa - had to make exchange arrangements - so the jury is still out for a overall rating - if the second one is also dead - I'll give up & get another brand ... ya'd think Marshell would be a wee bit more finiky on who they would liscence their name to ... had a Joyo amp that crapped out in just over a year - probably used it less then six times ... geez ... not having much luck with electronics lately - my Peavy Viper 3 just died .... Argh ... the gods of music must b p'od with me !!!	-1
I was very disappointed with this item. it sounded like one of those old am radios my dad use have	-1
They are a waste of money. You end up crimping through tons of wasted expensive cable. The ends are poorly designed, I have had them fall off after seating the cut cable which I cut perfectly with a razor blade. Making sure not to crush the flimsy cable. Its cheaper buying factory made cables that always are consistent when I use them. Avoid at all cost only hours of frustration are in store.	-1
This new planet wave cables suck. The connectors are still big and takes up space next to pedals on a board. The cable itself isn't that flexible. I threw these out and bought George L Cables and if you got a little extra cash get Lava Cables either or is better than this	-1
Noisy and some of the plug ends did not work. Also the cable sometimes does not want to fir into the plug. My own fault for trying to save money.	-1
While this board was not costly, the thin aluminum construction, coupled with the awkward half-hinge design makes this pedal board a pain to use.  The velcro system in place on this board is nowhere approaching good enough for a gig, and unless you've got several heavy pedals, this board is going all over the place just from regular use.  I went through the trouble of making permanent mounts for my pedals, which was a poor investment in time since the overall quality of the board was unsatisfactory to begin with.  Look elsewhere.	-1
Cheap quality. Falls over too easliy	-1

I quickly saw the link and copied it to an email to students.  So, I've got 4 or 5 kids, middle school/high school aged, who've gotten this thing at my recommendation.  I guess I should have checked it out more.  If you don't click on the link and really examine it, it looks pretty much like a classic Hamilton-style folding stand.  (I've actually got one of those that's about 60 years old by the way.)  Well this one has some added features which may be a positive for some people, but for me personally, over-complicate the simplicity of the classic folding stand design.  It has added hinges and adjustment screws at several points that the traditional design doesn't.  I'm sure these add to the stand's versatility and also make it fold into a smaller size compared to conventional folding stands, but they also make it very difficult to operate until you figure it out.  If you give it to impatient kids, they'll pretty quickly break it or bend it beyond usefulness.  I found one stand, today in class, almost beyond that state.  I spent 15 minutes of class time trying to bend it back straight.  I spent another 10 or 15 minutes "training" students in the use of the stand and making a crappy video on my phone of how to fold/unfold it.  (I'm linking that video to this review).  Because of the design "additions", I don't see a stand like this lasting as long as a more traditional folding stand.  It has more hinges, lighter metal material, and plastic parts that make it appear as though it would fail much more easily than the solid metal construction of a traditional design like the Hamilton.  It also takes a lot longer to break down if you're really gigging with it or travelling between classes etc.  The traditionally designed stands fold in one motion for each of the two pieces, and you're done.  This one has 4 knobs that must be untightened and retightened each time, in addition to the basic folding motion.  To be honest, the old ones don't allow the kind of flexibility in adjustment that this stand has.  You can adjust the overall height, the tilt of the sheet music (flatter or more straight up-and-down), and it has extensions to support sheet music which overhangs the sides or tops of the stand.  I'd assume it's also lighter. So, if height limitations on traditional folding stands is your achilles or you *must* have something smaller/lighter than a traditional folding music stand, you might try this.  I, personally, would go for something more durable that doesn't fold down as small.  Remember, you *can* adjust the height, but you also *have* to adjust the height each time instead of a more traditional (and much faster) pop-together-and-done assembly.	-1
Pay $16 for a stand.  You get a $16 dollar stand.  "Precise fit and finish" would NOT be a phrase applicable to this unit.  Does it accomplish the task of holding music up at eye level?  Yes.  But, it is somewhat of a chore to adjust due to the cheap components.  I have a Pro stand that works great, but was looking for a low profile stand to use where floor space is at a premium and you'd want the presence of a music stand to be minimal.  I gave this away and will be looking for a different stand.	-1
For functionality, it holds up paper as its intended but the condition of this...Took LOTS of grease, black matte paint (covered in scratches, paint missing from joints, almost looked like silver and black camouflage). Its like someone sat on it, the metal frame of the part that holds the music was horribly bent, which made opening the device a royal pain and a communal laugh infront of other musicians.  I realize you get what you pay for, but the condition (NOT quality, condition) can almost be described as well used.  Spent another $20 and buy something that will last and won't bite your fingers every time you open it. Also look for one that folds up smaller, this thing still fairly sizable when folded up approx 2.5"x4"x20"...	-1
This stand is way too flimsy, might get by with using it in one spot but don't count on using it at gig's.	-1
I received the item quickly. I unpacked it and immediately saw that the velcro on the case was halfway off and not secure. Then I tried to put the stand together, all the pieces were very hard to move to get into the proper position.  I decided I was not going to struggle when I used it and I returned the item and got a refund.	-1
The stand is very light and folds to a very convenient size but is quite difficult to assemble and disassemble with very tight joints. Because of these joints, the black paint also comes off and it makes the stand unsightly.	-1
We wanted and extra stand to take with us on a tour and figured this would be just fine.  We have lots of the basic wire stands but wanted a black one, just in case it had to end up on stage. We read the reviews and, even though we knew it wasn't a heavy duty stand, thought this would be fine for a back up.  When the stand arrived, the first thing we noticed was that one of the music holders was flopping around. Since it couldn't be tightened in any way, that meant it was useless. We also noted that the "shelf" was a little shallow, probably not any shallower than other inexpensive stands, so any thicker music books or notebooks would not be able to stay on without something holding on tightly.  As we put it together, however, we discovered that one of the hand-screw-knobs that holds the stand in place -- stops it from spinning around -- could not be tightened enough to actually stop the stand from spinning.  We finally took pliers to it and was able to get it tight enough to ALMOST stop it from turning but weren't able to really ever get the stand to stay still.  Since that's a deal breaker, basically rendering the stand useless, we returned it to amazon.com.  One note about wire stands in general.  They use to all come with a lever at the bottom that would click into place and hold the stand open. That's a WAY better method than something that hand tightens, which is what this stand uses, 'cause it locks the stand into place. These screw-knobs can be fine but tend to break and/or wear out.	-1
I found it to be flimsy, fiddly, and awkwardly designed, with a poorly made case that's a little too small. Unless you really need adjustable tilt, the Hamilton folding stand that's been around for 50+ years is far superior, has the same (limited) capacity, and is about the same size and weight.  If compact portability is not a requirement, you can't beat the non-folding&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Manhasset-M48-Symphony-Music-Stand/dp/B0002FOBJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Manhasset M48 Symphony Music Stand</a>&nbsp;which also has been around forever. Much sturdier, can hold a lot more weight, with a tilting mechanism that is simpler, easier to use, and far stronger.	-1
Didn't work as good as the Oasis! You get what you pay for!	-1
Weak. It dries out a day after use, and contributes almost nothing to the humidity of the guitar. It's more work than reward, and I'd rather go for a real humidifier that costs more than buy four of these that don't work.	-1
they don't do a thing. maybe the ones I got were faulty.but I gave them every chance to do their job and nothing	-1
Didn't appear to absorb any water at all when I soaked it for days before placing in case, hard to trust it's doing anything	-1
This product appear to have been dried out, and did not observe any water.	-1
I put two of these in a fender dreadnought case and a soaked in water as directions, after 1 week humidity level was worse than the room. Tested with 2 different hygrometers both had been calibrated. 35% was as high as it would go inside the case and my house is about %39. May work for some just not for me..	-1
It "may" be better than nothing, but not much better.  It might be ok for a violin or uke but it won't humidify my guitar case.	-1
I ordered this by mistake.  I'm not sure if this thing does anything at all, but I use it anyway.  I don't particularly like it and would prefer the one with the sponge.  The photo is misleading, you only get ONE.	-1
I am surprised that other folks have had success witht this humidifier. My RH in the house is about 30%. In my guitar cases, this gizmo jacks it up to, well, exactly the same RH as the room. I love the concept so much, I wish it worked better. I keep one in the head area of both my guitars and added a dampit-type tube from Humitron in each of the bodies. I don't know if the Herco is doing anything or not, but the RH with the tube added is holding at 45%.	-1
It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water.	-1
I recently purchased this harmonica and three other brands of "cheap" tremolo harmonicas.  As I compared them, I was very surprised at how poorly this Hohner responded.  The low notes would hardly respond at all, ditto the highest.  By contrast, the best of the other brands, the Huang "frontier harp," responded very easily through the whole range of reeds, right out of the box.  Then I discovered that this Hohner does not have the same notes or arrangement of notes that other tremolo harmonicas have in the lowest octave (at least one note is missing in all tunings) and that those notes are arranged in an odd way that makes no sense.  The Hohner Weekender, which is similar, has the traditional note layout one would expect in a tremolo harmonica (but now it also is made in China).  For now, I suggest buyers beware of this model 455 "Celeste" harmonica, which is a tremolo with a unique layout and not up to Hohner standards.	-1
Be careful you can tip on this it would be more stable with more legs. Not bad for threaded height but should have went with a hydraulic seat. Glad i kept my old throne will switch back and forth might use this for an office chair. Back rest was uncomfortable to me should be wider. The only good thing about this was it was a breeze to put together. By the way,this thing is really heavy and the biker seat could be a lot more comfy. I'm dissatisfied with this but i expect i'll get over it.	-1
Any of you drummers out there care to explain why this thing has 3 legs and is just a fall waiting to happen?  I do not get it, and although it looks nice, I can't sit on it very long and sure can't lean back.  I bought it to play my acoustic guitars comfortably, and it's a big miss.	-1
Look's great.! But this one not working.!  Hope next one will.?	-1

I am disappointed in the Danelectro brand for releasing such garbage. However, I am not blaming Amazon at all for Danelectro's mistake. Amazon.com provides an excellent variety of products to choose from and unfortunately this particular item doesn't represent Amazon.com at all. I gave the Danelectro Flange 2 stars only because if you were to want a little something extra for your guitar sound, here it is. I own a Danelectro Fab-tone distortion pedal, I payed $69.99 for this item and it is my favorite distortion pedal thus far. Too bad about this other cheap piece of junk they've stamped their name into. Sorry Amazon but I must admit this just isn't a product worthy of the Danelectro name.	-1
A lot of effort for minimal results	-1
The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.  I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it.	-1
I  use the bag to take my keyboard to work, etc. so I can practice during lunch. My Yamaha YPT340 fit perfecly, but after using for a couple of weeks (with nothing in the pockets) the zippers started to get stuck in places, mostly at the corners. In my opinion, the zippers are much too fine for this application. I would guess that if you put anything heavy in the pockets as one reviewer mentioed (books, accesories) the zippers would fail. I also found that the zipper pulls were too small and I had to add string pulls.  I have sausage fingers! The handles are a joke; they double as a shoulder strap/handles, have zero padding, and when they're at their shortest position to use as handles, you have to gather up FOUR pieces of strap to pick it up. Also the adj buckles slide on their own, so the handle lengths keep changing at will. I sent the bag back and ordered the Gator Bag. A lot more $$, but it is worlds above this poorly made case!	-1
a bit flimsey, if you wigle the cable it becomes intermittent , now i don't know if it's the cable or the unit	-1
plastic and not sturdy	-1
The Chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have.	-1
$15 for a pedal that gets adequate reviews seemed to good to be true. I guess it is. Package arrived intact and looked fine. Pedal appears to be brand new. I received it, slapped in a battery and ... nothing. Tried a couple of other batteries as well thinking I'd grabbed a dead one, but no luck. Dead pedal, not dead battery.  I wasn't expecting an EHX level pedal for $15, but I at least expected it to function. Zero QA testing at Danelctro apparently.	-1
For the price the features are unmatched.  I owned this, and it worked fine for me for about a year.  It took a little time to understand all of the features.  I enjoyed memory, and autoeq features.  I have my own band, but also run large scale PA for bands that I know.  The bad-I was running sound for a grammy award winner and (luckily) this thing started rebooting constantly during sound checks.  I had backup gear I was able to patch in, but it would have been horrible if it had happened during a show.  A search on the failure modes for this device reveals an undersized, poorly cooled, power supply.  STAY AWAY!	-1
The DI is clean - I have 5 of the Behringer DI100 and they have been reliable for 3+ years.  When the 4x12 emulation is turned on with the GI100 there is a LOT of noise, so much so that it is not useable. Still a good DI, but for me, the emulation is a disappointment. I wish I had bought another DI100 because I always have to check this unit to make sure the emulation is turned off.	-1
Useless! Still having noise coming through. Of course, good DI's cost in excess of $200, so what can you expect. It does look good though.... :)	-1
After more than a year dealing with a lot of problems (fading audio in some channels, et cetera) my conclusion is that this is the item in my rack that has been creating all those headaches. I bought a lot of Behringer products, but the amount of them turning me down is enough for me to start hating the brand.  I use it with a set of B3031A (also Behringer, and I have absolutely no complain about these excellent studio monitors).  So, if you want a cheap, unreliable piece of something, buy it. But I wouldn't buy it again. Not at all.  Behringer should care a bit more about QA. Anyway, I will RMA and update this review based on that experience.	-1
If you're planning to get this DI box, just stop right here and get something else. Flexible enough for me but the noise from this thing is H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E.  If you're feeding to a PA from your mixer, perhaps you can manage it. However, for recordings or home rehearsal (with headphones), don't bother! I should add that I didn't get any hum issues using phantom power from my board. This the first Behringer product I'm not happy with. It is rather disappointing. Looking to get the DI-100 instead.  PLEASE DON'T READ ANY OTHER REVIEW ENCOURAGING YOU TO GET THIS.  Update: I now use this strictly for a bass guitar with a Hi-cut filter at 1.5kHz to eliminate the noise. Of course, I lose some punch in the bass sound but very negligible for my current needs (plus I use a little reverb for compensation). Unfortunately, can't use this for any instrument with stereo outs (keyboard, guitar fx boards, vdrums) because the current hi-cut will squeeze the juice out of the sound. <b>Again, if you have a choice, don't bother with this one</b>	-1
This is the noisiest DI box I have used in the last 10 years of running sound.  It is completely unusable.  Maybe I just got a bad one but it was a total waste of money and has been returned	-1
Update.  The manufacturer is replacing the bag.  Initially: The quality construction and the fit seemed excellent. Good design of handles. Easy to carry. Some built in padding makes for a bag that won't let the contents mar adjacent surfaces when banging around in transit and will protect the stands from cosmetic injury.  BUT: It is coming apart at the seams!  Now, the seams are ripping after only two gigs. It looked like a good product.	-1
Only redeeming quality was that it was only $10	-1
This item appears to be well built in the pics. And it's made of steel! But it broke on the third usage.  Also, it's way too high.  If you look underneath, you'll see that the lowest catch (height adjustment) is also the weakest due to less metal and a seriously wimpy stop that is supposed to prevent the arms from collapsing into transport position.  Well, with the normal weight of my left foot while in the lowest position, it broke through.  The stop broke completely off and the metal catches were mangled.  No, I did not use this to train elephants for the circus.  Piece of junk.	-1
I've ordered this product on two occasions, with different results.  The first time was a few months ago.  It came in an On-Stage Stands box, it feels very sturdy and it has good height adjustment settings.  It's a good product. I decided to order two more of them to use with guitar students, and I received two cheap, flimsy stands in nondescript white boxes.  They aren't sturdy, the height settings are inferior, and there is no product logo anywhere on the packaging or footrest.  There's no way they're even made by the same company.  I don't know how I could get two vastly different products when ordering the exact same thing from the same Amazon page with the same product code and everything.  I checked to confirm it, and the good one I got months ago was from the same order.  I'll be returning the junky ones right away.  UPDATE:  I decided to try having Amazon replace them, but the replacements I received today are also the generic junky version, not the original OnStage foot rest.  I called Amazon, and my only options were to replace them again (which seems like an exercise in futility) or get a refund.  I could have done this on the website, so calling turned out to be pretty pointless.  I'm settling for a refund.  This is very disappointing.	-1
This thing is useless. Good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. Unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. Pass on this.	-1
Great product, price and shipping time but doesn't fit 2 guitars without clonking 1 of them (in the back) into the stand.  Thanks.	-1
This stand did not fulfil my needs.	-1
I received my stand, and like a couple other reviews said, I had to bend the two rods in the rear of the stand just a bit such that the headstocks don't bang together, no problem.  Nice stand, love how it folds up... I was really excited... until... the very first gig, the foam padding came off one of the rear support rods, including the plastic button type cap at the end of the support.  I saw the padding come off the very first time I picked up the guitar from the back of the stand and immediately slipped it back on.  But somewhere in the process of loading the equipment (in the dark at 3:00 AM of course) the foam came off again, and now it's gone forever.  So now the stand is 50% useless because I'm not about to put one of my guitars on the back of this stand and lean it against a bare metal rod that's going to scratch it.  So in my opinion, the manufacturer has decided to go the el-cheapo route and not even put the tiniest bit of glue on the foam, and it's costing them a bad review.  How about a drop of glue on that padding folks?  Uggghhh... that's sad.	-1
If I have my Les Paul and a fender, it works well. But 2 fenders or one of any of my other guitars, forget only having one stand....	-1
Awful product.  Completely unstable with Dynaudio BM15As.  Esily tip over.	-1
Molds were kinda sloppy and got in the way of threading the carpet spikes.  The rest was alright. the incriments in between adjustments could be annoying if the sweet spot for you is somewhere in between...and the pads on these for the platform were kind of squished  besides all the faults, I don't think I like the big corners waiting for a foot to kick them.	-1
Shipping was excellent. I setup the pedal as described in the setup instructions (a no-brainer). I plugged my stat into the wah pedal and the wah pedal into my Marshall half stack. I played with the 'wah range' knob, the variable Q knob, the voume knob, and the boost button. The pedal has an effect-on / effect-off switch in the toe position. The tone I get from this pedal is a very light distortion and light volume boost.... no wah. I do not understand how Dunlop (world renown for their wah pedals) can call this pedal a wah pedal !!! I plan to give it away....  Well, a few months have past and I thought I would give this pedal another try. After sitting on the shelf since December, the pedal has collapsed on itself and rests on top of the toe switch. I expect there is a 'pedal tension' adjustment, but did not find it. When opening the battery cover to install a 9V battery, the battery connector fell out. It was easy to un-screw the bottom plate and reconnect the battery connector. Once the unit was 'working' again, I confirmed my original statement that this pedal is just a glorified volume control. Since so many people gave this pedal great reviews, I must either be nuts, everyone else is nuts, or I got a lemon! Whatever the case, this pedal was a costly mistake for me....	-1
The upper pole and plate are fine, but the base is way way too small.  It should be either a standard PA tripod or twice as large and square on the base.  For the price I paid, I could have bought two pair of pro tripod stands, two mounts, and bolted a piece of black painted plywood to the top... and had four stands that worked instead of two that don't.  At the moment I simply took the top pole off and put it on a pair of pro tripods and it's working fine, but that's a lot of money for just a pole and a plate.  I would only recommend considering this product for very light speakers (preferrably with a base smaller than 9" square) on very hard floors... without anyone or anything around that might bump it.	-1
Studio monitors are usually over 20lbs. Heavier than a frozen turkey. If you did not know, a fall with this weight is enough to break the bones in your foot or harm someone. I used 28lb JBLs on this stand with carpet spikes leveled out and they wobble at sitting height. I would not put anything over 8lbs on these to be honest, they are "rated at 100lb" but this claim is ridiculous. I was not able to use them at the height I needed. I will never buy from this company again. I wasted all of my christmas money. I will caution you again, don't put anything remotely heavy or large on these unless you have perfect conditions and no small animals / children around.	-1
Sturdy and easy to assemble. But I've mounted seven 1U modules and encountered 2 holes not properly threaded.	-1
They should consider running the sleeves into it after they paint/machine it. If you feel the screws don't fit use a power drill to drive out the scrap metal and paint.	-1
I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this.	-1
This pickup sounds very muddy and dark with a rosewood fretboard.  It was not better in any way than my stock USA strat bridge pickup.  With some research I found out that the ssl5 was originally conceived for maple neck strats, to darken them up a bit and add some more output and sustain than the stock.  The wiring originally was supposed to be without a tone control.  Think Gilmour's 57 strat...  Wire it without a tone control...  That would brighten the pickup up a bit...  Otherwise it sounds terrible wired to a tone control...  If you have a rosewood fretboard and want to have tone control options, there are better options out there.	-1
I disliked this pickup because it lack almost any highs at all. I knew with that much power a single coil would lose highs but this sounds like a neck pickup with all the highs rolled off, even in the bridge position. I love S. Duncan pickups but this is the biggest waste of money on a pick up for me ever. while I love all of my many other Duncan pick ups. And that is quite a few, I would not accept this pickup if it was free, now that I know how it sounds.	-1
Another classic case of you not getting what you paid for.  I should have known something this cheap was not a good product.  Within a week one antenna on the base broken and within a month one of the mic antennas broke.  They bleed over each channel and the range is HORRIBLE.  You might as well go without a microphone if you need to depend on these beauties!	-1
I ordered this wireless PA system from PylePro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. The unit itself worked okay at first but right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed on. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly mounted and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me next week to order parts. Guess what, no call to me was placed. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.	-1
Real cheap. One of them didn't work at all the other battery cover wouldn't stay on. Very cheap feel. I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
I should have listened to other reviewers. This thing actually sounds pretty good if you can get it work.  I just use this for rehearsals with my band, to minimize wiring clutter in my space.  Firstly, the batteries are useless. I bought 4 rechargeable Duracell AAs, which added some cost to the unit. Then one of the chargers failed. I've done factory authorized repairs for several big brands as a tech for a music store, so I tackled this thing. No dice - looks like several components failed, but it wasn't worth it to troubleshoot further, so I don't really know what failed. Build quality is pretty poor throughout, but after messing with it, reflowing solder joints, etc., I think I ruled out board failure from bad soldering. Maybe...I don't have the patience or time to screw with it further.  Then the audio output started intermittently failing and making noise - it almost took out my PA speakers during a rehearsal a few weeks ago.  So I purchased another, and it was bad out of the box, and was immediately returned.  I had this thing about 4 months, and used it two hours at a time weekly. so I've got about 30 hours on it. Meaning it cost me about $3/hour to find out for myself that it's really, really crappy. so...it's either back to wired mics for rehearsal, or $350 for a real wireless dual mic unit. Worth the shot, I guess. And it did sound pretty decent when it worked...	-1
I've been DJ'ing for many many years. When the description said it had dual outputs I thought it mean it had two INDIVIDUAL CHANNEL OUTPUTS. However, that is the least of my worries. I plugged this in and instantly got feedback. Where oh where could that be coming from? Then the mic kept cutting out. I used these professionally for about a minute before they failed on me. This product gets a big "F". What I do recommend is the Vocopro VHF-3005. I've had nothing but good luck and the support from Vocopro is much better. Don't waste your money or time on this.	-1
It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.	-1
This system works just okay.  Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.  My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item.  I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.  They couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where I could even buy a replacement.  Very frustrating!	-1
For the price, this shotgun mic seems like a good deal, but the sound quality is sub-par. The signal and range from the mic being very weak and very short, despite installing a fresh battery. (My mic arrived with a battery already installed!) Also, the lack of a phantom power option is VERY disappointing.  Another disappointment was that the mic I received had been used. The box had torn open by some previous owner. The documentation was missing as was the shockmount, and mic clip that was supposed to be included. Mic was covered with greasy finger prints, and a battery had been left in it.  I will be returning this "USED" item, to buy something better.	-1
You're buying a brand, not a quality microphone. This isn't the Shure of the olden days. This is poorly manufacturer, dull sounding, and un-durable junk. Go with Seinheiser or EV, save yourself the headache.	-1
Not what I was looking for	-1
Boosts signal well, I replaced the tube and didn't notice much difference, I never use it..	-1
Doesn't really do anything for the microphone except boost volume. Some noise till you push the 1st button down. To me it just seems like a VU meter to measure clipping with a little volume boost on microphone. Having Microphone Volume problems it might solve that issue for you...	-1
i bought the item and received it  but i did not like the fact that some of the knobs were very loose as if they had used it for a while and returned it,it was scratched with a few small dents and i just was not pleased with it.	-1
I honestly don't understand what people who give this a good review are talking about. You don't have to be an audiophile to hear that this awful device doesn't do any of the things the makers claim it does. Sure, forty bucks is way too little for anything stellar, but this unit actively destroys recordings. The hissing and buzzing has been mentioned. If you own a decent high end microphone and want it to sound like a five dollar crap toy, by all means, invest in this horrible, horrible device from an otherwise competent manufacturer.	-1
Doesn't pick up much on the low end and it picks up a lot of background noise	-1
these could only possibly serve as "scratch track" mics... suitable only for song drafting purposes or recordings that require no sonic quality. They are priced appropriately for this purpose. They are noisy & thin sounding. All mud & midrange, no deep lows or clear highs. Read the reviews and see how much EQ has to be applied to get them to sound OK.  The reviews here that say they are the amazing must be done by folks who have never used anything better and wouldn't know good sound if it slapped 'em in the face!	-1
I purchased this at the same time as I purchased a Behringer mixer. The combination was noisy and even with the gain reduced to zero, pulsed and made a cycling sound. Whether this was caused by the microphone or the mixer was impossible to tell as I didn't have an alternative for either so as to swap them out. Because of this I returned both of them. My uncertainty is why I am giving both products two stars.  I am unlikely to purchase another Behringer product, even though others have had some good reviews and will probably go with one of the competition.  I must say that Amazon accepted the return without question and refunded my money. I don't often return products, but when I do I'm pleased with this company's attitude. (When I returned something because I screwed up, I did have to pay a small fee for shipping and handling, but that seems absolutely fair.)	-1
You cannot expect much for $43.00 I returned this microphone to Amazon for a return.  Will not buy a Behringer mic again.  I have a Beyer and MXL that is much crisper in the highs than this mic.  High frequencies is rough and lacking in clarity.	-1
I have spent the last several years trying to get my self set up for MIDI guitar.  Amongst my set up, I have been trying to find a MIDI foot-controller that will let me send simple momentary signals to Ableton to do things like arm channels to record, change channels from on/off, etc.  The idea being, I want to arm a channel, start playing/recording a MIDI riff, and then disarm the channel so that the loop begins playing on its own and I can switch to another sound.  Out of the box, I discovered, this unit will NOT send that type of MIDI data.  SO, I did some digging around the internet, and found that there's a third-party/aftermarket firmware chip called UNO that will allow you to program the FCB1010 to send momentary MIDI signals, aka 'stompbox mode'.  I ordered this firmware chip, paying another $30 some odd on top of the original FCB1010 purchase.  2 weeks after installation of the UNO chip (Which, by the way, I could STILL not get programmed to send the type of signal I need), the FCB1010's LCD display died.  The unit still takes power, but no longer sends or receives data or shows any display on the LCD screen.  I now own a $250 over-sized paperweight.  FURTHERMORE, Behringer does not support this unit AT ALL.  BUYER BEWARE.  I consider now that my entire investment in this gear has been wasted.  I should have spent the extra money on a Roland or Rocktron unit, but I'm apparently stupid and still believe one can save some money once in a while buy buying an inexpensive piece of gear.  So much for that idea.  Once again the market proves that you get what you pay for.	-1
Not intuitive at all. Totally confusing on how to program.	-1
Worst piece of gear I've ever bought. I'd like to say you get what to pay for but not sure it applies to this one when the first one I bought was defective out of the box and the second one has hardware problems not one year into owning it and used for 2 hours a week and and few shows at a time. I get zero value from it for $150. Not made for guitar players unless you only plan on sending program changes to your racks. You need a separate chip to get stomp box functionality. Pain to program and expression pedals can only universally be assigned to a single midi channel so you can only ever use it for one or other device... period. It's amazing such a simple piece of electronic can be so limited. I've had nothing but good experiences with Behringer so I'm extremely disappointed with this one. Also, filled out a warranty claim and no word from them yet, I registered as soon as I got it because of the problem with the first one. Save yourself your $150, save up a little more and get the Voodoo Labs controller instead. World of difference still for under $400.	-1
Wasted a day trying to do something useful with this.  Far too complicated to operate, documentation is vague, and the software tools for it are woefully out of date.  One of these days I may break down and figure it out, writing documentation as I go, but for now it's just cluttering up my garage.  Will be buying a Soft Touch in the near future to do what I wanted this thing to do.  UPDATE 10/29/2016: I finally gave it another go before getting ready to post on eBay.  As expected, nothing worked, but after some digging I found that these editors send long MIDI messages that my cheap USB-MIDI cables can't handle.  I ran the pedals through my USB audio interface's MIDI I/O and suddenly the editor was able to connect to the footboard!  There may be hope for this thing yet, but I need to make some more money before I can buy the $18 editing software.	-1
My "new" foot pedal came sealed from factory. On the backside was a big scratch that they had put touch up paint over and tried to buff with a little buffer. Really? Must be a bad day in China. Sending this pile back.	-1
The price is right but it's a really cheap board. The pedals are plastic. It feels cheap because it is cheap. The wah pedal is just crap. You have to use an external wah or external controller. It's prone to breakage as well due to poor build quality. I finally gave up and bought a much nicer PEAK MIDI fcb4x which is much smaller, built like a tank and has a large LCD display to tell you which patch you are on!!! They are on sale for $245 on the PEAK midi web site. I don't know why they are so much more expensive here on amazon.	-1
Yup no kidding; go to YouTube or a forum, and that is exactly what they will tell you to do. So why the hell did I just pay $160 for an uncompleted device? Oh yeah, and it only really works on MAC's. Gee, thanks for that non-warning (PC-user here).  You can check out my other reviews, I own TONS of gear, including Guitar Rig and Rig Kontrol, and Amplitube and the Stealth Pedal (with the extra stomp box). These work so easily, you could be brain-dead and use them. The FCB 1010 takes a freaking Comp Sci major to get it to work.  EDIT - there is now 3rd party PC programming software. Here is one: http://host.mtnsys.com:81/faq-fcb/PCEditorBeta.htm  My advice...RUN AWAY!!!!!	-1
As with all Behringer junk, it works for 5 seconds and then you have to buy another one.  I gave them 1 star for their pretty office building.	-1
No software included and I could not get it to work with Amplitube. The whole unit seems cheep and toy like and was not 'road worthy' as some would say. Holding off on finding a replacement and will do more research next time to make sure the unit I by will work with the software I own.	-1
Mine fell off the stand after some of the elastic bands snapped in its holder. I don't even know how it was possible or maybe a studio ghost did it but it ended up on the floor in pieces!  I hate that I know how these things are assembled because I had to re-assemble it and put it back together. It still works but I'm surprised it came apart so easily.  I guess it's the mystery of Behringer Quality it's hit or miss.  It did sound good though but had a HELL OF A LOT OF HUMMMM!	-1
For the price, it's a decent product. However I recommend you save your money and try some of the newer products on the market.	-1
Not bad if you're using it in your bedroom, but I cannot recommend this for a live/gigging situation. It is much too noisy.........to the point of being useless. It does provide some nice sounds, and does offer a nice degree of flexibility, but (again) much too noisy for a gig. I brought it to a rehearsal and as soon as I stepped on it it sounded like french fries and burgers were cooking near an open mike. (I no longer own this device.....I returned it a few days after receiving it.)	-1
Distortions to me sounded harsh, gritty, tinny, I do however use it has a DI box when recording direct w a XLR  out and unit turned off..	-1
While I'm a big fan of the BDI21, the GDI21 was a disappointment.  It's hugely noisy above unity gain and never actually quiet, which pretty drastically limits its usefulness in its intended role as a studio DI unless it's used with a noise gate of some sort.  The BRIT and CALIF settings pretty much sound like every cheap dirtbox in the world -- harsh, gritty and nasty.  The MIC settings just seem to add layers of muffling to the signal.  The TWEED settings are less objectionable, but ultimately and after repeated tries I can find no real use for this thing except as an emergency backup in the gigbox.	-1
Not so great.  The sound is ok and the distortion medium.  The noise is high if pushed to effective level.  The controls are too hard to figure out.	-1
If you order this microphone they will send you the less expensive Nady StarPower mic whichh sells for $6.99.	-1
I was disappointed in these 'bones'  I used to play bones years ago but the were about twice the width of these. I am not a professional bones player but I would recommend finding a wider type for easier playing.	-1
It avoided 1 star because of the price.  If these remain stationary, they are probably fine, but for gigging, the screws on the base of the center post loosen and fall off.	-1
Wanted a small portable mixer for very small venues. Used it twice. Was using it just for background music. Volume was very low and it still burned up. No wonder it's so cheap.	-1
Poorly manufactured.  The plastic cushion top was only halfway attached.  See photo.	-1
This item was returned. It is favoring one leg. The big knob which is plastic has sharp edges. The pin that secures the upright pole is a lot smaller in diameter that it can be pulled while engaged. The box it came in with may have had a lot of mileage. I have to put a tape to where the ear flops are located to make sure it will remain closed. And the piece of paper which I think is the instruction can hardly be read because it is worn and old. Not that I need it. Just an observation.	-1
These are inexpensive, yes. Heavy duty and reliable? No.  If you do ANY sort of gigging or traveling, skip these stands.  These are not well built nor designed well.  The knob that secures the tripod legs in place to the speaker pole on BOTH my stands fails to secure the pole in place. So, when you place any speaker on the stand, the legs move in and make this almost useless.  Pyle makes some cool products. This isn't one of them.  Spend the money and get quality stands.	-1
It's not that this is absolute junk, it's just that it's clearly not as nice as something like an On-Stage 7725 which has been our go-to light duty stand for quite some time. The price difference isn't much, and the On-Stage stand appears to be built much more carefully. An excellent example is the safety pin that goes through the hole to prevent the speaker from falling down, should the tension be set incorrectly.  On the On-Stage stand, it has a spring loaded ball bearing, which prevents the pin from accidentally falling out. This stand has a undersized pin that has nothing to keep it from backing out.  I'd recommend you look elsewhere.	-1
This is the epitome of cheap imported crap from China. Rust, paint scrapes, cheap handles break, poor materials, made to wear out soon.	-1
Too late to return ...	-1
I don't recommend this except for the price.  I bought this to replace a lost QuikLok stand.  I would have bought QuikLok again, but could only find them for sale in pairs. I only needed one; and I had higher expectations of Pyle products. Therefore, I bought this one. It is adequate and that is all.  I don't trust it to last long- the compression fittings don't strike me as well made or quality material.  I consider this one click above rickety. Like another reviewer said, if you have heavy speakers buy something else.  These do the job, but don't leave me feeling confident. All the 5 star reviews are based entirely on price. And they're right. This is the cheapest speaker stand I came across that could hope to work for a while. That said, if you need a pair of stands, spend the extra bucks and buy QuikLok.  Those stands are superior, and I just saw some priced very very close to this one.	-1
Cheap Made very unstable, Dont buy these, you will hurt someone if you put speakers on it, cheap price and cheap made	-1
Heavy and kind of crappy.  It does the job though.	-1
Bag arrived with a large tear in one end. Mid-tower tightener broke on first use. Pretty unimpressive all around.  They do hold the speakers though....	-1
Cheap. Flimsy	-1
Poorly made. I had to modify mine to  make them usable. They were a little iffy holding my cabs in the air, and my cabs are only about 27lbs each. I'd spend a little more on something a bit more stable. First Pyle product I was unhappy with. And the carry bag? Looks like it's made from some kind of  disposable fabric as well as it came all torn up. A waste of money for me.	-1
I bought a pair of these and they lasted about 4 months.  The adjustment that spreads the tripod is threaded into an aluminum housing.  If you know anything about aluminum and threads you know that aluminum threads will not last long.  These stands are garbage.  The cheap stands sold by Musicians Friend "Musicians Gear" are about the same price and are a much better design.	-1
package and shipping very bad!!! Terrible!!!  Item looked used, scratched, dented ...I had a very important conference show...no choice so I kept dual speaker stands......very disappointed!!!	-1
Both of the stands had parts that had fallen out, or were missing all together. When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects, this is a major concern. It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control, but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products.	-1
I ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated. However, the bag was ripped in 3 places. The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. The holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anyway...bit disappointing.	-1
It came broken at the bottom and din't fit in sub-woofer hole. Had to hammered to fix it. Didn't send it back because I need it for that day. It was not damage during shipping because box was immaculate, the person that work on quality control in PYLE must be a Trump employee.	-1
I am a huge fan of Fender guitars and amps.  I own several Tele's and Strat's as well as four Fender amps.  But this tuner is a total piece of cr@p.  Not only does it feel cheap---it doesn't work worth a darn.  I sent it back and got a refund.	-1
I've been playing guitar for 46 years (damn - that's scary).  These Fender tuners are relatively accurate, are simple to use, and have a decent display.  The problem is that they break within 6 months if you gig regularly (or even use them in rehearsals regularly).  Yes, you can get them to last a longer time if you 'baby' them and just use them for practice at home, but if you're just going to sit on your living room couch and play, get a cheaper tuner that's just as accurate that will last a much longer time.	-1
The Dominant strings have been something of a standard for violins for a long time.  They were the strings that came with my first few violins, they were the strings that were recommended to me for a very long time, and they are the ones that you will see in most music stores.  But for about the same price there are many better alternatives. The problem with these strings?  Their tone isn't really all that great.  They have a miserably long break-in time.  They aren't that durable (I've had some break within a week of installing them on my violin).  And they aren't really that cheap either. If you are at all particular about what kind of string that you use, I would recommend any of the sets that Pirastro offers.  The Wondertones are just about equal in price, but are a much finer example.  For around $20 or so more you could buy the Evah Pirazzis (very strong, bright tone with great projection) or the Obligatos (very rich, dark tone). In short, use the Dominant for your kid's violin (it doesn't make much difference to them anyway), but for everyone else look elsewhere.	-1
The FM side of this unit doesn't work , very hard to get it tuned in just not worth it.	-1
Only half worked!	-1
This unit did not work for me. The mic packs are real bad. I returned this unit and would tell you not to waste your time or money.	-1
I ordered this wireless PA system from PylePro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. Right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed in. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly made and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the really big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me so I could order parts. Guess what, no call yet again. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.	-1
I use this system in a small mobile stage setup.  The base is in a rack with amps next to the stage.  The mics work well for performers on the stage, no more than 17 feet away.  However, the mics also get used in front of the stage, and they begin to break up about 20-25 feet from the base.  They are also difficult to get into a wireless mic clip, because of the various shape of the handles.  You should see people trying to jam this mic back into a clip.  They feel great, with a rubberized coating, although I'd be afraid if they were dropped. (that is why I didn't spend much money on them afterall).  I'm not happy that the power supply is an old school transformer, which doesn't work well in a rack setup, so I have an extension cable inside.  UPDATE:  After use at several concerts I have to lower my rating.  They just aren't reliable.  Occasionally, a microphone will not work at all.  The outputs on the back of the transceiver do not all work correctly, normally I have to use the xlr output to get signal from all 4 microphones.  The 1/4 jacks don't all function as they are supposed too, especially not the combined output jack.  The worst is that the mics will cut out with the slightest peaking signal, even within 10-15 ft of the rack.  I mean they are literally steps away from the unit and they will cutout, anything beyond 20 feet and you are out of luck for sure.  Use fresh batteries every time to avoid signal problems, but there are still no guarantees.  I wish I had my money back.	-1
Bought this unit to use hosting trivia at a local bar. Sound quality is not that good and can be very muffled at times. Sound cuts out if you're more than 10' away from the antenna or if not in direct sight line. This ithem suck.	-1
Not sufficient gain to run the mikes through my PA. I will either sell the system, or give it away if I can't sell it!	-1
I took them to a speaking engagement and one worked the entire time. They had great range but the other stopped working after 15 minutes of use without any abuse. You get what you pay for, you go cheep you look cheep.	-1
I don't like the voice reproduction at all form these Mics. It doesn't matter what I do to the set-up I can't get rid of distortion so I can't use these.	-1
I hated this tuner.  The needle did not seem accurate, and it would barely move until you were almost tuned, then it was bouncing all over.  I fought with it for years until I bought the Planet Waves NS Microtunner.  Now, I have a NS Micro for every guitar, and the Korg sits in a drawer.	-1
I bought this tuner for one reason, so I can tune my guitar to b flat tuning, but when I get this, I figured that it could at least do a better job then my TG Tuner (on computer, for free). Not only does it do worse (tunes off-key) but you can only tune into standard, (which I can do without a tuner) meaning that you can't tune into anything other then Standard, dropped D. In other words, no B, C, D, F, E sharp, Open A, Open C, Open D, Open F, Cross Note C, Cross Note D, anything that requires you tune a string to C or F. To put a simply, no experimenting, which is pretty much the only reason I can think of to buy a tuner.	-1
JUNK..... JUST JUNK	-1
better choices on the mkt today	-1
i needed chromatic tuner...returned this and got a ca-40 korg...replacing my ca-20 korg,,,of 15 years,,and still ticking	-1
I play super aggressive, so I buy picks buy the gross. I usually buy Fender 351 mediums in shell. Thought I would try the white. Something about the coloring makes these softer then the mediums in shell. I rip these things up one after another at a gig. My bandmate couldn't believe how many of these I would go through in a gig. Been playing for 47 years and for the longest time have used only 351's in shell. Surprised by the white and that a dye/color can make that much of a difference but it does.	-1
BEWARE! As another reviewer has stated, these are NOT genuine Fender celluloid guitar picks! Sadly when things are too good to be true, they usually are and this is one of those things. These are clearly made of a glossy, thicker plastic and not celluloid as advertised. These picks do not even come in official Fender packaging, rather a flimsy plastic zip lock with a laser printed sticker. Official fender grosses come in the typical clam shell packaging like the 12 packs. I had an original gross pack lying around here as I go through these like water and now I can't find it, but if I do I will post a picture. I've posted a pic of a 12 pack so you can see what the picks should come in when they are an official Fender product. Either way, these being sold here on Amazon in this listing are fakes and I am not happy. For one, I am not happy because this would have been a great deal on Fender picks and for two because this order was fulfilled by Amazon and not some other third party. Amazon, why are you selling me cheap knockoff BS as the real thing? What is going on here? Again, I have been playing guitar for almost 30 years and Fender Medium celluloid picks are the ONLY picks I use on a regular basis for recording and jamming and these are clearly NOT the real thing. If you don't care what your picks are made of, this might be a good deal for you on a giant bag of cheap glossy plastic picks... but if you are a serious player and are expecting the quality and feel, that only the original Fender celluloid pick can deliver, look elsewhere, you have been warned! I'm appalled...  As for the pictures I have posted; the picture on the left of the two individual picks, the one on the left is an official Fender Medium Celluloid and the one on the right is a shiny plastic pick that was sent to me. Notice that it's darker and a bit thicker. The original picks have a matte finish due to the way they are made and the material. The picks I received on the right are glossy and "polished", probably because they were tumbled unlike the fenders. The picture on the right, you see the cheap plastic bag I got from Amazon with their laser printed label. The clam shell 12 pack is original Fender packaging. I know these still come in grosses in the clam shell because I still buy them this way locally, albeit at a higher price. So, yes Fender does still manufacture the gross and sell it in the official packaging. Hope this helps someone out.	-1
It stops functioning after a month	-1
You know? you have to try stuff as its described, but alas without being informed correctly, a person makes erroneous decisions	-1
I bought this Korg GA-40 tuner to assist me in setting up my Floyed Rose tremolos on my Jackson and Schecter guitars - because I wanted pin point accuracy in my tuning. It was slow responding and irritating to use. I was able to set them up faster and more accurate by ear and ended up using it just to double check my accuracy. I guess it is an essential item for someone who is tone deaf. Why somebody who is tone deaf would decide to become a musician is quite baffling.	-1
I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough.  The main problem with this tuner is the usability. The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.  Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating. The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune. The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.  Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.  Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this.  The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:  SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not. CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not. SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto. SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves. SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.  The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.  I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be.	-1
This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input.	-1
I was going to get a pitch pipe and then saw this so i cancled my pitchpipe order and got this with 1 day shipping got here on time...but it needs to be set at 440mhz for a violin..I spent a hr tuning my violin not only for the first time but also touching a violin for the first time in like 10 years.well i though it was good but have to re review my review this thing sucks I found out my violin software had a violin tuner on it..it's more accurate then this tuner when im at A on the software tuner it's on B and this tuner so its not right plus it's really frickin touchy if a flea farts near it it would go off...waste foe $12 + $3.99 for over night shipping..	-1
There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using "F" or "C" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere.	-1
I would spend my money on the CA-30 chromatic tuner, you can tune drop d, c, open d, etc. Not with this one. This one only seems to be good enough for standard tune.	-1
In one word, "Jumpy." Would not settle down when tuning my bass or my guitar.  Even tried it with my keyboard.  I returned it and bought the Fender ST-1 tuner.  It's excellent - simple - big display - great for gigs.	-1
The pricing of this hardware is shockingly high.  This is what SKB and their dealers think of SKB customers.  This is consumer exploitation at its worst.  Please teach SKB a lesson.  I will leave the particulars up to you.	-1
"Greed is good."  So you bought an SKB product.  Get the meaning of "over a barrel" yet?	-1
The cleaning solution itself is fine, but the cloth that comes with it is not worth the additional $3 to pay. It goes bad after the first usage. I would not recommend paying $9.50 for this. I think the manufacturer took advantage of me by charging additional $3 for the cloth. It absolutely not worthed. that is why I gave it only two stars. If you want to buy Dunlop 65, buy the one for $6. It is exact same thing but without that worthless cloth that comes with the one for $9.50. I hope you find this review useful.	-1
Like a few of the other reviewers here I have had problems with the grips/ASG becoming sticky and eventually degrading and falling apart. I am now using screws instead of the ASG to adjust the height (which is a big PITA!). It is incredible to me that Hercules has not addressed this issue by upgrading the plastic they are using for the ASG as it seems widespread. While it worked it was a good stand.	-1
I have used Dunlop Straplok's for years, but these are the first Flush Mount's I've ever tried. BIG MISTAKE. Now, before I go into it, I had them professionally installed on my ESP Snakebyte and my 3" leather strap. I played a few practices with them, no issue. Then, the night of the big gig - my Straplok's failed me for the first time in 15 years. Guitar face plants right on the stage in front of 800 people. Guitar: SHOT. Bonus - The crowd thought it was part of the show.  Afterwards my guy checks to see what happened. The flush was secure to the body. The strap button was was secure to the strap. Hmmmm.... must have been the ball bearings inside the Straplok. Now, again, I am highly, highly anal about slinging my guitars before going on. I ensure the straps are nice and secure. I knew this was, just like any other gig. I've never used the Flush Mount system and I never will again. Thanks to this crappy system, I am currently replacing a $1,200 ESP. However, those at Cargo got one hell of a show!	-1
The stand is good, like all Hercules products, but the yoke is too narrow for a standard classical guitar. The specs here and on the Hercules site don't include the yoke dimensions, so I took a chance and bought it. Wasted money. I will use the stand for other guitars, but it will not hold the guitar for which I bought it.	-1
Check out my photo. After a bit of time, this thing moved and shifted and left sticky un-removable glue all over the head.  Yuk! I did not have this problem with a regular bass drum head.	-1
DUMB! FOR LITTLE KIDS	-1
The powder coating wears off after one use, and then they go back to being slippery. Next!	-1
I received a pick totally different from the picture. It is a dunlop but not this type. just wasted my time.	-1
This ocarina is a bad ocarina.  While it is cheap and you think you're getting what you pay for, you actually aren't.  This is the kind of product that gives all ocarinas a bad name.  People pick this thing up and think that it represents how an ocarina actually sounds.  It doesn't play it's entire range, it has a very airy sound and calling it badly tuned is a compliment.  When shopping for ocarinas, FIND A SOUND SAMPLE.  Your ears will thank you.	-1
This is hands down, the single worst "musical instrument" I've ever tried to play. I say try, because mine is truly unplayable. I own & play flute, a Dixon Trad tinwhistle, the Yamaha Fife-corder, Low D Whistle (I even have the hard to play bamboo version Amazon sells, which sounds great btw), and I can make sweet sounding music on an old cheap plastic recorder with only 1 playable octave. This thing however, is truly terrible. Some reviewers are claiming they can actually play this piece of junk, which makes me think the quality control on these may occasionally allow a "good" one thru, purely by accident.  Here's the deal. Mine looks fine. The holes are fine, no obvious flaws. It does make noise, but I spent an hour trying to get anything resembling a musical note from it and only managed a few noises that sounded remotely musical, and they were faint, airy and distant.  I ended up getting a Mountain Ocarina, which plays beautifully, and has a very nice sound. I really should have payed more attention to the bad reviews of this horrible little piece of molded plastic - I can't call it an ocarina because it's really not. I was buying this for my 10yr old son as his first instrument. That didn't work out. Take my advice and buy something else, anything else. Just read all the bad reviews & then avoid this like the little plastic plague.	-1
Ok	-1
These were too thin for me...	-1
This pad is waste of money even at a dime per piece. A dish washing foam pad that you get a dozen for a buck from a $.99 store would be better. There is no way to attach it to a violin. No instruction of use. Just a small piece of very soft foam. Hard to believe Amazon would sell things like this as a "product".	-1
you would do better with an electronic tuner that costs just a little more.  The sound on this is muddy and you can't get a clear tone.	-1
Read the reviews people; this thing is small and useless. You will be wasting your money and time.	-1
I have the Lexan ones in the same size, and wanted to try the nylon as nylon has a nice warm sound to it.  Overall it's not bad, although as with the Lexan ones the sharp end on the pick does not lend itself well to any chording work.	-1
I found these to be a lot softer than their purple plastic counterparts.  The purple ones have a harder attack and are easier to hold on to than these nylon ones.  I'll hang on to these as spares, but I doubt I'll be buying these again.	-1
BIG, easy to hold, pointy, consistent.... consistently bad for either strumming or single-note work.  Nylon has an interesting soft sound if the pick has a normal shape, but with this ridiculous acute point, the tone is both tick-tacky thin AND un-dynamic. The acute angle of the point makes them TERRIBLE for any serious player. This particular grade of nylon is pretty tough, but like all nylon picks I've ever tried, the wear quickly. So in addition to the initial cost ( which is TOO HIGH) they wear out fast and need replacement. The grip is good for beginners who have trouble holding on to picks. other than that... not good.  I can't see any reason to ever get these other than to try them out ( as I did) or for beginners with grip problems. Dunlop makes MANY great products. This is not one of them.	-1
Not much grip	-1
The ol' school purple ones are better in my opinion. These are more likely to have sharp rough edges and I found they wore more quickly.	-1
Good	-1
This pick ok, but I prefer the Dunlop 207.  This is a thick pick so it is different than what most players are used to using.  Thicker picks do improve your tone, especially if you are playing a cheaper guitar.  This pick doesn't slip as easily over the strings and is a little more difficult to use than others.	-1
I didn't really care for these. It's a very individual feel for a guitar pick and this one had too much flex for my.	-1
I should have ordered the wood ones but they only make one color. I got this for the extra screw hole support, all black color and that it sits flush with the wall but getting the screws in was a nightmare. The hook itself is not detachable leaving a very awkward angle small space to access the screws. Suffice it to say it didn't workout for me and I missed the return window. Guess Ill keep it in case I move into a house with interior brick walls that require guitar hanging.	-1
It would make a good doorstop. Its heavy and useless.  I'm sure it could be OK for someone but I don't know who.	-1
I have used these my entire life.  Love them.  But 18 bucks for 12 picks?  No way -do NOT SUPPORT PRICE GOUGERS.	-1
Well I was surprised when I got these picks that there not as shiny gold as it looks on amazon. There very dull looking. So now I have 4 twelve packs of medium dull picks. Ah man!	-1
Herco Flex 50s used to be the perfect pick, but they've changed. I've been using them for decades; since before Dunlop took over. I was afraid this might happen eventually.  I opened one of these new 12-packs and instantly noticed something was amiss. They looked more brown and less gold than before, and with more gloss. That's not the issue though; the problem is they are noticeably thinner and flex more than what I'm used to. After decades of using these picks, how bad is this for me? Imagine if you could no longer find strings in your preferred gauge: it's that bad. These newer picks flex too much and it affects my rhythm playing, and not in a good way.  I searched my house and found a couple dozen of the oldies and I've cleaned all my local stores out of their inventory of the old ones as well. I hope I never run out of them, but if I do, I hope Dunlop will go back to making these they way they used to. Please, Dunlop.	-1
These picks are too thin for me and have way too much flex.  I also bought the .75 silver as well and I like those much better.  Both have a great grip.	-1
First, been a bassist for over 40 years and always have played on full round wound, mostly steel strings - gigging at least one night a week - sometimes 3 or 4 - so I have permanent callouses. I bought these for my Schecter Riot 4 studio bass which has black hardware and pickups. First thing I noticed is that the signal level out of the bass was diminished - especially the overtones you would expect. I seriously had to adjust my amps way louder than before with several tonal adjustments. The final straw for me was playing an outdoor concert and after a couple of fretted slides on the lower strings I had a heat burn on my finger just off the edge of my callous zone down towards my nail bed. It actually caused me to stop for a second in mid slide. Thinking it to be an anomaly I played on, then it happened again and at this point, it was painful. I pulled them and went back to my Blue Steels.	-1
These DR's sounds great! Looks good on my MusicMan Sterling Ray34 Bass (Will be back with update review) Update: After playing for an half an hour (4 times out of the week) G String went dead, followed by the D ...I'm going to try the new Rotosound NXB45 Nexus Bass Black Polymer Coated Hybrid Strings (Good Reviews)	-1
These are advertised as "hand made."  And they sure are.  As in poor quality control, poor consistency, poor construction, poor sound.  They have all the benefits of a product made by some teenager in his basement.  Quality control is poor.  One of four shredded upon installation before even coming up to tune.  And, yes, I followed the "manufacturer's" instructions to the letter (use pliers to make a sharp 90 degree bend, then cut).  25% waste is not acceptable.  The sound is poor.  These have a tinny sound inconsistent with quality bass strings.  Alas, this is not consistent from string to string, most noticeable on the third string, but also evident on the second.  Not the rich tone of a true round wound, nor the thump of a flat.  As stated, the consistency is poor.  It would almost be better if all four strings had the same tone, because then we could just say they were poorly designed.  These are poorly manufactured ("hand made").  The feel is poor.  I disagree with those who say these need lubrication to handle slides properly.  These feel like mushy round wound strings, although sliding is no problem.  Still, it's hard to get the left hand feel necessary for decent playing.  Basically, they're cheap round wounds dipped in paint.  I haven't played them long enough to see whether the paint stays on or not.  Other reviewers suggest it just chips off after a few days.  These strings only have two things going for them.  First, they are billed as lasting upwards of double the life of an uncoated string.  Maybe so, but given how nasty they feel and sound, that's hardly a benefit.  Second, they look great, especially on my black JT Viola bass.  Shame we have to listen to them as well.  If you want cool looking strings you can hang on the wall, you'll love these.  If you want acceptable sounding bass strings, these are not the way to go.  So let's just look at them and not play them.	-1
I like the sound of the strings, and I love the feel of them. They don't eat up my fingers like regular strings do, but they wear out so fast. It's already worn where I pluck with my fingers, and I am very disappointed since I have not even had them that long. Now it looks like s***,and I want to replace them just so they don't look that way.	-1
Looks awesome on my bass but they sound lifeless.  I tried them for about two weeks and then trashed them!	-1
