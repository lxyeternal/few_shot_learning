The 2 player campaign is lots of fun.  The multiplayer death match is extremely addictive.  Its alittle short but most 1st person shooters that are new are short.	1
Medal of Honor: Rising Sun was a huge disappointment. First of all, the graphics are horrible for a fps of its time. The graphics are actually worse than Frontline's! Not only do the graphics suck, but so does the AI and the gameplay. The game was extremely linear. You are confined to only one direct approach for every mission: Run down the only (and most obvious) path and frag every mentally-challenged Jap in your way.(Think of this game as playing the first Mario Bros. except Mario is replaced by a GI with a gun. And goombas are Japs.) This game is for single-minded people who enjoy playing games which have no depth whatsoever. The AI of this game is horrible. For example, one time I left Gunny behind, and he crossed paths with a Japanese soldier while trying to catch up with me. The Japanese soldier stabbed him with a bayonet about 50 times, but Gunny didn't care because he was so intent on getting to where I was. He just kept trying to run throught the Jap while he was getting stabbed.(Gunny never died either) Another thing that irkes me is that EA made every single enemy have the same death animation. The guy that you clubbed with your pistol dies in the exact same fashion as the guy who recieved a direct hit from a bazooka or hand grenade. I could go on an on about how bad this game is, but that would take a year at least. First person shooters are getting quite advanced these days, and Rising Sun just does not live up to the standards of other fps' like Halo or even the first half-life. To sum it up, Rising Sun is a low budget, linear, boring game with no replay value. I feel bad for my uncle for going out and spending his time and money to get me this game for Christmas.  Any person with an IQ of 5 could beat this game within a day.	-1
MOH:Frontline,the first game I got. I loved it. With 20 levels I thought the second was the same. Thanks alot EA for ruining the best WW2 franchise ever. And that one guy that said they looked alike and EA did it for money...I agree. I mean,I wanted my dad to buy this game but my dad WASTED,let me repeat that,WASTED $50 dollars on a game that not one out of ten people liked. But hey,I still play it,well sometimes. This game has 9 levels...9 levels and how many levels did MOH:Frontline have. Like the title says,What happend EA.	1
I am so disgusted with this game that I refuse to even see it to the end...WHAT A WASTE OF $50. If you have this game, do yourself a favor and trade it in ASAP. Get yourself a real game. I will not even bother commenting on the game play cuz I think most of the guys here did a great job of describing it. Just do yourself a favour and let that god-forsaken game collect dust on the shelf. The creators of this game should be ashamed of themselves!!	-1
Its online fun but not as good as frontline	1
sure these games are always fun but lets face it.  The graphics aren't good at all and the battles although fun, get very very repetitive.  the new pokeone is a great new addition and will still live up to the atmosphere of the pokemon stadium games.	1
It has different levels and different racetracks. Didn't take long to complete the levels. Had different drivers and different cars.	1
This is my favorite game. The grafics are great. My dad even plays it. Everyone is saying they beat it n 2-4 hours. That is impossible to do. It took my that long to get to the 3rd level. There are 9 levels. It has multiplayer and multiplayer campain like in Halo. You get to pick how smart the computer people are in multiplayer. In the first level you have to get out of a battleship then you get on the deck and shoot down Japenese planes with a anti-aircraft gun. When your ship gets bombed you become the gunner on a U-Boat. Its really cool. After you defend the battleships you beat that level. In the next level your in the Philepies. You have to get back a lost amunition truck and safley cross the burning bridge. The next level is the hardest. You have to survive a midnight raid on a enemy camp. The next 5 levels are cool too but my favorite one is the last level. You have to destroy a enemy aircraft carier. After you set it on fire you hop in a plane with a british soldier and fly around the carier shooting planes with the back guner. Its really fun being the back guner. If you liked Medal of Honor Frontline you would like Medal of Honor Rising sun.	1
"Medal of Honor: Rising Sun" surpasses "Frontline" to be the best game I've ever experienced. Although the game has fewer levels (five missions spread over nine levels, compared to "Frontline's" six missions and nineteen levels of play), the levels are longer and more complex than the levels found in "Frontline." The best part of the game is the recreation of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Through two exhausting levels, you become witness to the event that would define our nation for an entire generation. Fans of the "Medal of Honor" games and all types of first-person shooter games will not want to miss "Medal of Honor: Rising Sun!" Grade: A+	1
STINKS!!! BUY "XIII" AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! THATS ALL THE ADVICE I CAN GIVE..."XIII" IS MOST "UNDER" RATED GAME OF YEAR!!!	-1
The 2 Player Cooperative Genre is a small genre indeed.  It had it's fun in Arcades with such games like Gauntlet.  It was popular in the Nintendo world with Ikari Warriors and other hack and slash games as well.  Socom is probably the best multiplayer cooperative, but requires online play, and really isn't fun when two players are in the same room.  Games such as Desert Conflict 2 could have been perfect if they got the level design and save points correctly, but the genre never reached that pivotal point until now. Granted it's not perfect, but it sure is fun and mesmerizing while it lasts.  First off, the atmosphere is amazing.  It really feels like you're in the jungle with all these enemies in camouflage attacking you.  There is a bit of strategy involved as you have to discuss who goes where and who gets health.  The game only ends when both players die, so sometimes you have stay back to let the other one take the hits.  Really fun.  Most levels require trekking through a jungle, fighting enemies, and completing objectives.  The graphics and scenery are not only fitting, but play well with the level design perfectly. Yes, there is also a single person  mode, but from what I hear, it's nothing compared to Medal of Honor: Frontline. Here's the bad though: The gun controls (I use a standard PS2 controller), are jerky, and the player's movements are a bit too slow.  The first level consists of you walking up a ship and then firing lots of gun fire from stationary guns.  While the atmosphere is beyond impressive, it gets old after a while.  There are about 5-6 missions total, and unfortunately, a friend and I finished it just 5 hours on the normal setting. There is also online play, which is somewhat cool in that exists.  The online play, however, only consists or Quake like deathmatch and team deathmatches.  No cooperative level game play like Socom.  Unfortunately, the people who do play are not that fun to talk to, and are quite the First Person Shooter Nerds who will kill you as soon as you turn a corner.  It really only works when you can get enough people for a private room. All in all, it's a great game with great atmosphere, but way too short. Pros: Great atmosphere Superb two player cooperative mode At least has some type of online play Levels are intuitive Cons: Way Too short First two missions are pointless Save points have to be found, cannot save anywhere Jerky gun controls Online play is boring, ruined by FPS nerds Hours to Complete (Cooperative): 5 hours (normal setting) Difficulty Level: Easy Frustration Level: Non-existent	1
Mega Man Zero 2 is a textbook example of how a good video game sequel should be done.  Not only does it address the latent issues and problems with the first Zero game, but it goes one step further to make for a very strong platforming title skilled gamers should consider. Zero 2 returns us to the distant future where Reploids (sentient robots) are the subject of genocide attempts by Neo Arcadia, a faction created by humans to eliminate the Reploids, whose free will they believe is a threat to their livelihood.  A new commander for the Reploid resistance movement, Elpizo, goes on the warpath to bring Neo Arcadia down once and for all.  The story presented in Zero 2 is a notably complicated one that links elements from the Mega Man X series and the previous Zero game. Aside from the sinister new bosses and stages, there are a lot of things to find and collect.  Zero 2 brings back the Cyber Elf system, where you can raise elves so you may take on special powers.  Zero also has a Shield Boomerang (deflects shots back at enemies) and the Chain Rod (a grappling hook).  There are also special Forms that change Zero's appearance and add special attributes tailored to your playing style.  Finally, there are EX Skills, special attacks and moves, that are rewarded to the most hardcore of games.  Clearly, there is a lot of incentive to replay the game. Graphically, this game continues the high standard set forth in its predecessor for fluid and vibrant animation and design.  Again, expect subtle use of "Mode 7" effects and transparency details to create rather compelling environments.  Sound is one of the most improved aspects, with the music being more catchy and memorable than in the previous game.  There is also a liberal use of voice effects (the final boss is particularly well done in this regard).  The controls, as we would expect, are nearly flawless.  However, I would echo the sentiment that the Chain Rod demands a little too much precision. I had two complaints about the first Zero game, both of which are rectified in Zero 2.  The primary complaint was that feeding Cyber Elves energy was a tedious process that bogged the game down.  In this game, there are more locations with copious elf energy capsules such that this doesn't become a problem.  The second was the overall difficulty and limited continues.  Zero 2 goes back to the traditional Mega Man arrangement of limited lives, but unlimited continues, which greatly eases the game.  Additionally, there are up to four Sub-Tanks (energy refillers), a 2x life meter upgrade in the game, and an upgrade that makes spikes and lava non-lethal.  In other words, the Cyber Elf system works as it should - it can make the game much, much easier for the casual gamer while maintaining an extreme difficulty level for the diehard fan.  For using elves, you are penalized by not getting a high rank for each stage, but this does not affect the ending - only the ability to get special EX Skills. Drawbacks?  I think that for casual gamers, the game is still a bit ruthless early on.  Trying to beat your first boss can be challenging.  There should be a pushover of a boss, along with a very easy stage, among the initial four.  Second, compared to the Japanese-to-English translation of the first game, Capcom kinda' botched this one.  Although the plot makes sense, there are a lot of unprofessional grammatical errors and mistakes that should have been caught by translators.  But, clearly, these are minor problems to an otherwise great game. If you think all of the Mega Man games are the same, or thought that Mega Man X7 was a disaster, Mega Man Zero 2 should restore your faith in the series.  Even for newcomers, this is a great platform game - one of the best on the Game Boy Advance.  Highly recommended.	1
Wow this is a great game but not what I thought it would be like.  Ok so its really really fun but its alot eazyer then the first mmz.  Some of you people are probably saying right now what are you talking about it was hard!!!!!!!  but really mmz1 was harder than mmz2.  I hope they make a mmz3 because at the end of mmz2 when you beat it shows you a sound only box saying something but I for got since its been so long since I beat it.  even though it was eazyer this was alot funer than mmz because of now armor and other stuff.  THIS IS A MUST BUY GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
MMZ2 is one of the best GBA games I've ever played!  BUT, for those people that said it was hard...  Never played MM&B! (Mega Man & Bass)  Any ways.  MMZ2 is so cool with the new changes and styles with Zero's armor!  This game is the bomb.	1
Ok, this game has nice graphics, and cool music,but if you don't like hard games, you might not want to buy. The concept is good,the gameplay is good,and control is normal. Ya youll be slashing, or shooting,and think its the best game,like I did,once you get to the scorpion boss thing,ohhh boy,Yuo go through so much and hurt your thumb,youll stop for awhile. The game is ok, but not great.	1
The Game Boy Advance is quickly becoming the Mega Man system. In its less than three years on the market, not only has Capcom created two original Mega Man game series in the form of the Mega Man Battle Network and Mega Man Zero, but has also brought back a long-lost gone portable with Mega Man & Bass. But just as the company did back in the NES days with the original Mega Man series, Capcom's churning out sequels to its GBA series, creating new experiences by reusing assets from the past games in the series. It's certainly worked out for the company as it can produce sequels on a faster than yearly rate, and it's worked out for fans of Mega Man as they can get their hands on more of their favorite game franchises. Mega Man Zero 2 is definitely among this tradition. When the series was started last year, it was the first real and original Mega Man game for the Game Boy Advance, and because of that it definitely added to the game's excitement value. Mega Man Zero 2, a continuation of last year's adventure, builds upon everything already established in the original Zero, and though it definitely adds a few new elements to the mix, there really isn't anything here you haven't experienced already... it's just a lot more of it. More CyberElves, more abilities, and more frustratingly difficult level design. Mega Man fans know just what they're getting into, though, since Capcom's notorious for its almost evil level design, and in this sense, yes, Mega Man Zero 2 is a worthy follow-up to the Mega Man line. But it's not as special or as significant release as the original game was when it hit shelves last year. Mega Man Zero 2 is set a year after the ending of the original Mega Man Zero, in a world where reploids are unjustly attacked by an organization called 'Neo Arcadia.' Early in the game, Zero falls prey to a trap set by Neo Arcadia's ruthless and newly self-appointed commander. Though she appears on the surface to be fighting for the good of the world, she tricks Zero into helping her with her ultimate plan and use him to wreak chaos between reploids and humans. Players are faced with the same gameplay that was already established in the original Mega Man Zero: blast through run and jump, enemy infested areas and complete these missions in order to advance the story forward. Last year's game was a little sloppy in its mission layouts, but it's been tweaked better for the sequel since players now have unlimited continues to complete the specific level. But that doesn't make it any easier, since players still have to get through the challenges with their storage of extra lives (usually three in reserve)...and if the level challenges don't get you, the end level bosses -- these gigantic monstrosities with wildly varying attack patterns -- definitely will. Just as with most of the Mega Man action games, the game does really boil down to one specific pattern: waste your lives by memorizing the level layout and perfect your abilities until the end boss. Then, it's all a matter of losing your lives trying to defeat the end boss. Mega Man does rely heavily on hardcore gaming skill, but don't be naive...there's a ton of trial and error involved as well. Along with the player's standard blaster and sword abilities (both which upgrade in abilities the more you use them), players can also equip more "weapons." The most significant is the Chain Rod, which is essentially Capcom giving Zero the same ability as another one of the company's past videogame heroes, Bionic Commando. Players can utilize this chain to swing from ledges as well as grab out of reach items (or bring enemies up close). Level designs definitely put this Chain Rod to use in several places, which makes it a good thing that players can easily equip it as Zero's main or secondary weapon. The clean controller interface is definitely one of Mega Man Zero 2's strengths, but trying to use the Chain Rod is a little frustrating. It's a little stiff in its design, and collision has to be absolutely precise...and in many levels, if players can't get that Chain Rod off at the right time, it's a quick life lost thanks to the many, many, many bottomless pit deaths in Mega Man Zero 2. CyberElves also make a return in this sequel, and there are a lot more of them. CyberElves are Mega Man Zero's version of the Pokemon element of collection; if players find these fluttery little sprites after defeating an enemy, they can scoop them up and utilize their specific powers during the action. Some turn on-screen monsters into power-ups, others freeze them in place. Zero can only have one CyberElf equipped during a level, so it's a bit of a strategy for players to pick the right elf for the job. But their appearance is almost entirely random...though specific ones hang around the same area, they sometimes just refuse to appear. There are other enhanced elements in this game, including the Mega Man-esque ability to use acquired boss power-ups for a near perfect level run, as well as upgraded, palette-swapped forms players can collect throughout the game...there's not a whole lot in this sequel that makes it a whole new adventure. Except for maybe the multiplayer support; find a friend with a copy of the game and you can go head-to-head with them in three different "race" type modes. It's definitely a neat and welcome inclusion, adding a little more competition to the game design. Yes, this game is hard. Like the other members of the Mega Man franchise, Zero 2 features some of the most challenging videogaming you'll ever experience because the designers never let up on the difficulty. It's meant to be a tough game, possibly to give players a real sense of accomplishment defeating these level creations. But it certainly wouldn't hurt the game if the creators sloped the difficulty curve a little more in the player's favor, especially early in the game. If you're frustrated easily, this game is not for you. If you loved the original Mega Man Zero there is absolutely no reason why you won't love this sequel...unless, of course, you're looking for a brand new gaming experience. What it lacks in new elements it makes up for it in tighter design and more ass-kicking level designs...don't think for a second that this game is going to be a simple trek through. If anything, it's an excuse to see just how much patience you have, and just how much gaming skill oozes from your fingertips.	1
They just keep making these games better and better each year.  While I suppose this one is now dated, as it is no longer 2004, this is still a fun and entertaining game.  If you are wanting a good NASCAR game you have found in this or any other one made by EA.	1
I almost really enjoy this game.  I'm on the fence here. The Goods: *  Graphics have been improved.  Despite some complaints about the smoke you'll find in corners (usually caused by your own car sliding the previous lap), the graphics have been greatly upgraded since the '03 version. *  More depth in the Career mode.  Your sponsors now drop you for poor performance. *  More money earned from Sponsors.  If you don't make your Sponsor's performance requirements, you still receive a per-race fee. *  The Rival system - More on this in the "Bad" section. *  EA Sports Bio - This feature is great.  If only we could get EA to roll over saved Career, Dynasty, Franchise saves from one version to the next.  It sucks to spend a year on a dynasty mode only to have to start from scratch when the next year's version comes out.  Why hasn't more noise been made over this?  I know, I'll write EA. The Bads: *  The Rival system - I really, really like this idea.  However, it was WAAAAAY overdone.  You tend to piss people off during short tracks.  This is a given.  The problem is, you'll have rivals taking you, and themselves, out of a race out of hatred.  How often have you seen a set of rivals take each other out on the first lap of Daytona in real life?  Exactly.  Fix this EA. *  Rival Icons - At least you can turn this visual off.  When on, you have a heck of a time judging distance to turns, as the icons obscure your view. *  Qualifying - I constantly get dumped by my Secondary sponsor because I can't qualify worth a crap.  It may just be me, I may suck at driving a clean line.  But it shouldn't be this tough. Other than the insanely intense hatred you apparently receive from Rivals on this game, it kicks.  If EA tones down the Rival reactions (Like turning 90 degrees and t-boning you on the first lap on Daytona, for example) and allow you to carry-over Careers from previous versions, I'd crown EA the Gods of gameing.  Until then....	1
What more can I say. Well, the newest and latest edition to the Medal of Honor franchise is here and available on the Playstation 2. Of course it would be better than Frontline because it is a new and up to date game. But some things have changed and some things haven't. Of course EA would keep the game in first person mode, but there has been some slight alterations that have made this MOH unique. Like the fact that there are bonus/hidden objectives and that at the end of each mission you are graded on 3 different things: Hits Taken, Accuracy, and Bonus Objectives completed. All of these categories makes getting a medal a very tough and a challenging thing indeed. Also you can find certain items that will aid you later on in the game and make things much easier, but you have to look for these things. Now let's talk about the levels. Well to say the least, these levels are huge!! I'm not kidding. The Day of Infamy level (Pearl Harbor) is very well done and is fun to play over and over again. But most of the action takes place in the jungle (duhh! You're fighting the Japanese around the Philippine Islands) and the Japanese pop up in the most unlikely places and ambush you from behind. So watch your back. And like I said before, the levels are massive. There are so many different paths to take you could easily become confused, but they're fun all the same. Next we are going to discuss weapons. Well there is not a whole lot to talk about. There has not been that many changes. You will have the usual M1 Garand and the ever faithful Thompson SMG, and yes you have your Shotgun, and your Bazooka, and oh yes, your standard Mark II Frag Grenades to chuck at some holed up Japs. So now you want to talk about controler capabilities. Well let me say this, there has been a slight change since Frontline. The throw Grenade and Reload weapon capabilities have their own separate buttons which really uses up all the buttons on the controller and their are more controller layouts than Frontline had available. So there you have it. Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is yet another great game from Electronic Arts and if I have heard and seen correctly, there will be a sequel to this game (the first sequel for the Playstation MOH series) which continues this game's story. Bottom Line: Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is a really great game to open up a new theater of World War II.	1

Game works great, some visible scratches but nothing that hurts the game. I Purchased mine through Warehouse Deals.	1
Best game.	1
Are you all kidding or what?  In the context of the game's release, Mega Man Zero 2 is the best in the series!  Just compare and contrast the original with this sequel, and the results are obvious.  GameSpot's review on this game is accurate, but it harshly condemns this game for being so difficult.  The difficulty, most would concur, is pronunciated in the beginning, where Zero has little health and must fight two Golems and a Mecha Scorpion...and survive the onslaught!  I admit I was a bit daunted by the number of mini-bosses in the game's onset, but after the first batch of bosses (namely after Phoenix Magnion) the game does not hate you as much.  The game's sprites look wonderful.  Mega Man Zero features more hand-drawn characters and landscapes, and that is okay, but Zero 2's looks are simply amazing for a handheld game.  Not only have the graphics sharpened, but the quality of the game's music has improved greatly.  Some of the stand-out tracks include the Train level, the Computer Zone (both the Rooftop and the base) and the Neo Arcadia Temple.  How can reviewers say that the graphics have been recycled from Mega Man Zero, when plainly the characters look more vibrant and well-animated?  The difficulty in the game is also increased by the number of levels where you largely depend on the Chain Rod to traverse.  The Forest of Dysis, for instance, got on my nerves because I had to jump a certain distance in order for my Chain Rod to grapple on the floating machine.  You can't get too close to the agent you wish to latch on to.  I learned that the hard way.  Another thing is to swing to the other side correctly.  In a very realistic manner, you to have swing back and forth to gain momentum prior to leaping across, or you may find yourself exploding to bits after 4 or 5 tries.  The cyber-elf system is a little easier to use, but it's not dramatically different from the first game's system.  Basically you talk to Ciel if you want to download a cyber-elf (they're basically sprites that endow Zero with upgrades and abilities), but some cyber-elves require that you feed them Energy Crystals, or you can't transfer them.  As the game progresses, you might want to consider downloading the cyber-elves that increase your MAX energy because the bosses get bigger (but not always badder).  Too bad this affects your Mission Result ranking permanently, for the rest of the game.  I can't complain however, because even though I finished the game with a C Rank, I obtained 99% of the EX Skills after each Boss Battle.  Cutscenes are considerably more abundant in this game than in any  of the other Mega Man Zero installments.  Particularly astouding graphics are what makes this game such an enjoyable experience, in spite of the difficulty setting and the acquisition of Zero's forms, which is my subsequent topic.  Zero grows stronger not only by the collection of EX Skills he absorbs from his adversaries, but also by obtaining "Forms."  These forms are like a physical evolution.  They can only be attained when you embark on a Mission:  That means you CANNOT obtain a form on an already completed mission!!!  That makes forms a rarity, because you get them only by performing certain kinds of actions.  For example, you get the X Form (so called because of X's weapon of choice, the Buster, and by the Form's color, blue) by KILLING 50 enemies with your Buster before the Mission ends.  If you want to know about Zero's other forms, check out gamefaqs.com.  The plot that drives Mega Man Zero 2 is as engrossing as the first game's.  After separating yourself from the Resistance Base for a time, Zero wants to find a purpose for living, as well as search for clues about his past.  However, he's in a rut, and he looks for Ciel and the Resistance.  When he is rescued by the Resistance Reploids, he discovers that the leadership and management of the Reploids has been passed down from Ciel to a mysterious figure named Elpizo.  He was formerly from Neo Arcadia, but he was ostracized (kicked out) and is now the Commander of the Resistance.  As Zero takes on Elpizo's orders to infiltrate Neo Arcadia and ultimately destroy it, we find that he's got a hidden agenda running.  The Dark Elf, a creature that used to be benign and which was X's hope to ending the Elf Wars a 100 years ago, is now a source of evil energy.  Elpizo is obsessed with the Dark Elf and will do anything to get his hands on its boundless power.  While this game doesn't reveal TOO much about Zero's relationship to X or their past, it doesn't mean this game isn't good.  It keeps you interested in what other things will transpire.  Play Mega Man Zero 3 and you will come to learn a lot, but you might not think that game as challenging or as fun as Mega Man Zero 2...but that might just be my personal opinion. :)  It's so much fun kicking the crap out of Leviathan, Fefnir and Harpuia, I'll tell you that much!	1
Mega Man Zero 2 is one of the better GBA games to come in a while.  It is also one of those rare moments where the sequel more than surpasses the original.  In fact, Mega Man Zero 2 surpasses its predecessor in almost every way possible.  The game takes place one year after the first Mega Man Zero.  The game begins with Zero wandering through the desert looking for the resistance base when he is suddenly ambushed by the enemy.  He lives long enough to get to the resistance base where his weapons are fixed and he's ready to battle the threat of Neo Arcadia once more.  The game has a story similar to the Mega Man X series and the previous Mega Man Zero game.  Neo Arcadia, a faction built by humans, wants to "retire" all the reploids (by retire they mean destroy) since they see the robots as a future threat.  With peace nearly in reach, Elpizom the new resistance leader seems set on destroying Neo Arcadia. But Elpizo and Zero, you'll quickly learn have different views on what a Utopia should be.  The gameplay isn't much different from Mega Man Zero.  Zero can do all the same abilities he did in the last one.  He can dash, jump and use any of four weapons of his choice.  Zero's four weapons consists of his Z-Buster, Z-Saber, Chain Rod and Shield Boomerang.  Each has its own properties, for example the Z-Buster allows Zero to attack long range but the cost is he doesn't do much damage.  The Z-Saber allows him to deal massive damage but he needs to be right in the enemies face.  The Chain Rod allows Zero to hit enemies from a distance with medium damage.  The Chain Rod also allows him to swing from ledges.  The Shield Boomerang is a shield that deflects shots.  Each wapon can also be charged up to do double the damage.  Each mission plays out similar, but they're not straightforward to defeating the boss.  Some missions require you to rescue certain comrades, destroy certain objects and many other side objectives.  Each mission has a boss as well.  Mega Man Zero 2 takes a small step above the first one with its Ranking System.  After each mission you're graded on a scale that ranges from S to F. S being the highest.  But there's more to it than just having a ranking and a nickname.  If Zero should be at an A or S rank bosses will use a special attack that Zero can acquire called an "EX" skill. There are ten of these skills in all but new comers shouldn't attempt this until a few runs through the game.  Zero can also take on different "Forms".  Each form gives him different properties.  One could give him lots of defense and speed and limit his power.  One could give him more power but limit other properties.  Each form Zero takes changes his color.  The Cyber-Elf system is back and it remains unchanged.  You find Cyber Elves in every level by defeating enemies, destroying containers or defeating the mini boss in a level.  Cyber Elves are divided into three categories, Nurse (health), Animal (Enhance Abilities) and Hacker (Change level).  Zero can also feed his elves and make them stronger.  Some elves have permanent effects but Capcom makes sure that if you want all the EX skills and everything Mega Man Zero 2 has to offer then you must master going through the game without using the more powerful ones.  Using the more powerful elves drops your ranking.  Visually, Mega Man Zero 2 looks great!  Zero looks about the same as he did in the first one but backgrounds and levels are much more vividly detailed than before.  The game also sounds incredible!  No Mega Man game has ever sounded this good.  Remixing old tracks from the last installment and adding in several new tracks.  Its as if Capcom knew exactly what was wrong with the first one.  This game is also much much longer than the first one and offers lots more to do.  The game has more stages and they're much longer.  This game is also a CHALLENGE!  We all know that once you got the hang of Mega Man Zero (or if you were a Mega Man X veteran) then Mega Man Zero was too easy.  But when you first pop this in, even Mega Man veterans will find this new one to be a challenge!  The challenge can be a little frustrating at times, especially when trying to maintain your A or S ranking but a good challenge always presents a good game.  Capcom went all out to make this better than the previous one by changing everything that was bad about the first one and keeping all that was good and the result is a well defined sequel that no Mega Man fan should miss!  The Good  +New improved gameplay  +So much more stuff to do  +Longer than the first one  +More challenging than the first one  +Music is better than the first one  +More abilities than in the first one  +Just all out BETTER than the first one  The Bad  -The game may be too challenging for those new to the Mega Man world	1
Classic Pokemon game. Is very nostalgic brings so many memories.	1

ok, this game to me is very cool, as at the beggining you get to shoot down Zeros, cool graphics at the beggining and great sounds. i bought the game for 30 and so far i think it was worth the money. i bought it 3 days ago and im already on the 7th level. The japs are un-real, they run up to you and swing their sword at you, pull put a grenade and blow their heads off :) WEll, your team mates are stupid, The japs will control a built to the ground machine gun miles away. and your team mates would just stand there and shoot wi th a pistol. silly. great weapons, but you only get to use like 3 of them in 1 level so you do get bored of them. MOH frontline was good, but i think this beats it by a whisker :) multiplayer! good old multiplayer! 2 players - GREAT! 4 - players - you need glasses, the crosshairs are so small you need to be like 5cm away from the screen. i havn't played it online, and im not going to. i think, you should buy it, not sure? rent it then buy it :)	1
The Single-Player Campaign is extremely short.  On the default setting, I was able to beat the game in one night.  However, unlocking the bonus features/multiplayer 'skins' was nearly impossible for me. In any case, I enjoyed the campaign of "Medal of Honor Frontline" much better; however, I'm going to say that "Rising Sun" is a much superior title than its predecessor due entirely for its Multiplayer Option.  With 2 players, you can add 6 more bots, and there's hardly any slowdown.  But if you add 4 human opponents (+bots), you'll get enough slowdown to give you an incredible headache.  Another problem with 4 players is that the crosshairs become more difficult to see, and a result, your aim at far-range will suffer (especially with the Garand rifle). All in all, I'd say get this game if you enjoyed "Frontline" especially if you felt that a multiplayer option was badly needed in the first PS2 MoH.	1
I don't like this game	-1
Fun thx	1
Kids loved it. Christmas gift.	1
The multiplayer is horrible, you need a gba to play it. But the story mode is fine I guess.	1
The Nintendo Game Cube has good games like Metorid Prime,and Super Smash Bros Melee,but Pokemon Collaseum is amazing. It's the best RPG pokemon game I've ever played. I highly recommend this to a pokemon fan.  Unlike the cute,simple gameplay pokemon is known for,this game is dark. The storyline is very deep,and full of dark themes. The player is a young boy,he is part of team Snag,a evil team that takes pokemon and use the darkness they have. The young boy teams up with a girl,and the two go around snagging pokemon. You can steal trainers pokemon,if their a shadow pokemon. Shadow pokemon have shadow moves,and are evil. Every battle is a double battle,but it's fun. There are tons of towns and cities. There are pokemon Centers and shops. Tons of trainers you can fight too. This game is well made,and is a great RPG. The graphics are amazing for a pokwmon game. Pokemon Stadium was great,but not as good as Pokemon Colosseum.  Since you can play Nintendo GameBoy games on the Nintendo GameCube,trade your Ruby and Sapphire pokemon onto your game. There are tons of awesome pokemon like Bayleaf in Colosseum,so trade it into Ruby and Sapphire.  There is a Colosseum,battle area,and you can battle pokemon on different modes. Like easy,medium,and hard. There are different teams too. You can even trade your Ruby and Sapphire pokemon into it to fight.  GET THIS GAME!!!! IT ROCKS!!!! STORYLINE AND POKEMON ROCK!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!	1
Love this game	1
The game is great I love it so much! y childhood is soon to be restored, though the price that I being offered for here is completely outrageous and not worth it! Who spends over 100 dollars on a game you can get for 25 at an old gaming shop, like I did? Not worth the price but I still love this game, any Pokemon fan would.	1
Really fun game, I actually never played it before which I know is odd (only played XD: Gale of Darkness) but hey, I liked it, glad to play it.	1
Loved it and i still do it works just fine. I payed $40 for it not bad, but maybe to high but is is a compete game which is great. Did not freeze or stop or get slowed. Came in the usps and got here in 3 days fast.	1
It's one of the funniest pokemon game's for gamecube.	1
I love it, Thanks	1
I LOVED Medal of Honor Frontline. Its one of my favorite games on the PS2 to date. Maybe thats why i had such high hopes for Rising Sun. First off let me hit the main complaint, yes its to short, and the back of the box trys to make it look like theres more missions than frontline. While in Frontline each Mission has many sublevels ranging from 2 to 6. Each Mission in Rising Sun is just one mission and once you finish it you go on to the next mission. So really they cut down on amount of gameplay. Yet just because its shorter doesnt mean that its a bad game. Really if you think about there aren't that many games that give you ur $50 dollars worth these days, like i bought Lord of the Rings: Return of the King the other day and i beat it in 3 days. So although its bad that theres less gameplay i still get a lot of use out of it because i replay games but not everybody does so be warned, yes this is a shorter game. Now a lot of people have said that the multiplayer isn't great, in fact some say its down right terrible, but i don't have the online adaptor and i have no siblings who play video games so i cant really say how the multiplayer is, i just have to go on what ive heard. And the AI is a big let down. At first, yah its cool that the Japanesse hid in the ground and run up and stab you but it gets old real fast, usually they just stand out in the open reloaded so you can easly kill them, and they still don't notice when you snipe someone standing right next to them. But those are only the down sides to the game. You still have a very solid shooter here, and despite flaws its at least worth a rental if you don't decide to buy it, but i would go with buying it because i really enjoyed it for the about eight hours it took me to finish this game. I wish i could give this game 3 and 1/2 stars because thats what it really deserves. I just think everyone was expecting another frontline.	1
...1.compared to frontline the graphics are pretty bad. 2.i beat this game is 3 hours. 3.the only thing you do is shoot people. 4.its easy,for instense i let a japan shoot me then i sit there he takes an hour to reload i could shoot a million people before he takes another shot. 5.hear rumors about multiplayer and online,well multiplayer stinks because its only a challenge against your friend and the guns stink. And for online better but still very unintense and bad. 6.the funnest thing is the begining:shooting down planes. 7.last but not least,there are no challenging parts in this game all it is is shoot japs and a couple tanks.in frontline there were guys with bazookas(none in rise of sun), better tanks,way better grenades,nazis actually threw the nades,and more variety of nazis that shot at you like shiefs.	1
week upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping  to get the new MOH and onee day it's there so i put it in the ps2 and it's kind of like the terminator... kill kill sometimes have a hard mission, the AI sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the HARD difficulty level the extremely anti-climactic ending. WAY to easy i beat it in 1 day and took it back, no re-playability. back to its to easy, way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a 8 year oild could beat this game.. take my advice don't even rent this game,find a friend who has it and borrow it, i don't think they'll care it's so bad	-1
Oh what a disappointment.  Frontline was very big shoes to fill, and this game did not even come close.  Rising Sun is too short, too simple, not inventive enough, and a clear cashing in by EA on an established franchise.  The first criticisms are self explanatory, as far as it being not inventive enough it was just because it was just such a plain vanilla FPS.  Lots of shooting, cookie cutter levels, a fairly small selection of weapons, and an uninspired story line, not a list of things that I was expecting to see from the sequel of one of the best PS2 games of all time. I only gave the game two stars because the Pearl Harbor opening is breathtaking, but it is a gigantic let down from there.  The only other real highlight is an acceptable multi-player setup, which was missing from the first game.  However if I were given the choice between the multi-player and a game with a length similar to the first one I would take the longer game. What is perhaps the most galling about this game is that there is another sequel on the way for next year.  Now we can see why this game seemed too short by half, because it is only half!  Rent this game don't buy it, and hope that the sequel to this sequel is an improvement.  Shame on everyone at EA for soiling a great gaming franchise.	1
New and fresh although the game comes with faults I personally like this game better out of the orre duo. As long as you can deal with rui	1
As advertised, meets expectations	1
Great loved it.	1
son loves it	1
I still can't believe how much this is worth in my store. Good game.	1
not much of a game if i have to start all over again. There must have been some kind of glitch when I played it or something	-1
Its pokemon duh its epic	1
YAY	1
This is a must-have game for all the pokmon fans !!!	1
There is nothing more gutwrenching than seeing the Arizona jump up into the sky, and turn over onto its side and sink. There's flak, guns blazing, and Zeros flying all over the place. They try to make you feel what it was like to be in the battle of Pearl Harbor. They add confusion, mixed emotions, etc. The multiplayer is quite fun. They're up to 4 "real" players, and you can have up to, I believe 10-12 bots or so. I'd highly recommend this one to your list to buy.	1
This game is awful. Very bad graphics by a first person shooter. Ugly, bland enviroments with bad atmosphere. Seems they went bachward from the first one. They now added a multiplayer mode witch is essential to a good FPS, tobady is sucks. I never understood what was going on and it is easy to get lost in the jugle witch all looks the same to me. Get red faction 2 instead. Did't live up to the standard as the first one and is a huge disappointment.	-1
I have a rule that if I own ONE of something that says Pokemon, I keep it.  PokeFan forever and always.  I never had this game, but I know I need it to trade up all of my retro styled Pokemon.  I clone them in Silver or another later game, and I can transfer them up to the current games of X or Y.  This game was missing from my link of being able to do so (like trading a Charizard to Silver, teach it fly, and then trade it back), and now, it's a worry no more.  Decided to do so while the prices are still cheap (under $100).	1
Great game, around 80 hours of play time to fully complete, 1 VS. 100 challenges and more, my favorite gamecube game, if you liked super mario sunshine and luigis mansion, this'll be right up your alley.	1
This was a gift for my son for Christmas. He is a pokemon fan so he very much liked it.	1
Extra, extra, read all about it.  The latest MOH is not as good as the last one, Front Line.  Not to say that I didn't enjoy it.  I particularly liked shooting down Japanese aircraft onboard a ship and engaging enemies in the dense woods, but the graphics took a step backwards.  On a positive note, you can save anywhere, a feature every shooter game should have.  The controls are perfect.  For these reasons, I gave it 4 stars.  This game is a keeper and I'll play it again, but I expected better from this great series. Oh yeah, the word for today is "flawsome", i.e., meaning awesomelly full of flaws.  That's how I would describe "No One Lives Forever" for Playstation 2.  I bought that game over a year ago and I still can't get over how bad it was/is.	1
This game is fun just like all Resident Evil games. If you liked the others, you'll like this one too. A must play for a Resident Evil fan.	1
I bought a GameCube system for just one reason: to play the Resident Evil. The first game's remake was a total masterpiece. Even though I still prefer the first version, the REmake (that's how I call it) is one of the best games in history. The Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis' ports were fine, I've already beaten those games before, but it was always good to buy them again for a very little graphical and sound update and for a trip down Memory Lane, if you know what I mean. Resident Evil Zero wasn't that good, I've expected much more, but the graphics were gorgeous. And now it comes the last game before the long-awaited Resident Evil 4... Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X. Yes, Code Veronica first appeared in the Sega DreamCast, it was a top-seller in that plataform. Soon, the X version, including some extras, and different things throughout the game, came for the PS2. Another Greatest Hit it was. The GameCube version of Code Veronica is much alike the PS2 version, but it has graphic updates and another different things that differ the GCN's version of the PS2's. The game soundtrack is fantastic. Not as good as the first game's, but it captures every room's spirit. Almost perfect, no complains. The voice acting is also a great thing, every character has its own style, from the eccentrical Alfred Ashford until the sweet Claire Redfield's voice, everything matches so well. Another score for CAPCOM! Graphically, the game isn't as good as Resident Evil Zero or Resident Evil, the remake, but it's almost there. The character's expressions are really good, even considering this game was originally released in 2000. Approved, graphically. The controls may be a little complicated for begginers, because even though this is a 3D game (yes, it feels great to play Resident Evil in a 3D universe, there aren't pre-rendered backgrounds anymore, like in every other game, it's now fully 3D, and it rocks!), you still must turn and walk, the controls are still almost the same from the other Resident Evil games, if you've played them, you'll get along very fine with this one. And, just a touch in the C Stick and your character turns 180 degrees, it's very helpful. Yes, once you beat this game, there are some extras... I don't want to spoil your surprises, but there are very nice things... This game is going to keep you amused for a while. Oh yes, I must also warn you that this game may be scary for younger children, so I'd recommend this game for 15 and up. So, my friends, to be ready for Resident Evil 4, you must play, beat and, even better, buy all the five Resident Evil games (REZero, REmake, RE2, RE3, RECVX) already released for the GameCube (they're all avaliable at Amazon.com), because they're all very worthy their prices. Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X is one of the best games ever, and you must play it to understand the whole series. Trust me, it'll be one of the greatest experiences ever in gaming universe.	1
Many people missed this when it came out on Dreamcast. It was later ported to PS2 with the addition of the Wesker Report. The PS2 version was called Code Veronica X, I guess the X stands for Xtra content. The bottom line here is I played the game on Dreamcast and it is one of the best RE games out there right now. It is the first RE game to be featured in a fully 3D world, the camera follows you except in some areas where the camera is static for effect. It doesn't follow you like a chase cam, but instead the camera is situated somewhere in the room and follows you as you walk by and such. Another benefit of the 3D engine is that you can have real time lighting from gunfire and explosions. The walls will light up when you fire your shotgun, pistol, etc. No to mention the light affects your character. If the room is dark then so is your character. Light sourcing enables a new realm of reality. RE 4 coming to gamecube later this year is also featured in 3D. Since the Gamecube is much more powerful than the Dreamcast it looks like everything is prerendered. Code Veronica is an excellent game and the camera is a lot better than in some RE games. I found only a few spots where you were taken off guard by zombies in tight corridors. The environments are freaky and very well done. And of course the music is completely dark and forboding just like in the other games from the series. You will not be disappointed. Pre-order now and add this to your collection with no worries.	1
I swear I thought this game would start off like any other pokemon game, the little kid is about to leave her/his dear mommy to embark on an adventure where it's obvious you try to get all 8 badges, go to the Elite Four and beat the Champion while dealing with Team Rocket or whatever team that's the villian. But thank goodness this game was different. You got this main character who has this awesome anti-hero vibe going on with him, he has two awesme pokemon that aren't level 5 and you're dealing with a new threat that will change the Pokemon world. To those who think Pokemon is for little kids, they haven't play this game yet.	1
I was slightly disappointed by this game. The multi-player option only allows you to play a friend if they have a game boy advance and a connection cord. This game also doesn't have mini games like Pokemon Stadiums past. The Story Mode is pretty fun though and the overall gameplay is good. Overall, it is a good game, not a great game.	1
Overall, I will say this game is fun. I like that there was an actual plot to the game (as opposed to Pokemon Stadium 1 and 2), the graphics are very nice, the music is kinda catchy, the controls are pretty easy to figure out, and it's just cool to see your favorite Pokemon in 3D. Also, I think there's some feature that allows for transfer of Pokemon from Game Boy Advance games, but I don't know how well that works since I never had a GBA to begin with.  Honestly, my only issues with this game stems from the selection of Pokemon available to you and the lousy move lists. You are only allowed to capture Shadow Pokemon in order to purify them...and that's fine, except a LOT of the ones you must capture are pretty crappy Pokemon. But that's just me. For example, if you love Fire types, prepare to be disappointed: the only Fire Pokemon you can get before you beat the game are Slugma and Entei. And yeah, Entei is awesome, but as someone who loves a lot of Fire Pokemon, I was sorely disappointed in how few Fire types there were. That might not be an issue for some people, but prepare to make alternate battle plans that do not require Fire moves if you intend to play this.  It wasn't just the lack of Fire types, though - just the ones you can catch in general were kind of "blah." You can expect to catch things like Dunsparce, Ariados, Quagsire, Qwilfish, Sudowoodo, Gligar and a few others I wouldn't ever use because I think they're kind of lame. There are some good choices, though - you can capture the three legendary beasts. And the lack of really good Pokemon has forced me to give other Pokemon a chance in battle that I'd never have bothered with before (like Mantine and Medicham). Also from what I have seen, there are no Pokemon in this game that require an item to evolve (like elemental stones), so don't expect to get any of the Eevee evolutions, Ninetales, Arcanine, Vileplume, Victreebel, Starmie, and so on.  TMs seem to be few and far between in this game - you can't buy them. You need to do what are called knockout challenges to earn special coupons that can be redeemed for TMs. However, it's like the Game Corner - you need to take forever to save up enough of the coupons before you can get anything decent. And most of the TMs you find during the game are things like Attract and Rain Dance - stuff that causes no real damage. I think I used three of the TMs I found during game play: Return, Steel Wing and Earthquake. The rest were sold.  Despite the length of my rant, it's really just a minor flaw in an otherwise fun and challenging game. It just kind of irritates me that you can't capture normal Pokemon along with the Shadow Pokemon in order to build a better team. Your job is strictly to steal corrupted, evil Pokemon and purify them with love and return them to their original forms. And I gotta say I have never felt so good about beating a Pokemon boss as I did when I faced Miror B. - a man in a gold disco suit with a two-tone afro who looks like a Saturday Night Fever extra. I say this because the man has FOUR Ludicolos and I am more than thrilled to beat down anyone with a team like that. In short, I would recommend this game to Pokemon experts and newbies alike because it's just got a neat story.	1
The game is awesome since it has both Story mode where you snag and purify pokemon and Battle Mode where you battle right away. You can have the three legendary beasts, Entei, Suicune and Raikou. You have a choice at the beginning of the game between Bayleef, Cyndequill and Crocanaw. You can snag pokemon like Absol, Quagsire, Mantine, Slugma, Noctowl, Skiploom, Houndoom, Misdeverus, and so many more. You snag up to 48 pokemon. And you can also try to optain Ho Oh! Totally fun game!!!!	1
(Daughter Writing Review)  I'm going to say this right off the bat, I may be biased to this game because it was my first Pokemon game, and boy am I glad it was. The story features you playing as a teenage guy, who must prevent the world from being taken over by this organization called Cipher. Cipher uses Pokemon which have their hearts artificially closed, making them ruthless and dangerous. You must capture these Pokemon back from them by "snagging" them and opening their hearts again. As the story progresses, you will learn more about the organization, make friends and foes, and, of course, have lots of Pokemon battles!  Unlike the Handheld games, you will not be able to capture Pokemon while roaming freely around the towns. There are no badges to collect, but they do have a gym in this game. This game is very easy, but capturing and purifying all of the shadow Pokemon could present a challenge for you, especially if you decide on purifying a few shadow Pokemon and then focus on raising a team. There are plenty of trainers to battle in this game, and in my opinion, this is the best game to raise Pokemon due to Mt. Battle. The music is very good, the best I have heard in a Pokemon game.  However, the stadium mode is, not the best to put it lightly. The game is far too easy, meaning if you work fast enough, this game could be completed in a few days. Sometimes, capturing the shadow Pokemon could be a bit frustrating. You could get their health as low as possible, and put as many status problems on it and it would still bust out of the Pokeball, but that's a minor problem.  Overall, this game is highly fun, but I feel that older fans may not enjoy this game as much as I did. Without the presence of gyms and badge collecting, as well as freely catching as many Pokemon as you choose, some fans might feel a little strange and upset while playing this game. I can understand why, but it's a nice change of pace, and I recommend it.	1
First off, just to let everyone know, I actually picked up Pokemon XD (the sequel) and played it before this game, so now I've experienced the story out of chronological order.  Go me!  Well, because of this, I'm going to be comparing this game a lot to its sequel, Pokemon XD.  I'll also be making some comparisons to the handheld Pokemon games (if you've never played one of those, why are you even reading this?).  So anyway, here we go!  Graphics (score 7/10): Well, as far as I can tell, the graphics are sort of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, the 3D models for the pokemon look very good.  However, the character models on the people are sort of meh.  I think it's the art style that I don't really care for.  Everyone has sort of a "pinched" look to their face.  All the people look very cartoony, which is appropriate for a Pokemon title, so I won't really hold it against them.  Overall, the graphics are just average.  Music (score 7/10): Some of the music is remixed versions of songs from the handheld pokemon games (the pokemon center theme comes to mind).  Some of it's original though.  The music as a whole is pretty bland (except for The Under's theme music, it rocks!).  It doesn't really stand out in any way, which is appropriate for a pokemon game.  The music is meant to stay in the background, providing a pleasant backdrop for your gameplay.  That being said, the music seems to get uncomfortably loud a lot, forcing me to turn down the T.V.'s volume moreso than I do for any other game.  I had the same problem with XD, so I really don't know what's going on with that.  Maybe Nintendo's thinking that young children need to go deaf?  Characters (score 5/10): Oh boy.  Well, I know this is a Pokemon game, and Pokemon is not known for its deep and complex characterizations, but come on!  They really dropped the ball with this one.  This is some of the poorest characterization I've come across in a game.  For example, your main character, Wes, is a silent protagonist.  That's not ideal, but it's okay since I've come to expect that from pokemon games.  In the opening fmv, he blows up a criminal organization's building (Team Snagem) and then flees with their device, the Snag Machine (let's you steal pokemon from other characters).  He used to be a member of Team Snagem, and the entire game goes by, literally, without the player ever getting to hear his motivation for doing so.  Why!?  Did he have a change of heart?  Was he angry with the boss and wanted revenge?  Is he a pyromaniac and a compulsive back-stabber?  We'll never know.  And that's just one example.  How about his friend Rui?  She joins him and after finding out he's a former member of Team Snagem, she just dismisses this and decides to trust him all within a single sentence and with no explanation as to why she believes in him.  Sigh, as we say on the internet, you FAIL!  All the other characters, like the villains, are stock and one dimensional, so nothing to get excited about there.  Amusingly, Pokemon XD has better characters than this game, so I guess Nintendo decided to improve or something.  Story (score 7/10): Well, after Wes's mysterious change of heart, the story basically follows him as he goes around thwarting the plans of Team Cipher, an organization that makes evil pokemon called Shadow Pokemon.  So basically, the whole story is just him and Rui chasing down the leaders of Team Cipher and stopping their plans.  It's pretty basic; it's on about the same level as the handheld Pokemon games.  Still, it's enough to keep you entertained and playing, so I guess it's no problem there.  I kinda like this game's simplicity; it's sort of a good break from more serious RPGs. It's kinda cool seeing the pokemon world in 3D, and it truly feels immersive.  Oh, and the town of "The Under" really reminded me of Midgar, so that's a plus too  Battle System (score 9/10): The battle system is just like the handhelds; it's turn-based.  I really like this type of battle system, so I'm really pleased.  My only complaint is that I feel like sometimes the camera spends a little too much time panning around the battlefield, which slows things down.  Just so you know, just about every battle in this game is a double battle.  I have no idea why, but everyone just pulls out two pokemon at a time even though they are always battling alone.  Go figure.  That being said, it's still just as fun as single battling.  Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  For the most part, the controls are good, but I do have one big complaint.  Your partner Rui follows you the whole game.  If you turn around in a tight corridor, she blocks your way, forcing you to walk really slowly until you can move in front of her again.  This is really annoying.  I know it doesn't sound like a big problem, but after awhile, it really starts to wear on your nerves.  Other things of note...  You cannot capture any wild pokemon.  All pokemon you get are shadow pokemon that have been taken from other trainers, so this is in no way a proper 3-D version of the handhelds.  It's still fun though, even if the selection is a bit limited.  My other complaint (a problem which is improved upon in XD) is that it takes too long to purify shadow pokemon so that they can be properly used.  You can, however, import pokemon from the GBA games to use on sidequests after you beat the game, so I guess it's not so bad.  On a side note, there's still stuff to do after you get your end credits (just like the handhelds) so this helps extend the long term playability of the game.  Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I felt like Pokemon Colosseum wasn't really a bad game, it's just not great either.  I still enjoyed it, but I don't think any non-pokemon fans would get much out of it.  There's really not much here for the general RPG enthusiast since the characterization and story are so basic and simple.  Well, if you're a fan of pokemon, go ahead and pick this up (you can get some good legendaries to import to your GBA games), but if you are just a general RPG fan, I'd have to recommend you pass on this game or pick up Pokemon XD instead.  Even though I did enjoy them about equally, XD is objectively the more polished and better game out of the two.	1
Positive: + great story + the first true Pokemon adventure in 3-D + Colosseum mode is pretty extensive  Negative: - things just take a little too long sometimes - only 48 shadow Pokemon  Pokemon Stadium had been Pokemon's only foray into the wonderful world of 3-D before 2004, when this game came out. They only had battles and minigames, no real adventure. But with Colosseum, a full 3-D adventure and story was added to make for a really great game.  The story is actually good, believe it or not. The evil corporation Cipher has made some Pokemon evil (shadow Pokemon) and it's up to you to stop them and snag as many of the evil ones as possible, bringing them back to normal along the way. The story remains at least a little engaging throughout, but it really bugs me that the main character doesn't say one single word in the whole game.  The gameplay is basically the same in battle as any other Pokemon game, but every battle is a double battle. This is cool sometimes, but some single battles every once in a while would have made for a bit of good variety. The game is in full 3-D, which is really cool to see essentially for the first time (Stadium doesn't really count, it wasn't an adventure like this).  The game's visuals are pretty good. The GameCube isn't pushed to its full potential here but they do a fine job. The battles animations go in a fashion that's way too set-and-stone with absolutely no variety at all. Every Pokemon has a couple animations for attacking, one for getting hit by an attack (which goes every time they're hit with an attack no matter what it is), and one for fainting. The lack of physical contact between the Pokemon is heavily disappointing, as it would add much to the battles.  Aside from the great adventure mode, there are lots of colosseum battles as well. You can do sets of battles or do the Mt. Battle Vs 100 challenge, which takes a long time. There is really a lot to do here and it's a nice supplement to the single player. You can also play this mode with multiple players, and GBA games can be connected and the Pokemon from those games can be used in battle.  Pokemon Colosseum put the franchise in a great new direction. Not only did it give us the first true 3-D Pokemon game; it introduced us to a whole new region of the Pokemon world that would be worth revisiting for another shadow Pokemon themed story. So to sum it all up, Colosseum should disappoint no Pokemon fan.  Gameplay: 8.0 Graphics: 7.5 Sound: 8.0 Value: 8.0  FINAL SCORE: 8.2/10	1
This game tickled my fancy from the get-go. Since I didn't have the option of owning Stadium for the N64, I purchased the next-best thing. I was initially blown away. I had never seen my Pokemon in 3d before, and my jaw dropped when I first saw them in a battle. Don't get me wrong, there are flaws in this game, and the premise might be a little too dark for younger Pokemon players, but I was searching for a little more grit and grime in my Pokemon taste, and this game fit the bill quite nicely. I REALLY miss the sounds that the Pokemon make, saying their names and whatnot, but I can overlook the little flaw and see the game for the Pokemon enjoyment that it really is.  Pros:  It's Pokemon in 3d! Graphically superior to Pokemon Stadium Sounds are good during battle sequences Transfers from Ruby/Saphire are possible  Cons:  No trademark sounds from your favorite Pokemon characters Gritty, dark..you're kids might not like this version  Overall:  Great game to add to your Gamecube collection, and great game for any Pokemon fan to enjoy. Get it's sequel as well if you're a collector of all things Pokemon.	1
Pokemon Colosseum is the third game in the Pokemon Stadium series, and it's a bit different from its predecessors, in that it's not just a fighting game, but it's also the very first Pokemon adventure game for the GameCube.  In Story Mode, there are a couple of evil organizations: Snagem and Cipher, who steal Pokemon and turn them into evil "Shadow Pokemon".  You play as a boy who once worked for Snagem.  However, at the beginning of the game, the boy causes an explosion at the hideout, wrecking its equipment, and escapes with his Espeon and Umbreon.  Soon enough, you rescue a girl with the ability to sense when a Pokemon is evil, and the real adventure starts.  The object of the game is to raise Pokemon, of course, and to steal the evil Pokemon from the bad guys so you can make them good again.  Here are the pros and cons of this game.  PROS:  It's a LOT of fun (duhh).  The graphics are really good.  The background music is also really good (with the possible exception of when they use harmonicas; that gets stuck in my head).  There's a lot in it.  CONS:  The final boss is really really really really really really hard.  You can't save wherever you want--you have to find a special computer in a certain part of wherever you are.  (This is EXTREMELY annoying--I almost got stuck playing it well into the night because of this.)  You can't play as a girl.  However, there is a girl who follows the main character around, and you get to name her, but it's not quite the same.  Overall, this game is really quite good, if a bit frustrating from time to time, and it's certainly worth buying.	1
Excelent Thanks so much	1
DO NOT BUY FROM WAREHOUSE DEALS, INC they scratch their discs around the edges so they are unplayable past the opening screen for some reason. My guess is that someone is using one of those old disc cleaners that scratches discs or something.	-1
sent me the right game for the wrong system	-1
I came here to primarily discredit the majority of game rating websites online which rate this game bad on gamecube. Its an Awesome resident evil game just a notch below the awesomeness of resident evil 2 and 3. I actually like it better than resident evil 3. The atmosphere really puts you in your seat, especially the beginning scenes by the crashed helicopter and prison, eewhhh, got chills just remembering the dog scene from under the... well play the game. I haven't played the HD version yet but accordingly from my own experience, the gamecube version is better than any other version because of the controller which I prefer over dreamcast, although dreamcast has the hud display on the memory card.	1
I bought this game to complete my resident evil collection and I was not disappointed. I should warn in advance that this game is unforgiving, so if you mess up with item collection or ammo conservation, and you get to a critical point in the game without either...you are screwed. Anyway, since I am an RE veteran I already knew what I was getting into. I don't know why people are complaining about the controls as they are exactly as all the previous RE games, so that is a ridiculous point to criticize about this game. This game does have a bit of backtracking, but it is nothing impossible to whine about like people have been doing. Overall, it is an interesting story and I just love Claire, my favorite female ;)	1
I HAVE PLAYED AND BEAT ALL RESIDENT EVIL GAMES ON EVERY SYSTEM PS1,SATURN,N64,DREAMCAST,PS2,GAMECUBE,XBOX360,GAMEBOY COLOR,DS,PS3 AND WII. Code Veronica is only better then Dead Aim, Gaiden and Survivor! But the gamecube version knocks dreamcast off the couch a bit. And Ps2 version is same as Gamecube realy. If you haven't played it get it for under $25 or you will fill robbed. I have ps2 and dreamcast versions too both much cheaper but if you only have a cube then give it a try Story is ok gameplay is repetative and controls are bad but better the Dreamcast. If you have a PS2 head too Lukie Games and get it for $10 with box an book otherwise get the gamecube from someone fullfilled by Amazon they have best Gamecube games at best prices why I always get Gamecube games at Amazon and Nes and Snes and used Xbox 360 games too!	1
Ok, I just bought this game and have played it just two hours.  But that was two hours straight the first time I put it in and I don't get to play console games for hours in a row very often.  I can rack up more time on GBA Pokemon titles but this game was exactly what I wanted.  I am very pleased with the over all aspects of the game but am especially pleased with the graphics that are a lot better than GBA and I am playing it on a 32 inch tv so...I just love it.  I agree with another review that said the story is rather "dark" but that is a nice change of pace so far.  If you haven't played the GBA games, I suggest you try those before buying this game.  I can see how this game will delight fans but I am not so sure about it doing much for new comers since it is pretty easy at first.	1
Pokemon colosseum is a nice game,but once again I'd like to bring up something important about this game! Much like Pokemon stadium,there seems to be alot of strange coincidences within this game. Listen carefully... While playing pokemon colosseum,you're bound to notice several odd coincidences that always work in your enemies favor! Such coincidences may include;Low-accuracy moves hit you without fail,Your enemy's pokemon is far stronger than normally possible, Your enemy can switch pokemon even when the moves "Mean Look" & "Spider web" are active,and lastly,One-hit KO moves like "Fissure" never seem to fail or miss! Take note: These things will not always happen but they do happen sometimes within the game. I've come to call these coincidences "Cheat-Detectors" because they only seem to happen when you're doing particularly well in a battle. C'mon,that's just not a fair thing to put in a kid's game!!! With those things aside,this is a very good game,and it's worth the $19.99 that you would usually pay for it.  The story starts with a young heroic figure named "Wes" who's just succeeded in destroying the hideout of a notorious criminal organization, "Team Snagem" Wes has managed to destroy Team Snagem's hideout,and has also managed to steal their latest project,the "Snag-Machine" a machine that enables pokeballs to steal trainer's pokemon from them. But little does Wes know,Team Snagem was just a warm-up for whats coming next! Wes must face the mysterious criminal syndacate,"Cipher" if he ever wants to rescue the pokemon that are being made evil for criminal purposes. He better watch out,Cipher makes past enemies like,"Team Rocket" look like what they really are,Over-the-top saturday morning cartoon bad guys.  Pros:New story mode with a convincing enemy,can enter your GBA trained pokemon into this game,very nice looking graphics,and a few toe-tapping melodies,and somewhat convincing enemy crime-syndicate.  Cons:You cannot upload your pokemon from previous games like pokemon Red/blue & Gold/silver, requires a whopping 48 memory card blocks to save, No spoken diologue within the game, most tasks within the game are to hard for me let alone a child, takes a really long time to purify Shadow pokemon, and you can only register one party of pokemon at a time.  NOTE:If you want to play this game you'll need two things, a memory card that can store over 48 blocks, and a GBA/Gamecube link-cable. You only need the cable if you plan to use GBA pokemon, don't buy any other cable besides the offical Nintendo brand, any other type of cable won't work! "Trust me, I know from experience that a non-offical link cable won't work!"  For more information on "Cheat-Detectors" checkout my review on pokemon stadium.

As a long time Pokemon fan I was slightly dissapointed by this game, I mean it was good, but I think it should've been 2 games. The part I enjoyed the most (the actuall "Colosseum" part), with the battle mountian and stadium, I think could've had a few more features if it had been a game by itself. The 100 trainer knock out challenge, with your Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Fire Red, Leaf Green, or Story Mode pokemon, is the funnest aspect of the game. The Story Mode could have been better, quite frankly, I'd expected a little more from the first 3D pokemon RPG. The whole concept of "snagging" pokemon from trainers, and then purifying them is a little lacking, and doesn't work as well as catching wild pokemon. It would have been better if there had been more pokemon to choose from, there weren't a whole lot of good pokemon to snag. The best pokemon in the game are your starters, espeon and umbreon. Also, it's hard to have all you're pokemon at high levels by the time of the final battle; because they can't go up any levels before they are purified, and that takes awhile! If I were to re-do Story Mose, I'd stick soley with espeon and umbreon the whole game! Another thing I'd like to note is that all battles in Story mode are double battles (where you use 2 pokemon at once), which isn't nessearely a bad thing. It's not that Story Mode isn't fun, I just didn't feel it lived up to its Gameboy counterparts. Another thing is that some pokemon movements (such as the jesters they made when they first appered on the field and some attack motions) are gone, it's not really important, but takes away some of the personality of the game. I'm eager to see if the newely annouced sequel to Colosseum, currently titled: Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness, does a better job than Colosseum. I have heard that there will be a wider range of pokemon to snag, that's a start. In this new game, it seems you will start with a Lv. 5 eevee (the un-evloved form of espeon and umbreon, as well as flareon, jolteon, and vaporeon), it seems you will probably get to pick your "eon" this time. Anyway, bottom line is, if you're a pokemon fan, I recommed getting Coloseum, it's great to see your Gameboy pokemon battling on the 100 trainer challenge, and it is an experiance to play a pokemon RPG in 3D. Overall, it really is a good game.	1
Maybe my favorite! you can play as more then one person and its a good buy if you love Resident Evil!	1
For starters, I have played and still own every major Resident Evil game in the series including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Code Veronica, all of them being on the GameCube except RE5. Definitely one of the best video game series of all times. While RE 4 is my favorite with the remake of RE 1 a close 2nd place, Code Veronica is still a great game.  Story: If you remember RE 2, Claire was searching for her brother Chris (from RE 1). The trail leads her to an Umbrella facility in Paris, where she is captured and taken to Rockford Island. Wesker unleashes the T-virus on Rockford so she is let go by the prison guard and tries to escape. After escaping via a plane, the autopilot is engaged by her captors and flies them to a remote island in the Antarctic, yet another Umbrella research facility. After being captured again, you take over as Chris Redfield and try and free her.  Gameplay: Survival Horror, 3rd person, single-player. If you have played any RE game then you know what to expect. Puzzles, zombies, boss fights, scrambling to find enough ammo for your weapons. Code Veronica is the first game in the series to use 3D backgrounds instead of the pre-rendered ones. The camera is big improvement from before and it is not just a fixed position. It will move between two fixed points, giving it more flexibility. The quick 180 turn is still in this game. Weapons are standard from what you would expect such as handguns, shotguns, launchers, etc. Some new things include the return of custom handguns parts as in RE 2 and some new ammo has been added such as crossbow arrows can be explosive and anti-B.O.W. rounds for the grenade launcher. If remember the 2nd play through of RE 2, the gameplay of Code Veronica is affected the same way. Whatever Claire leaves in the storage containers is there for Chris to use and same goes for weapons she used or didn't use.  Fighting: Killing zombies is the same as in RE 2 & 3. The laser sight accuracy didn't come to the series until RE 4. You can still do the usual- blow zombies heads off, shoot high or low. There is a sniper rifle and linear launcher in the game that lets you shoot from 1st person but everything else in the game is 3rd person.  Conclusion: Graphics aren't amazing but still good considering this is a port. Controls are easy as the other RE entries. Sound is excellent. While I enjoy a good challenge in gaming, this entry in the series is one of the most challenging. Try and remember to conserve what you can using Claire because if you don't, Chris won't have anything to use and can make it so challenging that you have to restart and try again from the beginning. The RE series is going to stay in my collection. If you want an updated version of this game, including updated graphics, menus, item placements, trophies/achievements and a leader board system, it was released on XBL and PSN in Sept. 2011 as well as an updated RE 4.	1
resident evil code is such a awesome yet crimenily overlooked resident evil game to me my 3rd favorite resident evil game next to RE 1 and RE 2 if you love the gamecube versions of RE 1 and RE 2 then you should really give this game a shot its classic resident evil you won't be sorry	1
Just great, for the price. Its a great item for resident evil fans, even the code veronica X is a very rare title for GC, if you are a RE collector, you don't must miss the RE Code Veronica x for GC, its the same that the RE for PS2, but its like a limited edition for GC. And the game its unforgivable to miss for a real Resident Evil Fan.	1
I bought this game based on the absolutely enjoyable experience of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and Medal of Honor: Frontline and I for one, really enjoyed this one as well! For the grumpy people who are slammin' it, don't believe them. They probably have friends and relatives who worked on Call of Duty. Maybe it wasn't up to the %100 standard that the two previously mentioned games are, but for my $50, it was money well spent. Finished the game in a few days and wanted MORE, MORE, MORE!!!!! If you love the idea behind Medal of Honor, you will enjoy this game just as much as I did!	1
This game is not what I had expected.  For one, the graphics suck, and to complete Pokemon Leaf Green/ Fire Red pokedex, you have to beat this game, which isn't an easy takt to be done.  All in all, i don't reccomend this game.	-1
I think it was a great idea to bring to the game cube so all fans can enjoy this series. Thank you very much, great game	1
Three months after the terrible Raccoon City incident, Claire Redfield is now working as a secret agent whom is trying to destroy everything of the Umbrella corporation including trying to find her brother Chris. While in Paris trying to sneek in the Umbrella labs in Paris she got arrested then sent to a prison island in South America, however the T-virus has broken out on the island bringing the dead back to life and letting loose other mutations. Claire escapes from her cell as she joins up with a boy named Steve as together they battle against the undead and other weird mutations for they must escape the island together and head to the Arctic to find Chris especially a hidden Umbrella lab over there.  An exciting and sometimes challenging installment of the franchise! here you play as Claire then her brother Chris in this game. The graphics are very impressive with the 3D Polygraph look with realism even to the enviroments, new weapons including some old ones, cool monsters and more zombies as well. This game does require brains even to beat the Tyrant in the first half of the game but here's a small hint: save up fire arrows until the last part of the first half where you have to kill him. The gameplay can be tricky but you can get use to it, and of course it's scary as hell. This is one 2-Disc set that is bound to get RE fans hooked, of course it may be kind of difficult for some but figuring stuff out will help you.  I highly recommend this game!	1
Being a Resident Evil fan who's gotten into the series recently, it's kind of hard to play each game and figure out which ones your favorite since the newer ones tend to be the most treasured while the oldies show their age and just aren't that fun. Whereas the REmake is probably my favorite so far, Code Veronica I could classify as my least favorite out of the main canon games. It's not that it's a bad game overall since it's RE as we all know it and love it and it's more progressive in its story than 3 was but at the same time, it just wasn't as fun to play as the others.  Story: 3 months after the Raccoon City incident (depicted in RE2 and 3), Claire Redfield is captured after an unsuccessful raid at an Umbrella Headquarters in Paris and imprisoned at an Umbrella-owned island named Rockford Island. Teaming up with a fellow prisoner, Steve Burnside, Claire finds out the background behind one of the Umbrella founders and their family as well as the plot set by an old acquaintance.  Graphics: I think it's very easy to say that Code Veronica is probably the blandest of all the games as far as graphics go. At least the Playstation games looked at least a bit colorful and while it did look polygon-deficient at times and other things were awkward, CV at times looks more impressive with bigger camera moves during gameplay, improved character designs and animation and 3D background uses as opposed to pre-rendered ones. However, the color scheme, with its dull grey-blue combo, just looks bland and the games doesn't have as vibrant a color palette as any of the games.  Sound/Music: Whereas the series always had bad voice acting, Code Veronica doesn't stray from this with actors for Steve and Alfred just sounding awful and while Claire's voice fits her character, others have either unemotional or just awkward readings. The music as well is not that memorable and while some music is exciting and gets you going, it leaves your brain rather quickly and even the always dependable Save Room music doesn't really hit me.  Gameplay: CV is the first RE I've played in awhile that doesn't bear resemblance to recent ones like Zero or REmake. Meaning that there's a noticeable difference in a few things such as zombies who die or get shot, the weird nonsensical puzzles (granted, they always had them but these at times felt vague) and a greater emphasis is placed on ammo consumption since you can easily find yourself sans bullet should you shoot everything. But CV, while a good story, just doesn't have the best presentation and the opening Rockfort Island section just didn't excite me like the mansion or the police station did.  As far as the difficulty is concerned, the game is a little bit unforgiving at times since there's plenty of zombies who can take their fair share of bullets and when they can respawn after awhile, it gets trying to duck around them when there's not enough space to (not to mention their rather long reach). Puzzles as well can be difficult to figure out and it's hard to tell how to solve a puzzle since the second half is meant to solve the puzzle while you're looking all over trying to figure it out and plus, who builds stuff like this anyway?  The story is interesting and it's always good to see the Redfields have their own game but Code Veronica is a game that needs a REmake-style overhaul since the game itself is just good enough to warrant a playthrough.	1
Resident Evil: Code Veronica was probably the most advanced and beautiful game the RE series had ever seen when it was released on Dreamcast a few years ago. With the DC's popularity dying off rather quickly though, the game was ported to PS2 a year later, and given the Wester Report, and renamed "Resident Evil: Code Veronica X". However the version of the game which appears on the Playstation 2 and this version on the Gamecube, have no differences whatsoever. This is exactly the same game that most have already played through on the PS2 or DC, and as marvelous as it may be, it is not worth purchasing again on the GC if you already own the original. Capcom did get lazy when it came to rereleasing RE 2, 3 and CV on Gamecube, but they were simply hoping to capitalize on the market that had not played any of the RE games before they made their way to GC. If that's the case, and you don't own a PS2, then this is a good chance to play one of the best installments in the RE series.  Story wise the game shifts back to Claire Redfield, who has never located her brother Chris Redfield after the events of the first or second game. Her quest leads her to a mysterious island which apparently has a few things going on that are less than normal. Her quest takes her across two continents, and through more zombies than you'll know what to do with. It's definitely the best story line since the first RE game, and is a major favorite among the RE faithful.  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it was the first RE game to be featured in a full 3D environment. The camera follows you the majority of the time when you move (except in certain circumstances where it is static for scary effect), and creates wonderous lighting throughout the game. When you fire a weapon you will see the light on the surroundings of the room, which gives it a true to life genuine feel. The 3D world creates some beautiful graphics (at the time they were amazing) and a feel that is not only lifelike, but genuinely creepy.  Control wise this is the same as every other RE game, just re-adjusted to suit to the GC control pad, much like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0. If you've played any RE game before, especially on the Gamecube, then you should have no problems jumping right into the game and getting to things. If you're new to the series, then it might take some adjusting, but since you're buying the re-release on GC I'm guessing you've at least played one Resident Evil game on the Gamecube, so there should be no problems.  However if you already own this game on the PS2 or Dreamcast, there is absolutely no reason to buy this one. It's just a port, no added extras, no enhanced graphics, no nothing. There's nothing different from this than the game you already played 4 years ago. This is mainly aimed at the audience who only played Resident Evil on the gamecube, and its Capcom's attempt to capitalize on that. Marketing the game at $40 though, is ridiculous, especially when you can buy the same exact game on PS2 for $15. Fans should definitely realize this before they go shelling out cash on a game that they can get for an unbelievably cheaper price.  In the end, Resident Evil: Code Veronica is still one of the best games in the RE franchise, both story and game play wise. The addition of the 3D element added wonders to the game, and is still one of the reasons why this one should be played. This version is only a port, so if you own the original on either DC or PS2, it is wise to stay away from this one. If you don't own a PS2 or DC and have never played this game, then I would recommend buying it, if you can find it at a decent price ($20-$25). Otherwise stay away, because you're getting ripped off. Capcom exhibited a lot of laziness when it came to re-releasing these games, and it's pretty insulting to fans like myself who love the game and would have at least liked to have seen the game touched up a bit. Alas that didn't happen. Only buy if you can't get the original, and beware of ripoff prices.	1
Resident Evil Code: Veronica X is a port of the original Dreamcast game, and includes the extended cutscenes from the later PS2 version. You are Claire Redfield, and must escape from an island controlled by the Umbrella Corporation. You'll battle zombies, mutant animals and other abominations of nature. Halfway through the game you'll journey to the antarctic, and you'll take control of Claire's brother Chris as he tries to rescue her.  I've completed all the Resident Evil games with the exception of the Rebecca Chambers prequel, and Code: Veronica is a rather lengthy and intricate, yet difficult adventure. This is the first game where I've had to restart from the very beginning multiple times because I simply used up my ammo and healing items too quickly. The programmers weren't shy about placement of many of the "harder" enemies (such as the Tyrant-esque Bandersnatches or the infamous Hunters), and while usual player instinct is to gun these creatures down, there are even tougher boss monsters further in the game that need the ammo. Also, the more powerful weapons and ammo seem to be hidden on optional sidequests and backtracking, so players who don't really explore every area to its fullest are outta luck later on.  Otherwise, Code: Veronica has probably the most complex storyline of all the games, and it's set up in such a way that just when you think the game's coming to a close, you've only reached the halfway point. The voice-acting is typical Resident Evil, earnest in a deliberate B-movie kinda way but with one or two miscast actors (read: Steve). This is also the only game (excluding RE4) with full 3-D backgrounds and a dynamic camera.  So should you buy the Gamecube port? If you have a Dreamcast or PS2, you can find those versions for much cheaper. Storywise the game is worth it, but of course the graphics are somewhat dated, even if the atmosphere is still convincing. Best bet for Gamecube owners is to find a cheaper, used version before shelling out big bucks for the retail price. Capcom has stopped production on this port, so don't expect it to come cheap.	1
I can't give this game much credit, with the exception of the audio.  The game is very short.  Six hours on an FPS is laughable.  Half of that prblem is the AI.  I don't know about you, but when I need to reload I try to take cover.  Instead "they" go to an open area, stop, then start reloading.  That isn't AI at all.  The walking fungus in Mario was smarter. The weapon selection is a bit on the short side.  I know it took place in WWII.  I also know there was more than FIVE guns (a fire extinguisher doesn't count).  Yeah, I can mount guns.  They look a little different, but feel the same.  Sorry. I might be too critical of this game because of anticipation, or maybe the game was over-hyped.  I gave it a chance, and I was let down.   P.S. There is always XIII	-1
A slightly less impressive port of the original Dreamcast game with some extra features, pretty much sums up the GCN version of Code Veronica X. This is a great game, one of the better Resident Evil\'s in my opinion. Now, if you still have a Dreamcast, you should get it is more impressive visually and the VMU health meter is a nice touch and alternative instead of having to hit pause to check your current condition) Capadded about 5 minutes of cutscenes to this version, but really, if you never see them, you\'re not missing out on much as it\'s basically just a bunch of the cut scenes slightly longer and a more drawn out ending sequence (which actually hinders the moment IMO) So, if you don\'t have a Dreamcast, I\'m sure you can look past the few flaws and enjoy your 5 minutes extra of a great Resident Evil game. NnyCW for CapCity	1
This game was not as interesting as the other games, fisrt of all, it was twice as long as the other games, which means that you can get tired of it more easily. The new enemys, mostly zombies and bandersnatches are really hard. The game also features our well known second favorite female character : *Drumroll* Claire Redfield! The game also has a new enviroment which to me is more confusing, its not my favoirite, but better than Outbreak, Survivor, and Dead Aim.	1
Many RE fans are giving the Gamecube ports bad reviews citing the fact that "This is the exact same game I played on Playstation! Weak!" Fools, these ports were not made for you.  Resident Evil has been around for eight years now. It started on the Playstation, then it jumped to the Dreamcast, now it's on Gamecube. While true blue RE fans from the Playstation era got themselves a GC so they could play the REmake of the original RE1 and the prequel RE Zero and the upcoming RE4, the majority of Gamecube owners had never played any of the original RE games in their Playstation or Dreamcast incarnations. These Gamecube ports are for them, so they can enjoy the entire series along with us salty veterans.  That said, I personally only recommend RE2 and RE Code Veronica to the newcomers. RE3 adds almost nothing to the continuing storyline. RE3 did have some good gameplay, but it was unsatisfying to me because it had no "Normal" difficulty setting. You had to choose either Easy or Hard. Easy was insultingly too easy, and hard was more difficult than I like. I've never understood why they named it RE3, and named this Code Veronica. RE Code Veronica is the true sequel to RE2; its story literally begins where RE2 ended and then continues forward, whereas RE3 actually begins *before* RE2, and then eventually ends shortly after the events of RE2, feeling quite pointless when all is said and done. Code Veronica should have been given the title RE3, and RE3 should have been titled simply RE Nemesis.	1
Resident Evil Code Veronia X is one of the best RE games on the game cube to date (RE-4 is not out yet, and it is looking like it will overtake RE CVX). But not counting RE4, RE CVX could very likely be the best RE game yet. This game is so great, you start off as Claire on an island, the virus leaks after an old enemy launches an attack on the island. You then must get off the island which is easier said than done, however you meet a new friend along the way. You finally get off (if you're good that is) and then you go to a very cold base (take a guess where). After playing as Claire for a while longer, her brother Chris takes over, he arrives on the island and finds it is empty (well almost empty). He must then fight his way off the island and get to the base where Claire is. The games ending sequence is great, and it alone is worth the game price... Your Resident Evil collection will be incomplete unless you add Resident Evil Code Veronica X to it. bryanreo@sbcglobal.net	1
I was expecting Pokemon stadium 3. But this is not it. What it really is, is just a new edition of the Gameboy series. I've been a Pokemon fan since Red and Blue versions, (the first two games of the gameboy series) Liking it all. But ever since the beginning it has been winding down. Now with the new Pokemon Colosseum, it took a jump... Down. There's some major problems with this game like, where's the plot? How come you can't go in-between towns? Why so little Pokemon? Why do the bad guys look mutated? Well I can tell you this I was very disappointed at this almost a Pokemon game	-1
I had high expectations for this release based on things I'd read about it, and I figured that this release would be even better than Frontline. After having finished the entire game in about six hours, I'm a little dissapointed. The graphics are incredible, it's obvious EA's advanced them well beyond where they were for even Frontline. But the A.I. is still not too bright except for perhaps the Guadalcanal invasion level. The rest of the levels the enemy just isn't too bright and you can mow them down easily. I did enjoy the different types of missions however. In this game rather than most of the missions set in towns like Frontine, they're set in towns (including one part in a hotel) but a few are also in the jungles of Pacific islands, which is a fun change, including one where you've got to go running through a wrecked train. However, the missions just seem too short. I was shocked at how fast I could complete every mission except perhaps two where I got lost and had to find the right way back again. The in level saves probably are the difference as to why every mission seems shorter, but I think they're a bonus because if you die you don't have to completely re-do a level if you've saved. PRO-- 1. Graphics are great 2. Added gameplay including riding an elephant and also missions where you're in a PT boat at Pearl Harbor and using AA guns. As well as a tail gunner for an airplane in the final mission. 3. In game saves lessen frustration CON-- 1. A.I. still needs work, the enemy is still not too bright 2. Missions are too short, the game could have been longer. I have read that this is part I of a two part series, with part II coming out sometime in 2004. There is a cliffhanger at the end of this game, I hope the next release perhaps takes us all the way to Japan. THAT would be fun!	1
Ok, lets start things off, I like this game, and I play it quite a bit, but I"m an old school RPGist and the concept of constant levelling up is a past time of mine, so I just go on auto pilot. The Story mode is ok, its not the greatest, but it doesnt utterly suck either. Although I do feel that seemed to end it a bit too fast. There are really only a handful of Boss fights and they seem to be over and done with so fast, that was a tad disappointing. The fights also seem to be uproariously unbalanced. The fights leading up to said boss are at one level and then the boss is 10 levels higher than them, and you cant level up in preparation for him. Though its not all bad, these are just a few of my issues regarding it, and there are ways around them once you figure it out, which mind you isn't all that hard. The real jewel of this game are the colesseums and the battle mode and of course the fact that you can take your Gameboy Advance pokemon and trade them and train them on a much higher graphical setting , ie the Gamecube. The multiplayer mayhem of whooping your friends pokemon can be quite entertaining especially in the 4 way battles. I have to say I had a great amount of fun in capturing the shadow pokemon and waiting to see if the capture was successful or not. I am hopeful that in the next Pokemon game they put a little more depth into it for those of us who aren't 8 or 9 years old. All in all, this a fun game, but more so I think if you're a Pokemon fan.	1
This game has some really nice graphics.  The idea for the storyline is using dark Pokemon makes the game interesting.  However, there is waaaaaayy too much battling and not enough adventure, just when you think you might actually be getting somewhere up pops another battle.	1
This is a great game and pokemon fans probaly love this game but it is very odd in many different ways. This game does not have pokemon that you an chose from the game. Sometimes the music can get very annoying and boring. This is also alittle to much like the gameboy games and dosen't work on this game. Other than that it is a great game and I would definitly reccomend this to anbody who like pokemon.	1
It is best to order this game with the free bonus disk. The game with the bounus disk is listed as a seperate item than the game by itself.  It is best to get the combo.	1
Ok I've never played this game before but it looks really cool.  A few day ago I went on capcom.com to look at some sceen shots of X7 and those gaphics look sick. The graphics are really good but they don't show anysceen shots of Axl the new hero. I hear its a 2 player game but Im not really sher, if it is this would be a really fun X game im probably gonna get it soon and I hope its fun. It most likely will be all the other X games were good. The X series is my favorite but not because of Zero.	1
I probably don't hate Mega Man X7 as much as most people but I feel confident the game is at least the second worst X title in existence.  X6 is the very worst of course and I highly doubt my feelings with change there.  X7 has its share of flaws however.  It's amazing Capcom actually thought blending 2D with 3D would be the wave of the future for the series.  They apparently didn't realize Mega Man maintaining 2D roots with fast-paced action is the reason we fell in love with the series so much.  You can't really make a change of this magnitude without lots of backlash from fans.  With that said however, the game likes to take elements of 3D and combine them with classic side scroller 2D the entire way through the game.  I'd say there's some occasions this combination works really well, but there's other times the 3D portions either become monotonous, tedious or just horrible.  Well instead of playing as X from the beginning, for a good chunk of the game you have to play as a much weaker, wimpier character named Axl.  His name makes him sound tough, but he's anything but.  You can also play as Zero but unfortunately his saber is much slower this time around which means you often leave yourself wide open to enemy attacks/retaliation if you're just out of their reach, and this game has a way of not seeming very dangerous at first until you realize you're being overwhelmed.  It's usually a gradual process when the danger surrounds you, but thankfully not NEARLY as brain-smashingly hard as in X6.  Yes, X6 is all about smashing our brains into walls with its neverending needless difficulty, haha!  Anyway with Zero's saber there's no real strategy- just go in and slice enemies.  Axl is basically a really weak version of X as I mention above.  You can switch between Axl and Zero throughout most of the first half of the game, and when X comes in you can switch between Axl, Zero and X.  You can only take two of these characters with you per stage.  The ability to switch between two characters is a nice throwback to X3 and I like it.  As far as graphics go, well in some stages they're really unique (Radio Tower for example, and Deep Forest) but otherwise they tend to be dark and uninspiring (like the intro stage).  It's almost like Capcom thought that using dark graphics would disguise the blandness of the stages, or that the darkness would play into a more realistic/serious setting.  Either way it's unimpressive.  Now the awful news- you have to rescue reploids AGAIN!  Yes I know, this idea was atrocious and unnecessary in X6 and unfortunately they brought it back again in X7.  Talk about a lousy attempt to extend the gameplay.  If they want to add replay value, how about stepping away from the usual 8 levels/boss battles and give us 12 stages and bosses?  Anyway I believe you can collect 64 reploids which is less than half compared to X6.  The atmosphere in the game is similar to a Metroid Prime game oddly enough, and the 3D mechanics are strikingly similar to Metroid: Other M.  I realize this game came out way before Other M but similarities are noticeable in the atmosphere.  The voice acting... REALLY REALLY AWFUL!  Yes, I had to state that in big words so everyone could see- the voice acting is just atrocious.  Zero's voice is too deep and manly, Axl sounds like a little kid playing in a sandbox but X... X's voice is the worst one of all.  I've never heard such a bloated overdramatic way of speaking since Richter from the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night days and actually thought such exceptionally bad voice acting would have been eliminated by this point in time (2003 when X7 was released).  Apparently not!  Bosses can speak annoyingly too as I'll mention below but for different reasons (repetition).  The problem with the voice acting is that all the dialogue text is now spoken, so we hear all these characters speak.  It makes the game feel way less like an action/shoot 'em up Mega Man video game adventure and more like a low budget cartoon.  Proof that voice acting doesn't belong in the Mega Man series unless it's only used occasionally like in X4.  The truth is all the voice acting sounds like little kids in a high school play reciting lines and their interpretation of what they believe is acceptable, but for those of us playing the game and especially those of us who grew up with the NES and Super NES games, we realize just how unnecessary, distracting and grating this stuff sounds since we know X or Zero should *not* sound the way they do here.  You'll quickly realize how bad the voice acting is after the opening stage when Axl, X and Zero have a conversation.  It's so wrong it hurts.  What else can I say before moving on to describing the stages and bosses?  Well Axl's charge shot is very weak.  The animations you see when Axl, Zero or X die are all really bland and identical.  Unfortunately sometimes you still have to risk unnecessary life or death instances while rescuing tricky placed reploids such as when they're placed over spiked areas.  Not as overwhelmingly annoying rescuing them compared to X6 due to spikes only appearing sometimes and due to Capcom easing up on placing reploids over bottomless pits, but unfortunately rescuing them is still occasionally an issue.  The gameplay seems to be a little slow in my opinion.  The X series is supposed to move much faster than the original Mega Man games, at least that's the impression I get since the original Mega Man X on the Super NES moved along at a SUPER fast pace the moment you obtained the dash ability.  This game feels slow in comparison to the previous X titles, and I have a feeling the reason is to compliment the 3D elements.  Maybe the slower speed is Capcom's way of making the game seem more realistic or maybe the game has trouble functioning going back and forth between 2D and 3D sections all the time.  Who knows the real reason.  At least X's charged shot is superior to Axl's, but I have to wonder if it's just exaggerated eye candy.  I mean X's shot is so huge it fills up a good chunk of the screen!  Looks like a massive blue fireball shooting forward, haha.  Anyway I like how X can shoot upward or downward.  There's also a glide or fly move that looks unintentionally hilarious to me since it's so out of place for an X game.  Capcom obviously wanted to change the series completely with this game, that much I do know by looking at the graphics and how the game plays.  Also before I forget to mention it, this game has a severe shortage of energy capsules.  Just try your best not to take damage.  It's not an impossibly hard game like X6, but it's certainly challenging enough that you'll want to avoid taking damage as much as possible.  Alright let's discuss the levels...  The Lava Factory has a pretty strong atmosphere despite the fact it's just a typical factory setting with areas of lava.  This level is unique in that the first half is all about typical 2D side scroller shooting and the second half is all 3D-focused involving several tricky jumps across awkwardly placed platforms avoiding or shooting red dragons coming out of the lava or pesky red laser beams.  The 3D platforming portion of this stage lasts a long time which is annoying.  Radio Tower is based around a spiral staircase-like setting similar to Split Mushroom's spiral areas from X4.  Creative use of 2D and 3D blended together, and even more creative is the mini boss fight I guess you could say, who stays in the middle of the room as you progress up the stairs avoiding rockets and fireballs from all kinds of surrounding danger (including the boss himself such as his claw move which is used to halt your progression).  This stage is pretty awesome I admit.  The Battleship stage is all about total 3D level design running between crates and avoiding explosions.  The enemy variety is unusual here- you battle blue birds positioned on platforms with their own shooting attacks.  Perhaps the 3D setting is hte reason this area so unusual.  Basically the entire Battleship stage feels awkward since it's split between a few different 3D areas, and that's it.  A failed experiment on the part of Capcom.  Others may disagree with me however and see it as an experimental success.  However with that said, the huge robotic mid-level boss is REALLY cool.  He's elaborate and intimidating enough to almost be a regular boss!  Deep Forest is another pretty decent stage.  I love the dark green forest in the background which is realistic enough to remind me of something out of Metroid Prime 3, and the best use of 3D occurs in this level- around the halfway point when you walk down a hill, the camera switches to a 3D effect.  It's subtle and most people probably won't care or admire it enough to compliment, but I think it's a genius idea to implement 3D portions in this one specific area since the appearance is so beautiful.  It's *very* effective and adds to the atmosphere.  The enemy variety is poor however- you shoot bees all over the place, and even more plentiful are these boring stone moving enemies that move up and down with green lights attached to them.  They're sort of like thwomps from the Mario Bros. series.  You can climb over them or dash under them.  The rolling boulders are a little better but due to Axl being so weak, not that much fun either I'm afraid.  Now let's mention the AWFUL levels- the next four.  One in particular is atrocious enough to never pick this game up again.  Central Circuit is all about a slow-moving 3D race on your ride chaser which basically another version of the jet bike.  You have to take it slow in order to rescue all the reploids.  I hate the idea of basing an entire level around the driving mechanic unless it's high-speed action.  This however, is lackluster.  At least the glowing green sky over a futuristic dreary setting is nice.  Tunnel Base is one major problem after another.  The stage feels 3 times bigger than the other 7 levels for one thing so it's clearly overlong.  You ride blue and red armor robots in the first two sections while shooting laser beams or stomp the ground for a shockwave effect across narrow hallways while dealing with dark uninspiring surroundings.  Make that WAY too dark in this case.  When the third half arrives and the stage feels like it's trying to develop into something more, it's evident this is nothing but generic destruction involving spamming the ride armor and punching enemies in an open 3D setting.  I hate this kind of gameplay a lot.  Air Forces is an exceptionally bad level.  You begin by jumping from airplane to airplane way up high in the sky which in theory seems like an amazing idea, but the execution is furiously difficult.  I love the cloud effects here however.  You basically have to glide from one plane to another without jumping short and falling which is much harder than it sounds.  In the second half you must avoid giant blue laser beams swaying back and forth in a 3D isometric setting.  I really wish the first part of this level was designed differently because the good news is that the third portion of this level is where you go deep inside the ship and the atmosphere gets really thick and enjoyable here.  The third portion saves this level from mediocrity however...  The worst level I've ever played in a Mega Man game (well besides the Clown Man stage in MM8) occurs next.  Cyber Field.  I HATE this level!  It consists of nothing but blue platforms shaped like pentagons in a generic futuristic setting with no personality whatsoever, and teleportation *overload*.  I can't even figure out how to navigate this confusing place without using a guide- I need to actually see someone play this game on youtube in order to figure my way through.  This is because all the areas look identical.  To make matters worse, there's even an upside down segments that must be completed around halfway through.  UGH!!  Now onto the bosses.  Soldier Stonekong makes amazing use of 3D effects similar to the spiral staircase level I mention above, except you go around in a circle on a stone structure.  Fun boss too since his attack patterns are exciting to dodge.  Tornado Tonion has an annoying and repetitive squeaky Asian voice and it's especially awful hearing "ah!" every time you hit him.  However once again this boss fight is fun.  Splash Warfly offers suspense whenever he jumps out of the water and surprises you.  Flame Hyenard does the WORST THING EVER!  He won't stop screaming "Burn to the ground!" a hundred times in a row!  This is why voice acting is a serious negative in my book, for reprehensible moments such as these.  This particular boss is really boring and feels like it's missing something, since it takes place on top of a giant robot.  It's almost like the robot itself should have been the boss fight instead.  Ride Boarski is an *extremely* hard and long boss fight with the camera positioned showing a faraway aerial view of a gated platform where the battle takes place, and you have to avoid fireball attacks and prepare yourself for moments of slowdown which is odd.  Snipe Anteator's battle takes place on a see-through tunnel leading to the ceiling.  While the setting is cool, the boss battle is annoyingly difficult since he mostly stays on the other side of the tunnel on the opposite side of your shooting range.  Then he cheap shots by spamming blasts which are hard to avoid.  Wind Crowrang is notable for X's hilariously bad voice acting before the battle begins.  He once again sounds pretentiously heroic.  Very similar to Richter from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night like I mention above.  The boss fight itself is awesome since it's 2D fast-paced action which is *just* the way I like X games.  Vanishing Gungaroo contains more hilariously awful/overdramatic voice acting from X and the boss' voice here isn't any better.  This is a bland and generic fight where you simply jump around shooting in a 3D environment.  Totally forgettable.  The Sigma boss fight is pretty awesome at least.  The first round is all about 2D jumping, dodging and attacking like in Vanishing Gungaroo, then the second form is pure 3D perfection with a screen-sized Sigma and avoiding his many moves while standing on top of a series of platform, and countering attacks accordingly until you're able to find just the right moment to retaliate.  It can be frustrating if you keep falling off the edge however since it takes a while to bring him down.  Overall pretty disappointing but not the worst X game.	-1
I know they called the game Mega Man X, but they put too much emphasis on X.  Those special weapons that you acquire get wasted quick and are not effective when they are the boss' weakness.  I love the armors that X has throughout the series, but I have to say, the armor in this game looks like the one from the first one with minor changes for looks and the abilities suck.  Zero and Axl can go through the levels, but going through the bosses are going to make you pull your hair out if you have any.  Then the voice acting is horrible that you wish you didn't play the game.  Overall, if you're a fan, it's going to make you go WTF.  Capcom got lazy and didn't think about their loyal fans.	-1
An onion being a maverick?  what happened to the boss selection screens we used to see where there were bosses we were scared to face first because they looked bad?  None of these bosses looked threatening and the weakest looking are actually the hardest...(the kangaroo boss.)  Capcom should've kept it 2D and axel has no purpose.  The ability to switch between characters takes away from the challenge and megaman sounds like doug funnie.  Avoid!	-1
this is the worst 3d megaman game I've ever played. the camera angles suck. It is very difficult to see things. The control sucked as well. I regret buying this game.	-1
Where to begin on this review of one of my top 5 worst Mega Man Games of all time. Okay, for those who know nothing about the series, it's a sub series in the Mega Man franchise. The sub-series began on the Super Nintendo (or Super Famicom in Japan) which is considered not only one of the best Mega Man games of all time but also one of the best games on the system. 2 more came out (along with Mega Man 7 and Mega Man Soccer, which is not part of the X series) and then eventually went on to the 32 bit era (Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn, as Capcom didn't care for Nintendo's N64 console) and released X4. The graphics were redone but were still in 2D and along with that were cinemas and voice acting. Of course we can forget about voice acting as it was still very bad. Later, in 2001, X5 came out and the gameplay was the same but a few different things were added. X6 came out a year later and this was the final X game to come out for the PSone (Sega's Saturn had only X4 due to being a failure). People were displeased with X5 and X6 due to "unupdated" gameplay and difficulty level. Then This... This game came out. When I first played it I was excited to play a new X game because the X games were actually my favorite games of all time. I played through this disaster and my heart was shattered into a million tiny pieces. First of all, you can't play as X... hold on a second, you can't play as X! I later found out why Capcom did this and it was because it was part of the story as X didn't want to fight anymore so you play as Zero and AXL (Why did they make this character? he sucks!). The gameplay was way too weird for my tastes and the boss battles were just terrible. Go on YouTube and look up the gameplay and boss battles for more info. I only played this game once but playing it just once told me to never ever play this disgrace again. Hear Me Out: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!	-1
After dropping the pathetic bombshell that was X6 back in 2001, Capcom finally decided it was time to take the X series to the next level. Unforunately, as if things weren't already bad enough for the series, we all know that Capcom failed to make this conversion as painless as possible, and fans had another half-baked game to add to their Mega Man X gaming collection.  At first glance, Mega Man X7 has eveything one would expect from a Mega Man title. The the cel-shaded graphics are pretty nice to look at, considering X fans are used to looking at 2D sprite graphics. Beyond it's graphical engine, however, X7 does almost everything humanly possible to ruin the rest of the experience for the gamer.  To start off, the load times are way too abundant. Considering  this isn't a first generation PSX2 title, and the fact that games like the PSX2 Final Fantasy's have better graphics and faster load times, this is just unexcusable (even if the load screens do act as continue points). Next is the horrendous english voice acting. Considering the fact Capcom conmpletely disrespected US gamers but not even bothering to add english voices to X6, this is a little more tollerable in my book (at least they tried - I guess).  Another gripe is we're still treated to the same still shots and text story scenes as in X5 and X6. I though the jump to a 32-bit system to a 128-bit system would actually mean something here, but no. You'll have to beat the game to see ending - the only VMF in the entire game, excluding the opening.  Gameplay is where Mega Man X7 commits the most serious of its crimes. The 2D sections of the game play well enough, even if the auto-aim is a bit glitchy at times. 3D sections don't even play half as well, as camera problems creep up continously, forcing players to make some jumps completely blind (don't get me started on having to rotate the camera in conjunction to shooting in some boss fights just to see your attacker...). Even worse is the mass of slowdown one will experence, espcially during the boss fights, were the game slows down to a crawl. Level designs are decent, but it is pretty sad considering one can find all the hidden power-ups without much exploration (I didn't even have to consult a guide - I found everything on the first playthough).  Most Mega Man fans will probably buy Mega Man X7 reguardless of what I written above (I still bought it, and I knew what I was getting into). Still, I remember a time when you could say you had beaten all the Mega Man X games and you could say it with pride. Unfortunately, now all it means you have played four good games and four so-so games.	-1
ever since i was about 5 years old, megaman has been my favorite videogame. I started wih megaman 7 and was instantly hooked! As the series went on it was nearing its peek. meg man X was insanely good, great powerups, and o so much mroe to collect, as was X2, and especially the ultra rare, 125 dollar X3. The trnslation to the next gen consoles is usually the ultimate down fall of great side scrolling, old school shooter, and this is no exception. Megaman had some undoubtedly rough spots, what with megaman legends, and megaman 64, things were really looking down. Then capcom graced us with megaman X4, good ol' side scrolling fun, and megaman was good again for a brief shining moment. Then again the quality began to slip with X5 and 6, and X7 is definately the low point. the problem with this game is that megaman was never meant to be a 3D expierience, it just doesnt work. The game has terrible controls, average graphics, and infuriates you past the point of caring anymore. Megaman should frusterate you, but before it fueled you to do better, now it just pisses you off and causes a lot of broken controllers. The megaman anniversery edition just came out, and is an excellent old school finger numbing smash! It features behind the scenes videos, sketches, and even the original TV commercials for megaman 1 through 8, which are available for play, plus 2 Japan only boss rush modes, try that instead, you won't regret it!	-1
just stop with these games, they've sucked forever, this one is just too hard and cheesy. die mega man or x or zero or whatever the main character is now.	-1
Mega Man X7(2003). The seventh game in a seven part series. Ever since Megaman X4 was released back in 1997, hardcore fans of the series were impatiently waiting for Capcom to follow up on its impressive streak of solid MMX games, I being one of those fans. It took them nearly four long years to finally make MMX5, and when they did, it received nothing but mixed reviews. While it still stayed tried and true to the classic 2D formula, there were a few changes that ended up bringing the game down, such as the lack of anime-cutscenes and a guiding feature that hindered more than helped the game. Despite these quibbles however, I felt that this game was needlessly bashed by other hardcore fans, so I stood up for it. Afterall it was still a fun game and it stuck tried and true to the classic gameplay. Same thing for MMX6, only this one got even more criticism by the die-hard fans. I personally thought X6 was a reasonable game, though the story was bad, but once again, it delivered in challenging old-school gameplay. As a hardcore fan who is open to most games, I am willing to defend X5 and X6 to the end. However, the same cannot be said about the new entry, X7. Read on and see why the negatives outweigh the positives: POSITIVES -For the most part, THE GRAPHICS HERE ARE PRETTY GOOD. Bringing the game to the PS2 was an advantage here because it allowed the environments to be brought fully into the 3D realm with lots of detail. Not only the environments, but also the characters were animated fairly well too. -Contrary to the last couple of X games, X7 ACTUALLY SPORTS AN EXCELLENT ROCK SOUNDTRACK. Nothing real memorable, but the tunes do stay true to the earlier games. -I like the option of BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN TWO CHARACTERS AT ANYTIME DURING A LEVEL. This helps when a certain part of a level is too difficult with one character, but the one has an easier time. -Though most of the voice acting isn't necessarily great, I thought that the voices for Zero and Signas were excellent. If you pay close attention, you can tell that the voice for Signas is the same as the voice of Alucard from Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night. -And on the bright side, X certainly doesn't sound like a girl like he did in X4. -Certain enemies you encounter will bring up old memories of the first few MMX games. NEGATIVES -Here is where the X7 comes crashing down: WHEN A MMX GAME IS NO LONGER CLASSIC 2D, THEN A MMX GAME HAS LOST ITS "SOUL". What I mean is, by moving the game to 3D, the game loses its feel that most people have come to love. I'm not against making 3D games at all, quite the opposite in fact. It's just that the MMX series was meant to be classic sidescroller gaming, and by taking that away, the MMX games are reduced to nothing more than a generic 3D shooter that already looks like so many other games. Besides, we already have a 3D MM series, and that's none other than Mega Man Legends. I appreciate Capcom for trying to add a little bit of new to the formula, but this has really gone too far. -Also, without the classic 2D formula, the level designs become drab, without excitement. -While there were some places where the camera switched to 2D sideview, in both modes THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SLUGGISH. This is probably what turned me off the most about X7. Remember how X and Zero had smooth controls in all the past games? Well, its mostly gone now. Having sluggish controls is a big nono when it comes to these games because the games are all about fast action, and the game becomes no fun to play when your controls aren't very responsive. -Unresponsive controls means the game is going to be very difficult to play, and not in a good way. -A MMX GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK X, THE _MAIN_ CHARACTER?? Utter Blasphemy. -What's the point of Axl? He may be an easy character to use, but he's just plain annoying. I cringe everytime he speaks. -Remember how in X6 how they thankfully gave you the option of listening or not listening to Alia's advice? WELL THEY SOMEHOW MESSED THAT UP HERE TOO! Everytime you get to certain points (which is like every few feet) Alia will whine at you to listen to her advice. This is almost as annoying as when you were FORCED to listen to her in X5. -Also, the dialogue moves very slowly and you are forced to sit through everything. -The story has gone so far off track that it's become difficult to follow. So Zero is still around even after X6 where he (*SPOILER ALERT*) put himself into a capsule pod to awaken in the future where the MM Zero games take place? His presence in X7 completely negates those two games, AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD MM GAMES TOO, unlike this one here. -Don't get me started on the bosses. It's been stated before but Capcom really has run out of ideas for bosses. An onion?? I won't even touch that one. -The gameplay can become very unbalanced at times. While Zero can storm levels, it's nearly impossible to use him on most bosses in the game, even the easy ones. -WHAT'S THE POINT IN PUTTING SIGMA IN THE GAME?? Is there some sort of rule where Sigma has to be the final boss in every X game, regardless of how he does/doesn't tie in to the plot? He hasn't been an important storyline element at all since X5, where he was a BIG part of the plot. I just wish Capcom would surprise us a little in that area. While I do give Capcom props for trying to add new dimensions to the MMX series, it proved to be a vain attempt to get a new audience, and it ended up only making everyone yawn. Since it's a bad game overall, I'm giving it only 2 stars. 1 star is too low though because I only reserve that for absolutely terrible games. X7 is still somewhat playable. It's just not my cup of tea, and that's saying alot because I'm actually a lot more open to newer MM games than most of the diehard fans are. They will continue to put down X5 and X6 needlessly, but I believe X7 is where the low point really is. Once the game has lost all the aspects of the MMX series, it's over. X7 unfortunately demonstrates that fact. I hate to say it, but this is where Capcom should call it quits. IF YOU ARE A NEW FAN, AVOID. OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS A WEEKEND RENTAL AT BEST.	-1
Mega Man X7 continues the Mega Man X series slide into ruin.  It tries to improve upon the formula and that certainly isn't the best idea.  A new character is introduced but that can't save Mega Man X7 at all. The 3-D graphics aren't that bad at all in this game. Surprisingly their pretty good.  We get to watch a 3D anime scene at the start and it's pretty cool.  But that's about as far as eye-candy goes. Without a doubt more animations and such could've been put into the graphics. I can't say much for the sound.  A lot of it is pretty bad and while it hits the action notes, it just doesn't work.  The voices (in english anyway) are very horrible.  The sound effects are cool though, but that doesn't mean the sound is all that great. The gameplay almost saves this game and actually gets it the two stars it deserves.  The gameplay is simple, just like always.  When you select to go to a level you now get to choose two of three characters. Either X, Zero or the new character Axl.  You're allowed to switch between the two characters as you like. As you might have guessed, Zero is the strongest of the three and he uses a Z-Saber (Think of a lightsaber from Star Wars if this is your first Mega Man X game).  Axl is a new character who has the ability to float in the air if need be for a short while (like Peach in Super Mario Brothers 2). While the gameplay is good it is quite a difficult game, like many other Mega Man X games it takes time to get used to. The story actually focuses around Zero and Axl.  There really is no real plot in Mega Man X7, it's the same old select between eight bosses until you get to that final encounter.  Short game as always. It's about time a Mega Man game came to the PS2 but I certainly woudln't recommend you get this one. Pass this up, it isn't even better than Mega Man X6.	-1
I have been a fan of Capcom's Megaman series since the first game on the original NES. The colorful environments, stimulating music, and inventive character design kept me interested even into recent years. After Megaman X4 however, Capcom has been getting sloppy with the series. The translation and overall production of X5 and X6 took a nose-dive, the music wasn't as inspired, and the level setup/enemy design was poor. Sadly, Megaman X7 is even worse than those two games. The updated 3D graphics give the game a fresh facelift, but the hit detection, boss design, and story is just a garbled mess. The camera in the full 3D areas often obstructs the player's view, some of the minor enemies take way too many hits to defeat, and there isn't even a sound effect when you pick up items. In short, the whole production simply feels glitchy and incomplete. The new character Axl is no redeeming factor either...he's a whiny brat who is meant to appeal to today's overconfident youth. If a good Megaman game is what you want, get Megaman X4 for PS1 or one of the Megaman Zero games for Gameboy Advance instead. First the Street Fighter/VS. series drops in quality, then the sequel to Devil May Cry turns out to be a dud, and now Megaman X7...what's going on, Capcom?	-1
what was CAPCOM thinking when they tried to make a mega man x game 3d??? the thing i ALWAYS liked about the mega man x series, was it ALWAYS kept the "traditional" side scrolling theme! i always liked that, they were the only ones who knew it was about game play and not 3d graphics. i put the emphasiz on "were"! this is horrible, i cant believe they made it into 3d graphics. not only is it not as appealing!, but it ALSO makes it hard to see enemies that are coming your way. thats what i LOVED about mega man x6, it was still the traditional REAL side scroller. i cant believe they broke this "tradition!"	-1
This is coming from a true Mega Man X fan, I love this game!  I got it the day it came out and I had no regrets, even though you have to unlock the main character, the game is so fun!  I stayed up all night playing!  Its so adicting!	1
very good article for the old Xbox, now I can play my control. I needed that I made a good buy.	1
I have an old xbox and 3 of my 4 break away cables seemed to have disappeared.  I bought these and they work fine.  I couldn't really find these things anywhere else either.	1
Worked great, seemed loose but still works well.	1
Cord works like and charm and got it in good time.  Thanks for the great product seller person.  the color might be better if it was black but no biggy, I won't hold that against you.	1
This piece ships fast and works great it's actually an extended wire so it makes your controller even longer which is always a plus in my book very happy 5 out of 5 in my book	1
It works. What else can I say? The original parts aren't available anymore, so this was great to save a controller from the trash	1
by aquireing this and some other parts i was able to finish a controller job. after some work it was working just fine. its madcatz who is known as a great third party component manufacturer.	1
All good thanks	1
Great items and shipping	1
It hooks right up to your controller and connects to the game. You start to play instantly. A+++++++ you will love this.	1
These breakaway cables are nice and play like a dream.  All in all I would rate these cables as five stars.	1
Thank you for this item. It is a big help. Now I have the ability to play more than just campaign.	1
March Madness 2004 has one very redeaming quality that will undoubtidly make it one of EA Sports top sellers of 2004: Carmelo Anthony is featured on the front cover wearing a Syracuse Orangeman jersey.  I am from Syracuse, NY and when Melo lead the hometwon orange to the national title last year, it was like winning a World War here in the good old Cuse town.  I had only played the EA Sports versions of college basketball sparingly in the past, but I simply had to buy March Madness 2004 just because of its cover.  The game is much better than I had anticipated, and continues EA Sport's long line of success this season along with Madden 2004 and NCAA Football 2004.  March Madness does present some flaws however.  The graphics are nothing spectuacular, and are realistically poor for this day in age of video gaming, the controls are sometimes confusing, and this games biggest fault is the fact that the person playing the game can not in bound the ball.  Yes, that's correct you did not read that wrong.  The person throwing the ball in bounds is controlled by the CPU, and this leads to a mass amount of turnovers and in some cases, the loss of a pivitol game.  Still, March Madness 2004 far exceeded my expectations, and proves to worthwile if you're looking to just have some solid fun between you and your gaming friends.	1
This game is terribly pure and simple.  First, the graphics are poor, the players looked distorted, with overally large heads and feet.  Second, the game play and controls are poor, with the game handling nothing like real college basketball, and poor button placements.  Finally, reality?  They can't even get stadiums correct on the inside.  They don't look anything like what they are supposed to be.  Save your money, if you really want a good college basketball game, get ESPN College Hoops, you won't be dissappointed.	-1
this a pretty good game because the grapics are pretty good the gameplay is alright and Dick Vitale keeps the commentary livly. It is pretty hard to score because some of the times you get charging foul if you try to do a lay up or a dunk. I will give this four stars because of this reason.	1
Although this year's March Madness is a step up from last year's version (it now includes many more teams, like mid-major Creighton, etc., and it fixed some of the tournament issues), I'm still sorely disappointed by gameplay and features. Gameplay is relatively intuitive, and the ability to juke and set plays are decent, yet the game lacks imagination and creativity in its setup. Problems with the menu are particularly troubling -- you must load your "favorite team" each time you play, as well as your saved dynasties and settings. Recruiting is a tiring task, which is disappointing since I truly enjoy this feature in EA's football series. The game is a bit buggy, with the announcers calling out the wrong team's name (I was up by 40+ pts, and had scored 12 straight unanswered points, but Dick Vitale said my opponent was "on fire".) :-) I would not recommend a purchase -- either buy it used, rent it, or wait until next year.	-1
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is by far the best James Bond game yet. The graphics are great, although it is viewed from a 3rd person view (where you see yuor entire character, not just the gun). At first, this might not seem great. However, it ends up working very well. James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing has great varity. The third person view makes stelth easier. The manual aim feature (like in Nightfire) puts you in frist-person ofr precies aiming. There is a fairly forgiving auto-aim feuture, as well. There are driving levels, with a better variety of cars. There are also more explosions, more opportunities to use tight-ropes, and the levels have multiple ways of being beaten. James bond 007: Everything or Nothing is one of the best games around. The multiplayer mode is great. It offers silky smooth online support, as well as multitap support. Fans of shooters should buy this game.	1
great	1
I like it.	1
I enjoyed playing this game, 5 stars, it was playable just like new.	1
I bought this game when I bought my playstation 2 game , an was very impressed. The grafics are awesome an the missions are fun , you drive cars , helicopters ,cycles and rapel up an down walls , have machine guns , stun guns and even in one mission jump off a cliff an must catch a girl while you shoot bad guys before you both hit the ground ! yeah , if your a "max-out gamer this game may be easy for you , but if you enjoy a good 007 game thats fun to play over and over as I do ( yes , i own a PS3 ) and still play PS2 games , play this , i only wish i had it on a PSP cuz thats how much i liked this game .	1
0007 Everything or Nothing uses an original story and an all-star cast of Pierce Brosnan, William Dafoe, Shannon Elizabeth, Richard Kiel, Heidi Klum, Mya, Misaki Ito, John Cleese, and Judi Dench as "M". You get to play the role of James Bond as you take on the bad guys. The game is fun and challenging at times, but there are few glitches that can become annoying.	1
This is the best james bond game I ever play. It's just like the movies. You can do all different kind of things. I recommend this game.	1
When I first bought this game, I was expecting disappointment. EA's last Bond title, Goldeneye: Rogue Agent, failed to impress me and overall I was dissatisfied. However, Everything or Nothing marks a turningpoint in Bond game history that I'd have liked to see be improved on.  The gameplay in this game is top-notch. Shooting enemies is simple and satisfying, due to the innovative (or maybe not) lock-on system. Within a few hours, you'll be able to pop off enemies and create moments that look ripped right from a Bond movie. A key gameplay feature is the Bond Sense. The directional buttons will bring you to the weapon select menu, which will rest at the bottom of the screen. Meanwhile, the game screen tints blue and goes in super-slow motion. Bond can look around and pinpoint key things such as a Guard's status (health and awareness), shootable and throwable objects, etc.  A little-known thing is something that people call "Bond Sense shooting". Essentially, Bond sense shooting is like a manual version of the Mark and Execute system in the upcoming Splinter Cell: Conviction. It allows Bond to pop off multiple enemies in rapid succession on the fly, in a matter of a second in-game. Basically, you lock on to an enemy, headshot him, go into bond sense, target the next enemy (albeit strategically), headshot, etc. It sounds unimpressive but in execution, it looks cool and feels incredibly badass.  While this is a Bond game, one thing I noticed is an absence of stealth as a serious option. Yes, you can sneak around and kill people without anyone noticing, but it's impossible to go a whole level without being seen. Eventually, there will be a part where rappel guards jump in and everything turns into an epic firefight. I'd equate it to Uncharted 2's stealth system. It's there, but don't rely on it for the whole time.  Bond controls exceptionally well. The controls work well and are incredibly fluid, and the aforementioned lock-on system makes moving, rolling, covering and shooting a breeze. Bond's moveset is not limited at all, and he will be able to do various rolls, cover manuevers, and fighting moves.  The hand-to-hand combat system is new, and a welcome addition. The Square and Triangle buttons handle punches, and while it may seem incredibly simple, pressing the two simultaneously will allow Bond to do a neat-looking takedown move that will instantly disable the enemy.  I wish the fighting system were a bit more polished, though. I found it possible to run up to a guy, press Square and Triangle simultaneously, and immediately tackle him and throw him over my shoulders, killing him instantly. It's not hard to pull off and it feels a bit cheap, but sometimes hand to hand combat can dock you a bit of health, so it's not completely biased towards Bond.  The mission types are great fun and incredibly varied. You'll find yourself in epic firefights, behind the wheel of tanks, motorcycles, helicopters, you name it. Once you complete a mission on 00 Agent difficulty, you can choose to complete Platinum challenges which will unlock cheats (Golden Gun, Infinite Ammo, Infinite Battery, etc.). I usually find things like this to be gimmicky and boring but the Platinum objectives are so fun and challenging that it's very much worth going for them. Just to give you a general taste, Platinum challenges usually involve going through a level in an alloted time limit, or without taking damage or using any ammo.  The graphics are very good. Not Splinter Cell, but good. Models look great, textures are decent res, and shadows are present as opposed to the cheap "dark circle on the ground" trick that some devs try to pull. Animations flow beautifully together and there is high attention to detail, especially present in the driving segments.  The voice acting is top-notch. Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, and John Cleese all provide a voice cast that is indistinguishable from their performance in the movies. The bad guys communicate with each other and sound like stereotypical Bond henchmen.  Overall, this is one of the best action games on the PS2. I'd highly recommend it, especially to fans of the series. Make no mistake; this game makes you feel like James Bond.  (Replay Value: High)	1
When I played this game years ago I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I still remember how much fun I had on this one game. Excellent	1
This is the quintessential PS2 shooter.  Run, don't walk to get this game.  Very comparable to Black, Max Payne, and Splinter Cell. Enjoy!	1
This is one of the few really good games I managed to overlook when the PS2 was in it's prime.  I wasn't sure about going from the 1st person view to 3rd person, but it works...it really really works.  The missions are so much more varied from Bonds games of old.  Instead of just shooting people in endless fetch quests, you're now chasing trains on motorcycles and grappling down burning buildings.  The only complaint I have is the lock on targeting system doesn't work sometimes in the heat of battle.  You might have to reposition yourself to get a lock on your enemy when you really shouldn't have to.  Bottom line is you can get this game used for under [...] shipped.  No excuse not to play this if you're still sporting the PS2.	1
I'm pressed for time but this short review is still better than nothing.    Replayability, graphics, and weapons are great, game is fun and I play it often. The multiplayer/Co-Op is also fun. Some levels are REALLY challenging though. I also like the fact that you get a motorcycle in a few of the levels.    BUY THIS TODAY!!!	1
my god, it's amazing how overrated some games can be.  supposedly the "best" bond game.. and i love bond, i love FPS action games, surely i would love this game, right?!  wrong.  things start off looking fun... oh, a nice little tutorial to teach you cool moves.  cool weapons.  but things immediately reveal themselves to be terrible.  you repel down a wall..  then you have about 6 guys shooting at you from all sides.  but uh oh, their bullets are apparently much stronger than yours!  and there's no health to be found anywhere!  wait, you're telling me bond packed all these incredible technological tools in his backpack, AND HE DOESN'T BRING ANY MED KITS??? jesus christ, you must be joking.  that wouldn't be a problem if surviving wasn't nearly IMPOSSIBLE.  and remember, this is just the FIRST part.  you have more parts to complete after this, while TRYING to stay alive.  ok, so let's say you're a wonderful gamer and you DO survive.  so what?  the shooting action is BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING.  press a button to auto aim your enemy.  pull the trigger.  that's it!  no aiming at all!  just pushing a button.  wow.  this is what games have become?  give me a break.  i've played great FPS games on PC like call of duty and half-life 2, and this doesn't cut it, at all.  besides, who decided that bond is supposed to be some superman with a pistol anyway??  isn't he supposed to be more of a spy than rambo?	-1
THIS GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MOVIE. IT FEELS LIKE ONE. THE MUSIC, THE ANIMATION IS FANTASTIC. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE PIERCE BROSNAN. THE CHARACTERS HAVE A LIFELIKE LOOK ABOUT THEM. THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING. A SHOOTER, A DRIVING GAME, A MOTORCYCLE DRIVING GAME. HIGHLY RECOMMENED GAME I GIVE IT 5*****. THANK YOU	1
...masquerading as a video game and allowing you to lead Bond through his missions. Action-packed prelude that throws you into the mix without a pause? Check. Cheesy theme song? Check. Scenery Chewing Villain? Check. Bond hooking up with the easiest girls this side of wild kegger? Check check and check. Yup, we got a James Bond movie here! And a pretty decent game too.  I haven't played any other Bond games so I can't compare them to it; nor did i have the chance to check out the multiplayer. I can say that this is a very entertaining game in the single player mode, quite creative and interactive with various weapons and vehicles depending on what stage you're in. Graphics were good, the xBox version would probably be a lot sharper. I dig vehicles, so I was happy that you have to fly a helicopter, drive a Cayenne and the good ol' Aston Martin as well as a SWEET crotch rocket during the course of the game. Too bad there was no water action, but i'm not picky :)  There are a wide range of weapons for you to choose from, as well as a lot of cool gadgets to play with. I didn't find myself using a lot of the gadgets, but then I was playing it on easy. I'm sure that i'd need that strobe grenade on harder levels...The aiming system is adequate but needs refining. Too many times i've been trying to peek around corners to take out a guy,  when someone comes around and is shooting at me; yet the automatic aim continues to focus on the guy around the corner instead of the guy in my face.  I played this game as a rental on the PS2, took me about 3 days including breaks to beat it on the easiest level. The replay value for me is quite small, since I now know what the story/movie is, though they do try to add some life to it by having two combat simulators available after the last mission. I don't like the Tron setting of it though, couldn't they have created a theme setting?  All in all, i recommend this game strongly as a very good rental. Buying it is your choice, since I don't think it would hold up well over time for me even if it is a good game.	1
EA finally made a game worthy of Bond and they've blurred the line between the games and the films at this point.  Gone is the old standard FPS format.  Bond is now in third person, and it's Pierce Brosnan giving the voice and face.  The rest of the filmic cast is here as well.  The game looks like the films.  Easily one of the better PS2 games this year.  Since Medal of Honor appeared to have the same engine as the Bond games, perhaps they'll update that series with the Bond game third person.  You feel like you're acting out an action sequence from the film, and it blows away the feel of Nightfire and its predecessor.  The violence is top notch, the gadgets are great, and the game is tough on Platinum level.  The game is also long, not one of those eight mission shooters you finish in a day.  The weapons look and sound great, and of course they shamelessly plug new cars like the Porsche Cayenne and the Aston Martin Vanquish of the last film.  Plain fun, even if you're not a Bond fan.  It's a shame they have to stick to Teen ratings for the franchise, but blood might push the game higher.  I don't remember the story, and it doesn't matter.  The same people who write the films are now writing the games.  Even the guy who writes the Bond novels now was a video games designer.  It's all the same.  Willem Defoe joins the ranks of video game actors, as does Heidi Klum and even John Cleese.  There is now little difference between the films and the games, effectively.  The game even has little MI6 interludes, like the films, and there is a the requisite visit to Q Branch to get your new gadgets and heavily armed cars.  There are also bonus combat simulators thrown in.  There's good variety in the missions, too.  Some heavily rely on stealth, some on driving, or flying, and others on plain combat.  The hand-to-hand combat is a lot of fun, too.  No more cheesy flying fists.  Bond (as Brosnan) can now break out killer moves, even while clad in his Brioni tuxedo.  Highly recommended shooter, a lot of fun.  Justice to the Bond name.	1
OK, so it's been ages since they first came out with Golden Eye which still ranks #1 amongst Jimmy B sequels on the PS1 and PS2 systems.  This is hands down the best one since the legendary Nintendo 64 creation.  The music played throughout parts of the missions really get your adrenaline going.  I would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for the arcade feeling and graphics.  When they make the characters and environments life like, then we have a better game.  Maybe they'll take my advice and introduce it in the Golden Eye sequel that's long overdue.  P.S.  If you see No One Lives Forever on the shelf of a video game store, ask the manager to kindly remove it, as it brings shame to anyone who possesses it along with a lifetime of remorse and shame.	1
*Begin Transmission*  M BREIFING:  Listen up,007!word has it that a good game called "007:everything or nothing" is out! In this game:car chases,Booming explosians and everything you need for a great video game.  Q BRANCH:  Now pay attenian,007!In this game you will get lots of new weapons. The weapons are like this:  If you shoot a wall with a rocket launcher(concrete),it colapses.  If you shoot a vehicle,It explodes.  Also that a neat "spider bomb" is a cool gadget made by me:It detonates when it reache something  MONEYPENNY:  Good luck playing this great game,James!(...)	1
5 Stars. Well "EA" has done it again. They created another awesome game(besides "lord of the rings" that is)."EA" deliver's awesome action game play for the system's. Some game's seem like they were made for a certain system. And in my perspective this one was made for the PS2. And "sonic hero's" should Never be for the PS2&XBOX.Anyway's "Everything or Nothing" delivers decent gameplay. And of course I have to complain about the aiming. Because when you aim you don't really fell like your doing anything. You simply tap L1 and Bond literally aim's at anyone. This game is really difficult so don't just ecspect to zoom through it. The motercycle is a real good addition. Why,because it's equipped with a flamethrower and you get a shotgun. The gun variety isn't big since "EA"  decided to make it more realistic. Once you lock onto an enemy you can adjust your aiming for a headshot. The new fist fighting was a good idea. Better then the old game's when you just simply punched. Multiplayer is rather odd. It's not bad but will keep you in your friend's occupied for a while. And trust me battle arena get's old fast. On multiplayer you cant even choose your character. There is a decent amount of 2 player cooperation. Just like on the 4th co-op level 1 person has to disarm a bomb while the other guard's his back. The stealth at time's is a little weird. Enemies seem to be able to spot you to easily. Or maybe it's just that one mine level. I don't know. The best co-op level in my opinion is when you have to fight and survive until a door open's. Well hear's what I think of everything.   (out of 5) Graphic's:5 Nice and smooth. Weapons'S:4 Maybe if they had a little more then 6 it would be better. Sound:4 So-so Lighting:4 Can't quite beat "Splinter cell". Replay value:4 won't last forever Toatel score:21 Pro's I like third person better then FPS. Good clean graphic's. New gadget's are cool. All 6 gun's have good shooting effect's Con's Multiplayer need's work. Aiming need's work. Am I the only one who think's they stole idea's from"Splinter cell" So in conclusion all I can say is "EA" please fix the aiming. Bye!!!	1
When I finished GoldenEye for the N64 several years ago, I thought, "Wow, we've got a lot to look forward to as endless sequals of Bond action comes out."  Well, several mediocre titles later, only one of which I bothered to purchase, comes Everything or Nothing.  It just happens to be the best action game made to date for the PS2 in my opinion. I had become so jaded to the degradation of the Bond license that it took some glowing reviews from magazines before I would even rent this game.  Once I did, I bought it, and have spent many hours trying to achieve the various objectives embedded in each mission. This game plays like a Bond movie.  It has Hollywood actor voice overs and characterizations.  You can recognize Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Shannon Elizabeth, etc.  I would even go so far as to say this game version is better than the last actual Bond movie, Die Another Day (a North Korean villain with metal stuck in his face and an ice palace, come on, give me a break). Beyond that superficial stuff is the gameplay, which is excellent.  There are usually various ways to accomplish an objective, usually one involving stealth and one with guns blazing. The later missions are quite challenging, and the story is good, even if a little far-fetched.  The missions in New Orleans are partularly fun, and the various "Bond moments" scattered throughout the game add a lot of depth and keep the game from being just another first person shooter. One small note to EA: ditch Jaws.  I think I've killed him 24 times in three different games.  Get another classic villain to use.	1
How many ideal "interactive" games out there? Games like Final Fantasy VII claimed to be cinematic, yet you do 30+ over hours running around and fighting random monsters. Metal Gear Solid series is another, yet despite clever plot twists and addictive gameplay, it fails to be an ideal "interactive" game. Now if we're saying which are better games, any MGS title would've beat this to pulp. James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is perfect in it's own way. It doesn't throw a puny 5-second CGI for every few hours of teddlesome quests or 10-minute CGI for every few minutes of key-fetching work (a reputation of Metal Gear Solid 2). You get fast and furious action with exciting cinematics perfectly complimented each other. Ok, I lied. The story is a disappointment and pretty much rehashed any average Bond movie to date. The voice-casts are excellent though what surprises me is model Ito Misaki displaying a commendable English even better than her counterparts like Michelle Yeoh (great, can we see her in a Hollywood movie next? She's was convincing in Ju-On: The Grudge movie). Too bad her lines were too bloody few, along with Willem Dafoe and Mya. I guess voice-acting in a video game does give you very limited roles. Pierce Brosnan shines and does not disappoint here given plenty of lines for him compared with other casts. His one-liners are perfectly captured with that trademark Bond charisma and coolness. It'll be idiotic to dump Mr Brosnan now for the next Bond film. I can't think Orlando Bloom or Hugh Jackman could ever possess half a quality of a Bond that Brosnan, Sir Sean Connery and even Roger Moore possesses. Now, for the gameplay. It's a bit tad easy with players doing lock-ons 100% of the time. The big flaw is the lack of manual targetting that 3rd person games like MGS had. The shooting levels are exciting, but lacked depth of that Goldeneye or Perfect Dark games. It is simply because the generous and easy lock-on controls that this game possess. The shooting levels are thankfully awesome with trademark Bond gadgets thrown in such as Q Spiders, Nano-suit, Coin-granades and Gun Rapple. When it comes to automobile missions, EoN rules the lot. You're given missiles, machine-gun turrets, flamethrower and Bond-in-built gadgets such as Nano-stealth and remote controlled RC cars. There's an intense Midnight Run level set in a nightime urban city, train chase thoughtout an Egyptian ruin and an interactive Matrix Reloaded Trinity-on-a-bike-against-freeway-traffic tribute where Bond must race on a freeway stopping Jaws' trailer from blowing up a city. The bonus extras for this game are Production Stills which must be unlocked by exceptional rating and an "exclusive" multiplayer co-op missions. Too bad this game falls flat compared to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark when it comes to multiplayer goodness. I am not sure if this game warrants a purchase because even though in every aspect it deserves a high rating, the depth and longetivity is questionable. A must rent and a must buy for true Bond fans.	1
James Bond returns to the small screen in his finest performance yet on this generation of consoles. 007: Everything or Nothing's high-octane action accurately captures the spirit of Bond with a snappy variety of hijinks and a roster of talent that packs in Hollywood stars like sardines. Everything or Nothing represents a sizable leap forward in EA's line of 007 games. The star-studded cast would've been suitable for an actual movie; instead, EoN's original tale deploys the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, Judi Dench as M, John Cleese as Q, Shannon Elizabeth and Heidi Klum as Bond girls, and Willem Dafoe as Nicolai Diavolo, a villain bent on an plot involving nanobots. The camera has been pulled back to a third-person perspective, which adds to the authentic Bond atmosphere and pervasively cinematic feel by putting his famously dashing self on the screen. Also maintaining that Bond spirit, 007 tackles a crazy number of gameplay styles-he mans tank turrets, drives cars and motorcycles, flies helicopters, sneaks through shadows, and blazes away with all manner of weaponry. EA also dispensed with the cheesy dialogue and chintzy gadgets that made earlier games ring false. 007 makes great use of awesome gizmos ranging from a spider drone to a belt-mounted rappel that lets him climb or descend at will. Solid multiplayer support comes in the form of two-player cooperative missions and four-player arenas, while the PS2 version offers online co-op play. Innovative controls help you manage the switch to third-person...mostly. Targeting happens via a lock-on system, but sometimes it can be hard to light up the target you want. With practice, you learn that 007 must be facing an enemy to target him, regardless of where the camera is facing. Counterbalancing that is the effective cursor within the cursor-once you lock on, you can steer a small dot with the right stick to fine-tune your aim and go for head shots. The Spidey-like Bond sense, which activates when the game's paused, helpfully highlights rappel points, selectable objects, and more. Everything else performs smoothly, which is impressive given how many different tasks you undertake in this game. EoN is no mindless shooter. If you don't wisely use the new crouch and back-against-the-wall moves, you'll be sliced to ribbons out in the open-fast. The enemy A.I. pulls its weight, using cover well and reacting to player tactics with reasonable intelligence. The lack of checkpoints or in-game saves, along with the sometimes-stingy supply of health and ammo, means that frustration can become a factor, though not to an agonizing extent. Surprisingly, this adds up to a game that feels aimed more toward hardcore gamers than you might expect. On the presentation side, EoN delivers high quality and a big-budget feel. The differences between the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions are marginal at best, so it's a matter of picking your favorite controller or perhaps the Xbox's slightly better graphics. Across the board, the slick environments, cut-scenes, and character faces shine, although some of the animations are awkward, particularly when 007 runs. A great title song by Mya, strong voice acting, and booming sound effects complete the package. Like the better Bond films, EoN delivers exactly what you expect and hope for, and that's a good thing. This action extravaganza definitely brings 007 in out of the cold.	1
Wow this game was fun the first thing that I noticed that kind of took me by surprize was this game is in third person! Though the third person is a bit choppy and hard to move around sometimes it works pretty well. The big thing that I found about the game was how great the vehicles come into the game! They were the best part!	1
i hate this game! it drives me nuts. i bought the first 2 bond games and i was very surprised with all the gadgets and the good graphics. but now, they changed over to third person. this is the worst thing they could ever do! i hate this game! the multiplayer has something messed up with it, and the lock on target thing sucks. cuz u could be like a mile away and ur gun could just automatically lock on to the player. it's very unrealistic. SO NEVER BUY THIS GAME it is horrible.	-1
ok ok ok, this is a crazy fun game, very cool.  this game will PUMP  YOU  UP!!!!!  First of all, liked max payne? youll LOVE this.  even if you didn't give it a try, i think you'll be plesently suprised.  now the key...ONLINE muthafucher!  This game, online, is pimpin fun!  Wow running around with a dude and blowing baddies away is really fun!	1
This game is very boring. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it has very good grafics. My friend just bought it and I played it on two player with him for half an hour before I got bored. It is differnt from other shooting games like Medal of Honor because you don't really aim the gun your self (it locks on to a target), theres almost no health packs, you have to put the game on slow mode to change your weapon and you cant jump. I wouldnt buy it or rent if if your not a really big bond fan.	1
out of all the james bond games ive played this is the worst of them And yes i would know since ive played every single one of them. not everything about this game is bad and you no wut that thing is its the graphics. I mean the game play is terrible, the 3rd person feture is  to far out and wuts up with the story board. let me include and nominate the voice overs though that was pretty good.   {im me at blbuckinator,i am an expert gamer and played mostly every ps2 game,i also did voice overs for kingdom hearts and for the portal show on g4tv including other games, i am a twelve year old gamer waiting for your questions}	1
It was great to see some big names lend their likeness to this title. Right from the opening credits you can tell this game will be a vast improvement over the previous 007 titles. Heidi Klum, Shannon Elizabeth, and my personal fav. Mya are in the game as well! (VA-VA-BOOM) Throw in a lot of the neat gadgets, more advanced enemies, much longer levels, variety of vehicles, etc. and we got ourseleves a winner. The best part of the game for me is the fact that the game totally immerses you in the various locations. You don't just go to a box-like building in some remote location. You actually feel you are in the specific location due to the level and sheer size of the maps. The driving levels in New Orleans and Peru are especially fun. The game can be easy or hard, depending on the level you choose and the one player mission, IMO has a good replay value. But what really makes this game a 5 star game is the multiplayer option as well as the co-operative games. Truly a much needed addition to this series. I remember how happy I was with goldeneye for the N64 and this will do the same for me and my XBOX. Enjoy!	1
This is by far one of the greatest games ever made. It is entirely unique from all other 007 games yet has all of the things a good action game needs. To start the new hand to hand combat mode is increadibly realistic. It mimics the fighting moves bond does in the movie. Second piloting all sorts of vehicles in several levels is awesome. You go from the Porsche SUV to a motorcycle to a helicopter to a tank to an Ashton Martin Vanquish to a delivery truck. (Plus those are just the first 10 levels) The plot of Everything Or Nothiing is better than some of the real 007 movie plots. There are a ton of levels that can be played on three different skill sets. This game incorperates more gadgets and weapons then ever before. There's even a gadget that lets you walk down walls and an explosive remote controll spider. If all the high tech stealth stuff isn't for you,you can still just run in and bust a machine gun. Everything Or Nothing is seriously an amazing game. If you didn't like Nightfire than you should be pleasently surprized about this game. They are totally different. I would recomend this for anyone however, It is rated teen for a good reason. (Violence mainly and a lot of pretty girls... It is James Bond)Please give what I believe to be the best game of the young year a try, it will blow you away.	1
Everthing or Nothing is probably the best Bond adapted game ever on any consoles! The game have excellent varied game modes wich includes gun'em'down, stealth, driving, helicopter chaes and much much more. Video & Audio is simply outstanding, and the controller is very, very good (not perfect, but very good). And the coolest parts: Real voice-works from Pierce Brosnan, John Cleese and more celebrities, as well as a original title song by Mya in real Bond style. Unfortantly, i cannot say that the game is 100% perfect. Cons include: - The game may be a bit to hard & frustraiting in certain areas - A bit to linear, stealth not 100% requierd - Dull camera works - You must unlock much of the multiplayer content Other than this, Everthing or Nothing is way better than Rareware's GoldenEye. This is a highly recommented title you really should lookout for. Bond has never been this good! Shaken, not stired...	1
First of all this is not a bad game, but like all Bond games it is flawed by its Bondness.  It seems to me that once a game designer is handed a franchise, like Bond, a lot of their urge to truly innovate and make a really great game disappears.  Yes, this is a good game, it has good graphics, a competent, but very short plot, and some nice gameplay elements, but it is not superb. It is also cursed with the disease of all games that try to do too much, the third person play is fine, the driving is fine, and the other game play aspects are fine, but nothing is superlative.  Instead of making a great third person shooter or a great driving game, the designers make a series of pretty good substitutes and combine them. I will say this though the game comes as close to the game/movie mind meld as I have seen.  First rate voice talent, and a sufficient plot make this game as good as most Bond movies, and that is more than most movie to game efforts can say for themselves. I am not sad I bought this game, and I would say that if you love Bond this game is a must have.  For everyone else though look in your wallets, if you see five bucks and a credit card rent this game first, if you see fifty and don't have to buy groceries, buy this game.	1
In a sure sign that video games are as powerful as movies, the latest James Bond game has all the actors, all the action, all the effects - and isn't based on a movie! Perfect for fans of New Orleans, a lot of the story takes place in that historic city of Louisiana. James Bond has the fast cars, the sexy, intelligent women, and the self assured skills that get him out of any jam. All the actors and actresses are here, and it makes a HUGE difference to hear John Cleese, Judi Densch, Pierce Brosnan and all the other voices speaking to you while you play. The likenesses are all very accurate too, so it really is like playing a movie. Where some previous Bond games were more like Rambo, this one is pure Bond. You get special bonus points for doing a special Bond Move where you defeat your enemies with a brilliant strategy instead of just blasting them. It's more Splinter Cell rather than Unreal II. The graphics are great, with little spider robots, slick cars, well done smoke and fire and other atmospheric effects. You really do feel like you're in a movie and not looking at a texture-mapped building. Gameplay is great, too. The enemies show some amazing AI in sequences. It might get a little used to the gameplay style, but stick with it. After a few hours of the learning curve (which a well done training level works you through) you will be totally immersed in this world. Replayability is just amazing, too. You go through once to get the basic idea of the level. But then you keep going through aiming for those Bond moments, and trying to ratchet your score up by doing it quickly and accurately. If you're able to get on Platinum Level in all missions, you unlock new bonusses. Everyone I know who has seen and played this game loves it, and we ourselves are quite addicted to it right now. There are stealth missions, driving missions, shooting missions, even ride-and-shoot missions. The cut scenes are great, too! I definitely rate this one a must-buy for any fan of the Bond series, and for any action gamer in general. Enjoy!!	1
NHL 2004 shows some signs of being a quality game, but lacks far too much to actually achieve this. Some features were improved, others took a step backwards and the result is an average at best game that could have and should have been so much more. We'll start with the gameplay. The computer is able to use this incredible little "Hold/Hook" feature to get the puck from you at will. Last I checked Holding and Hooking were penalties, but the computer is hardly penalized for these infractions. Naturally you might think that turning around and hooking/holding them would be successful, but don't worry, the computer is able to skate right through hooks and holds. This leads to many frustrating encounters as the computer effortlessly strips you of the puck while you have to bash a computer guy through the glass to get the puck from him. The passing can also be frustrating, guys often cut or spontaneously change their direction after you fire off the pass. I thought I had finally got passing down, was getting 80-85% passing and then I was hit with a game in which I completed a whole 56% of passes. As far as I know I didn't change anything. The nature of the beast? At any rate, passing, while it isn't guarenteed anymore (that's good) is perhaps a bit too random now. The camera angles are also rather poor. I don't know why EA messed with it's cameras, but for any of the vertical camera angles the "up" net and the area behind the "up" net is impossible to find the puck in. The off-ice features are a mess as well. First of all, no more NHL Cards. OK, OK, so you never used them anyway right? But you could unlock stuff with certain cards and earning points to buy card packs was a nice extra element. Well all that is gone. Instead in NHL 2004 there is a menu option called "Unlockables". Oh, how original. I believe it is tied in with your EA Sports Bio and periodically it pops up and gives you a new unlockable. Exciting, isn't it? Now how about that new Dynasty mode you ask yourself? Well, it's a start at a good mode but is riddled with problems. First of all is this upgrade stuff. You get your team in a crippled state, their facilities are horrible and you have to use upgrades to get them to average and then beyond. Until you do that's a big ol -10 OV to your players. But every other GM faces this problem too, so the playing field is level ... everyone just plays with slow 70-75 OV players until they get their facilities up. Of course, that'll take about 35 more upgrade points than you start with, so you'll need 3500 exp points. That'd be 350 trades or 1750 wins. Win a Stanley Cup or two along the way and it's probably only 500 wins. That's not the only problem either. Dynasty Mode conviently forgets to mention when players are injured and refuses to even give you an injury estimate. Perhaps this may be related to the medical upgrades, but I should still be able to know if he's in serious health trouble or not. The effect of back to back games on your players is also ridiculous, don't expect to win the back end of any back to backs: your players are literally pylons out there. The big effort of NHL 2004 seemed to go into its Dynasty Mode. This means the other features are very bare bones and you really must use Dynasty Mode to get anything worthwhile out of the game. Unforetunately, while Dynasty Mode had some good ideas the execution wasn't there. And sadly the gameplay certainly isn't about to "hook or hold" you in where the features fail (haha haha ha ...) The motto of NHL 2004: It had some good ideas, but the execution just wasn't there.	-1
This game is not that good. The EA sports series for hockey are getting to complex and boring,like this one. You don't have nearly as much control as the other Hockey games, and the slapshots stink! Get ESPN NHL HOCKEY or NHL HITS PRO.	-1
I have been a long supporter of EA sports and their hockey franchise. I wanted them to create a more challenging game which NHL 2004 is, but htey did the one thing I wished they would never do, they changed the control system. My biggest gripe, YOU HAVE TO USE THE ANALOG STICK. Now I as an old school gamer has lived and died by my directional pad. This one alteration made it very difficult to control. Number 2, the supposed advanced control setup, when you set up one side of the puck's control's, it alters the design for the opposite side and when you try and fix it, it alters the other side again. I just found these changes absolutely damaging to the franchise that has prided itself on easy to use controls. It is a decent game for those who like the analog but I rarely use it and to be forced and have no choice, turns me off to this game, hence why I only gave it three stars. Later, IsleStyle	1
I think this is the most realistic game in the NHL series.  The player models are excellent, and the faces are very recognizable, although everyone sports short hair, which is a bit disappointing, I really wanted to see Anson Carter's dreads or Alfredsson's hair sticking out everywhere.  The animation is smooth and fluid, although it slows down once in a while.  The right analog control really lets you deke and hit with much more precise control.  Once you learn how to deke and shoot in one motion by pressing down the analog stick after you finish your move, you will be looking for that breakaway all the time.  Which leads to my next point, don't look for that breakaway all the time!  You can't chase people all over the ice looking for the big hit like Kasparitis anymore.  You have to stay in position and play smart by poking the puck away, by laying down to block the cross ice pass, and by holding and hooking your opponents.  In that regard, the game is a lot more like real hockey than any previous versions.  On the one hand it may seem slower gameplay, but on the other hand, it's much easier setting up plays behind the net and cycling the puck to create one-timers.  The game clock also runs at real time during powerplays so you actually have 2 full minutes to get the powerplay goal or to kill.  The last minute of the game also runs at real time, which allows huge comebacks.  Although the high-speed up and down hockey is gone, you now have more chances to really create space by executing plays.  And even though positional defense is the emphasis, you can still connect on some major hits, and they look a lot more realistic as sometimes your guy will fall to the ice with the poor victim, and other times the helmet would pop off and stay on the ice until there's a stop in the action.  The fighting is also improved and much more exciting, with the new grappling and blocking system.  There are also some European teams to choose from, too bad there are no Russian teams.  NHL 2004 truly has incredible gameplay the series has never seen before.  Unfortunately, once again, hockey fans will realize how hockey is treated as second class citizen by EA Sports.  Incomplete retro jerseys and no player from the 2003 draft class are minor flaws I can live with, but what's with the lack of classic teams.  Madden, NCAA Football, NBA Live all feature some sort of classic teams.  ESPN NHL has classic teams, so why doesn't NHL 2004 have it?  I'd much rather play with the 94 Rangers or the 84 Oilers than some German team I've never heard of before.  Shootout mode is no longer available, which is too bad, cuz the improved deking is screaming to be used in the shootout.  The Dynasty mode is not as good as Madden's either.  Gaining experience points is too painful a process, and having all your players' rating being awful because of your poor facilities will eventually get on your nerves.  And the worst is the fact that just about every other start player reaches the 200 point plateau.  Just about every team has a 2 points per game guy, and 100 goals are no longer reserved for the guys you control.  This game is worth buying.  The gameplay is wonderful, I just wish that there would've been more features that will improve the atmosphere for this hockey fan.	1
EA's NHL 2004 is so realistic, the average gamer might not like this game.  However, if you are a die-hard hockey fan and gamer, you'll eat this game up on its realism. The Good:  Nearly everything.  The graphics, vastly improved sound (no more cannon blasts for slap shots), better animations--board pinning, simulation gameplay, and total control keep me in awe every time I play this game.  Where some may complain about the advanced control, most will appreciate the fact that you, the gamer, are in 100% control of your player--not the 50% by you with 50% computer assistance as in the past.  What do I mean?  Passing, stick-handling, shooting, choosing to get into fights, power level of hits and power level of dumping the puck are all "you".  No more is the computer aiming your passes, making your players fight at bad times, or protecting the puck for you (you use the right analog stick to move your stick/deke away from poke checks).  You have total control. Another good point in this game is the realism.  No longer can one take a puck from end-to-end by just going up the boards.  With computer players trying to poke check the puck away or hook at you, there is going to be the need to either pass or dump the puck in once you cross the red line (you will find yourself dumping the puck a lot--which is good).  No longer can you just start taking people out of position and make big hits.  This will cause opponents to drive to the net untouched and you will pay with a goal against--Remember, this is a simulation (not arcade) game.  You need to play this game like you see it on TV. Another major improvement is the fighting engine.  Sure it was a total joke in the past, but you are going to love it this year.  No longer are there two players standing side-by-side like robots taking speedy punches from each other.  This year, players grapple and struggle to get their fist to the other guys head or body.  Goalies even get into the action when the game gets really heated. The Bad:  There's not too much to say here, but the game isn't perfect.  During the game, you will notice the computer probably gets away with more hooks than it should, but it's not a serious problem because you should be passing or dumping the puck to avoid getting angry about this (I was at first, but I don't mind anymore).  Also, there seems to be a problem with your goalie staying close (or "hugging") to the post on bad angle shots--too many goals seem to go in between the post and your goalie. The only major problem I have with this game is the online play.  The online server for NHL 2004 isn't nearly as good as the Madden server.  It's seriously flawed with horrible glitches that need to be addressed by EA.  [I have yet to get a game in due to a faceoff glitch at the beginning of the game--won't go past the opening faceoff].  EA's NHL online support is horrible and doesn't offer much support.  If someone quits on you, you have no option to continue--so the game is over and done and the only thing that tells that game existed is a higher disconnect percentage under your username (you don't get a win if you had the lead when you were quit-on).  The online experience seems to be okay from what I hear from other players, but it's seriously flawed. Overall, this game is nearly perfect for the gamer that want total control and a total simulation hockey game (most real on the difficult level).  You can play online, but expect some problems.  Putting the online problems aside, you'll love this game. To the average gamer that likes high scores and likes to go out and hit every player that moves--Stay away from this game as these things just do not happen. To the serious gamer and die-hard hockey fan--You will not be winning many games by simply hitting and shooting.  Oh, no--not this year my gaming friend.  You are going to have to play hockey!  Go and get this game!	1
I am very surprised at the number of awful reviews this game has gotten here.  I can only guess that mnost wrote them after playing this game less then an hour.  It takes time to fully appreciate all this version has to offer.  It is ironic that many complain now how hard scoring is..if you check past versions reviews you will see many complaining about unrealistic scores.  EA can't win either way. Basically, this is the most realistic hockey game made.  The speed is human, not super human.  The passing is awesome because you now have to actually have skill to pull it off.  I love how you can hold other players against the boards and hook them to slow them down.  I was mazed to see one reviewer complain about the high number of blocks when trying to shoot the puck.  Anyone who watches real hockey knows that on almost every outside shot a defender will dive to try to block the puck.  This is an awesome feature of this year's version and makes defense even more enjoyable since you have to time your blocks just like NBA Street. I hated the speed boost (R2 button) at first, but now can appreciate that it is set up to be realistic and you must use it only when it is perfectly appropriate.  In fact, the button allows you to vary your speed and that helpd to avoid poke checks.  Another great feature is the manual dekes using the left analog stick.  Not only to you have full control over moving the puck, but you can actually shoot it by pressing down on the analog stick. To show I am not a shill for EA, I will now mention a much needed improvment.  There is no reason why this game did not come with a practice option.  With all the new button combinations, it is ridiculous that they have no real tutorial (other than a brief video) which allows you to perfect the techniques.  The brilliant soccer game Winning Eleven 6 literally have an academy you have to go through to learn its controls, why could EA not have provided something simliar?  I would bet that many complaints would have faded had gamers gotten a chance to learn the new controls rather then have to play and pick them up while getting clobbered. So, if you already have past versions where all you do is fly down the ice on breakaways and score 15-20 goals a game, and want something new for your money, then this game is well worth it.  Do not let the negative reviews deter you.  Unlike Knockout Kings 2003, this is not a horrible game, it is instead a new version, quite different from earlier ones..and for 50 bucks that is what i would want.	1
As I'm sure you can imagine, this game is not only the greatest hockey game I've ever played, it is also one of the best sports games ever, too. I played a demo of it on a bootleg copy from someone I know at EA, and I have to say that you will most definitely not be let down by it. The new dyansty mode will certainly be detrimental to your productivity at work or school. The new Bruise Control makes it even more fun to fight and get physical on the boards, you'll love it!	1
I haven't played this yet, but FIFA hasn't dissapointed me since. FIFA is one of the few games that you could play for days witout getting bore and the best part is that with every edition of FIFA, they have improved the game. I am most excited about this edition with all the administrative stuff that you can do and even more realistic movements and reaction from players Don't waste your time with those other soccer games. They are all just wannabees of FIFA...yea, I said it!	1
Trash, all of it Thats what I think I would say when I see these kinds of reviews.  All trash.  Well most of em.  This game has practically went beyond my expectations.  I don't make sharp comments on every game.  A game is a game.  But this game, it blows every other game.  Winning Eleven 6 is nothing compared to FIFA 2004.  The faces looks so realistic, wow.  Theres 4 modes: Play Now, Career Mode, Tournament Mode, and Practice.  People say there is no friendly but Play Now is practically the same.  Practice mode is where you can select as many players as you want for the opposing team and do whatever pk, fk, or jsut a regular play.  career Mode you get a 5 year quest to lead a team to victory.  The only thing I hate is that they didn't add any chants for Korea.  The controls are awesome.  Not like in other games when you take a sharp turn afer a long run you can actually move the defenders off a lot.  Other games the computer just sticks to you like magnet.  The graphics, oh dang.  Players faces look a little cartoony but this has to be the most accurate graphic detail in any soccer game I have ever seen.  The background music is kind of dumb though (CHANGE IT I MEAN WANNA ROCK from JAPAN WAS WEIRD! ADD BROWN EYES TEARS OF THE MOON FROM KOREA!"The commentary is awesome.  One of the announcers who I think is new sucks to me.  I think its Ally McCoist.  I mean hes a great announcer but some plays he just drifts off.  I haven't even heard all the comments but they keep on saying new comments!  Trust me, this game was worth it!  FIFA 2003 is like Madden 2004 and Madden 97 distance, catch my drift?  If I JUST bought a PS2 and wanted some type of sports game, this would be it.  The other reviews are jsut like that guy from "American Idol" who is a very strict critic!  These guys worked hard and did a good job!  So trust me, this game IS BETTER THAN WINNING 11!  BUY FIFA 2004	1
What they produce it's not soccer!!!, I bought fifa 2004 just for the online play, (another disappointment the online gameplay) but just like others fifa's games, a complete dissapoint. It's seems like your game it's a merge of soccer and NFL, NOT soccer at all. Everyone who played real soccer... at least once in it's life, could tell you that fifa series it's not soccer, or it's what EA team think soccer it's.. or should be, but not way of play. Fifa have good grafics, but you don't feel the emotion of the soccer seen graphics, soccer it's passion, not graphics and tactics of NFL games. I won't purchase any fifa game ever!. See what Winning eleven 6 or 7 does, or Word tour soccer 2005 does whith the gameplay.	-1
albeit you can't form any tournaments as in its predecessor, this game is still worth the purchase.  there are those complaining about how the transfer market doesn't allow you to aquire top talent (i had 13 million or so with psg and players like beckham will you cost you around 34 million), but this isn't much of a problem considering that you can edit rosters before starting your career.  thus, i brought over viera, henry and zidane (perhaps my performance didn't merit such quality but it's only a game).  as far as the difficulty goes it isn't too imposing as you can sharpen your skills (with edited rosters) in the practice mode.  this game does require you to actually incorporate other players on the field, you can't just run around with one player in the hope of finding a opening.	1
Since the last Fifa game, EA has improved the most important aspect which was the game play. The new controls to enable players off the ball to move and make runs add so much to the game. As a single player you can play like you were in a multi-player environment. Other points of improvement are the the realistic graphic details and the goal celebrations add so much realism to the game. As many other reviewers I use to own Winning Eleven, although Fifa 2004 has almost all the teams and players that I read about then can play them on the screen adds another dimension of realism to the game. Enjoy the game it is worth playing until the next version comes out.	1
before i bought this game i had read some of the reviews, and to tell you the truth they were all negative, you know saying that the game was too slow, and that there were no holland and the list goes on and on, but when i got it, i was surprised yes it was slow but that's not a bad thing 'cause now you actually have time to pass with more accuracy and that's good, the enviorement that surrounds the game is awesome!! the uniforms are up to date and the players look the same, the defense is smarter, and yes it's pretty hard to score sometimes, but EA has given you  the choice of the R2 button, which allows you to walk, and if you're in the striking zone you press that button and you can execute better giving you the chance to enter the goalkepper zone and score, so you don't have to do it from a long range, know i've noticed something while in carrer and that is: no rain at all, and the special moves!!! DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO DO A BICYCLE KICK??? 'cause i haven't seen any type of it so if you know tell us 'cause i'm not the only one dying to know!!!! but besides that, is a pretty good game!!	1
Why people don`t accept changes?, every edition of fifa has its changes, and all the changes are for good.  By example, there are only one speed of the game, but with this you can create a better plays, with more time and precition to make a pass, and with the new funtion that let you move your player who doesn`t have the ball, its a great Idea, you can move your team as you decide...and what a beautiful plays you can make and what a nice goals..the movements of the players are asewome, its almost real, you can make goals from a lot of position, but it depends if you have space to make such play.  don`t wait to get this new game, has a lot of changes and fixes, that I will mention below.  Personally I recomend it, what game have all the superstars and stadiums, and uniforms???...this is Real. Pros: *the new control without ball player *the practice area *in fifa 2003 when you were playing and you push a button the player react instantly making unwishing passes, but now the player don`t react when you push buttons while play, he wait and make the pass..*the way to make corners, wow!! you can select between three choices...and you select the player who have to score and there is a battle with the defender and you, the vision is awesome, again...almost real  *the way to make free kicks, direct or undirect *the motion videos, and replays are well done, and you can saw the better plays at the end of the game twice...* the career mode, is a great Idea just to put in the place of a manager...you can choose a team from the 3rd premier league and put in the 1st premier league *the way to save your games, if is a tournament, in a tournament tab, if is a career, in the career tab...you can rename it to know what game is it..and so.. Pros: *you cannot make tournaments, there are not world cup tournament, so the way to play with international teams, is always friendly... *in career mode you cannot invent a team, you have to use the default teams. As I saw, I think that maybe when I play and win tournaments and all...could be that I can unlock tournaments, or other stuff... so, don`t think to much and buy it...its a Classic Game that you must have... ah, almost forget...maybe some day we can save our goals...it will be great...because I have scored a lot of beautiful goals, and I cannot share with nobody....	1
I was scratching my head last year why EA changed the sprint control from the triangle to the R1, and then I played Winning Eleven 6, and it hit me. Electronic Arts have been playing catch up since Konami came out with the Pro-Evolution/Winning Eleven series.  What amazes me is that there are still people giving good reviews to the Fifa series? Just a word of advice, pick up a baseball bat and stop kidding yourselves. What's wrong with 2004 you ask? Everything! This is not futbol, futebol, soccer, calcio or anything remotely near it. I learned my lesson after buying Fifa 2003 without even playing it first. This year I rented 2004 and I returned it the same day. The Fifa series is a bad cancer for futbol. It alters the perception of the public of what the game is truly about just so it can be marketable in the US. Just like when FIFA tried to incorporate the timeout just so they can fit in those 3 minute commercial spots. Can you even imagine they experimented with it in Brazil? Well I'm through experimenting with the Fifa series form EA. I just hope somebody from EA reads this review and comments it on their next creative meeting. 'Where did we go wrong?' they would ask themselves. Simple, you never listened to your customers.	-1
Fifa 2004 has definitely improved since its tainted 2003 version. In this one, the focus seems to be on club activity as opposed to national teams. I've always been more interested in club soccer, so this game suits me fine. But for someone who is more interested in managing your own national side, well, this might not be the game for you. In terms of gameplay and graphics, both are top-notch. Controlling your players off of the ball is admittedly tough to get the hang of at first, but it's adds a new dimension to the game. The graphics are truly splendid, and the players' faces are alarmingly accurate. Overall, I'd rate this game 4/5. It would have been nice to see more international teams and more competitions to the fold, but generally, I think most will find this game quite acceptable.	1
I don't think this game even deserves one star. This is by the far the worst soccer game I have EVER played in my life. The controls get worse every year, the gameplay slows down every year, the realism was non-existant 5 years ago in FIFA and ceases to exist now. Everyone who gave this game 4 or 5 stars know absolutely NOTHING about soccer. This is the last time I have bought an EA soccer game. I wish I lived in Europe where they have a lot more realistic soccer (football) games. Europeans rule! If they were the ones behind the production of this game, I gaurantee that it would be a masterpiece. I'm getting rid of this nonsense tomorrow.	-1

If you go onto w[...] youll see an advertisment for ROLLER COASTER TYCOON 3!!!!!!!!! It says it'll be released this holiday season and new features include 3-D GRAPHICS, front car view on the roller cosaters and more	1
As for myself, I LOVE this game!  The expansion packs are great!  You have sooooo many more options than before.  My favorite part is creating my own scenario and giving myself lots of money and every piece of scenary or rides that I'd like and just CREATE!  It's great! Now for the kicker ----  I'm a "in my 30's" homeschooling mom! :)	1
Mario kart games have always been good and this one has a style of its own.  Now there are 2 characters in a kart, one for driving, the other for throwing items at the other karts.  It looks like it will be another mario kart winter.	1
The GamePlay In Kirby Air Ride Should Duplicate The Gameplay Of Mario Kart Double Dash. So If You Liked Previous Games In The Kirby Series You Should Definitley Check This One Out.	1
Addictive and Super Fun. Runs like Brand New. Just sooo PERFECT.	1
Came on time, been playing it for months and it's still working perfectly fine	1
2003 was an interesting year for racing game. Few of them were F-Zero GX, Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, and this game. While I did enjoyed the previous two (Double Dash is my favorite to this day), Kirby Air Ride gave me a second chance. And oh boy, I was really surprise after I started the game. Good controls, great soundtrack, nice graphics, and fun multiplayer! Plus, the City Trial Mode is the most fun experience to play with friends for countless hours.  It maybe not my favorite spinoff of the series, but Air Ride is a worthy Gamecube game today.	1
One of my kids favorite game...works well in their Wii..Arrived on time...excellent gift...	1
Great Product! Loved it.	1
SERIOUSLY, Kirby Air Ride is one of the most underrated racing games I've ever heard of. In the wake of Mario Kart Double Dash, folks were surprised to see Kirby hit the road on his pop star. And MAN my sister and cousins loved it! I loved Mario Kart DD, but honestly, I gotta say Air Ride will stick with me for years to come. The stages are gorgeous, truly showing what the NGC was capable of at the time, and they're also designed well. The bird-eye view stages are just so adorable yet hecktic, it's really something you don't see in racing games today. And CIty Trial is probably one of the funnest things I have ever done in a video game. Collecting items to beat up your friends, jump on about every available vehicle, trying to get to the top of the volcano or heading under ground! Zig Zagging through mazes or soaring through the sky on a legendary machine! Every time and event popped up, the hype was REAL. Masahiro Sakurai and Hal Labs REALLY know to give you a game. You can clearly see the influence Super Smash Bros Melee had on this game, and the influence this game had on Brawl and SSB4. All in all, forget the critics, pop the game open, get 3 other friends and have a BLAST.	1
son loves it	1
Great Game, hours of fun!	1
I used to play this game a lot when I was younger. When I played it for the first time in years I was so impressed. The different tracks get repetitive though.	1
best kart game, IMHO	1
It came in pretty good quality and the disc is scratch-free. It works perfectly and I've encountered no problems.	1
Game cheats, horrible controls.  Typical Nintendo pattern of making a game cheat to substitute difficulty.  Whoever wrote this game and released it should be jailed for consumer fraud.	-1
amazing game. a must have for a gamecube owner and is great four player or one player!	1

Great game, came in mint condition, y'all can trust these guys, my cd is still working great today. Enjoy it!	1
This was one of the greatest games that I have ever played its insane that I even see one bad review on here because honestly all those people who did give it a bad review seem like trolls or at least most of them. I played this when I think I was seven, but now I'm 18 and my copy broke. I actually was playing this with a few friends when it suddenly broke and I spared no time in buying a working one. The box, manual, and disc came in a very great condition I almost could swear that there was not a single scratch on that thing. It has arrived and while I'm typing this review I continue to play it  against CPU and friends. Those who say this games is easy put the freaking difficulty higher than one star I swear I had it on nine and the cpus are insanely fast at collecting power ups. I hope when I have a family of my own this is one game my children will play.	1
Works great. A little disappointed at the lack of rainbow road, but it was a necessary addition to my collection. Everything is in excellent condition, if not better. Recommended seller.	1
Easy, enjoyable, and fun for all ages! Highly recommend this game to be in your library. Controls are simply the control stick, and the A button.	1
At first glance, it looks like Kirby is ripping off Mario Kart, but that's far from it. Kirby Air Ride is completely different.  There are three modes. Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial.  Air Ride is like Mario Kart where you race around the track and be the first one to complete all laps. What I like about most maps is that there is so much space and alternate routes to take. On the air ride machine, since each one is different you will have a different experience each time trying to beat each time. The biggest flaw is the simple fact that you start with the Warp Star and have to unlock the rest of the machines which could take forever given that each machine is set at a different speed and it means taking the fastest route without crashing into walls or ghost collision at the top of the game. The soundtrack for each stage is amazing and every stage is themed (and I dare say after an element). Frozen Hillside and Magma Overflow are still my favorite level.  Top Ride is a small multiplayer mode (then again all of the modes are multiplayer). You play on an extremely small course trying to complete it the fastest. This game I found was boring since hitting your opponent was similar in the other modes of the game only you get controls that hardly work and the computer is so perfect with its steering on the higher levels.  City Trial is probably where you'll be spending most of the game doing. In this game, you're thrown into the city on a Compact Star (weaker than Warp Star) and have 3-7 minutes to collect power ups in the city to power up your machine (from increasing the attack to increasing the boost, etc.) Your usually put up against 3 other computers doing the same thing and more times than not, they'll leave you alone to collect their own power ups. City trail is so open though in which you can do almost anything. You can switch your air ride machine, collect power ups, participate in the events that occur in the city (such as destroying the pillar or attacking Dyno Blade) and even attacking your opponents, destroying their machine and stealing their power ups. There are many weapons in the city to choose from sword Kirby to setting time bombs in the ground where it blows up if someone hovers over it. At the end of the time limit, you are thrown into a random event and whoever completes the objective wins (from racing a stage from the main game to defeating a certain amount of enemies to KOing King DDD). Sometimes the game foreshadows what event will happen on the bottom of the screen while other times it keeps you guessing. You can set it up where it will only be a specific thing if your'e trying to get a certain achievement (but even with the racing, the stages are random). The best part though is collecting the three pieces of the Hydra or Dragoon star and wrecking your opponent in the city and outside of it given how overpowered these machines are.  Overall, why the game was not well received when it came out, it's a cult classic now with how original the game was that set it apart from Mario Kart Double Dash and F Zero.	1

This was a gift for my grandson.  He loved it, and has played it almost daily since Christmas.  I would recommend, based on his playing experience.	1
Fun game!  My children and I have been fans of Mario Kart Double Dash for years.  We were sad when our old copy wend down, but were happy to find a vendor through Amazon that sells these (GameCube version).  The fit is great and I'm particularly impressed by how soft they are inside and by how warm they are.  This is perhaps the best version of this game ever released.  5 stars.	1
This IMO Is The Best Mario Kart Ever. Had Lots Of Fun Playing It With My Cousins When I Was Younger. And Still Am Even In My Twenties. Pick This Game Up. You Won't Regret It.	1
I like to collect all the Mario Kart Games.	1
This is the only Kirby game for the GC, and it is great. Its not like other kirby games. Its racing and u r kirby that rides on this platform. U can race either on multiplayer which if u go into the city its kind of like freeride. It is fun to just mess around on multiplayer and see what u can do. The graphics r really good for the GC and the sound is like other GC games. The controls r good and easy to use. This is a great game on multiplayer or single player.	1
Overall, Nintendo and HAL Laboratories did an outstanding job creating this masterpiece of standard Kirby game plus action racing game with some of the greatest graphics on the GameCube. Most of the Kirby games are addicting, easy, simple, and short. The addicting, simple, and easy attributes make the Kirby games wonderful for any gamer, but the short length of most of the Kirby games doesn't apply to those more interested in gaming. This Kirby game is addicting, easy to pick up (hard to master), and with a depthness to gameplay and a long time to complete makes this the greatest Kirby game of all time. There's not much of a story to Kirby Air Ride, but that's to be expected, because (with the exception of Canvas Curse) none of the Kirby games have really had a story. The game is fast paced, but little ones and older ones alike can easily pick up on the one button gameplay. Anyone can get all that they want from this game. For those looking for 15 minutes of fun, easily done. For those looking for a nice long game, the checklist of accomplishments will keep any gamer sitting around for a long time trying to complete them. The genre of this game is hard to explain. Somehow, the creators meshed racing with standard Kirby style so well, that there's only one word for the genre: KIRBYRACING! This is a game that needs to be on any gamer's shelf, or even for people who don't consider themselves gamers who just want a fun game. This is one of my favorite games of all time. Your friend in gaming, CPU12 "Nintendo Freak"	1
this game is very fun!  When I first played it I thought it would be dumb but its a really cool game!!!  It is hard to get use to the controls but after you play a while you will get use to them.  If I was trying to get someone to try a game with Kirby in it I would tell them about this one.	1
My son is huge gamer and we both had a lot of fun with this game. For some odd reason we have a hard time with are we accepting the GameCube disks, and we literally have to try over and over and over for quite a while until we can get them to work but when we get them working they are great!	1
its work	1
Got exactly what I read in description. Very pleased!	1
Love it	1
Very hard handling! But a true classic!	1
Man, I haven't play this game for long times!	1
Must have for your GameCube. Super fun multiplayer too	1
Normally when you think game sequels a small tear forms as you realize the subsequent sequels generally don't live up to the fun and hype of the original game. The Mario Kart team has proved us all wrong time and time again that they know how to still think outside of the box they created and add just enough elements to keep you coming back and wanting more.  The gameplay is essentially the same as the previous Mario Kart, except now you have two rivers that you can switch between. Each driver can hold an item while in passive mode and each driver has their own "special" item that might drop from a [?] box. This adds a whole new strategy to the game when combining drivers that have specials you might be able to benefit from at different times during the race. Another element the game adds is that the carts you can choose also change depending on which drivers you have, so picking someone like Mario with Toad, might open up a faster cart that Mario did not have access to previously.  Aside from just the drivers and carts, the game has a ton of new courses to race through and a few new battle arenas. The racing mode is as engrossing as it ever is and battling your friends continues to be one of the major reasons for coming back to this game.  In case anyone is wondering, yes the AI still frustrates the heck out of you on 250cc and, of course, have the insane ability to catch up to you in ridiculously small amounts of time - but hey it wouldn't be Mario Kart if they didn't!  Score: 9.0 out of 10. Once again they have knocked the Mario Kart series out of the park. The only real detracting factor is that the battle mode also has a limited amount of arenas, which makes the game incredibly repetitive at times.	1

I am not sure just what it is that this game has, but it's got it!  It didn't get great reviews, but it looked fun to me, and I bought it for my kids---well, it's been played far more than any of the other (too many) video games we have!  There are 3 basic modes---a standard racing mode, a overhead view racing mode and City Mode, which takes more explaining!  The standard mode uses Kirbys riding on different vehicles, going VERY fast on different kinds of courses.  Kirby can eat enemies and take their powers for a while.  You can race each other, or the computer.  All you really do is steer and slow down in order to power up for a boost.  It's very simple to control Kirby, and you get a great feeling of being half out of control while still in control!  The overhead mode is kind of retro looking.  You race a little Kirby around and around a small track (there are several different ones).  The track looks like those little car tracks from the 70s.  There are bonus items you can eat up as you race, some boost you, some hurt others.  The City Mode is what we play the most.  It's WEIRD but fun!  It's a city full of odd things---a section of trees, a section of run down buildings, a waterwheel, a castle, a subway, lots of underground areas---all sort of minimalistically portrayed!  The real goal is to break open all kinds of boxes and get power up items, like better turning or better speed.  In the standard mode, you have 5 minutes to do this.  You can find different vehicles lying around, and ride them instead of your starting one.  Then, after the 5 minutes, you compete in a random pick of one of 20 or so stadium events---a  long jump, a race, a melee match, etc.  It's fun as you might have collected items for a race, which do you no good in what you are actually doing, so all have a chance!  The most fun of this game is trying to finish the grids with records!  There are a huge 128 boxes to fill in for EACH mode!  Some are things like getting a certain score, but others are out there, like finishing with your time all a certain number on the seconds!  We haven't filled all the boxes in any of the modes yet!  But we have had fun trying---it's so neat to see after you finish a section if any of the little boxes get filled in!  We are simple people, I guess---we enjoy that a lot!  If I had any complaint about the game, I guess I wish there were more unlockable tracks or modes---I love that, although I don't know why---I guess it gives you something to aim for!  All in all, a super game!	1
i bought this game only because you can have up to 4 players. since i have 4 kids, it works out great! the kids love the game. simple enough for everyone yet still fun for the older ones. worth the money.	1
THIS GAME IS SO FUN I HAD  THIS GAME SINCE IT FISRT CAME OUT. THE GAME IS STILL FUN. THE GAME HAS SO MANY THINGS TO DO. YOU CAN PLAY AIR RIDE AND TOP RIDE AND ALSO CITY RIDE. THE GAME IS GREAT TO PLAY WITH 3-4 PLAYERS. SO BUY IT NOW BECAUSE IT IS CHEEP AND FUN.	1
This game is extremely fun and easy to play but it is limited. There are 3 modes but no story mode. The modes are City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Ride. City Trial: You fly around a city trying to upgrade your ship. Air Ride:Basic Racing. Top Ride:You race on a small course. You see everything from above. Its like a mini arcade game. I like it.	1
Forget Forza, GranTurism or Need For speed. This is the best racing game hands down. You can take a friend along as a gunner riding in your rear. I felt like I was back in Iraq on patrol missions as I launched murderous shells at the other opponents on the track. The sweet sweet feeling of knocking someone off into deep space on rainbow road will never get old.  If you have the room and money, I suggest you buy two or more GameCube systems and multiple displays and play on LAN mode. I'm currently at Four GameCubes, four DD copies, four broadband adapters and 16 controllers for a very amazing night of Double Dash LAND gaming. I'm working towards eight complete GameCube systems and all the necessary accessories to have the most fun out of this game that is possible. I will post pictures of the complete LAN setup at my lake house.	1
Great Product	1
all kirby games have like a story mode but this one doesn't. there is a mode where you cruise around and solve really hard problems if you can. you could unlock all sorts of sweet vehicles and tracks. you could play free ride by yourself and with your friends. kirby air ride is up to 4 players. in multiplayer mode you can solve problems and stuff like in 1 player mode. kirby air ride is really fun to play and is up to 4 players.	1
good condition,thanks	1
Got it for the Wii w/Gamecube controllers.  My kids really like it.	1
Fast shipping, good product.	1
New in the packaging, great disk!	1
Thank you, very much!	1
This is a good product, I like it	1
It's Mario Kart.  What more needs to be said.  Its a classic and should be owned by any Nintendo fan.	1
A good game.  Not as good as the Mario Party GameCube Triology excluding Mario Party 4 but still a great game nonetheless.  Still, a must have for any GameCube owners.	1
it ok	1
This game is so fun! It was a ground breaking game for the Mario kart series. They added nice additions like Daisy, Waluigi, Wario etc. The team racing is cool too.	1
my family an I love this product. An we highly recommend it to anyone an everyone. Amazing!!!! Great fro everyone an anyone	1
one of the most fun games ever made other them Mario kart wii & Mario n64. its fun to hear Mario say "im a weenier" good game.	1
Kirby Air Ride is THE game to get!!! It has simple but great graphics, very addictive gameplay and excellent music, which sounds as if it was played by a full-sized orchestra, or at least a very good keyboard. The Kirbies are ULTRA CUTE. There is no way you can hate them. There are three modes: Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial. Air Ride is a simple race. Top Ride is a mini race that you view from the top. City Trial(my favorite)is where you power up in a city by getting new air ride machines, power-ups for the machine and getting advatage of all the events that happen in the city(falling meteors, Dyna Blade the giant bird, bouncy power-ups, ect.). Then when time runs out in the city, you play a mini game(drag race, target flight, air glider, destruction derby, ect.). If you got enough of the right power ups in the city, you win! So, for example, if you get lots of the Top Speed power-ups in the city, have a fast air ride machine, and the mini game is drag race, you win! Also, Kirby is multiplayer: even more fun!!! It only takes up a few memory blocks, too. AND, you have all these records to break on all the modes. Like, "Get 10 Turn Power-Ups in the city", "Fly for 15 seconds in Target Flight" or "On Air Ride, come in 1st place without hitting the walls." There are more than 100 of them. AND...there are two Legendary Machines called Hydra and Dragoon. You have to collect their pieces in City Trial to get them. Hydra is the king at speed and strength, and Dragoon is the master at flying. So, Kirby may look boring, but it is anything but! So BUY TODAY!!!!!!!!! You won't be sorry.	1
I rented it for about 1 hour before i took it back. I really thought it was just another boring race game. There was nothing special about it. The graphics were what i expected, not bad, but not SUPERIOR. Not a must buy.	-1
This is really the best Mario Kart I've played, better then the newer Wii one even.  This game lets you play against other or with them on a team and has some of the funniest Mario Kart tracks ever.	1
This is such a fun game. I bought it for my gamecube which ended up breaking. But this game works on my first generation wii	1
this game was the first game for my Little son who is very happy, because is very funny. I am satisfied.	1
awesome game...though I wish they didn't limit the versus battle mode...maybe old SNES Mario Kart just seemed bigger? I dunno.	1
One of my kids' FAVORITES!  Forget the Wii and all the other fancy consoles (even though this DOES play on the Wii), my kids still spend hours on weekends playing this with and against each other and against dad!!!  A great classic game!	1
Frankly, there isn't much reason to go to the trouble of teaching your buddies how to play Kirby Air Ride, although that will take all of five seconds as you point to the A-button and grunt. Theres some decent stuff here, but its wasted on a game that cant decide if it wants to appeal to three-year olds or thirty-year olds. The one button gameplay is frustrating and silly, resulting is an uneven, uninspiring racer that doesnt do the gumball justice. Perhaps he should shape himself into a pink triangle and look into guest appearing on Queer Eye.	1
these games may seem a little repetitive but this is a good game. i don't even like kirby that much but it has great control and graphics. its colorful and has lots of depth and different things to do.  it doesnt really bring anything new to the talble though.  unless im mistaken to price is a big factor when it comest to games, and this one will be cheaper. buy it then, or just buy mario kart double dash. its great	1
Ride with Kirby on all sorts of great new warp stars in Kirby's new game Kirby's Air Ride. Great grafics, easy controls, super two player, the onely thing that's just fair is battleing the computer. There's three modes City Trial, Top Ride; and Air Ride. In City Trial you ride around, find warp stars, get items to beat the other player. Ten times the fun in the other modes!:)	1
Let me just say of all the Nintendo franchises, Kirby has always been my favorite. Naturally last year when Nintendo announced that they had revived this game (it was on N64 but got canceled) I was very excited. So it was with that excitement I proceded to my local Blockbuster the week of it's release to see just what the geniuses at Hal Labs had in store for me this time. Words can not express the disapointment I felt the first time I raced. I'd heard this game was simple but this is downright retarded. Memo to Hal: there are six other buttons on the controller for the reason that unless you're playing a minigame in Mario Party one button can't function as everything. In this game the A button does everything. It brakes, sucks in enemies, uses their powers, and when over a boost pad initiates it. Let me explain how this simply can not work. While attempting to catch up to the Kirby in first I sucked in an enemy. Problem is A is also the brake so I slowed down and was relegated to third place. Now when I used my bombs I was forced to brake again thus putting me in fourth! Are you seeing the picture now? But wait there's some bad icing to go on the stale cake. This game has nine tracks. Whoever let this game ship thinking nine tracks was enough needs to be fired and hit. Many people will tout this games 360 unlockables as a selling point but honestly they do a horrible job extending this games already short lifespan. This is due to the fact most are utterly pointless such as the soundcheck (which at this point shouldn't have to be unlocked anyway). Other than the initial time getting use to the controls this game is also pretty easy. Once for fun I started a race and just set the controller down watched since Kirby accelerates automatically (which by the is another horrible idea). I finished second. Finally the multiplayer in this game isn't even very good which is bad for a game in a genre where the lifespan of the game pretty much depends on multiplayer. Overall, I will buy this game but only to own Kirby's first (and hopefully not last) Gamecube outing. However this will be when I can pick it up for fifteen dollars at most. I recommend anyone wanting this game to rent it and then should you still want it, wait like I'm doing.	-1
I LOVE this game. I had a brand-new that I ordered when GameCube first came out but it messed up on me so I decided to get a used one and it did come without a case and manual but it still work perfectly fine!	1
This games are one of those games I loved when I was little, I really wanted to try playing it once more, and I don't regret buying it at all.	1
The whole family loves this game. There's a lot of characters to play as, unlockables and it's a great way to take out frustrations in a positive way. A good, clean game that all ages can play.	1
on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much	1
When I ordered this game, I didn't consider the fact that it isn't really made for 1 person. It is only fun if there are 2 people. I even only have 1 gamecube controller so this was kind of a waste of money. Make sure you have someone loyal to play with because otherwise your stuck with Grand Prixes and Time Trials. I want to do battles and VS but there is no 'computer' option :/	1
This is high speed racing game with Kirby and company.  You can choose from different types of star vehicles to ride and race through differrent tracks.  You can use Kirby different powers such as fire, ice and plasma to beat your oponents to the finish line.  This game is also online which is also great.  A must get for all Kirby fans.	1
Ok, this might be a good game for young kirby fans, but otherwise...... It's basically like any other fast paced unrealistic racing games (not that they're bad, i personally like FX) but the handling of the racing isn't smother or easy, and its almost impossible to get any of the cool weapons on the track. I still haven't mastered the controls completly. But multyplayer's pretty fun, so this is actually a good buy if you don't have any other 2+ games, or for first timers with the gamecube. Especially for the younger kids, IF they have the intelligence to master the controls. Overall, it's a good game, for the younger kids (10 or under) but with anyone else older might be pushing it.	-1
It is a great game and loads of fun. The disk is perfectly clean and it works just fine. Awsome	1
Ok, so if you like any of the other Mario games such as Mario superstar baseball or Mario power tennis then you will love this game. Also if you like fun kind of goofy games and games that will be fun for everyone this is definitely for you. Also has a great multiplayer and the more people you have the more fun it is! I highly a recommend this to anyone interested in buying. However if you prefer serious racing games such as GT or Forza then I do not recommend this game, this game is not super serious racing, it's mainly just a lot of fun.	1
well these games are my sons favorite and he loves everything mario bros. hen was so happy to see these in the mail.	1
This game is incredibly fun! I'm not a golfer.  I also don't play golf games on the PC, on a console, in a house, with a mouse... you get the idea.  I saw all the great reviews of this on different game sites and thought I'd give it a try.  After all, it was made by Camelot, the same designers who did the outstanding Golden Sun games for the GBA. Rather than just being about playing golf, you get to spend time talking to other golfers, finding secrets, playing minigames, getting custom tickets so you can pick up special clubs, and gaining experience to improve your abilities.  You have a partner in the game too and have to balance out spending experience points on your own character and on your partner.  Get too good yourself and you'll be slammed on doubles play. This game is simple to play and hard to master.  You can perform the basic commands easily, but can really customize how you hit the ball, the spin you give it and more.  You can make each shot as complex as you want to. Mario Golf is a really really fun game.  I thought I'd just play a few holes and haven't put it down for three days.  This is a must have, up there with my top 5 games for GBA - Advance Wars 2, Golden Sun 2, WarioWare, Final Fantasy Tactics and now Mario Golf.	1
This is one of the best games I've ever bought, and that's no exaggeration.  I've never really been into golf games, like those Tiger Woods ones, but when I bought Mario Golf (MGGB) on the Game Boy Color, I was hooked.  It's the only game that I actually still play from my GBC.  And then this game came out.  I never thought that they could outdo MGGB, but they did.  Advance Tour, like MGGB, is actually a role-playing game disguised as a golf game!  Ingenius!  Instead of fighting enemies to increase your HP or MP, you play tournaments or complete tasks that increase your control, the height of your shot, drive distance and more.  And the goal?  Why, it's simple--to the best golfer and someday play Mario! Graphics:  (5/5)  The Game Boy Advance's screen has never looked better.  Bright colors and fabulous simulated 3D images.  It's from the makers of "Golden Sun" (Camelot), so if you thought those graphics were awesome (I did), they're all here!  Cool! Sound:  (5/5)  The music is catchy and there's actual digitized voices!  You can hear "Nice Shot" whenever you hit the ball perfectly or your character whine when he/she fails at a task.  I don't know how they packed all this into one game! Gameplay:  (5/5)  Okay, I'm not the most coordinated gamer out there, so for me to say that this game is easy to learn, it says a lot.  But, like the real game of golf, it's easy to learn, but darned near impossible to master.  Plus, the game is limited to the few buttons the GBA has to offer, so expect those buttons to be well used.  The game itself is not merely a golf game, as I mentioned.  Like the box states, "It's Role-Playing Golf" and that makes it much more interesting than a plain old golf game.  But if you only want golf, you can have that, too, as well as a bunch of other mini golf-centered games.  However, with all the features locked away in the "Story Mode," I'm not sure why anyone would buy the game and NOT play it like a regular RPG.  Also, you can link to other GBAs for muli-player cooperative or head-to-head action.  Camelot sure stuffed a lot of different features into this one tiny cartridge, let me say. Replay Value:  (5/5)  You won't be able to put this game down.  Ever.  You will lose friends, pets and the ability to see without glasses.  That's how much you'll be glued to your tiny front-lit screen.  Like I said, the game is easy to learn, but near impossible to master and that's what will keep bringing you back for more.  And then there's the ability to play with your friends in doubles play or against one another.  There's just so much to do! Let me start off by saying that this game is NOT just for people who love golf.  I'm not terribly fond of the sport, although I used to go every once in a while.  But Mario Golf, in the two incarnations I've played, are the BEST games out there.  They combine the challenge of golf and RPG into one slick game that the whole family can enjoy.  As far as I know, there's no violence in this game, so I can recommend this game to gamers of all ages, but because of the RPG-nature of this game, I think kids age 10 and up will appreciate the game much more.  Oh, and adults won't be able to put it down, either.	1
10.0  Presentation Absolutely brilliant and thorough golfing experience that goes well beyond the console experience. The RPG element adds depth to an already great golfing design.    9.0  Graphics If you liked the Golden Sun style, you'll love the look of Mario Golf. The 3D view's a little awkward, but after a few minutes you won't even notice the strange Mode 7 skewing.    9.0  Sound Fantastic audio and soundtrack throughout the experience, though some tune selections don't exactly fit the golf action.    10.0  Gameplay Camelot really knows its golf. GameCube Mario Golf was great, but the GBA version blows it away in features and depth.    10.0  Lasting Appeal Single player, multiplayer, tournaments, RPG level-up, GameCube connectivity, Wireless network support. Did I miss anything?	1
Kirby's air ride is one of those games that many will only buy because it has the name "kirby" in it, a household name part of one of nintendos premiere franchise. While nintendo is not one of those develpers who make racing games, 3 will be coming out this year. F-Zero GX (great game), mario kart double dash (which is getting alot of hype) and kirby's air ride, a game that just doesn't seem like it actually came out of the nintendo camp. Like nintendo couldn't have possibly ok'd a game that uses one button. But they did and to tell you the truth this game has little going for it. The game boasts of being a "one button game" which is basically saying we want to appeal to the younger crowd and get them involved in some of the older nintendo franchises. But after 2 days of renting the game my little brother was found playing the game, hands on the controller sleeping in front of the television set. And the 3rd day he was saying how he didn't like the game (and this is funny cause he's at that age where anything he watches that appeals to young audiances he will like no matter what - if its bad he'll like it, if its good he'll like it). This got me into playing the game. The game has terrible gameplay. Like I said before it's a one button game meaning it takes absolutley no skill to win, just knowing when to press the A button. If you know when to press A you can win. This means that I can play the game for years and years and my little brother can come up (after not playing the game in years) and whoop me cause he knew when to press A. And this doesn't just go for racing in multiplayer. In city mode you can pick up items and while picking up things (like the rocket launcher) if you pick up something it will begin a rapid fire of rockets giving you no control over where the rockets go. Why not use the Y button or the B button. This is just plain old silly, why cant you use the other 5 buttons on the GC controller to shoot a rocket, why? why? why? Kirby's Air Ride does have a few things going for it. The graphics and the colors are nice and bright and the music is good but can get a little repetettive. Plus there are plenty of cool feaures ot unlock in one of the modes giving the game a decent amount of replay value. Something many kirby fans aren't used to (remember how quick it took to beat the last kirby game.) Unfortunatley kirby air ride is the first GC game to support the LAN support for a GC game. This means that if you have 4 tvs, 4 gamegubes and 4 copies of the game plus an Local area network (LAN) you can play the game with 4 of your friends. This is nice but I did say unfortunatley. Unforunatley this game is so unworthy of this feature that you'd wish tht this feature came out on F-Zero GX or some other mutliplayer game on the GC. Kirby air ride is not one of those games you would want to buy or rent. I reccomend that no matter how old you are to not think about getting this game and staying away from it	-1
To be honest, when I bought this game, I was a bit doubtful. One-button controls didn't seem like all that great an idea, and I was considering buying F-zero instead. Nevertheless, I am a big fan of Kirby, having played most of his games, even weird spinoffs like Kirby's Dream Course,  (basically Kirby Golf), so I decided on the less traditional game. I was glad I did. Lacking a storyline but not much else, this game leaves F-zero far behind in sheer variety of gameplay. If you get tired of the Normal Race and Time Attack modes, which each feature plenty of unlockables, you can compete in entirely separate top-view racing (I got used to the controls for this pretty quickly, considering). Also available is the vast City Trial, almost a game on its own, in which you race to boost your vehicle's attributes, such as speed, steering, etc., then battle in a random multiplayer contest. It will take any player a long time to complete every objective of this game, so even without other players it is extremely fun. One thing is for sure: If this is meant for kids, they must be kids who have really good reflexes.	1
Best mario kart game ever! and my personal favorite mario kart game. I also love the N64 cart game, but I think this was a major improvement and also had a lot of new concepts that increase the fun of playing the game.	1
i love the game and the Mario people and the karts the cores and the items and the best love it	1
Gotta' say, this is one of the best games on GameCube. Bottom line: it's fun, it's family friendly, it's got tons of replay value, its' truly multi-player (up to 4), with many different multi-player scenarios (races, battle arenas). In some multi-player modes you can choose whether players go it alone or team up together.  It's an iterative improvement over MK64. The graphics are far better (much less 'polygonal,' much more polished), the gameplay is somewhat improved.  The basic premise is that rather than having a single character on a go-kart, you get to select two characters and switch back and forth between them. Each character can have its own "box" for getting items. Why might you want to team up different characters? Well, because it would seem that each character gets a slightly higher probability of getting different items. Some are more likely to get mushrooms (toad, toadette), some are more likely to get chain chomps (baby Mario / baby Luigi), giant shells (Bowser / Bowser Jr.), etc. By teaming up different characters, you can suit your own play style.  You start with a standard assortment of characters / karts (plenty of variety) and through completing different races / grand prix / challenges, you can unlock additional characters / karts.  Basically, this game is 5 kind of fun and is pretty much infinitely replayable. It's a great party game, since up to 4 players at a time can play and it's not too hard to pick up. Though mastering it can be an occasionally challenging pursuit.  These days it's harder to come by, since it's not manufactured anymore but it's still popular for all the aforementioned reasons and it'll still play on the Wii (no idea if it'll play on the WiiU tho'; I don't think it supports GC controllers like the regular Wii did, so maybe not?).  ----------  On another note.  If you like this game, I'd also VERY HIGHLY recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Crash-Tag-Team-Racing/dp/B0007KTBAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Crash Tag Team Racing</a>. So much fun! Very similar concept. Also includes a free-roaming amusement part "land" where you can explore, find power crystals & coins, engage in various quirky "mini-games," etc. It also has a "clashing" feature (really should have been called "merging") that brings it into direct competition with double dash (you can "merge" with the player or AI kart next to you, and access "secret weapons" for devastating the other karts; also the computer drives, so you don't have to fiddle with driving while trying to aim). It's way more fun than I thought it had any right to be. It gives Double Dash a run for its money. A pretty perfect complement to MK: DD.	1
I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +	1
Hello and good day, i am daniel and this particular game was Okay the animation wasn't as good as the sonic adventure battle 2 i also bought but Mario Kart was always my favorite game.  i picked this game in particular because my friends recommended it to me so i thought i would buy it on amazon for myself. i only liked this mario kart game because it was "double dash" But i rated this 4 because it wasn't as good as the other mario kart games but it was still a good game and it was worth the money i paid for the amazon card. i would recommend this to all my friends...just to see what they would say to me. Bye and have a god day	1
On GBA I have "Golden Sun", "Tetris", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Racing Gears" and this golfing game.  I should also add that I regularly play "Tiger Woods" on the PC.  This game is so fun that I play it twice as much as all my other Game Boy Advance games put together.  The characters are kind of dorky looking in an anime meets precious moments kind of way, but how much can you expect in a hand-held golfing game?  The ability to work your way through both the role-playing aspects and the golfing aspects really break up the game.  The quick games are great when you're just got ten minutes to kill at the dentist's waiting room.  The 3-click works as well as my old Jack Nicklaus' Golden Bear game, and the ability to earn points which you add to your character's attributes gives you a real feeling of progressive accomplishment.  Fun for the short and long haul.  Ten bucks well spent.	1
Not the best game in the world but its a great golf game all together.  I like this much more than any Tiger Woods style golf game b/c it poses a little more than a challege.  Worth a try.	1
I don't even want to begin to speculate on how much time I spent playing Tiger Woods 2003.  Suffice it to say that I played the game to death, and was eagerly awaiting this newest installment.  Fortunately for me and thousands of other fans of the series, TW2004 is a great improvement over its predecessors, and promises to provide even more enjoyment than the original. One of the best new aspects of this game is the career mode, allowing you to play a series of seasons and participate in countless tournaments.  The new World Tour mode is also new, providing a chance to unlock a number of new courses and players.  The real-time events were a nice touch as well, allowing you to play over a period of time and participate in events exactly as they happen.  In addition, you can now earn sponsorships if you play well, and you even get one of these if you have the 2003 version on your memory card. As far as the added playability is concerned, there are two major things which, for me, will make this a game which I will not quickly become bored of.  First of these is the new pro shop.  On TW2003 I finally got to the point where my character's attributes were maxed out, and I had a bunch of money I couldn't use.  With hundreds of items at the pro shop, this isn't likely to happen.  The other great feature is the new series of trophy balls, the chasing Tiger balls.  Over the course of your career, if you can rack up stats more impressive than Tiger's (not an easy task), you can earn a bunch of new trophy balls, thus giving long-term players something to aim at. My one complaint with this game is a major one.  You can no longer play tournaments with more than one player.  That, for me, kills a lot of entertainment value, since my friend and I played lots of tournaments together.  This setback is unfortunate, and is a large blotch on what would otherwise be a perfect game. Despite this setback (a large one for me, but an insignificant one for someone who generally plays by himself), this is a great game.  The series just keeps getting better.	1
Electronic Arts has earned a reputation as being a premier company of video game sports titles and rightly so.  Each successive year of expanding and modifying their games, they continually break new barriers and push the limit of entertainment even higher. Following the highly successful release of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003, EA continues on with its 2004 version and its new features are setting it up to be the one and only golf game you'll want to own and play.  Utilizing the power of the Playstation 2 hardware, the following new features should make for a dynamic and exciting golf experience that will leave a lasting impression. 19 courses (all courses from Tiger Woods 2003, 5 new PGA courses, 2 new fantasy courses) Career mode offers an actual 52 week PGA tour schedule and the ability to earn sponsorships along the way Tiger Challenge is now replaced with World Tour Mode that allows for greater variation in game play The Create-a-golfer mode let's you morph a very realistic golfer into what suits your tastes to include clothes, facial features, skin tone, tattoos, headgear, and more A huge pro shop to buy hundreds (yes, hundreds) of sponsor related apparel, equipment, and even character animation sequences 15 PGA pro-tour characters along with 12 original characters to play as Online play modes for the Playstation 2 Improved graphics above and beyond Tiger Woods 2003 With this much to offer and riding on its already excellent reputation and past track record, Electronic Arts has given golf fans a sure-fire winner in Tiger Woods 2004.  It's going to be gorgeous and a whole lot of fun.	1
love mario kart then buy this love mario kart then buy this love mario kart then buy this love mario kart then buy this.	1
Double dash is the epitome of Mario Kart racing. This opened up a flood gate of awesome that Nintendo has been trying to match, but in my opinion has been unable to do so. DD let's you race two people per kart, one driving and one firing off items. This creates a great sense of team work and coordination that I don't even see in shooter games. I highly recommend Mario Kart Double Dash, it plays on the Wii as well as the Gamecube, so don't let that stop you. You will have to buy some GC controllers, which puts this one game at a higher price probably, but it is so worth it in the end. I'd say don't even buy the Wii Mario Kart and just buy Double Dash with a crew of game cube controllers.  Did I mention that Double Dash is awesome?	1
While this is probably your best bet for a worthwhile golf game on GBA, it isn't exactly a Mario game either. You only start with four playable Mario characters at the beginning of the game (Mario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong and Princess Toadstool) and your primary character in storymode is Some Anime-looking Dude you get to name, similar to Mario Tennis (except you get 8 characters right off the bat in Mario Tennis). You have to spend quite a bit of time unlocking things before you really come close to anything remotely Mario-ish. And there's a lot to unlock. The storymode in the game is very SNES-esque in its RPG presentation, and there's a lot of different mini-games that play by some unique rules (slot clubs, for instance, randomly selects clubs for you for one hole, so in essence you could be left with trying to par a 495 yard par 5 with a 4-wood and a pitching wedge) and some that are just conventional "closest to the pin" contests. Completing these mini-games, as well as tournaments (both singles and doubles) gives you experience points, which you can utilize to build up specific parts of your game, such as driving distance or spin control. And like I mentioned earlier, in the early going while unlocking things and building experience (which may take a while), there isn't a whole lot of Mario going on, and that may turn some players away.  But if you're strictly looking for a good golf game for GBA, this is as good as it's going to get. Considering both the graphical and physics-engine limitations that are present (remember how awful some SNES golf games were?), this game really does a great job presenting a solid golf experience in terms of gameplay and control. It's your traditional three-click swing system, and you can control the spin and select the impact on the ball itself, letting the player manipulate his/her shot in a lot of different ways. Putting is pretty easy; if you putt with some mustard behind your shots, almost any putt will go in from within about 25 feet. The courses are all very different, providing tropical, desert and um... Scotish atmospheres. The last course that is unlocked after winning each tournament and sufficiently building up experience is the Mushroom Course, the only all-out crazy Mario course in the game, and it's a doozy.  The thing to remember is this: if you're looking for a Mario themed game, you may want to look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a good golf game for GBA, this is the best you'll find.	1
Well I'm one of those people who doesn't like sports games (except racing). When my fiancee first told me about this game, I was very skepticle. I thought that this game would be really boring and not fun, well boy was I wrong. This game is very fun and also very addicting. One of the great thigns about this game is that there is a RPG element to it, which makes it that much better. There are also many different modes and a lot of things to do. You can play a story mode which has a lot of diffrent types of golf and mini games or you can play the quick mode which is some different twists on the old game of golf. Regardless if you like golf or not this game is a must have for anyone who wants to play a fun game with lots to unlock and discover.	1
Anyone who's played Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour for the Gamecube will notice some major differences when they pick up its handheld version, Advance Tour.  While also created by Camelot, the developers of Golden Sun went back to what they do best this time around, offering gamers the same great golfing experience, now blended with the company's talents in RPG programming.  The end result is a game that's not only unique, but also extremely fun.  The influence of Camelot's previous RPG efforts is on full display with Mario Golf Advance Tour.  The game's story mode is traditional...your goal is to work your way up through the golfing ranks, developing your skills in practice, matches and tournaments until you reach the ultimate contest...a match with the golfing great himself, Mario!  This mode is well executed, giving you countless options in developing your skills, whether it be choosing which elements of your characters' abilities to boost (both you and your computer-controlled partner), which of the characters needs the most focus, or choosing the right strategy to minimize the effect of your weaknesses (especially if your computer partner is still shaky).  There are so many variable in Advance Tour, it's hard to make yourself a master of the game...and the challenge of doing so makes the game that much more fun.  Of course, no amount of effort with the aforesaid would matter without solid gameplay, and rest assured, they compliment each other beautifully.  The controls are taught as you go and are easy to learn, and the graphics and animation flow smoothly, making it easy to keep track of what's going on.  The game is also very deep and complex, making it a pleasant challenge no matter how much you've played.  It's the kind of game you can play forever, and there's still feels like there's something new to try or overcome.  This, coupled with a wide array of unlockable challenges, allows for an endless replay value, meaning the game still goes on, even after the story's been completed.  The sound department is typical for Camelot.  There are a few voice clips, while most of the dialogue is accompanied by a somewhat-irritating squaking/screeching/squeaking (take your pick).  The rest of the sound is efficient, getting the job done where it has to.  As for music, Advance Tour has a few tracks that feel at home with the Mario Golf franchise, but the influence of Camelot's past efforts (specifically Golden Sun) is quite apparent in other tracks.  This isn't bad, though...Camelot is often solid with its music, Advance Tour's score has a good feel to it, blending in well with the gameplay.  The only real issue with this game is that Mario and company seem to take a backseat to a collection of Camelot originals, making it seem like Mario was thrown into the game as an effort to add familiarity...kind of like when Star Fox was added to Dinosaur Planet (see Star Fox Adventures for Gamecube).  Still, the transition into Mario's world is cleverly done, and players can still use Mario and his closest pals whenever the desire comes to just go out and play a round (provided they're unlocked).  It may not feel like a genuine Mario game, but the game's too much fun to get worked up over it.  Overall, Mario Golf Advance Tour is hands down the best portable golf game you can buy.  Innovative, slick and fun, Camelot has ushered in a whole new level of sports games with their RPG Golf effort.  It's definately an experience like no other.	1
I love this game, just like Mario Kart 64 for Nintendo 64 of course there's various different challenges and the course and karts are different but the gameplay is much of the same. But theres lots of added twists for example you switch drivers with the Z button, when you get hit by an item the person in back of the vehicle can fall off and be dragged for a few seconds and eventually get back up onto the vehicle, its fun to play solo but its more fun to play with another person or more people up to four players which is pretty sweet. The only negative I would give is that if you fall on a banana peel you can't hit the B and Z button and then get a quick note bubble so thats the only down fall of this game where as in the Nintendo 64 that was not the case. It's a game for the whole family to play especially kids and parents its very awesome to play on the 2006 model Wii (that model Wii is backwards compatible and will play Gamecube games. The 2011 model can only play Wii games and DVD's.) However I recommend that this game be played on the original system which is Nintendo Gamecube, for which it is originally intended. I highly recommend this game!	1
Mickeys Speedway USA on N64 was 10x better than Mario Kart 64 and I miss that game; however Nintendo took levels from that game and sort of created a sequel with just as awsome tracks, music and even added a character to the back which makes it more fun. This is a buy for the system.	1
I order this game 'cause I saw a couples videos about the gameplay.. But it's so much better than the videos. This product was used but in perfect shape. Also it came involved in a plastic bag. The mini cd just have the normal scratch for the use.. But nothing really important. Really work perfectly. Totally recommended.	1
We all love a good Mario Kart game every now and then right? Super Mario Kart was great, Mario Kart 64 was even better, Super Circuit brought back all the elements of SMK, and now, we approach Mario Kart: Double Dash. Does this game stack up to all the other games in the series? Well, OF COURSE!  Mario Kart: Double Dash features a huge variety in courses and characters, like the other games in the series, but unlike them, Double Dash's main highlight, where you use 2 characters at once, takes the series to brand new heights! Not only was it fun to select which 2 characters race together (Baby Mario and Wario? Heh.), and to hold more than one item, but you can also play with a friend together in Co-op mode! And to top it all off, the racing is MUCH, MUCH FASTER than in all of the other games!  As for the items, they were just as insane as the 2-driver concept. Sure, you still have the average Koopa shells, Banana Peels, etc, but you also get a flying Spiny shell that creates a quick explosion in the 1st Place player's spot (Previous games had it wingless), and Special Items exclusive to each character (Mario: Fireball - Toad: Golden Mushroom)!!  The courses were more creative than ever. Here, we drive on a freaking cruiser ship, through prehistoric times, a couple stadiums, and even highways with multiple paths! And let's not forget the new feature in which we play through all 4 cups in one sitting!  Lastly, it's hardly ever known, but with some hard work, you can actually connect with 16 other people and play online! With some effort, it can be done....and you'll have an extreme experience unlike any other.  So overall, it's one of craziest, most fast-paced kart racers I've ever played! In fact, I think I may as well prefer this game over Mario Kart Wii! Sure, MKWii has easily accessible online play, but Double Dash nails everything else!	1
i have 3 mario golf games and i like this one the most.  it is a fun game that puts all your favorite mario characters in an uncommon sport. to me its uncommon anyway.  if you have the gamecube one i highly suggest you give this one a try too.	1
I waited a long time for this game. I was very excited, having played mario golf on the N64, to have a similiar game in a handheld format. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. Pros: great graphics, cool side games that help improve your skills, being able to build your skills through winning tournaments and the sound is decent. There's a storyline to follow: if you care about that sort of thing. Cons: The AI cheats fairly early on. I'll give you an example: The third tourney is played on a desert course. The first hole is a 470+ par four. I get a birdie on the hole and when they go to the leader board I'm in 4th place! Two people are tied for first with -3! THREE UNDER??? AFTER ONE???? That means they both got a hole in one on a 470 yard hole. Now THAT'S cheap. Another problem is dicey physics. Sometimes you'll get a ball to roll up on the green or stop one with backspin, but most of time the green appears to be made of concrete with balls bouncing yards into the air and shooting off the green at high speeds. The flight path of your ball shown by a glowing line that sometimes looks as though it's clear of obstacles but really isn't. You end up putting balls into trees, cacti etc. that look as if you should be clearing them. If a ball is close to the edge of a fairway or fringe you invariably are put in the rough. And the rough appears to be made of some hybrid of grass and superglue, a cheap way to make holes tougher. Then we'll move on to the course designs. Now I'm all for making golf games challenging but this is where the game really falls apart. Trees and cacti are simply put randomly in the middle of fairways with no thought towards realistic or asthetic course design, again, a cheap way to make holes tough. Then there are the "hills". What they actually are, are shelves or steppes that eat up ball momentum and fail to represent real world physics or course design. Not too mention they make the course look silly. Putting is random at best, you can't rotate the green to read it, the game doesn't give you any info other than distance to hole and those stupid arrows that affect the balls motion at seemingly random intervals. A big hill will certainly slow you down if you're putting up it, but won't neccesarily help with a downhill putt. You always need to putt farther than the distance the computer gives you. All in all I was really disappointed. Maybe I'm expecting too much out of this game. I know it's not supposed to be a golf sim, it's an RPG. That's fine, I'm not opposed to adding a dimension to a game. However, if the basis of a game is golf, then it should play like a golf game, moreover, it should be a GOOD golf game. I'm not saying it should be Tiger Woods 2005, but games like Hot Shots and Swing Away do a fine job of incorporating stat building with a good arcade style of golf play. My copy of this game will be available at a used game store soon.	-1
I wanted it I bought it I played it till I didn't want to play it anymore and I bought another one loved it that's why I bought it I am not a loser	1
Great game.  I was awesome at it.  I've bought several since then, so its a really great series.  Buy it.	1
This was purchased as a gift.  I do not own or use a gaming console.  The item was received in a timely manner and the recipient was pleased with the gift- about all I can tell you about the item.	1
So Nintendo follows suit again and releases a new Mario Kart game for every system. I have played every Mario Kart on all the consoles, including the Wii Mario Kart.  Gameplay: Racing. While some things are different from the N64 version such as power-sliding, this game adds new features, new tracks, new battle levels, new characters, new weapons, and the ability for 2 riders per cart. Let's start with the characters. There are now 20 playable characters including 11 new ones and each player chooses 2 characters. New weapons are included for some characters such as the fireball for Mario and Luigi, the giant banana for the Kongs, and Bob-ombs for Waluigi and Wario. There are 3 difficulty classes again; 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. After completing the available three cup tours with Golden trophies, you get a 4th cup tour called the all-cup tour. This has every race track in the game. If you complete the cup with a Golden Trophy, you open up the final option in the game; mirror mode. Mirror mode is only on 150cc but each track is played in mirror mode (everything is mirrored so turns that were right are now left and vice-versa). Battle mode has the traditional balloon battles and includes two new modes. One is capturing and maintaining a Shine Sprite for as long as possible. The other is Bob-omb battle which players throw Bob-ombs at each other.  Multiplayer: Mario Kart-Double Dash can have up to four players. You have the option as riding with two players per cart, or each having their own cart. With two players in one cart, new abilities are added such as the double-dash quick start acceleration and stronger power slides. One player drives while the other player handles the weapons and helps with steering. You can play versus mode and battle mode with up to four players, while only two players can compete in Grand Prix.  Conclusion: Graphics are good but not a huge improvement from the N64. Controls are easy. A lot of the new tracks are great and multiplayer is still as fun as ever. Worth getting even years after the GameCube era has ended. Will play on the Wii using the GameCube controllers.	1
I really enjoy coop games so this mario kart is pretty awesome in that aspect.  I just wish it had more too it but nothing seems to compare to Mario Kart 64 or Super Mario Kart anyways.  The graphics and animations are cool.	1
I've Had This Game A Long Time And I Still Play It At Least Once A Week. It Never Gets Old. If You Like Racing Games, Mario Kart Will Top Any You've Ever Played. Its Hard To Control At First But Before Long You Get Good At It, But Its Still Not Easy To Win! There Is Extra Levels (Mini Games) That Are Really Fun Too. And The Best Part About It Is That There Is TONS Of Stuff To Unlock. It Seems Endless. As Soon As You Think You've Got Everything You Unlock Something Else! So Please Get This Game, You Will Love It. :)	1
I loved the previous Mario Kart despite the fact that it cheated. This one isn't quite as bad in the cheating department. In this incarnation you take two characters per kart. Each one with their own skills and items. The courses are naturally a blast. The game is challenging but not "tear your hair out" difficult. The music is perfect for the game and the graphics of course are top notch. Every cart controls differently so you'll have to experiment with each cart and a variety of racers to see what combo works best for you. I give this game my highest recommendations. Sure there are a ton of racers out there but not many of them are as fun as this one.	1
I've attempted on so many occasions to play this game and to force myself to like it.  I CANNOT.  The fun factor just isn't there for me.  I sit there driving around bored the whole time.  And then there's the music...WTF is with the "music" in this game!?  Not only is it not good, it's actually BAD.  It's downright annoying and painful like someone just randomly strung a bunch of notes together and called it a day.  I honestly can't get over how terrible it is.  There's also so much crap in the peripherals of the screen that you can barely see half the course!  I wish they'd give you the option to turn that stuff OFF.  The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because some of the levels have nice graphics.  But who cares!  Anyone want to buy a used Double Dash game?	-1
Being a huge fan of XSN Golf for Xbox, I decided to try Tiger Woods' game because of all the rave reviews I've heard.  I was so disappointed.  The controls are rather difficult and hard to master.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is not that much different from last year's Tiger. The analog swing is unchanged, letting you control the power and direction of your shot with a back-and-forward motion on the analog stick. One of the big new additions to Tiger Woods 2004 is the "game face" feature that allows you to create your own pro golfer with a rather painstaking level of detail. This player creation mode lets you define virtually every aspect of your player's appearance. For some idea as to how extensive it is, there are 18 different attributes that can be modified in terms of facial structure alone, not including facial hair, eye color, skin tone, and what your golfer's teeth might look like. Truly, the level of character customization offered by the game face feature is unparalleled. The only nagging issue with the Tiger Woods games that EA has yet to address seriously is the game's soundtrack. For the past two years, EA has been assembling seemingly random collections of contemporary licensed songs and calling them soundtracks.	-1
Players are not different enough cause you only get Tiger. I dislike how putting is done. Too many arcade elements for a "sim" game. CPU AI is not worth playing against.	-1
I still play this game (Double Dash) even though there's a new Mario Kart for the Wii. I like this game better than Mario Kart Wii (just by a little), but the courses can get a bit repetitive though.	1
This game is an excellent idea, and the two different roles are also creative. It's fun playing a Mario Kart title in which you're not always versing Player 2. You actually get to team up and choose a kart based on your size. You're even able to switch roles with your partner during the race, just plan before you do it, or else you'll lose your place. This game can get VERY challenging at times, but that's only when you change the engine size to the max. This Mario Kart can show two people a very fun time.	1
This game rocks!  It is a little different from Super Mario Kart for SNES and Mario Kart 64 in that there are two characters per kart, but there inlies the fun!  Twice the question blocks, more strategy (as far as when to release your items vs when to hold on to them) and added features like having a second player controll one of the characters (allowing your back character to punch other karts).  New courses are a lot of fun and CGI charactes are an exciting challenge in the 150cc races.  Update, Sep 2012: This game rocks!  My wife and I still are not tired of playing it!  We even wiped the memory so we could play through it again :)  We love Mario Kart racing and always can't wait for the next game to be released :)	1
A fun sequel to Mario Kart 64. It's a bit different, but after getting used to it, it is great fun.	1
I GOT THIS GAME 3 YEARS AGO AND IT IS FUN. THIS GAME LETS YOU HAVE TWO CHARECTERS IN A KART AT ONCE. THE GAME HAS ABOUT 21 PEOPLE TO CHOSE FROM. I LIKE TO PICK FROM BABY MARIO AND BABY LUIGI.IT IS REALLY FUN	1
the career mode is enough in itself to purchase this rather than continue playing the '03 version. you can still challenge the best fictional players and some of the best players on the tour (unfortuanately els, mickelson and weir are nowhere to be found).  again the courses are replicated down to a tee, with new entries such as sahalee cc and the emerald dragon.  it allows you to choose your player's appearance (even right or left handed), sex and skills (i recommend moderating your attributes).  new players include justin rose and the talented, young aussie adam scott.  again, the most glaring problem is difficulty.  i have posted myriad scores in the 50's in inclement weather, and i still get defeated by my friends on most occasions.	1
there is so much more u can do in 2004 than 2003! u can buy clothes, jewelry, gloves, hats, shoes, etc. u can also play online! this is one of the biggest improvements in the game from last year. the online play is just simply amazing. i live in wisconsin and i played against someone all the way down in texas with clear reception! i was just blown away right there!	1
EA has outdone themselves with this game.  Tiger Woods 04 is far and away better than earlier versions.  This game rates a A.  Career Mode is good, building up attributes over time.  Very realistic -  Tiger is almost unbeatable in any mode, but shouldn't he be?  There are many courses to play, many modes, many tournaments and endless addictive fun.  I live in Minnesota and sometimes the only golf we have, well six months at a time, is on the computer.  This game is a good bandaid for those of us stuck in the hinterland, Minnesota.  A Joseph Dworak	1
Slices... yep.. in the game.. Shanked it? Yep - in the game... Punched it right into a tree... yep... it's in the game. This game is AS HARD AS REAL GOLF! I love it. The left thumb-pad is the way you "swing" the club - go from left to right and you slice it with a wicked spin, go from right to left and you pull it... just like in real golf. Timing is off? No worry - sucker is going to go flying just like in real golf... All of that said - once you get the hang of how to actually stop shanking and slicing the ball off the course, this becomes a VERY addictive game. I highly recommend the ONLINE portion - you wouldn't think GOLF on-line is a very good idea... but this is QUITE fun! You buy this game - you're going to be addicted... it's that simple. PLUS - I love being able to configure my own guy and then play against Vijay Sign, Tiger, Appleby, Daly, etc. I'm just happy when I PAR... let alone those monster players whippin me by hitting eagles and double eagles! Wow! This is a fun game if you like golf... no doubt. See you on the links.	1
My son played this game at a friends house - and loved it. I waited a couple of months to make sure he really wanted it, and sure enough, he plays this game at least a couple times a week! Am VERY glad for this purchase! I HATE to buy games only to have them sit and collect dust!	1
mario kart racing is a lot of fun. our children's dentist has this in his office waiting room and we just had to buy it for ourselves at home. Both of my boys, 12 and 5, like to race each other. My husband even gets in on the game. I haven't been able to squeeze in a session between the three of them.	1
It doesn't have that good ol' Mario Kart feel. It's very competitive, and fast paced. I'd say it's much harder than the two before it. But you feel like you're trying too hard to win a race (which is actually a challenge here), than just having fun. I feel as though they've modified the controls a bit, the carts tend to drift around more than before, and the subtraction of the jump ability, along with modifying the power turn (to make it harder), along with Ai improvements and the good old fashioned "cheating" AI characters , this game can be very frustrating at times. However, for you Mario Kart fans looking for a new game, look no further. I wish it had not been quite so frustrating, but I definitely recommend it.	1
This is so much better than mario golf and other cheesy golf games because it uses the analog sticks to swing. Character customozation is very good and has a lot of new things. Many courses and scenarios. The graphics aren't much better than the 2003 version and the whole game isn't much different than the last game that you could get for $20 instead of $50.	1
Ive been a fan of the Tiger Woods franchise for a while, and this game is definetly the best of the bunch.  The game engine is basically the same, but this version sports an incredible amount of extras. Some of what I mean:  New courses, new golfers, new scenarios and ways to play.  The gamefaces system which allows you to customize your player to look like you or anyone you want.  The ability to modify and accesorize your character to an incredible degree.  The real-time events.  The new tournament system.  The chasing Tiger challenge.  All great additions. One entirely new feature is the online play.  A much needed addition and priceless feature.  You can play in online tournaments or match up against other online players in skins or stroke play. All in all, a great game which takes the established strong tiger woods elements and adds incredible new features.	1
I bought this for my daughter, who is in college...  this game is a crackup, lots of fun, and a great way to get the family together for some laughs.  A great game for all ages.  I highly recommend it.	1
I love Mario Kart double dash a lot, even though it is now considered an "old" (3 years) game. Great for parties, as are all Mario Games, and very competitive.	1
I bought this to play on my new Wii because I never did buy a gamecube, and man was I ever let down.  I have a SNES system pretty much just for the original mariokart.  It's great, it's something that challenges everyone and can be enjoyed by kids and adults.  Double dash is so infantile it sickens me!  The battlemode options are terrible!  Who wants to play on top of a gamecube?  That's the most uninspired thing I've ever seen!  And other venues such as cookie land?  I wanted to see sequels to the original, advances in the game but the same basic concept.  This game is for kids much like the N64 version, look toward the gameboy DS for a better mariokart. A serious let down.  If you liked the original at least rent it before you buy it just to see if I'm telling the truth here.	-1
Every version of this game is a lot of fun. Nintendo continues to produce new things for this, the two drivers, special items and picking your kart make this even better than the N64 version.	1
I don't know how to explain how amazing this game is. It is the most addictive game I have ever laid eyes on beside Grand Theft Auto Vice City, which is DEFENITELY saying something. I loved the career mode where you create your own player, then build his attributes up by playing tournaments, real PGA events, world tours, and one-on-one matchups with any type of golf, such as match play, stroke play, and skins matches. Your player can also be endorsed by major golf companies, which is a cool touch. All I can say is buy this game.	1
Every year this game hooks me and I have to force myself to stop. This game obviously simplifies golf because golf is a cruel and maddening game. They left that part for the PC users. The console versions are a lot easier... and that's just fine. Since I don't want to waste time listing all the superlatives around this game because it would take forever... I will simply mention it's one and only flaw. It becomes to easy because of the attribute system. Use your money directly on attributes, equipment and clothing by winning in the World Tour and in no time at all you hitting in the 50's on calm days and low 60's on stormy days on professional courses. This tended to make career play boring as I was finishing tournaments -60. But to be fair to this "problem", I could just have easily turned off my "caddy tip" and relied on the green grid for putting (kind of like the PC version) and that problem would virtually be solved. That's it... one problem... and it's solveable in the settings menu for those who enjoy the simulation aspects of the game. Kudos to EA for the hard work and obviously talented people that made this gem.	1
If you have ever enjoyed anything to do with golf then get this game now!  This is by far the best golf game I have ever played.  I played Tiger Woods 2002 ALOT!  About 8 hours a day for about 4 months.  I loved it but it wasn't without its issues.  I rented Tiger Woods 2003 and it was fun but it seemed like a typical update.  A couple new courses etc...  But 2004 took me by surprise.  There's just SO MUCH added to this game.  Lots of courses to play, Tons of goodies to unlock, graphics are great, gameplay is great.  Plus there's online play and it supports voice if you have a USB microphone.  There's also new tournaments daily online.  You can actually play through an entire PGA season too and earn sponserships from Nike, adidas, Taylor made, etc...  This game is great.  The customization of your characters is amazing too.  You can create your own golfer and they went overboard on this ability.  You can create a golfer that looks at least 90% like you.  Sometimes 100%.  Depending on how you look.  In addition there are all kinds of accessaries to buy.  Balls, gloves, hats, watches, glasses, lucky tees, shoes, clubs, shafts, grips, etc...  These items add modifiers to your abilities and with so many available you'll be playing for days to unlock them all.  There are also real time events to unlock special equip.  These events only occur on specific days and it works with your PS2's internal clock.  I already played the halloween event and got a shirt to wear that celebrates the season.  If you haven't stopped reading and ran out to get this game then GO NOW!!! While there are still copies left on the shelves!!!!	1
All I have to say is, how would you feel playing a course that is the longest in U.S Open history? Not to mention one of the truly greatest American classics: Pinehurst #2.	1
The game is very fun for awhile, especially if you have a friend or sibling to play with.  The disappointment is with the battle mode.  It just doesn't live up to previous Mario Kart games.  It just seems Nintendo left a lot out of this one.  However, there are unlockable characters, karts, courses, and tournaments.  The 2 character team up is very unique, and the best part of playing with friends - one of you drives while the other focuses on items until you decide to switch.  It maybe would have been better if the player in the back of the kart had a view facing backwards as to see oncoming racers, but it is fun to criticize the driving of a sibling.  I recommend the game to any Mario Kart fan, but only at a less then $40 price.	1
I love this game, it is so much fun.  Even though my wife does not like it I recommend this game for anyone who like Mario Kart games.  Enjoy the races, and don't forget to blow your friends up.	1
I would like to know when in the world are they going to release the greatest Mario Bros. game of all time on GBA?! I mean, this was the only reason that I had bought my GBA (now I have a SP as well)! I was hoping and praying that they wouldn't skip Super Mario Bros. 3, the greatest game of the series of them all, on the Super Mario Advance trilogy.  I pray that this doesn't get  left out, let alone, the original Super Mario Bros.  What were they thinking? Please game releaser gods, don't do this to me! I must own this on GBA SP.  My collection wouldn't be complete if this doesn't come out soon.  I mean, *what were you thinking* when you guys thought it would be a good idea to skip the legendary Super Mario Bros. 3! You know that this was just about everyone's favorite game of them all, so many powers and baddies, and power-ups.  I must own this, so please I beg of you, release it! Fans will be happy.	1
Mario Kart Double Dash is essentially Mario Kart 64 and then some. The game brings alot of new cards to the table, which I will review below.  Mario Kart Double Dash has improved on the last game immensely, and that is saying alot, because Mario Kart 64 was one of the most fun games available for the N64. The first way it improved on the previous game was allowing players to choose 2 characters to race with instead of 1. This makes for a bit more of a complex control scheme, but otherwise doubles the fun.  The game also features tons of available characters to play as:  Mario  Luigi  Peach  Daisy  Wario  Walluigi  Bowser  Baby Bowser  Koopa  Paratroopa  Baby Mario  Baby Luigi  Donkey Kong  Diddy Kong  Yoshi, and  Birdo  The game has the ol' Grand Prix mode and the Time Trials, but it also has some new unlockable features, such as:  New carts  New characters  A new circuit  New battle mode stages...  and more, but I don't want to spoil anything.  Mario Kart Double Dash's multiplayer modes are better than ever, too. Not only are battle and versus modes once again available, but there are new types of battles: shine theif and babomb blast.  All in all, Mario Kart Double Dash is extremely fun and replayable, and has enough features and unlockables to keep you occupied and entertained for a while. I enjoy it, and I think any Gamecube owner should pick this game up. I reccomend renting it first to see if you like it, and then making your decision.  Thanks for reading, bubba"samus"	1
Introduction-  Mario Kart started as a great little game on the Super Nintendo. Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo assumed you as one of eight mascots of the mario world, and let you race against the computer, or with a friend. The twist, setting it apart from all the other racers in the genre, was it's Item and power-up system, letting you attack your opponents with shells, and get a boost from mushrooms, plus many more. Looking back on the game now, you will see very aged graphics on a very aged system. But sit down with it for a few minutes, and you will find the addictive gameplay that made it such a classic.  Mario Kart then moved to the Nintendo 64 in 1997, and replaced the flat courses of the origional with huge, lush courses to show off the hardware of nintendo's new system. Unfortunately, this upset many people because the bigger courses made winning the race more about who could best use power ups, rather than actual racing skill. Multiplayer in this game was fantastic, letting you race with three other people rather than just one.  Mario Kart 64 also built up on the battle mode, making it much more than just a diversion from the main game. But this game was plagued with many bugs and glitches that made the game unfair, and sometimes even unenjoyable. Mario Kart 64 was fun to play with friends, but was a little unbalanced, and had too many problems for its own good.  Now comes the third outing of the Mario Kart franchise to hit nintendo consoles. Mario Kart: Double Dash!! combines the best aspects of both the games before it, but unfortunately doesn't really do much else to improve the game.  Graphics-  The graphics in MKDD are crisp, smooth, and very colorful. The style of the game is very cartoonish, so those looking for a more gritty dark game will be very dissapointed. Nothing in the graphics catagory is done wrong. It has that classic mario style, but some might be somewhat concerned about how nintendo has places eyes on many of the game's inanimate objects, making it somewhat distracting to drive without feeling that you are being watched the trees... (Graphics 4/5)  Sound-  Mario and the Gang are very chatty, commenting on most of thier actions. Voice acting isn't terrible, but it might get annoying to hear those italian plumbers shout out their nintendo nonsense over and over. Some catchy themes on some of the race tracks, but nothing to get too excited about. (Sound 4/5)  Gameplay-  The gameplay in this game remains mostly unchanged from previous editions of mario kart. Race 3 times around a track, collecting power-ups from Item boxes scattered throuout each course, and beating your opponents. Controlling your Kart in this game has been tuned to perfection. The biggest addition to this edition of mario kart is the two-player-per kart aspect of racing. There is one driver in the front of the kart, and one in the back who handles the weapons and power-ups. This means you can hold two items at a time, and you can switch your character's places whenever at the push of a button.  This adds a strategic element while chosing your character, because you can combine any two characters in one kart. There are 20 characters in total, each with their own specialized kart. Another thing to worry about is that each "team" of characters has a SPECIAL item that they get randomly from any item box on the map. Each special item is different, and adds a lot to a team. The addition of a two-player-per-kart system works well and adds a lot to the game, but Mario Kart Veterans of any kind will find that playing with as two characters at once doesn't really change the gameplay that much.  The tracks you will race on are some of the best and creative courses to date, but unfortunately there are only 16, and some of them are mediocre and dull compaired to others. (Gameplay 4/5)  Multiplayer-  Multiplayer is the main draw of this title, and should be where you spend most of your time. WARNING: If you have no friends, do not buy this game! The two-player-per-kart lets you play co-op with a friend, but honestly, controlling your own kart is way more fun. Battle mode has unfortunately taken a step down from Mario Kart 64, because the courses to play on are boring and uninspired. Two new battle modes to play with are fun and welcomed, but just not fun on such bad battle arenas.  Nintendo also offers LAN play, offering up to 16 players to race, but it looks like this was thrown in at the last second, and only recommended if you actually have the resources to do it. (Multiplayer 4/5)  Overall-  This game is a great addition to the Mario Kart franchise, and recommended to anyone who owns a gamecube, and is looking for a great multiplayer experience. It perfects the mario Kart formula, but it has too little tracks, and a bad battle mode, and in the end, doesn't really offer anything new.  Overall, it is a great game. 4 out of 5    __________	1
After running into a purchased "dud," we decided in order to avoid purchasing more duds we are going to rent video games just to make sure which games are and aren't good, and throughout the renting period, I will keep you updated.  This game was the first on our list, and now we're going to end up buying a copy because it is so much fun. In this game, Mario and his friends and foes are racing, with each team having 2 characters. You start out with Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Birdo, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Koopa, Paratroopa, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Bowser, Baby Bowser, Wario and Waluigi, and you can later unlock Toad, Toadette, King Boo and Petty Pirahna. Each character will race, but they also get to knock characters of the track with special moves. For example, Bowser and Baby Bowser get to use giant shells, while Baby Mario and Baby Luigi get to use Chain-chomps to clear the road. Try using different character combos for different moves. Some of the race tracks include Baby Park, Yoshi's Island, and our favorite, DK Mountain!  Overall, 5 stars, a fun racing game for Mario fans.  P.S. one small request: I wish our local video store would offer Nintendo DS games, that way we can know what DS are and aren't good, without the hassle of purchasing the "duds."	1
Definitely an addicting and fun game. If you're not familiar with the previous Mario Kart games, then you're completely missing out. Of course you'll need somebody to play with. Playing by yourself is only fun for the first few races.  In this game there are two people on one cart. You can switch over the people and decide which one belongs on the back or on the front of the cart. This was definitely a clever and good idea, because it makes it double the fun! Besides racing, you can also do battle mode. This is where you try to destroy your opponent with shells, bananas, etc. It's only for 2-4 players and sadly you can't play against the computer. There are also alot of characters to choose from (I think 16) and you can also choose which cart you drive. If you want power choose the huge carts or if you want speed choose the lighter carts.  As for the gameplay, it's easy to get used to. The controller is just perfect for this game. The graphics are also good and better than the previous Mario Kart games. The music fits perfectly to this game and some remind you of the previous games. The challenge of this game is nothing. It's just so easy even if it's on hard (maybe because I play more challenging games) and you could easily beat it in one day.  Overall, it's definitely worth your money and time. Even the whole family can enjoy such a wonderful and fun game. And for the price you can't complain.	1
If you're anything like me and loved the Mario Kart games on Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64, then you will absolutely love this game!  After I got rid of my 64, I missed a lot of the games and wished they would develop newer versions.  Mario Kart 64 was one of those that I missed so much.  Thankfully, the Nintendo people saw this coming and developed an even better version of the Mario Kart game!  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is a game that will entertain kids for hours, but it's also a game for the entire family.  Yes, the entire family will love it!  This game is crammed full of single player fun, but it also features many multiplayer options.  *Single Player  In single player mode, you can choose to race in Grand Prix mode in one of three different speed settings, or you can race against the clock in Time Trial.  In Grand Prix mode, there are several karts, characters, and Battle mode arenas to be unlocked.  In Time Trial, there are also secrets to unlock by beating the developers' best times on the tracks.  *Multiplayer  First of all, you can have up to 4 players racing with one Game Cube, or you can link two or more Game Cubes together with ethernet cable to have even more racers.  With 2-4 players, you can race in Grand Prix (with 8 total karts) Versus (no computer karts) or Battle.  There are three different Battle modes to keep things interesting!  I can't even begin to tell you everything about this game that makes it a worthwile addition to your game library,  but after you play a while you'll understand.  If you were a fan of the previous Nintendo Mario Kart games, this is a must for you!  Highly recommended to all!	1
Mario kart is a long time established video game if you go back there is the early super nintendo version and then the nintendo 64 version that sold milions and was one of the best game created then they made gameboy versions. When the gamecube arrived fans wanted a new mario kart game and the result is really impressive!  They featured a new two player mode,but not the mode you would play on separate cars they made a new 2 player mode when both players are on the same car at the same time. A cooperation mode not seen often now the players help each other one is driving one is throwing stuff  it wasn't seen before and yet it was so simple.  Just that option makes the game 5 stars but there is more. The graphics looks great the race tracks are great,and you got many cars that fits one character`s style but you can all use them. There are 3 types of cars;light,medium and heavy to go on the light car you need 2 small characters ans so it is for medium car but for the heavy you only need to have one heavy player.  You can unlock cars as you do the tournaments and characters many are here;birdo,didy kong,toadette,daisy are making appearances. Many stuff to unlock the game isn't really long it didn't took a big amout of time to beat the game but its always fun to replay this game its a classic maybe not as much as the 64 version of mario kart but still a heck of fun!  The cooperation mode,the characters,the fun everithing seems to be there the tracks are really good yet there isn't a negative point gamecube owners you should think about having it its a must have for mario fans!	1
Mario Kart Double Dash is a fun and exciting racing game that you fill find yourself constantly wanting to play gainn and again. Pacing is only half the frun of the game. You also have to use crazy items to protect your self and mess up the other racers.  Pros  -So many diifrent characters to race with  -So many diffrent courses  -1-4 players  -Items make the gameplay even more fun  -Sound and Graphics are great  -Choice quotesfrom the charcters add even more value to the game  Cons  -There is no need to have two characters on one car  -It is hard to find some of the secert paasage ways that are hidden on the race course  Overall  A fun Mario game that is worth a purchase because it is hard not to like that charcters, cars, courses, and items that are in this game	1
This is by far one of the best racing games.  The best thing about this game is that you get to throw bombs, turtle shells, bananas, and lots of other things.  It is a great game to play with 1 friend or 4 friends.	1
Greatest version of the greatest game in history	1
Great Item, Highly recommend!!!	1
I like it.	1
This is the best Mario Kart game to date. I've played everyone except the one for DS. This is probably the best racing game every too because it is stragety compared to just speed. Anybody can put the pedal to the metal but can you stay ahead when you have no advantage in speed.  The best thing about this game is that you can use two characters at once. So one is driving(driver can hold an item also) and the other is throwing the items. That essentially turns the game from an 8 player game to a 16 player game. Chalk this game up on the list of Ultimate Nintendo party games. Whoever on the Nintendo staff thought that idea up should be put in the Nintendo hall of fame beside mario and donkey kong. That is pure genius. Now you can save an item that you may need instead of using it right away. The only catch is though that if you get hit by a shell, lightning, or banana, you drop all you items.  That can easily be avoided by dodging shells and bananas. How you may ask. Well here is the other, less noticably addition to the game. When playing with a friend in the back, they can press the L or R button to dodge things, slow drivers down, knock opponents of the road, or steal items from opponents.  The last addition is the ability to use specials. Maro & Luigi can throw green or red fireballs. Baby Mario & Baby Luigi can use Chomps to clear the road for them. Donkey Kong & Diddy can throw a giant banana. Wario & Waluigi can throw an explosive bomb. Bowser & Baby Bowser can throw a giant Bowser shell. Peach & Daisy can steal opponents weapons. Toad & Toadette can get unlimited boost for about 8 seconds. Yoshi & Birdo have a homing shell. Koopa & Paratroopa have 3 green or red shells. Last but not least Piranha Plant & Boo have ALL THE POWERS. All in all, this is a best game in the series and well worth owning for any serious Nintendo fan or Gamecube owner.	1
This game was made for the console only, all the great things about the first one have been taken out, from the skill sets, ammo, reloading, the inventory. Everything has been super simplified so now its a FPS not an action rpg. ALso your looking about around 15 hours of gameplay. The most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name. FOrgot to mention a very weak AI and no head shots or body specific damage like the first one. They should of named it DIET Deus Ex	-1
Excelent	1
I remember playing super Mario bros 3 on the NES and it was a big improvement for the NES in the 90's i mean who didn't play it but then i saw it at my local video game stores that sells classic video games i mean they had 2 copys of it and it reminds me of the NES version i mean you get that and the original Mario bros classic game that was in the arcade.	1
Mario Kart double dash brings back the sixth instalment in Mario's racing history.  Play as one of the origanal NES Mario cast as well as Waliugi/Wario. You steer your charaters own kart of choice as you go through of what is mostly Mushroom Kingdom, wiving in and out of props from your favorite NES games.   You have a gunner and a driver. The driver of course drives, while the gunner throughs random items from green and red shells, to your gunners speaical iteam.   The multi-player is one of Nintendo's better ideas, esspicaly the broadband connection. It would be extremly smart of you to buy this.	1
Ive been playing this game for years by myself and with my friends. It is simply amazing. For single player there are 3 different grand prixs each with 4 wacky courses with 3 levels, 50cc,100cc, and 150cc. Higher the cc the higher the speed. Each level up is harder. Beat levels to unlock the special cup, special karts, and new amazing characters. Each character has its own special like marios flame balls and koopas triple red shells. There are tons of multiplayer options for up to 4 players. Race each other in a grand prix, go one on one or whatever combination in a versus. Or face off 2 on 2. For two players, there is a co-op mode. One person drives, while the other rides shotgun being able to throw items and punch nearby opponents karts. There is also a battle mode for up to 4 players with weird tracks such as tilt-a-kart and pipe plaza. There are 3 battles, Shine theif, bob-omb blast, and balloon battle. All of them are loads of fun, especially bob-omb blast and balloon battle. Unlock another level known as mirror and play each course reverse. Unlock the all-cup-tour and play a 16 race tour following every single race.  Here are my final totals:  Fun: 9/10, nothing like throwing items and duking it out to the finish  multiplayer/co-op: 10/10, tons of fun options for up to 4 players  time: 10/10, hours upon hours of gameplay  bugs: none  features: 10/10, several unlockable features and race courses  overall: 10/10, a legendary game. One of the few bright spots in the gamecube library.	1
I got this video game for Christmas and boy I got a lot more than I had ever hoped for.  I salute Nintendo for restoring the classic Mario Kart genre, this game is better then the Mario Kart 64 in my opinion because you're given the ability to have two racers of your choice on a Kart so you can combine your specials to eliminate the competitors.   The graphics are the best I've ever seen on a Gamecube game, the sound and the voice-overs are a pleasure to your ears,the concept can't be beat and there are a ton of things to unlock like characters, vehicles, and courses.   I was so obsessed with the game that I stayed up five nights sequentially and unlocked everything and beat it.   This game is very fun and enjoyable and will have you glued to your seat for hours, it is a definite must-own for any Gamecube owner.   The only flaw I could see in this game was that it was a bit too short and easy, also there could've been a few more courses to unlock. Overall get off your ass and go order/buy this game NOW,it's worth your money every single penny.	1
Omfg I love this game so much. I got it with my black Gamecube cause my purple one broke.. oh well. I never played the first Mario Kart so this was entirely new to me, but oh so fun. Each kart holds two people, one driver and another to chuck stuff around the track. There's three kart categories: light, medium, and heavy. The light karts have great acceleration, but poor speed and weight. Medium karts are well-rounded and average. Heavy karts are fast and stocky, but have really bad accel. The graphics and backrounds are great, and some of the tracks are so original, but I won't give those away.  If anybody is ever interested, I wasted some time and made a giant list of all Mario Kart: Double Dash! components, with items, characters, karts, and tracks. Just send me an e-mail requesting the Mario Kart guide.	1
I've been a fan of the entire Mario Kart series since it's original game. Any person can sit down and enjoy this game. Simple and easy to play on 50 CC and great Nintendo mascots.  Graphics: 8.5/10. Most game sites did not like the graphics so much in this game. They thought they were good but nothing special. True, but they didn't appreciate them enough. The cartoony and bright graphics fit well in this game, and the character models look great. The only real flaw is that they are a wee bit dated.  Sound: 9/10. It's all here. DK's trademark grunts, as well as Bowser's, Daisy says "I'm Daisy" so much it makes you want to shoot her with a red shell... it just sounds good. The tracks have their own little track too so there is a little music as well.  Control: 9.5/10. A lot of people hate the controls for this game. Why? I have no idea; but they are very realistic. Very, very realistic. For example, when you are going down a straight away and do a sharp turn, you will not turn much unless you use R to drift. Drifting well is essential to win races on 150 CC, so you have to get used to it if you want to win those karts and 2 extra characters.  Fun: 9/10. There is a lot of fun to be had here. Especially on multiplayer. You and a buddy can team up on one kart or go head-to-head; your decision. There are quite a few characters to race with from obviously Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Yoshi, and so on, to less popular mascots such as Birdo, Diddy Kong, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and many, many more. Each set of characters have their own "special", too. Baby Mario, Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi all shoot a set of five fireballs, Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong throw a large banana, and so on. You can also unlock the special cup after you beat the star cup, which adds to the games 15 levels to make it 20. This game will be hard for kids, and maybe for some adults, but with practice you will succeed. Even after you have beaten the game on single player, you can still have your way with up to 3 other friends, or you can play on LAN. This is a great addition to the series and I recommend ( if you haven't already ) that you pick it up now.  9.6/10	1
I love everything in this game. The graphics,the sound ( big time) but there is some flaws. When you are doing the Grand Prix,what happen to retry's if your 4th to 8th? This makes the game almost impossible. But that's a good thing. We want the game to be more challenging (unlike to Mario Kart 64). In this game,you can unlock characters,karts and even battle areans. Now I've spoken about that,there's 3 modes in battle  Ballon Battle: Same as original Ballon mode in MK 64 Shine Thief: Touch/Run into a sun and don't get attacked for 1 minute (this match is pretty easy for people who have the sun) Bomb Battle: Collect bombs and hit people 3 times in a row to win!  Overall 4/5 This game is great except for a few important flaws.	1
Mario Kart Double Dash!! is one of the most phenomenal video games ever made; a game that makes me fondly remember what video games used to be.    Firstly, for Mario Kart veterans (who I am sure have already picked this game up), this is the most unique game in the series.  Two racers now occupy each car.  The racer in front steers while the character in back handles weapons and attacks (you can punch nearby players now and steal their weapons).  If you play single-player, you control both characters, stearing and firing weapons, while a single tap of the 'Z' button will switch character positions.  This comes in handy, since each character can carry a weapon, while only the character in back can use them.  So, if the driver has a banana or a shell you want to fire, and the character in back has nothing, tap 'Z' and switch positions in an instant, without slowing down your car at all.    Because of the two-character mechanic, there are now two types of weapon boxes that you drive through to recieve your weapon: single boxes give only the character in the back of the car a weapon - so if the charcater in back is already carrying one, switch the charcater's positions when you drive through a single weapon box so that both your racers will now carry a weapon.  Double weapon boxes give each racer on the kart a weapon, (if one charcater is already carrying one, the other racer will recieve a weapon regardless).  In single-player, if both characters have a weapon, and the one in back fires theirs, the characters automatically switch positions on the car, so the character with the remaining weapon is instantly ready to fire.    In multi-player, you have a few options.  Each player can control their own car and both characters on it, or you can each pick one character to race on the same car.  If you choose the latter, both players will have to push 'Z' simultaneosly to switch positions on the car.  So, if one player prefers driving, and the other prefers handling the weapons, you can stay that way the entire race, since the characters will not automatically switch positions (instead, the player in front can tap the fire button to toss his weapon to the player in back when they are empty-handed).  Multiplayer is incredibly addicting; especially (surprise) in battle mode, which makes a welcome return.  For players used to ballon battle from Mario Kart 64, the levels in Double Dash will seem small at first (though you can unlock a few more, one of which is bigger), but give balloon battle a chance.  It is incredibly addictive, and nothing is more satisfying than hitting your opponent with an expertly timed shot of a green shell from across a level.  (There are also two new battle modes this time around, but I found balloon battle to be the most enjoyable.)    One thing that surprised me was the game's difficulty.  The learning curve is perfect, with three difficulty levels as usual, 50cc, 100 cc and 150cc racing modes.  But for a Nintendo game, 150cc proved fairly difficult, which was a welcome challenge.  Computer opponents are smart on 150cc mode, but make similar mistakes to the ones you'll find yourself making.  They win races not by cheating (like in other games), but by firing weapons at strategic moments in the race, or using power slides around turns (do it correctly and you'll get a mini speedy boost at the end of the power slide).  So, regardless of how far ahead you may be on 150cc mode, one simple error can prove devestating.  On the flip side, if you are behind, one great, well timed shot can be all you need to take the lead.  The gameplay is expertly balanced, and there is even strategy involved now in selecting your team and your car, since different players and cars have varying weights and pros and cons.  Plus, each character has a unique special weapon.    In addition, the course design, as usual in the Mario Kart series, is flawless.  Every course is unique, and you'll develop strategies for approaching each one.  Moreover, the graphics are sharp, bright and colorful.  Each course and each character has their own personality.    The replay value is infinite.  There are plenty of unlockables in single-player, inlcuding new characters, courses (racing and battle), cars, and game modes.  Once everything is unlocked, multiplayer alone will keep you coming back for more, not to mention besting your best course times in time trial mode.    This game is a great reminder of what used to make games great - gameplay and replayability, not graphics, physics or online modes.  This is a brilliantly crafted game, a game that will appeal to all ages, both genders, gamers and non-gamers alike.    A true classic!	1
This game is pretty fun and has pretty decent things to do and awesome cars!!! The courses are great to!! I love playing this game with my friends and kicking their butts!!!! I love this game!!!!!!	1
Nothing... nothing is worse than a backseat driver... unless of course they're throwing koopa shells or launching fireballs at your enemies. Mario Kart Double Dash is incredible, everything responds well, the controls are tight, simple to pick up yet difficult to master, no story... just fun. It's a game anyone can enjoy, including young children and grownups.	1

I'm satisfied with my purchase	1
I've been playing this game recently. Bought this from a friend at a super-cheap deal that I'll be satisfied for years.  As much as I love Super Mario Bros. 3 on Nintendo, the Game Boy Advance version retains the same greatness.....with Super Mario All-Stars graphics of course! However, the controls in this version are sorta stiff (using GameCube controller or GameBoy Player Digital Controller:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/x30B2-x30FC-x30E0-x30DC-x30FC-x30A4-x30D7-x30EC-x30FC-x30E4-x30FC-x5BFE-x5FDC-x30C7-x30B8-x30BF-x30EB-x30B3-x30F3-x30C8-x30ED-x30FC-x30E9-x30D0-x30A4-x30AA-x30EC-x30C3-x30C8/dp/B00008KDFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">&#x30B2;&#x30FC;&#x30E0;&#x30DC;&#x30FC;&#x30A4;&#x30D7;&#x30EC;&#x30FC;&#x30E4;&#x30FC;&#x5BFE;&#x5FDC; &#x30C7;&#x30B8;&#x30BF;&#x30EB;&#x30B3;&#x30F3;&#x30C8;&#x30ED;&#x30FC;&#x30E9; &#x30D0;&#x30A4;&#x30AA;&#x30EC;&#x30C3;&#x30C8;</a>) and then some bug fixes coming out of the earlier versions. If only I have an e-Reader and SMB3 cards in handy, then I'd be more satisfied.	1
Love this game, it's an instant classic of the many super Mario games made. Plays perfectly!	1
The classic ground breaker.	1
I'm a fan of ''Mario Kart 64'' and this game tops it off nicely. Bowser's casle is a good remake of a great course. Rainbow road is a lot better than the original and isn't as long and the new courses are very fun also. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because some of the characters look kinda plasticy (cough cough wario & waluigi).	1
Take all the crazy action of the celebrated Mario Kart series...and multiply it by two! In Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, each kart holds two racers that can switch places at any time, so choose from a huge cast of favorites and pair them up any way you see fit!    Team Up for Twice the Fun!	1
If anyone reading this begins to believe a word that I say, then please read the last paragraph.  It's amazing all the things you can do online in this game.  Up to eight players from eight different cities can compete head-to-head, either one race at a time or for an entire circuit.  Getting exploding-shelled at the last moment, then finding that mushroom you need and powering through the finish still in first place - this is quite a way to spend an afternoon.  Then there's challenger mode, which works like a time trial except that the three ghosts racing against you are real people racing at the same time as you are.  You look for a 'room' without too many people, and take your place in line.  Then when your time comes, you take your place as one of three challengers, and race against the champion.  Whoever wins the race then becomes champion and gets to race again; the losers have to go back to the end of the line.  Then as champion you are challenged by three more challengers.  The first challenger in line gets to choose the track for the next race.  While you're waiting, you get to watch the current race from the champ's point of view.  It's a blast.  But that's only in my dreams.  For now.  I will buy Nintendo's next home console, in the hope that they will get their online gaming in order.  And maybe the next system's Mario Kart game will work online something like this.  For now though, Mario Kart Double Dash is a very good (off-line only) game.  The action-packed, no-race-is-the-same-as-any-other gameplay is fun enough that I have kept playing long after unlocking everything (and there is a lot to unlock).  I thought that it might get too weird and complicated with two racers in each vehicle but it doesn't.  With such a huge lineup of characters and karts you will find one that works for you (mine is Luigi's baby buggy).  More challenge in Grand Prix mode could have given it even more replay value (250cc maybe?), but if you want more challenge you can try to score first in every race - the game keeps track.  That's not quite enough, but that's what multiplayer is for (more frantic challenge).  Don't think this game is just for young kids though -- in Time Trials just releasing the course ghosts is a challenge, and I have never come close to beating one.  I do wish there were more tracks.  This game isn't that flashy, won't thrill you, but is very, very fun.  But not online.	1
ok, for the first couple of months i loved this game but then you get sick of the courses and it gets boring, once you've mastered all the courses, it's so boring i don't even play it any more. but all in all i really liked this game   so hey, mabee youll like it and mabey you won't but i think you will and it is an excellent game for a child say 5-12 but after that youll get board with it quick like i did	1
I've never played a bad mario game, and this is no different. This game is very fun, it has a good selection of characters to choose from, and many different tracks. With the new feature of two racers on a car you can double the fun. If you like any mario games than I suggest you get this game.	1
My brother received a Gamecube (it came with this game only) for Christmas.  He's in his thirties.  I'm almost in my thirties.  And I'm the youngest.  There were six adults at our family get-together this past Christmas.  There were no children.  But all of us got the biggest kick out of this game.  I don't even usually like racing games, and I loved it!  I almost never play console games (only computer games), and I couldn't get enough of it.  This game is easy enough that anyone can enjoy it and still presents enough difficulties not to make it boring.  That is a balance which very few games ever achieve.  If you own a Gamecube, this is definitely for you.  If you don't own a Gamecube, this game could potentially make you want to purchase one.	1
I will start out just by saying that this game didn't blow me away or anything. I am a huge fan of the first game and can still go back and play it in a new way. After playing that one I jumped right into this one. Sure, i was disappointed to see that it was a bit stripped down to make it more accessible but that comes with some pluses as well as minuses so its not a complete loss. You'll still be able to tell that its a Deus Ex game. The game looks great, it plays great, and the story is interesting. If you have played the newest game you owe it to yourself to play the first and second. They are definitely worth playing.	1
Consider this a dual review; I'm reviewing both the original and the sequel here.  My first experience with Deus Ex was when my brother showed me a few minutes of the gameplay on his PC back in 2000. It wasn't too terribly far into the game but far enough that I had no clue what was going on story wise or what sort of gameplay mechanics it used. That was the seed that began it all, however.  A few months after that I found a jewel case for about $20 in a used PC store. Figuring that I could spend $20 on worse things, I snatched it up and went back to my dorm. Took a bit to tweak the settings to balance visuals with framerate (the computer I owned at the time was ancient even then) but finally worked all of that out.  And it didn't take too long before I realized why my brother liked the game so much.  I'd played a few games that allowed for freedom of choice before, but not to the scale that was offered here, and certainly not one that had as much replay value. I couldn't even begin to imagine how many times I replayed a particular level, or the game from beginning to end, trying something else just to see how it'd play out, and it took many, many playthroughs before I finally could say I saw/heard everything. Even on playthroughs where I already figured I must've seen/heard everything, I still ended up uncovering something new.  The game had a stronger emphasis on the shooter aspect than sneaking/hacking, but the general gaming atmosphere, and the expectations of the gaming audience at the time, were far different than it'd be today, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that shooting through the game was oftentimes the main path. There always was a stealth route available (apparently, even the most secure, heavily defended bases on the planet all have at least one air duct large enough for a man to crawl through - and they can crawl through completely silent at that!) but breaking stealth, accidentally or otherwise usually meant a fight until everything around you gathered flies. The fact that decisions in one level rarely impacted the game in the long term was disappointing, but it was more than fun enough to see everything it had to offer. In the end, the game was easily one of my favorite games and likely always will be.  Then, about a year ago, I stumbled across a copy of the much less well received sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War. By the time it originally came out, I was drifting away from PC gaming as a whole and didn't really bother to check into it before this. I knew that lots of people hated the game, but some enjoyed it, and I finally decided that there was only one way to find out which camp I belonged in.  By then I had a computer that was made several years after DE:IW came out, and was far more powerful than the recommended specs on the box.  Yet, somehow when the game began, I had to spend at least 15 minutes messing with the visual settings before finally having no choice but to scale everything - resolution, textures, the whole nine - down to the lowest levels. If I made one single setting go higher than the absolute lowest, it'd be a slideshow. Didn't matter which one, every single setting had to be at its lowest. Yet somehow everything at the lowest was smooth - there was no in-between. Not a great way to start things off, especially when you already have concerns about the game.  And it only got worse from there.  It's already very hard to ignore the mechanical flaws this game has, such as the horrible voice acting from every major character who wasn't in the first game (and some who were) the clunky gameplay, the annoying side quests that I ended up just ignoring about half way in, the horribly washed out colors, goofy character animations, the tad bit TOO streamlined inventory and magic ammo pool from whence all weapons drew being examples just off the top of my head. These might - just MIGHT - be forgiven if the story and characters themselves are great. But these are also two areas where IW failed to deliver. There were zero - literally, zero - great plot twists. There is a plot twist towards the latter half of the game that changes how you view the factions, but even if the plot twist was mind-blowing and completely unpredictable, (it's not!) it doesn't hold any weight to the game, so replaying the game and knowing the truth doesn't really make a difference. The plot twist in this game doesn't quite hold the same impact as the original KOTOR when you discovered who Darth Revan was, or perhaps Andrew Ryan telling you to stop (and what he says after) in Bioshock, or when Harbinger said what would be his final two words to...somebody who's not Shepherd in Mass Effect 2, despite the fact that it looks like that's what the developers were striving for. It seems like they were trying to wow us with that plot twist, yet it just falls flat.  There's also no real sense of escalating tension between protagonist and antagonist(s) either. In the original, every step forward meant two steps back, as it should be. Here, there were multiple factions going head to head and trying to convince you to take their side, but there's no real reason to care about any one of them, and the fact that you could have actively worked against any one of them the entire game yet still be able to fulfill their agenda was disappointing. In one instance, this can even mean going so far as to kill a key member of the original game in cold blood. You could do that, and still work with that faction, as if nothing was wrong. No real consequence for your actions.  Speaking of factions, did anybody else's hand attach itself to forehead upon finding out that one of the factions is - I'm not making this up - the Templars? Oh, but it gets better! Despite being disbanded over 7 centuries ago, somehow the Templars manage to raise up a formidable army, in a horrible, global recession no less, complete with walking mechs, choppers, tanks, you name it. You also spend the majority of the game sneaking into, killing, destroying, disrupting and otherwise giving anything that is even remotely Templar a headache of titanic proportions. But towards the end of the game, that doesn't matter none! Nope! The grandmaster of the Templar order doesn't seem to care one bit that you've killed countless soldiers and cost him millions in equipment loss. He'll still let you work for him if you're so inclined! And unless I missed something, the game also didn't really explain how Chad went from peaceful protester to megalomaniacal, homicidal dictator who would stop at nothing for total control. He was easily as detestable as the grandmaster of the Templars, if not more so.  The endings do require that you commit to a certain path at the very end (but only the very end) and they divulge largely from each other - they are mutually exclusive. In the original, they're not really so exclusive, a fact that this game takes on, because the canon "ending" the sequel uses is a combination of all of them. That is to say, JC fulfills every ending, and the world is shaped by that. But despite being mutually exclusive and forcing a final commitment, they still disappoint.  The only real improvements this game had over the original are that unlike the first game, you can 1.) Play a male or female operative. 2.) You can't save, get a door code by paying somebody, reload the game and use the code without spending the money - this time, you have to have the code to open the door. 3.) Air ducts are also guarded this time. 4. There's an interactive AI who resembles a major pop star. In one exchange, you can reveal the actual pop star's manager doing a dirty deed and ask her what she'll do. Her response? "Oh, tra la la...I'll probably just fire the b---h!" That got a good laugh. 5.) And the last level in the game was a good choice, as it ties the storyline back to the original game.  But those are it. And those plusses do not even begin to compensate for IW's many and deep flaws. So, in the end, I have no choice but to side with the camp who loved the original but hated the sequel. Fortunately, Human Revolution proved to be just what the series needs to bring it back into the limelight, so hopefully we can all move forward and forget this awful game.  Deus Ex: 9.5/10 Invisible War: 3.75/10 (And I feel that I'm being generous with that score.) Human Revolution: 8.5/10	-1
First and foremost, the original Deus Ex is the greatest game ever created. IW is a worthy sequel to that game.  Yes many cry that its not really Deus Ex, and yes many rpg elements were cut to make it more friendly to the console crowd.  But if you are a true fan of Deus Ex, then you will love this game simply because its more of the Deus Ex story to love. People seem to forget that while the first game did have great and unique gameplay, the heart and soul of the game was its story and characters, and  the choices you made along the way. In that respect, IW is exactly the same game.  Besides, you have to enjoy it because IW seems to be the series swan song. Deus Ex 3 is supposedly in the works, but it hasn't emerged for at least two years. So, just enjoy IW war for what it is: a great but flawed sequel that is fifty times better than the run and gun crud we get these days.	1
Deus Ex 1 was perfect and still stands as one of the best games ever (if you can overlook the outdated graphics).  How did they go wrong with this?  They had the perfect blueprint from the original game and screwed it all up by dumbing the gameplay down for a simultaneous console release (even after Warren Spector said he wouldn't dumb down the gameplay).  The environments are much smaller this time around, damage system is lousy (at v. 1.0, a hit anywhere on an enemy did the same damage).  My biggest gripe is the original was a very realistic Scifi FPS with meticulous ammunition management and yet in the sequel we get universal ammo and weapons that don't even need to be reloaded.  It's like they're stepping backwards.  Another cruddy element is the idle stance the characters have.  It doesn't look natural.  Every character when idle stands like a 3D character that hasn't been rigged yet with their arms a foot from their sides.  The music was yet another step back for the series as well.  There were no memorable themes (aside from the title and opening movie) and they ditched dynamic music which I loved in the original game (when you snuck around unnoticed, one song played, and when you were in combat, another higher tempo and more action packed variation segued in).  Finally, it's a minor element, but I also miss the camera bob from the original game.  It made the camera movement feel more natural and once again is a step backwards for the series.  I hope Eidos is paying real close attention to these negative reviews when they develop DX3.	-1

double dash is a fun game. if you didn't like the first one you gotta give this one a chance. the graphics are better and the same characters are in it. they all return like mario, luigi, donkey kong. new characters are introduced. like baby mario and luigi, diddy kong, bowser and baby bowser. i won't tell you the hidden characters but here's a little game of fill in the blanks for the hidden characters: ---, ----- ------, ----, and  -------. give this game a chance for you evil people who hate this game!	1
I got this for my b-day, and this is one of the funnest games out there! Its really cool how 2 people can be on the cart at once. this is so sweet! it is really neat becuase you work togeather to win, or against eachother to have the sweet taste of victory to yourself. this game is the best!  ( i gave it 4 educatinol points because of hand eye corrdanation)	1
I've found the key to happiness  All you have to do is get some Wild Turkey, A room full of friends, and this game, and you will forget all that is negative in your life. It's too much fun. Highly recommend!	1
in this game you get to pick 2 people to drive one car.  or u can team up with a friend and drive the car together.  race in all new courses with some new characters including: toad, toadette, boo, petty pirana, koopa, paratroopa, daisy, baby mario, baby luigi, and diddy.	1
I got this game for Christmas last year, and I'm STILL playing it! The fun never ends! (wow...) I love the "two-person-in-a-kart" feature and there are so many people to choose from! You can even win people to play with. The courses are fun and range from incredibly easy (Baby Park) to not that easy (Rainbow Road... according to my friends at least. I think it's not that hard.) The special courses are probably the best ones, so you have to work a little for the good stuff! Also, the other things you can do on this game are great too. The bob-omb blast is the BEST! Anyone can enjoy that.	1
Fun game!!!	1
Love this awesome game!!!!!	1
This game is terrible in every way possible.  The graphics actually take a step backward from the first Deus Ex.  The RPG element that was so great in the first game was hacked into pieces for this game, making it nearly unplayable.  The plot is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered.  The maps are small, which means very little exploring.  Overall, this game is not worth the box it comes in.  I am very disappointed that Eidos would slap together a game like this and unleash it on the public.  Shame on you Eidos.  We know you are capable of so much more!  Deus Ex Invisible War = Terrible = Buy Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition.	-1
When I read about the previews to this new Deus Ex, I was skeptical. I really thought it was going to be a dog. But, being such an extreme fan of the original, I was still looking forward to how it would be. I was especially irked by the removal of the skill system, a system that I thought made the game more like an RPG instead of just a first person action adventure game. After I played it, I was very impressed. It looks graphically stunning, has even more player freedom than the first Deus Ex, and even more endings. I loved playing through this game. It is a bit easier than the first one, but still squarely in the right range of difficulty to maintain my interest, but not make me too frustrated that I get killed in the same area over and over.  In the final analysis, this is a spectacular game much like the first, but the original Deus Ex is still my favorite game of all time.	1
I know when Invisible War came out there were issues. Yes it does not live up tho the original, and hopefully there will be a 3rd in the series.  But in 2007 with the proper computer system, and its price it's, a solid game.	1
This is one of the greatest super Mario games of all time it is just like the original N.E.S. Game only in game boy advance I love playing this game it just reminds me of my child years when I use to play it game was shipped in great condition label perfect intact only nail was rusted great buy.	1
Excellent item!	1
So I just go it the mail today (which is 2 days before the week of estimated delivery even began, which is awesome) and the game looks brand new! The label is totally intact and there are no scratches on the cartridge. It plays really well too. This game is one of my favorite old school Mario games and I haven't been able to play it in years. A really great game and a really great buy! I will definitely buy from this seller again! (:	1
I was a Kart-a-holic when it came to Mario Kart on the 64.  I guess I was just too set in my ways when I first started playing this game.  It is a great game, with quality levels, and fun new characters.  However it is different.  If you are one of those people that still dreams of the days when you would argue with friends about the distance from the television you had to sit in order to play Duck Hunt this one might not be for you.	1
I never had so much fun or never been so fustrated over this game! Get this game for the holidays yr kids will love it. Seriously, who actually uses the technique "double dashing"?	1
Man I put this game in and right away I drive so fast and good!  I win some of them and then I get to not win as many but I still like to play the girls. My favorite part is when you be a baby.  My worst favorite part is when the dinosaur steps on me and I get flat.  when you play try to go down to play on the flower part but the mushroom part can be hard to beat sometime.  You shoud play on the flower part.  and play on for a bit and then maybe try the mushroom part.  One time I find a car like a pipe!  tony	1
If you think Madden doesn't change, play this game.  The one player competes with DOA for the title of most shallow.  Where the hell is create-a-kart, a FULL career or something to give you something new to do.  In terms of multiplayer, SO MUCH wasted potential.  Where are the bots and level designs?  Get diddy kong racing on the 64, trust me.	-1
this game is so cool you get new cars and new people and its so fun racing i like doing it i am really good mabe the best i no i can beat alot of ppl at this game this game is really fun as well i bet alot of kids that don't have it yet will like this game alot.	1
Dont even rent Mario Kart: Double Dash. It is really boring. All the Mario Karts are the same. Im sick of Mario. He should die already. Dont buy it.	-1
I agree with the kid that said this was "Hands down the best racing game ever!". It's more than a racing game, it's an all out road war. If the other racers don't get you the obstacles on each track will. Mushroom Kingdoms favorite foes like Goomba's, Piranha Plant's, Pokey's and many more are waiting around every turn. There are a number of weapons that you can put to use againist your opponents.. like turtle shells, bombs, banana peels, large spiked King Koopa shells, fire, explosive boxes and more. There are also mushrooms that give you that extra boost of speed that can sometimes help you win the race at the last minute. Not to mention the famous speed boosters that are on each track. The tracks are great, they're  "Super Mario Sunshine" themed. I recommend that game highly as well. There are some tracks that are not "Sunshine" themed however. I recall one track that traffics regular and not-so regular vehicles, these cars and trucks will slow you down if you don't stay clear of them. I did notice some people say this game isn't much more advanced than "Mario Kart 64", don't believe such bologna. This game blows "Mario Kart 64" out of the water. Just in case you haven't played this yet, you may wanna know where the subtitle "Double Dash" comes from. That's simple you are able to choose two characters that race together. The combination is up to you. For instance you can team Mario with Bowser if you like, or you can be traditional and put the Mario Bros. together. My choice last time I played was Koopa and Wario. An odd team but that gives you an idea of your options. One character drives while the other is equip with an array of weapons (mentioned above), with the press of a button they are able to switch jobs. There are unlockable characters and tracks, but you do start off with a wide variety. Bottomline is, I really believe you won't find a better racing game. It's not Nascar and there's not a woman in a bikini that waves a checked flag, but I recommend it fully based on hundreds of hours in replay value, beautiful graphics, user friendly controls, and Nintendo's timeless characters that I always seem to fiend for more of. "MARIO KART DOUBLE DASH" IS A GREAT GAME TO ADD TO YOUR GAMECUBE INVENTORY. 100%	1
To understand this game's place in gaming history, it will help to understand the history of its developers.  Ion Storm was founded by John Romero and Tom Hall, the minds behind Doom.  Doom was, and probably still is,  the most widely known game in the FPS genre.  With its creators breaking off from ID software to form their own company, all eyes were already on Ion Storm from the very beginning.  The company had 2 branches: One in Austin, and one in Dallas.  The Dallas branch of Ion Storm spent years working on the game Daikatana.  Due to the amount of publicity the company and their game were receiving, Daikatana was highly anticipated by many gamers, who were champing at the bit to get their hands on what promised to be the best game ever made.  However, due in part to the excessively long development time (for the day), and the frustratingly wonky AI, Daikatana was finally released to painfully bad reviews all around.  The game ended up selling very poorly, and was directly responsible for the both the closing of the Dallas IS branch, and for the departure of Romero and Hall from the company.  Daikatana should have been the death of Ion Storm, and surely would have been if it hadn't been for what was happening in the Austin branch.  About the same time Daikatana was released, Ion Storm Austin completed work on and released a little known game called Deus Ex.  Deus Ex was a mix of FPS and RPG, which played like an interactive "choose your own adventure" sci-fi novel. Unlike Daikatana, Deus Ex was released to critical acclaim, and went on to sell very well.  It even won 2000s Game of the Year award.  Deus Ex singlehandedly saved the should-be-ruined Ion Storm from collapse.  Fast forward 3 years.  News of Deus Ex 2 comes.  Once again, in what can only be a cruel act of fate, Ion Storm was plagued with  a long development process, as well as the attention and anticipation of gamers everywhere.  You know where this is going, right?  The reviews on this site should deem it unnecessary for me to describe what happened when Invisible War was released.  I'll just say that it was universally panned, and die-hard fans of Deus Ex were, almost without exception, entirely disappointed with the game.  Shortly after DX2 was released, Ion Storm released another highly anticipated game, Thief III.  While not as critically panned as DX2, the game didn't sell very well, and was plagued with many of the same issues that DX2 apparently suffered from.  As a result, Eidos, Ion Storm's parent company, decided to close the doors at Ion Storm forever.  What should have been a return to greatness ended up being the end for one of the most ambitious and talented game development companies in the world.  Personally, I like DX2.  It's a bit smaller than the first game, and the story doesn't seem as inspired, but it's still a couple of steps above your average gaming fare.  There is a lot of freedom to enjoy yourself in this game, and,  like the first game, you can choose what type of person you will be.  You can chose to be a diplomat, a hardcore killer, or anything in between.  The only thing that I don't like about this game is the size of the play areas.  At times, the buildings are so tiny, you can't even move without bumping into something.  Other than that, the game is worthy of the Deus Ex name, in my opinion.  Even if it lacks something that the first game had, it is still worth checking out - ESPECIALLY at this price.	1
I finally got around to playing this and I still had fun even though I think Deus-Ex was better.  Make sure you video card is up to the task.  I had basic cards and they would not work.  Needed to upgrade anyway as the graphic levels are way more intense these days. I like the idea of Alex Denton but I think the roleplay aspects could have been a little better.  In the first one I was concerned about Paul, took a liking to Tracer Tong but in this one I really didn't care about anybody.  The closest interesting exchange was probably NG Resance but that only went so far.  Also, I didn't get the feeling of are they are friend or foe as much as I did in the first game.  The story line is ok. The intro was interesting.  However, as desperate as one group was to destroy Chicago, they really didn't try it again.  A nice "hateful" scenario would have been a race against the clock to get at a bomb.  You have factions again especially a new one called the Omar.  In one possible ending they could take over the earth.  However, if they are planning that, they probably would have been more involved then simply selling blackmarket stuff in the allyways and backrooms.  Another aspect was that maps in this game seemed smaller then I remember from the first one.  You could cover an area in no time.  The weapons are ok.  However, the special weapons are interesting.  However, the placement of some seemed to be along the lines of "hey isn't this cool?  Let's insert it somewhere"  Some weapons you can really do without(the stun prod and the club).  The weapons mods are plentiful so if you used a glass buster on a pistol.  You can still mod a better one down the road.  The biomods are ok.  The best part are the black market biomods.  There are enough of them so if you try something, you can trade it out if you don't like it.  However, I might point out there were not any really noticeable tradeoffs.  The jumping biomod is pretty well useless as the wall climbing ability wipes it out.  You have more things to throw if you want to try the strength mods but I didn't.  You get the hacking mod but I found it was too easy to hack stuff.  The mode to control guns was ok but not really needed.  One aspect that made attacking a little to easy was the drone mods.  You can create a drone that shoots tranks.  If you have enough charge ups, you can use a black market biomod that delivers modified EMP blasts that take down humans as well as robots.  This made robot fighting more of a delay then a hassle. Finally, watch your multitools as you need 6 of them at the end of the game and I didn't find many at that point....... There is an easter-egg ending.  Note the flag at the old unatco building.  Take it to the old leaders bathroom and flush the toilet.  Do save your spot as you have to reload to continue the game.  It's not the great game but it's hardly bad.  Hopefully, the next installment will have better interaction, better side-quests as they seem indirectly part of the story rather then space fillers.	1
super amazing port, love the update in graphics. still holds up today as the best mario. everyone should have this version.	1
great game,cool power ups,great bosses, and the green sidekick luigi. So I say bye it now so you can be happy.	1
I love all things mario this is a good game challenging  levels keeps you going for months good game for the money	1
I found this to be an interesting and entertaining game. Sure, a lot of fans of the original game did not get what they were looking for, but for gamers new to Deus Ex there is a lot to like.  For one, the story is much better than in most other games. Here, you can team up with any side you like and apply your view of the world to the game. It will probably take to the very end (and a few surprising turns) before you really know which way you want to go. No other game before has presented so many meaningful choices to me.  Of course, compared to Deus Ex 1, there are a number of simplifications. Unified ammo is something a lot of people do not like. It didn't bother me too much, although it is a bit odd that rocket launchers and pistols use the same ammo. The bio-mods I am not to crazy about. There are too many options to upgrade your mods and not enough meaningful choices there. But there are other aspects in the game that make up for it.  Of course at this point, the graphics engine can not quite keep up with Doom 3 or Half Life 2, but it gets the job done.	1
As a story-teller I was eager to play this game for the wide possinilities of scenarios.  As a game I was very disappointed.  First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions.  Only in game play was I able to move my character.  Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt.  If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo.  That was just a waste of space.  I also felt limited by the small selection of tools.  Not even the cheat codes would entirely work.  For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips.  The guns themselves were not even very good.  The sniper rifle didn't "snipe." The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak.  I should have bought Halo when I had the chance.	-1
Super Mario Bros 3 is one of my favorite Mario games included Super Mario World, Super Mario RPG, Mario and Luigi series, Paper Mario series, Super Mario Bros 1, 2 and New Super Mario Bros series. I have been playing Mario for 20 years and my very first Mario game is Super Mario World. I got Super Mario World when one of my aunts gave me for Christmas and the game came with the SNES system. Super Mario Bros 3 is very, very hard to beat and very addicting, but I managed to beat it. This game is almost better than the NES game because of the beautiful graphics. Super Mario Bros 3 had very hard and insane levels, new power-ups like the Raccoon leaf and hard bosses. This game had a new mini-boss: Boom-Boom and the introducing of the Koopa Kids bosses. The story starts when Bowser kidnaps Peach again and he sent the Koopa Kids to stop Mario and Luigi from saving Peach. Can Mario and Luigi get through the Koopa Kids and save Peach from Bowser before he rules the Mushroom Kingdom with an iron fist. If you love Super Mario Bros 3, you can either buy the NES or the remake version.	1
This game is well ported to the Gameboy Advance.  If you want to relive your old adventures or try out a classic, this is a great pick.	1
The Super Mario Kart of SNES days, despite the cartoonish nature of it, was perhaps the greatest racing game ever.  In my time, it was a college dorm staple.  The battles were just a medium for trash talking, the time trials were a measure of pure skill, and the races were a great combination of both.  Very rarely does a game reward skill.  When the N64 version came out, it came out with a collective, "ughh".  While darn good looking, much of the skill was replaced by luck, and it just wasn't as fun. Now the latest incantation is for the Gamecube.  Sure, Nintendo is no longer the only major player in the video game market, but it still shines.  This game still relies a lot on luck, and the power slide of yesteryears have been replaced by a useless unintuitive turn boost.  The Super Nintendo version had different levels of characters, where the ultimate goal was to master the clunky but amazingly fast Bowser and Donkey Kong Jr.  Now, even though there are more characters, the AI and lack of a power slide removes all motivation to switch from the lighter ones, reducing replayability.  The battles are good though.  I especially enjoy the bomb battles, but the lack of good levels severely limits the playability. The worst part of the AI is what I like to call the "Colorado Rockies Pitchers" syndrome, where if you get hit once, you get hit over and over again.  The second you get caught in the pack, it's over.  It's very common to get hit once with a red shell, then before you start again, get hit by a start, a green shell, a red shell, and hit by lightning, throwing you into last place.  It sucks. With all its faults, it's still darn fun and is pretty easy to pass all the levels.  Probably the best non-shooting multi-player game out there at this time. Pros: Good looking. Still fun. Cons: Cheap AI. The larger characters are not fun. Needs more battle levels. No power slide.	1
Mario Kart DD is a great game. The gameplay and variety in it are pretty good but average...Cmon they could have done better with this game! The graphics?...Great!  So slick and smooth.  Mario Kart Duble Dash is one GCN highest points of getting a gamecube. You get a choice of a few classic Nintendo characters...I.E Mario characters.  The level desighn is very good.  I have to give Nintendo credit for some of there actions towards this game.  Good job...If you like Double Dash then Get FZero GX... Gamecubes DD is another Nintendo hit and not a miss.....Get this game..If you don't have it then what are you waiting for! Graphics...5 Gameplay...4 Desighn...4/5 Overall 4/5..........	1
First off this is a Pretty fun game to play. At first I didn't like the idea of two characters riding in one kart but once I played my mind changed quickly. There are now different karts to chose from depending on waht characters you pick. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I thought the courses could have been better. The ones in MArio Kart 64 are better in my opinion, but there are still some pretty cool ones. Also if you beat all the cups on 150cc you can unlock a cup with all the races in it. So I would say get this game because it is fun and you will play it a lot.	1
The rumors were true:  Deus Ex was the greatest game ever to grace the video/computer game market.  Any attempt to follow up with a sequel would be an uphill battle.  In a way, Eidos succeeded.  Invisible War is slick sci-fi action RPG.  The graphics are a tremendous update from the original, and the levels and characters offer greater interaction.  The weapons are even more customizable, allowing you to turn a pistol into a silent glass-shattering tranq gun, or refit your Uzi to spew explosive shrapnel and use half the ammo. However, while some aspects of the gameplay have been enhanced, others have diminished.  Most notable is the storyline.  While Deus Ex put forth a clear struggle of establishment vs. freedom fighters vs. secret society, Invisible War basically has you choose sides between 4 power-hungry factions, with oddly similar ideologies.  There is no "for the good of the people" or "preserve the world" faction - in the end, you will be helping to put a single person or group of people in charge of the world. However, if you go into this game looking for just an enjoyable romp, and not something to top the original, you will be in for a treat.  Recommended for action enthusiasts and RPG fans.	1
I LOVED this game, this was one of my favorite games as a kid and I couldn't wait to get it for my kids to try it out.	1
I love this game so does my son and sister we are very satisfied to have gotten it and it works well and we are happy	1
I like the cast of characters, but they could have included characters like Kirby, Dixie Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and others whitch would be awesome!!! I wish they wouldn't have made Kirby Air Ride because Kirby would have been better on Mario Kart: Double Dash. But this game is great non the less, The tracks are short, thier isn't very many either just 12, and There arn't that many weapons!!!! I give this game 4 Stars!!!	1
Ok maybe it is a little close but it is sooo much fun. You play with two people one driving one hitting people. When you have two players on one kart it is awesome. I wish I could play it all night	1
. . . on the Nintendo 64. - Is there $50 worth of additions?  No. - Is there $50 worth of better graphics?  No. - Is there $50 worth of new characters?  No. - Is there $50 worth of new gameplay?  No. - Is two characters in one cart worth $50? No. - Is GC broadband compatibility worth $50? No. Face it, this game is not a sequel, it's an expansion pack.  Moreover, single player is no fun at all.  Has our society become so blind that we spend money on games that WE ALREADY HAVE all the while there are people in other countries who are STARVING?  I mean, give me a break, donate $50 to a worthwhile charity and play the N64 version for crying out loud.	-1
was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend & he loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.	1
we love all things mario and luigi this game is so much fun and we spend hours playing this so glad we found it	1
I've already reviewed "Super Mario Bros. 3" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the "Super Mario All-Stars" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on "Super Mario Bros. 3" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the "Super Mario Allstars" version).  We all know "Super Mario Bros. 3" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of "Super Mario Bros. 3".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of "Super Mario All-stars".  "SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing"  To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of "Super Mario Bros. 3" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.  Now, let's get to the problems of "Super Mario Advance 4", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.  e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of "Super Mario Bros. 3", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.  Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to "Super Mario Bros. 3", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, "World-e".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES "Super Mario Bros. 3" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?  No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card reader  So, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as "Super Mario Bros. 3" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in "Super Mario Bros. 3" style of "Super Mario Bros.".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to "Super Mario World" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.  Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in "Super Mario 3D Land", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, "Slidin' the Slopes", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.  Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the "New Super Mario Bros." series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.  In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.  For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, "Super Mario Advance 4" would be the definitive port of "Super Mario Bros. 3"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.  These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original "Super Mario Bros." had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.  In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!  Why oh why Nintendo???? . . ----- Released Levels Outside of Japan:  1.  Wild Ride in the Sky (Included with the game) (Japanese: Sky Athletics!) 2.

WHAT A DISAPPOINTING MESS.UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL, THIS GAME IS SO FRAGMENTED AND DISJOINTED  STORY LINE AND INTERACTIONS SUCK !!! I AM TEMPTED TO JUST CALMY WRAP IT UP AND PUT IT OUT TO PASTURE.EXCEPT FOR THE $50.00 I SPENT GAME JUST PLAIN STINKS, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. I HAD SUCH GREAT HOPES, THEY HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED. TOO BAD , GAME AND TITLE HAD SO MUCH PROMISE STICK TO THE ORIGINAL, IT WAS A "GREAT GAME"	-1
I really liked the first Deus Ex game, and so it hurts me to have this say this, but Deus Ex invisible war is one of the worst games I've played and one of the biggest computer game disapointments ever. It almost seems that the designers intentionally removed all of the good stuff from the first game. First, there is the way the game looks. I am not talking here about performance issues. I have a new computer with a 9800xt graphics card and 1 GB ram, and the game runs smoothly on my machine. The problem is that it just does not look very good. When you consider some of the amazing graphics that have been done in computer games in the last couple of years (Splinter Cell, for example, or even in budget titles like Devastation) it is hard for me to understand why this game looks so bad. Maybe part of it is the the artwork and design; the character animations look like weird cartoon figures. Also, the game areas are too small. Forget about the big, sprawling environments in DX. Here you will be constantly waiting for the next little area to load. Forget about the much-hyped physics; dead bodies flop around in a ridiculous way, and bumping into objects sends them spinning through space like Babe Ruth hitting one out of the park. The skill system, which made DX (and its predecessor System Shock) so awesome are gone. Why? The ability to customize your character and evolve through the course of the game was one of the most satisfying parts. You've probably already heard about the Universal Ammo thing, another serious design mistake IMO. The game is also quite short, and seems much shorter than the original. Also, without the various skill paths through the game, there is little replayability. Basically this is a textbook case of how to ruin a game sequel.	-1
Utter the words "Mario Kart" in a group of gamers, and you are likely to receive a reaction that can best be described as "awe." Why not? Mario Kart made appearances on three Nintendo since 1992, and each time they had been among the premiere games of their respective consoles. In 2003, Nintendo finally comes out with the Gamecube version of the legendary kart-racing series: Mario Kart: Double Dash!! And once again, Nintendo has a winner on their hands. Veterans of the Mario Kart series would feel right at home with the new Mario Kart game. The controls are generally the same. Even those new to Mario Kart would have no problems adapting to them. The biggest change to the Mario Kart formula is the appearance of what I call the "buddy system." Now, instead of one racer controlling the driving, you've got one person manning the wheel and another dropping the items. However, there's no difference whom you have driving and whom you have dropping. Unless you're playing Co-Op (more on that later), all you have to do is press Z and the characters would switch places. The only advantage this new system has is that it allows you to store items for later use. Another important addition to the game with the addition of the extra racer is the appearance of a new Co-Op mode. Now two players can combine to control one kart. One player drives while the other takes care of the items. One person Drifts while the other person does the Turbo. It may seem difficult to coordinate between two players, but the execution is quite excellent. All the various driving techniques make their reappearances in Double Dash!! Mini-Turbo Boosts are back and easier to perform. Boosts off the starting line are also back. The jump is gone, but seriously. Can you jump on a go-kart? The options in Double Dash contain old classics and new features. As was expected, Grand Prix, Versus, and Battle are back and better than ever. Unlike Mario Kart 64, which is easy to jump right into 150cc Grand Prix and capture first, or Mario Kart: Super Circuit, which has an astonishing jump in difficulty between 100cc and 150cc, Double Dash eases you into the Grand Prix. Gone are the days where the AI catches up almost immediately after you take care of them. Now you can easily build up a 10-second lead, or find yourself 10 seconds behind the computer. The former is the case in 50cc, which is easier than a walk in the park. The latter describes 150cc, which often become bitter battles for first place. For the first time ever, Double Dash features an All Cup Tour, which is an intense, 16-course marathon Grand Prix with all of the courses. This is just one of many unlockables present in the game. Other important unlockables include Special Cup, Mirror Mode, and two secret Battle stages. Of course, the most important aspect of Mario Kart is the courses. A kart racing game with bad courses are no fun to play. Thankfully, we don't have anything to worry about. The geniuses have supplied us with some of the most enjoyable courses ever to hit a racing game. Sure, there are some duds, but courses like D.K. Mountain are just pure delight. The problem comes with the Battle courses, which are excellent in their own right, but just seems like of lacking when compared to the courses of the past. (Tilt-a-Kart is cool, though.) The addition of two new battle modes makes up for the state of the courses. Shine Thief is like Oddball in Halo. There is a Shine on the course, and one player must take control of it for a combined 60 seconds. Bob-Omb Blast is just insane. Players chuck Bob-Ombs at each other for points. You gain a point if you hit somebody, and you lose a point if you get blown up. And for the traditionalists, theres the Balloon Match. While Nintendo refused to supply Mario Kart with online play, it does make use of the broadband adapter in LAN mode. It may be rather costly to connect to LAN, as two Gamecubes, two broadband adapters, and two copies of the game are needed in addition to a standard network cable. However, nothing can top the joys of 8-player Mario Kart, even the lack of a player-select. Graphically, the game is very similar to Super Mario Sunshine. The character models are detailed, and everything seems to have a sort of glossy, cel-shaded look. The game certainly is no Metroid Prime or even The Wind Waker in terms of graphics, but the visuals are definitely no slouch. The music of this game doesn't seem to be as good as the music in Mario Kart 64. However, they do fit the racing mood very well, and some of them are rather catchy. And its always great to hear the Mario Kart 64 Rainbow Road theme pop up in Double Dash. Sound Effects is where the game excels. There are 22 characters, and each of them has their own distinct voice samples. Even Daisy's "Hi! I'm Daisy!" line has its charms. The screeches of the karts are present but virtually unnoticeable in the heat of the race. All in all, Mario Kart: Double Dash may not be an epic to the scale of The Wind Waker or Prince of Persia, but with the best replay value in gaming since Super Smash Bros. Melee in 2001, Double Dash may very well be the best Gamecube game of 2003. It's never fun to fall from first to fourth following a cavalcade of shells, but you'll still find yourself wanting to play some more. Now that's power.	1
A must own. Unlike Super Mario Bros 2, this game was transferred to the GBA in a perfect way. No cons just pros.	1
Great game and all time classic. Updated slightly from the NES version, love in my GPA SP also recommend using a Gameboy Player for the Gamecube when at home instead of the version for the Gamecube.	1
I bought this for my nintendo gameboy. I used to play this game so much on my NES system as a kid that it was ridiculous lol. No one is as epic as Mario!	1
Although the job system and story are not as deep as the original PlayStation version, this game is still extremely fun and I have spent tons of time on it already. The combat is really satisfying and customizing your team can go a lot of ways. There's a high degree of replay ability. I would even say that the combat is more balanced than the original (e.g. There's no Calculator class or T.G. Cid that just destroys everything single-handedly). The introduction of new races is nice and helps to diversify the jobs; that is, there are less jobs per race than the original, but with 5 races, it about evens out.  If you're a fan of the original I very highly recommend you check this out.	1
Great game and reasonably priced unlike its playstation counterpart	1
Love this version of tactics.	1
When I heard a new Mario Kart game was coming out, I was obviously thrilled.  But when I found out about the 2 characters in one kart thing, I began to hesitate on whether I should get the game or not.  I decided I might as well give it a try, and I am very gald I got it.  The 2 character system isn't bad at all, with the new characters in the game (plus 4 hidden characters), I think 9 more characters total than in Mario Kart 64.  At first you start with 3 grand prix, 4 races per grand prix, but you can unlock another one early in the game, and then a second one with a twist, as well.  Don't expect a big dissapointment just because of one added feature, this game is a definitely good game.	1
This game is the probably the best Mario Kart game in the series.  Obviously, unlike the other Mario Kart games, you can have two people racing in one kart.  This is a great feature for people who have siblings who sometimes want to team up and win things usually only available in One-Player Mode.  The unlocks include new karts, tracks, characters, modes, arenas, etc.  The battle games and arenas are pretty fun but I still miss the classic Block City from Nintendo 64's Mario Kart.  This is a great Single a Multiplayer game.  I recommend this to anyone ready for fun.	1
....but this game does have a few flaws that put it a little below Mario Kart 64. First, the good:  The track design is *amazing* and greatly improved from Kart 64.  The track in Wario Coliseum is impossibly twisted, and DK Mountain, the best track, has a cannon to shoot you to the top of the mountain, and you fly back down.  I also liked Baby Park for its simplicity - it's just an oval, but it's so small that you're constantly switching places with your friends, and there are weapons ricocheting everywhere during the seven (!) laps. Some of the other tracks have interesting premises (Daisy Cruiser, which is set on a cruise ship), but they're not quite as fun as they should be.  Other tracks are blatant rip-offs of the previous games... we get yet another rainbow track, Bowser's castle, a dirt-bike track, a jungle, a beach, a desert, etc.  How about switching things up a little?  How about a track on the moon, or a roller coaster, or a funhouse, or in a level from another Mario game?  See how easy that is, Nintendo? One thing about the tracks I do appreciate is that many of them have "zippers" that give you a boost of speed.  Only a couple of tracks in the last version had these. The two-characters-to-a-cart aspect works well... you can hold two weapons and switch depending on which one you need.  Although it's quite hard to reach the Z-button to switch characters while you're playing.  I also think the slide technique is not as effective in this game as it was last time.  Neither are some of the weapons.  The new bomb would be an excellent weapon; unfortunately, when you toss it forward, it always explodes when you're right next to it.  You should be immune to your own bombs. The new special, character-specific weapons are great, and the giant banana peel is hilarious.  I find it very annoying that you can't tap the brake after you hit a banana peel to stop from spinning out, as you could in the last game.  I like having a choice of many cars, as well. Some players will be angry that they cannot access four of the tracks until they pass the final level on the medium difficulty.  This is not an easy thing to do; I'm a veteran Nintendo player and it took me about a dozen tries before I could do it.  Although I do like the new point system for the tournaments that gives even the 7th-place finisher a point. The battle modes, which some people consider the heart of the Kart games, did disappoint me.  They aren't the slightest bit creative or interesting like the main tracks, and the variations are kinda stupid.  Amazing that the battle mode keeps getting less fun the more advance the graphics get in these games... or is it that it's just played out?  Nah, I don't think so. Overall, this is a great game, with outstanding graphics, fun sound effects and music and great replayability, especially with multiple players.  But when you're making a sequel to some of the most popular video games of all time, you've gotta be perfect.... at least to get my five-star rating. ;)	1
his game is one of those games that you will keep playing until the next line of consoles come out. This game is hectic one player and even more hectic if you bring friends over. There is the engine size like in all MK games (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc.) the higher the CC the faster you go and the harder the AI is. after choosing your cc you get to choose your characters and your kart. You get two characters per kart each charaacter with a special item (baby mario gets chain chomp, DK gets big banana, etc.). after choosing your characters from the list of 16+ you choose your kart. The karts are sorted by weight class (light, medium, heavy). your characters determine what weight class you are in, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. after that you choose between 4 cups (mushroom, flower, star, and special) each with 4 tracks in them. by getting golds in the cups you unlock new content like extra battle tracks and characters. speaking of battle this is one of the best parts. get your friends together and blow them up in one of three battle types (shine thief, bob-omb blast, and classic balloon battle). in shine thief you want to take control of the shine until the timer reaches zero, get the shine by hitting them with shells, banana peel, or whatever else. in bob-omb blast every question mark block is a bomb and you blow each other up first to 3 or 4 hits wins. In balloon battle you have three balloons and the last one with any balloons wins. Knock your friends out by shooting them with shells to make their balloons fly away. All in all i think this game is one of the best on the gamecube and i recomend it to all gamecube owners.	1
The graphics in this game aren't all that much of an improvement, but the game is incredibly choppy. Did Eidos use the UT2003 enging? I doubt it. I'm saving up to buy the GeForce FX 5700 Ultra, so Deus Ex 2 had better not be choppy at all. I've got a fast pc with a gig of PC3200 ram, so when I buy and install the 5700 Ultra, I'd better see 30 fps or more, or there is something seriously wrong with this game's engine.	-1
Obviously released prematurely for Xmas, this game has more bugs and glitches than any game I've ever even heard of.  The patch does nothing to fix any problems and when asked, the developers on the eidos website give answers that are borderline rude.  A definite slap in the face to all gamers.  It breaks my heart to think about how many kids unwrapped this Xmas morning to find that their game doesn't work because the eidos quarterly report might have suffered had they put a few more weeks into this pseudo software.	-1
Came in okay condition, not perfect. I had try a couple times to make it start but when it did i had no problems. Plus it worked fine afterwards.	1
This is the most addictive game I've played since disgea love it the endless hours of fighting and questing it's simply amazing what they could put into such a small game simply beats ffta2 in my opinion I recommend highly both games	1
Great game lots of fun. My only complaint is how easy it is	1
Great game	1
this game is terrible did Nintendo hire George Lopez to make a flying Mario game but he was drunk do not get this extermly horrible game!	-1
Super Mario Bros 3 is often considered to be the greatest game on the NES and as the best Mario game of all time (Although I prefer Mario World).  This GBA version includes more than what meets the eye. The differences between this and the original are:  -Closer camera view (Something I forgot to mention in my Mario Advance 1 review) for the GBA -Small color differences (Not including lighter palliate) -Voices -Get to play as an updated Luigi -Level select after beating the game once. Just press B on the map -The updated version of Mario Bros carried over from the first Super Mario Advance  The best difference is the fact that you get to use the e-reader GBA add-on to be able to unlock/use all-new levels and power-ups. Heck, you can even use the cape from Super Mario World! The levels you can unlock are full of fan-appealing Mario goodness. You can throw veggies, like in SMB2, against enemies from Mario World! If you're lucky, you can find a card that lets you play the first level from the original Super Mario Bros! There's a lot more awesomeness coming your way. You just gotta buy cards.  Like I said just now, this game also includes the GBA version of Mario Bros, where you actually get to run, throw Pow blocks, and play as the Mario from Super Mario 2.  The multiplayer modes are also present. You can play with or against a friend, collecting 5 coins, or just sabotaging him/her.	1
Do I even need to give this game an introduction? When Super Mario Bros. 3 came out, it blew everyone away. The first two Mario games were great, but Mario 3 did everything those games did, and took it to another level. World maps, bonus stages, hidden areas, the ability to fly(!), and much more. I remember being a little kid when it came out and wondering how any game could top it. All these years later, I got this GBA version for my daughter, who's already into the Mario games at just 3 years old. What's funny is that, eventhough I got to replay the game on the SNES with Super Mario All-Stars, and  played it until I sold my SNES a few years ago, playing this version really took me back to the good ol' days of the early 90s. I won't be biased in this review- I try to be fair on everything, and point out flaws when they're there. But really, Super Mario Bros. 3 barely has anything wrong with it, and this GBA port just might be the best iteration of the game so far.  Basic Mario premise- you play as Mario (or Luigi) and save the princess from Bowser, traveling through a wide range of worlds in the process. You'll run, jump, fireball and tail smack your way through the stages while collecting coins and taking out the bad guys. Located on the world map are mushroom houses that let you take a quick break from the action and get a random power up. Where the first Super Mario Bros. only had the mushroom, fire flower and star, you get much more here. Those original 3 are back, as well as a leaf that gives you raccoon ears and a tail (allowing you to fly and smack enemies with a spin attack), a tanuki suit (a souped up raccoon costume that also lets you turn into a statue for a few seconds, giving you invincibility), a frog suit to maneuver in the water easier, and a Hammer Bros. costume, which protects you from fireballs (on your back) and lets you throw hammers that take out damn-near any enemy. And yet, there's more. One level gives you a giant green boot to hop around in, and you can also get cool power ups for the map, like a hammer that can take out rocks that block shortcuts, and a cloud that lets you skip a level. You can store a lot of these in a menu on the map screen, and select which one you want to use going into a level or right then and there if it's the cloud/hammer.  Fortunately, after 20 years since the original version, I can enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3. I was surprised by the number of times I'd die in certain stages, thinking that everything would be a piece of cake since I played it so many times over the years. Nope! I felt like a kid again when a couple of quick enemies would be coming right for me, while I panicked looking for a power up so I wouldn't die with one hit. And trying to remember how to get the special flying ship levels without looking it up online was a fun challenge. Trust me when I say that I'm not a Nintendo fanboy (far from it), but I can't think of anyone who's hated this game. It's a fun platformer for everyone, and tons of people still try to set world records for speed runs and maxing out the score. Did Nintendo create a timeless classic with this? I think so.  But what about the GBA additions? Well, it's not as bad as the additions to the Super Mario World port, but I still could've done without them. The graphics are enhanced a little bit from the Super Mario All-Stars version. I noticed some new background effects here and there. There are also some added in sound effects, like one when Mario slides down a hill. These are cool, but my problem lies with the added voices. Yep, Mario now says things like "Lucky!" and "oh-ah no!". Thanks a lot Nintendo. Then there's the change they made to Luigi once again. Yeah, he does his weird jump, and lands faster than Mario for some reason. Somehow, Nintendo didn't make the jump as good as it was in Mario Bros. 2, so playing as him is more of a challenge than anything this time. But I can't give them too much of a hard time since the music and sound effects sound perfect. No fuzziness like Super Mario World got- everything here sounds perfectly clear. They also included the original Mario Bros. arcade game, yet again, making this the 4th time it's appeared on the GBA.  What are you waiting for? Anyone who wants to play a classic should pick this up immediately. And if you were disappointed with New Super Mario Bros. for the DS, go on and relive the days when you didn't get 5 1-ups in a level for barely doing anything. This is old school platforming at its finest.	1
In 1990 Nintendo released "Super Mario Bros. 3" for the original NES system, and it was hailed as the most commercially successful video game of its time.  In 2003, a remake was translated from the Super NES title "Mario All-Stars" to the Game Boy Advance's "Mario Advance" series and it still sells at GameStop for $25.  I shelled out half as much for a copy elsewhere and I never looked back.  Aside from the fact that you don't have to beat the game in one sitting with what is otherwise a limited power source, you can win power-ups from minigames before you play through a level.  As with every Mario Advance title, SMA4 includes a remake of the classic Mario Bros. arcade game.  New copies of the game also include special 'level cards' with bonus content for use with Nintendo's short-lived e-Reader device.  While this captures the look and feel of the original SMB3 game, it's not a completely faithful remake; the music's that made me dance along as a kid is slightly toned down.  Otherwise, the updated graphics are pleasing to the eye, the gameplay still excites (and frustrates) the player and the added voiceovers are "just what I needed."  This game is rated E for Everyone: Violence.	1
The people at Nintendo have really outdone themselves this time.  I have always been a big fan of the Mario Kart series, and each release has been better than the last.  This is no exception.  Mario Kart Double Dash includes all of the classic elements that made the Super NES and N64 versions so much fun--wacky cast of characters, cool weapons, intense battle mode, very enjoyable Grand Prix mode--and yet manages to improve in almost every aspect of the game. The new Karts, which hold two people, are a great new feature.  Not only does this allow two players to team up together, it also allows four people to play in Grand Prix mode, something that was not available on the N64.  In addition, each character has a unique weapon, which adds variety to the game.  With many characters to choose from, and a large assortment of unlockable karts, levels, and characters, Mario Kart Double Dash also has a greater potential for extended game play than any of its predecessors. The graphics are stunning, and the commentary by the characters enjoyable.  It is entertaining to work on various combinations of characters, and try to pick out a kart suited for them.  The game is difficult, but not so difficult that you have to dedicate your life to playing it.  As always, the battle mode contains unlimited possibilities in the way of kart mayhem. In short, this is an excellent game, worthwhile in every way. With this game, Nintendo continues its tradition of excellent, unique games, and provides yet one more reason why the GameCube is a great choice for a system.	1
This game is really good but the battle game stages suck. In Mariokart64 the battle stages are 10times better then the ones on Double Dash!! but the over all race tracks are better. I would suggest buying "MARIO KART:DOUBLE DASH!!" and buying "MARIO KART 64".	1
Ok I just want to let you people know that in terms of gameplay, this is kart racing at its best. But the most important part of any racing game by far in my opinion is the tracks you have to race on. They have to be interesting and well designed. The tracks are what made MK64 so fun, they were well designed, long, creative, etc.... I expected a LOT better from Double dash. Theres probably about a total of 4 or 5 decent tracks in this game. Not very impressive! Very few shortcuts, boring design, nothing special at all. And as far as the 2 riders idea, its so overhyped its rediculous. Ok, so instead of seeing a banana peel flying from your cart..... um... you see another character throwing it? Each player has their own special item, but that doesnt really matter, its pretty much choosing which special weapon you like best. And switching drivers and riders in mid-race does absolutely nothing. I just wanted to warn the people who like awesome tracks in their racing games, and that this 2 rider idea adds nearly nothing to the game at all. Big stepdown from Mario Kart 64.	1
Mario Kart DD is absolutely awesome! I have to admit that I was a little hesitant about liking two riders for each kart. After only about a minute or less I was absolutely hooked on Mario Kart AGAIN! DD is in my opinion the best kart since SMK on the SNES. I have been a huge Kart fan my entire life since they came out. Double Dash is so incredibly fun that any fan of the other Kart games should simply go out and buy this game! It really is that good! Don't bother renting it first, JUST BUY IT!!!! It's sooo worth it!	1
This is a warning to people who have not bought this game! It does not support any of the nVidia MX vidio cards.	-1
This game has merits that make it worth playing, but it's still vastly inferior to the first game (Which I gave five stars).  This game has a lot of good ideas, but they are largely negated by some really bad design decisions. There are two HUGE faults that keep this from being a great game.  First: the role-playing system is bad.  Plain and simple.  It's not very useful, flexible, robust, or strategic.  The skills system that helped make the first game so great is gone, and that was a huge mistake.  The replacement, a carved up biomod system and a weak weapons mod system, requires little planning or thought.  There are only five biomod slots now, and the weapons mod system is cheap and underpowered.  The system in the first game was so wonderful, because it was loaded with choices and tradeoffs.  You could spend your skills system to become a tank, a hacker, a ninja, a frogman, or any combination that you wanted.  It's nonexistent here.  There is no sense of power development like what you get in a good RPG, where you start off as a complete wimp and end up the game as a demigod.  That is why "Deus Ex: Invisible War" is very shallow as an RPG. The other major fault of this game is the size of the maps.  They are ridiculously tiny.  Most of the areas are tight, indoor cramped spaces.  You have to get to the end of the game before you encounter any big open outdoor areas.  Exploring an area to find the alternate "secret" entrance to a well-guarded facility is laughably easy.  Part of the fun of the first game was wandering around the huge open maps and maybe sneaking into a huge building through the roof.  In this game, the front door and the air vent that takes you around it are only five feet away.  What's the point?  Small maps also mean frequent (and long) loading times. One welcome change from the first game is a big improvement in the voice acting.  Both the male and female Alex voice actors sound very good.  Except for voice acting though, the rest of the sound in this game takes a big step backwards.  Alex Brandon's music is scaled way back.  Forget about hearing another great soundtrack like the first game.  The weapons sound like toys, and the noises in the game don't do a good job of letting you know how stealthy are your being.  That's part of stealth just not being very useful in this game.  The riot prod is useless and the tranquilizer dart gun takes two shots now instead of one to take down an enemy.  Silent takedowns are too hard, but you don't need them anyways, since most enemies aren't much of a threat to you.  You can take most of them out easily with the overpowered sniper rifle. Deus Ex: Invisible War has some saving graces that make it worth playing.  The storyline is still excellent.  I think that it would have helped to make the game longer and give it more character development, but it's still great.  The story has one or two very surprising twists in it, and it gets you to think philosophically, just like the first one.  It all makes for a good legitimate sequel story, instead of just a thrown-together rehash of the first one (which is common for sequels).  Warning:  if you did not play the first game, then you will be totally lost, since the plot for "Invisible War" is pretty convoluted too. The developers had some good creative ideas too.  Some of the "black market" biomod canisters that you find are wicked, like one that lets you control bots, and one that imparts EMP to your melee attacks.  The rocket launcher has a guided missile mode that puts you into the first-person view of the missile.  I also got a lot of amusement out of the NG Resonance character, a holographic AI that provides some comic relief, as well as some hints and side quests.  And, even with the scaled-back role-playing system, "Invisible" still has tons of good dialog and lots of open-ended problem-solving.  Plus, there's nothing else like it out there as far as action/RPG games go.  It's too bad though, that there was so much removed for this game.  If it had been a full-fledged sequel instead of "Deus Ex Lite", then it could have been as good as the first one.  I would love to see a third Deus Ex game that combines the best elements of the first two.	1
My son loved this.	1
im sorry i bought this awhile back im happy with my purchase i didn't mean to take so long to review. i would buy from t/his user again.	1
I absolutely love it. The game is in perfect condition, the label in like new and the game saves wonderfully.	1
Gameplay-wise, FFTA is superior to it's predecessor Final Fantasy Tactics.  While the story is less sophisticated, it makes up for it with tight controls and addictive game play.  This game adds in five races to choose from, each with a slightly different selection of jobs.  Lots of jobs a short bite-sized missions makes this a good title to play for a few min, or a few hours.  I've logged two 100+ hour games of FFTA and expect to play again soon.	1
this game was amazing i had fun with it. my bro who hates mario games even got into it! i mean it was just so fun like grand preix mode was the best. im already on the all cup tour! anyway this game is the greatest and you will be satistfied!	1
You know what's hard to come by these days? A game that you play when you feel like playing games. Sometimes you'll be sitting in your room, and you wanna kick back and enjoy a game. You think you'll play one game, nope, you've beat it. You decide on another, no your stuck on it. You decided to play this one! Now there ya go. This game just can't get old, especially in multiplayer, and much like SSX or Super Smash Brothers, you can play it anytime just because it's fun, not really challenging, just good ol' fun. You would think that the controls are confusing, but they aren't, and unlocking new karts gives the game good replay value. Needless to say, Nintendo did it right this time, and they are keeping on a great franchise that I hope exists for a long time!	1
nintendo does it again with the best mario kart game so far. ride with your friends or against our friends in an extreme co-op mode and an awesome versus arena. youll get fustrated and want to quit, but will stay sucked in by will to win, i did it you can too	1
Known for its elegance in go-kart racing, the Mario Kart video game line has a new addition that will not disappoint gamers.  Picking up in the 3D racing world, where Mario Kart 64 left off, Mario Kart: Double Dash!! takes the Nintendo-related racing world to a new level.  The beauties of this game come on several different levels. Primarily, the action in this game is much faster paced.  With the addition of queued items, player-dependent item bias, and a few new items/item ideas, the opponent-verses-opponent aspect of this game is more intense than in previous Mario Kart games.  Additionally, allowing players to assist each other by splitting the responsibilities of driver and item user makes multiplayer more interesting and alive, creating a very friendly team-oriented race.  Finally, as with the previous Mario Kart games, Double Dash is friendly overall and isn't anything more than cartoonishly violent, making it a nice family gaming experience! Overall, I must give Mario Kart: Double Dash!! 5 stars for its overall appeal to all players and its fast-paced action.  I definitely recommend it to any old-school Mario Kart players as well anyone interested in racing with your favorite Nintendo Characters.	1
The concept of racing games always grabs the attention of everyone, even those who have never played on a game console.  Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) not only grabs you, but also hooks you with its ingenous racetracks, colorful and funny karts and their favorite trademark characters. This game is one of the few to take advantage of the broadband adapter (sold separately).  The broadband setup allows up to 8 players to play simultaneously using 8 separate TVs and consoles (requires an 8-port hub with patch cables), or 8 players on 2 TVs(4 players per TV) using 2 consoles (requires only a cross over cable to connect the 2 consoles).  These kind of setups are fantastic for a LAN party or even a MKDD tournament. Racing in this game is now a cooperative effort, there's the driver and the thrower on the same kart.  Characters are classified as light(e.g. Baby Luigi), medium (e.g. Yoshi) or heavy(e.g. Bowser). There are also three (3) corresponding kart types.  Any combination of driver/thrower is possible but they can ride only on a kart as big as the heaviest character in the pair.  Light karts accelerate fast, but are weak when colliding against heavier karts, and they don't have great top speeds. Heavy karts accelerate slowly, but they are strong and have the highest top speeds.  This character/kart combination allows the player to experiment and find the best pair for him/her. The main event is the grand prix competition.  In this event you race against human and/or computer opponents trying to reach the goal first not only with speed but by using your wits.  Special items such as banana peels or green shells, among others, are scattered all over the tracks for you to pick up.  Each item gives you a strategic advantage that if used wisely can make a difference at the end of the race. Apart from the grand prix competition there are also other race modes such as time trials (to measure how fast you finish a track), versus (race against human players only) and battle, which also has its own variations.  These game modes combined with multiplayer capabilities makes this game entertaining for a long period. How many character are there to choose? Well, there are 16, but who knows if there is some kind of code to unlock others. How many karts? There are 8, but you unlock others as you start winning grand prix tournaments. If you want clean, fun entertainment for the whole family then this one is a winner.	1
This is a GREAT game! It is incredibly fun! It has great graphics, sound and simple game play. The controls are easy to remember, and your car "sticks" to the track. Addictive and exciting! Buy!	1
this is one of the funnist game for game cube. its not really fun with one person. its fun if you have like 2 or more people, i like those games where you could beat the game with two people. there fun. this game you could hit people when your driving. i cant remember if there is  any new weapons. the levels are really fun too. it doesnt really match the old mario kart for super nitendo. i don't know about the sixty-four one but its still a great game. there are new characters too, like toad and his wife and you could pick your car too thats d coolest. well not the coolest but its still cool	1
I have had this game before, but it was a long time ago and I never got much of a chance to play it. Now that I have little else to do and am traveling some,I can say that this game is a great distraction for long bus rides.  Story line 5/5 The games story is semi-predictable, and childish. despite this, the story rings true of the FF series.  Game play 5/5 The First thing you do is go through a small tutorial, and learn the simple yet in depth system behind the game. With the addition of the Law system you can truly be unstoppable.  Graphics 5/5 Consider that this is a GBA game, then think back to Final Fantasy 6. you have similar graphics, if not better. The color scheme is pretty interesting.  Sound: 4/5 The sound track is good, but small. the repetitive battle theme may get on some peoples nerves.	1
For those who luv final fantasy and tactics this is a must buy!!  I can't stress this enough.  The story is facsinatinf the gameplay is well done and the characters are forever rememerable. great experience!!!!	1
This game is so cool! This game will keep you entertained with all the modes and characters to choose from.  I'ts nonstop action weather your playing alone or with friends.  Mario fans will enjoy this game so much.  I know this because i am one myself.  When I got it (the day it came out) i played all day nonstop.  This game is number 1 on my favorites list. You will enloy all the unlockables challenges in store. This game brings kart racing to a whole new level!!!	1
Playing Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo was great. Mario Kart 64 was hella better. Mario Kart Double Dash takes the game to a whole new level. This game is somewhat in the vein of Super Smash Bros. Melee in the sense that there is plenty to unlock this time around. Also, the adding of a passenger is a nice touch, since it gives the game a deeper feel. You actually have to really consider who you pick, because everyone has their own strengths, and special items. IGN originally trashed the game because they thought the demo was too slow. That's not the case here. All of the courses are really tight, but I remind you that this is not just a single-player game. This was made with multiplayer purposes in mind, case in point, the LAN support. It never gets dull with at least one other person around. Overall, I loved it. It manages to retain the feel of the previous games without sacrificing too much. It may take a little time to get used to this new feel, but I assure you, this game just plain rocks!	1
It is just so amazing when it really comes to video games these days. When I decided to purchase a new video game system, I had a very difficult time in knowing which system to buy. I could've bought the Xbox or Playstation 2, largely because of the value of games they've each came up with. Instead, I felt it was a wiser move to purchase the Gamecube from Nintendo. I think it was a much wiser mover, because it was easier to drag around, and because of the games that were available for it. One of them, really reminds me so well of a classic. Mario Kart has been considered as one of the Top 5 racing games of all time, accoriding to the Nickelodeon GAS show Play 2 Z. When I got to play this one, I thought it was much fiercer than ever before. Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, is the first Mario Kart release to really have a massive impact, since Mario Kart 64 back in 1997. The game takes on a true new light, as not one, but 2 different characters range with special weapons, and much more difficult tracks than the previous Mario Kart. The graphics really stand out on all the tracks as a premium that Gamecube has brought for about the past few years, and the game has more than ever. The game has the exact same number of courses and surprises that was in the previous one, but the oponents are tougher and make your road to #1 a lot harder. I also have to admit, the idea of swapping the team during the middle of the race also makes the pace a lot harder to go around, and the carts are definitely cute to fierce, depending on the status of your driving. I also like the idea of the internet device that can be used to add to the mayhem of Mario Kart. It just makes the game a lot more exciting, considering that just came out recently too. The game stands out a whole lot more than other racers at this time, largely because other racing games are exactly just the same these days. This is the very first game I've ever purchased for the Gamecube, since I bought the game system just recently too. I don't know how many people may enjoy the new Mario Kart: Double Dash!! as much as I am. Whatever the case is, Nintendo should really consider making a sequel very, very soon. This race cannot be stopped.	1
I'm sure, like many of the reviewers here, my first introduction to this game was on a TV screen with the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It is as much fun now as it was then.  To those experiencing this game for the first time, (and I know this may make me sound old) you had to be there.  At the time, this was the best there was.  That may not sound like much now, but you will be saying that yourself in 10 to 15 years about your favorite game that is in retro like this one.  While this is not as fun as the "original" Super Mario Brothers, this is still a good play. A couple reviewers have stated this is a "hard" game.  Um, the game is not supposed to be easy.  It is supposed to challenge you.  Deal with it.  For me, half the fun is working to beat it.  I've had the GBA version of the game for all of 48 hours now, am currently on World 2, and have lost many lives, but am having the time of my life.  Yes, some of it is the nostalgia factor, but more of it is the fact that I never actually beat the game when I was younger.  So the game shall be beat and the game will like it. As far as I remember, this is the same as the NES with maybe slight revisions to the background.  LOL I can't check it out because my NES doesn't work anymore. :-(  But if you are into straight-forward gaming, or just want a good old-school game, pick this up and enjoy.	1
Considering the Super Mario Brothers series is widely regarded as one of the best video game franchises ever, the fact that many long time Mario fans call this their favorite Super Mario game should be enough to convince you to try this game.  Super Mario Brothers 3 took the fantastic gameplay elements of the original Super Mario Brothers and improved upon them in many ways.  Several new powerups were added to compliment the mushroom, flower, and star.  These come in the form of 'suits,' and give Mario an array of abilities and forms.  The Raccoon suit, for example, allows Mario to fly, the Tanooki suit lets him turn to stone for a few seconds, and the Hammer Brothers suit allows him to, well, throw hammers.  This is one of the reasons this game remains so popular today--most of the suits are unique to this game, and they're all a lot of fun.  This game also features an overworld map with several stages per "world."  Instead of being simply linear like the original Super Mario Bros, players have some choices in the order they play the stages.  There are also bonus squares on the map, which have little mini games that offer powerups (which you can store and use later).  The game allows you to save after passing an airship or a fortress, but this version of it also allows you to save at any point (though you can only continue once from that location) if you have to interrupt play in between save points.  The Game Boy Advance version of Super Mario 3 (which they call Super Mario Advance 4) is a pretty faithful port of the original game.  The graphics and gameplay are essentially the same, which causes fans of the original (like me) to breathe a sigh of relief.  The original soundtrack to the game, which was excellent, remains intact, although Mario's voice (the one that started popping up around the time of Mario 64) pops up from time to time.  Apparently this bothers some people, but I don't find it intrusive or something that hinders the experience.  The game also includes a version of classic Mario Brothers which can be played by up to 4 people.  While I would have preferred to get this on my Wii's virtual console, the idea that I now have a portable version of Super Mario 3 to take with me on the go is pretty exciting.  The price tag may seem a little steep to some, but I consider it worth every penny (even though I have the original NES version).  I'd definitely recommend this title, regardless of if you're a fan of retro video games or if you're a relative newcomer to the Mario series of games.  This game is every bit as fun as it was when it first appeared many years ago.	1
I love this game.. my 9 yr old daughter wanted this game too, she likes it so i bought it.. it's not so easy for her but she likes to try anyway.  Other games she has are:  pacman (loves it!) sonic-sega version (loves it!) dogz (cute game/VERY cartoony - but she loves it! I like it too.) tetris (likes it) ant bully (she says it's ok) strawberry shortcake (says it's a bit hard) the sims2 pets (i like, but she doesn't get what she's supposed to do)	1
I played this game for hours on end when I was younger. Its a great game but the controls are hard to get use to. I did enjoy the extra Mario Brothers game as well. Fun if you enjoy the orignal, just watch out for controls.	1
Did you guys notice that they have the game with the bounus disk as a sepearte item than just the game by itself.  I recommend ordering it with the bonus disk. Anyway, this game should be awsome.  Based on the prevoius 3 Mario Kart games, the series is awesome.  The first was one of the most popular games on the Super Nintendo.  The second was an early Nintendo 64 game and the third came out on Gameboy Advance a couple of years ago.  This is the first time they made a big chance to the karts themselves having two riders in each cart instead of just one.	1
This game is the best Mario Kart in the series. From its colorful 3D graphics to its awsome multi player features. This game's got all you want in a racing game. The biggest change is that you can have 2 players in a kart at the same time and choose the car you want. Each pair of players has a special item that only the two of them can use like Yoshi and Birdo's egg or Baby Mario and Baby Luigi's giant chain chomp. The characters that you can use are as follows:Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Birdo, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Koopa, Paratroopa, Bowser, Bowser Jr., Wario, Waluigi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong and the unlockables:Toad, Toadette, King Boo and Petey Piranah. One of the coolest new features is the unlockables. You can unlock different coarses, characters and cars. This adds a brand new twist to the series. The coarses are amazing. Travel through sandy beaches,dry deserts,rainforests and a lot more. Beautiful 3d graphics create the awsome scenery.	1
You wanna know why this will be better than all the previous mario karts....well first off you aren't just one character...you play as 2 and you have to mix and match for the best possible duo to go against the rest of the racers....another thing that im looking forward too are the new characters....this is a must pick up for any of your mario kart fans....this will add a whole new dimension to the mario kart game im really looking forward to the game. Robert	1
Mario Kart: Double Dash is going to be REALLY TOTAL AWESOME game to play on the Nintendo GameCube I give it 5 Stars "Highly Recommended" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY AND PLAY this game on the NINTENDO GAMECUBE ***THIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME TO BUY AND PLAY***	1
Perfect for those final fantasy fans. Comes as described a perfect gift for gamers. fun for everyone and very challenging.	1
Yes it is superior for many reasons, before you get all mad at me for saying that hear me out. The original FFT remains as one of the best tactic games out there, so y is this superior? simple it took the formula that made the original one so great and improved it. Its challenging addicting and has qualities like the original, except for the story now this is where u either hated or loved it. Personally, i loved it simply because all i remenber from the original FFT was a poilitical mess that involved the church priest and nobles, if it wasn't about that it was about stones that granted great power, or someone getting kidnapped or needing help in every part of the game,  i have to be honest that story didn't interested me at the least. this one however is different yes its more kid friendly but thats wht makes it better it doesnt try to be some epic medieval times story or some tales of knights and demons this one is plain and simple ur stuck in a foreign world and u want to go back to ur own simple of course theres much much more to it than that but its such a better choice of storyline for this type of game, this is a strategy game chances are ull spend so much time grinding than when u go back to the story u won't know whts happening his games doesnt suffer in that regard like the original did. As said before it improved in things like the job system adding new races that hav exclusivility to certain jobs and such. This is as good as it was and even better the more family friendly and more friendly interface just makes the game more .....fun. and thats what a game should be fun and not some political mess of a story, before u start hating on me for dissing ur fav game let me tell ut ht the original fft its still my fav tactics game of all time BUT i admit when a game is better and this games id in fact superior.	1
Came as described and sooner than it was supposed ! Most def will buy from this seller again ;) Hard game tho - but fun	1
Have you ever wanted a ninty-hour-long ultra-addicting role-playing-game for the GBA? Then this game is perfect. The story is one of the most beautiful, brilliantly written story ever. It is toutching, epic, in simple terms it is perfect for almost anybods, save for the romance nuts.   Gameplay is deep and enjoyable. You can play almost any technique to some efficency, you can muscle through most situations and think you way out of any and all bad prediciments.   There is no vioce acting, GBA has limits, but the music is exceptional,, I can't really tell but it sounds like they used a full orchistra, the music was nailed. Epic and big, I guess, for big fight sceans, slow and eery for those sceans when you alone in the woods, and kinda depressing when... someone special abandons you, again.   It is a brilliant game almost completly, the only thing that bugs me is that you have to name you lead charicter(Marche) who is not supposed to be called anything other than Marche, and that you can't rename you other charicters. That and the length, I got through the storyline in a little less than 30 hours, some kinda record, and I'm guessing it's gonna take around ninty seeing as how I'm around half way to 100% and almost sixty hours in.   But a game this awesome lasting a hundred hours, you don't see this that much anymore, The anime style artwork pushed the GBA to it's limits and will rival some of the PS3 games.   If your attention span is long enough and you can grasp the core gameplay this game is 100% worth it, perfect score.	1
This game is very different from Final Fantasy Tactics, for better or worse.  It's more forgiving (most of the time) when characters "die" in battle. The ability system also has more in common w/ Final Fantasy IX's ability system than with Final Fantasy Tactics' ability system.  I could go on w/ the changes, but I'll let the players find out for themselves.  It's really fun though, despite the changes.  Newbies will enjoy it too since it has NOTHING to do w/ the original Final Fantasy Tactics either.  Highly recommended.	1
I'm in love with Mario, and I have a major crush on the Luiginator.  I just love these guys, and I'm as straight as a Priest in Sunday School.  If you haven't played this franchise in some time, or even if you're new to Mario's world, then welcome to FUN!  Enjoy!  And when you're through with this game, enjoy this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yoshi-s-Island-Super-Mario-Advance-3/dp/B00006FWTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3</a>&nbsp;You'll thank me later!

I'm so glad they reissued this game on Gameboy Advance. I've owned this game in many formats, origonally on Nintendo. Then it was on the compilation of Super Mario called "Super Mario All Stars" on SNES. Now we have this on Gameboy Advance. Pretty much everybody has said all the great things about this game. It's still fun to play. Mario's super powers are awesome (racoon tail, frog suit, fire flower, etc.). Some of the levels are still difficult for me to beat, but it's always been like that for me.  There are a few things I didn't like. Ever since Nintendo as well as Mario have evolved, he's becomming a little more involved in the game. Now they have him talking in this game. That's not necessarly a bad thing, but if you had this game on Nintendo or even Super Nintendo, you would remember he didn't say a word. Here, he talks, like for example: when he dies, he say "Oh! Mama mia!" Or when you enter into a level, he says "Letsago!". I for one wish they didn't add that in this game.  Also this game comes with the arcade Super Mario game. Thats the game where you have two players, and those enemies come out of pipes and you have to hit the blocks under them to flip them over and kick them off the screen. It's kind of fun, although they modified it a little bit. Both games are fun to play, and I highly recommend this game to any gamer out there. This is one of the classic Nintendo games ever created.	1
I never thought I'd have to post a bad review of a game in the Final Fantasy franchise, but here goes.  I don't know what the game designers were thinking with this. The "plot" is virtually non-existant. The game is basically a series of battles. There are no puzzles, nothing in particular to unlock except new battles, and very little sense of progress. There's virtually nil NPC interaction and nothing to figure out. If I wanted a game that was nothing but combat, I wouldn't be playing FF, i'd break out my old copy of the PC dos-based Dungeon Hack (which is exactly what it sounds like).  The laws are arbitrary. Restrictions on what kind of combat you're allowed to engage in SHOULD make a game interesting (they at least keep you from overspecializing in, say, warriors or wizards). But when the game arbitrarily and randomly decides "you can't use weapons in this battle" or "you can't use magic in this battle" with no real rationale, you just start to get annoyed with it. A MUCH better way of preventing over specialization is to throw the player up against a wider variety of monsters so that they MUST have multiple classes to be able to play to all the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.  I also really dislike the idea of gaining skills by equiping certain items (instead of, oh, you know, USING the skills in question?). The result is that you end up equipping really weak and generally useless items for longer than you conceivably would in any other game, or you end up lacking very basic skills. Both are artificially limiting.  Overall, I think the game just lacks a lot of what makes the Final Fantasy franchise such a popular one, and that's a shame, especially consider how good the original Tactics is supposed to be. This is the first time I've ever NOT finished an FF game that I bought. Not because it was difficult, but because it was mind-numbing.	-1
I like this game a lot. I do not care much about the rules system but it forces you to think before you act instead of using the best possible attacks. You should automatically receive bonus characters after you put in 100+ hours into the game. I like Disgaea/ Disgaea 2 better but that is for the PS2. I wish they would make a part 2 for FFTA. I still love FF.	1
I just bought this for my 6 year old and she loves it. It is worth every bit of your money. There are 8 worlds in total and she's on World 3 right now so she still has more than half to go. The good part is you can save your progress as you go along and each world is different than the last so you don't get bored and it is quite innovative at the same time. I'm very pleased with this purchase since I don't have to shell out money as often and my kid is having a great time!	1
Regarded by many as the best game to ever grace the original NES, Super Mario Bros. 3 gets shrunk down for the GBA, and it is all the more glorious all these years later, even on the small screen.  Featuring re-vamped graphics and sound effects with the tried but true side-scrolling Mario fun, Super Mario 3 is every bit as fun as it was years ago.  Fans who remember the classic game will remember the innovative power ups introduced here: the raccoon leaf, the frog suit, and plenty more as you take on Bowser's children and the Hammer Bros. as well as the usual cast of Mario villains.  The level design has yet to be beat, and despite a few frustrations that are common place in the Mario series, the game is still a blast to play.  All in all, Super Mario Bros. 3 is a must own for GBA owners and DS owners alike, and it's still one of the best platformers ever made.	1
This to me is by far the best Mario Brothers game they've come out with. I remember when it first came out and playing this thing through Junior High. I've pretty much forgotten about this thing (not completely though) when I saw my young cousin playing the game on her Gameboy Advanced. I played a few minutes and I've found I'm hooked once again.  This is worth it guys! :)	1
Super Mario Brothers 3 overall is fun and one of the better GBA games. It reminds me of the NES game. The first level is easy and the second, but the third is so hard. But in Mario as you all know, if you're the tiny Mario if you get hit once, boom, you are dead, have to start the level over again. Here's the lowdown:  Graphics: 5/5 They have really improved the graphics of the old version alot. They aren't those blocky NES graphics, they are fine and colorful. That's what I like about the Mario Franchise.  Sound: 5/5 The sound is fantastic in this game. You get to hear the classic theme and all Mario's phrases like "Oh, Mama Mea"  Controls: 5/5 The controls are pretty simple. A is to jump and thats about it and the D-pad. Also you use R to speed up.  Fun: 4/5 I always like the Mario franchise, but the game is literally too hard. One hit your are dead pretty much if you're not the racoon or Super Mario. But that's what Mario is I can't complain too much about that.	1
Very few games define classic. Many of the Marios can be classic(except I hate part 2 and only "liked" Sunshine), Mario 3 can definately be called a classic. Released waaaay back on the old NES system, many people were spellbound by the gameplay and the mechanics of having multiple suits and power-ups, expanding on the flower and mushroom power-ups.  Story: Ha, you're expecting a story in a Mario game? It all boils down to one sentence: there's trouble in the Mushroom Kingdom and Mario must save the day. That's it. To do that, he must clear at least 90 stages and face many enemies.  Graphics: It's NES so they're not exactly that great but in the end you just don't end up noticing. It's certainly an improvement from 2 and the different worlds are nicely detailed but face it, you don't play an old-school game for the graphics.  Sound/Music: Back when Nintendo re-released Link to the Past on the GBA, they added some voice clips from the N64. Well same thing with Mario 3, when Mario gets a power-up he goes "just what I needed" and it's slightly annoying but since you're not gonna get power-ups one right after another it's not as troublesome.  Gameplay: The most important aspect of a game and Mario 3 certainly delivered. Adding to the list of power-ups is the Leaf, giving Mario a tail and ears, allowing him to fly. Also added is the Hammer suit, capable of throwing hammers, the Tanooki suit which is similar to the Leaf but allows Mario to turn into a statue briefly, making enemies ignore him. Also is the frog suit which is more better suited at swimming and the oddly-popular shoe which allows safe passage over some terrain and stomping enemies.  The world is separated into 8 sections and like many-a Mario game, it's got a theme. There's a desert area, a sky area, the favorite "big world" with large enemies, an ice world and so on. Also included is different special areas, such as a mix-and-match where you have to match a whole picture of a power-up, a memory based card game where you flip cards that have to match(2 tries? that's really stupid) and a game of picking 1 of 3 chests.  By the way, this game can get incredibly frustrating. The first couple of levels are not that big of a deal but later levels will seriously drive you up the wall. World 6(ice world) and one stage on World 7(pipe/maze world) seriously made me yell in frustration.  As an added bonus, the game comes with the original Super Mario Bros where you have to bump the ceiling of different floors and kick enemies. Simple yet effective. Then when you're done, you can go back to Mario 3.  P.S Don't ask about the E-Reader stuff since I don't have one.	1
Really, this game was such a pleasant surprise, I still reccomend it to people who have a GBA or DS constantly. Like the title of my review, I never could get into strategy games until I played this game, especially Real-time Strategy games like Warcraft or Civilazation. Despite having those games highly reccomended to me, I could not get into them. Then came FFTA, which plays more like a RPG/Chess mish-mash than an RTS. You take turns moving across the battlefield, one charecter at a time, trying to defeat your opponents in battle. Very simple premise, no in-battle micro management involved. It is outside of battle that you will manage your "Clan" members by choosing their Job, and equiping them with the right stuff in order to learn new abilities to use in battle. This is where you will get absorbed: trying to get you clan as powerful as possible and unloking all the jobs. My only gripes with the game are the flimsy plot and that some jobs become obscelete after unlocking some of the later ones. Then again, this is sorta balanced by the fact that you can "Equip" the abilities from your first jobs and carry them over to a new job. Anyhoo, before I lose you, if you're looking for game that will last you a while, even after you beat it, this is THE best way to go. Few other games on the GBA comes close to offering the amount of replayibility of this title. Easily one of the very best on the system.	1
The game is fun. Very fun. Very much like the original Tactics for the PSone (although not quite as good). Takes place in the world of Ivalice (Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XII). Easily over 100+ hours of gameplay in this one. Tons of different classes, Summons and all the good FF stuff... The only down side I can think of is that it gets a little repetitive towards the end with the same old routine.	1
Now before you dismiss this review as a cry for attention by some fanboy just because i give it a five out of five, I'd like to first say that this is only my second Final fantasy experience (the other being FFX), and I only gave it a 5/5 because I genuinely loved playing this game. I found this game quite different from final fantasy X, first of all because it is a (somewhat) tactical game. What makes this game tactical is that battles are played on a map where you move your characters around and attack with consideration of direction, range, and properties of the land that you and your target stand on.  There are many classes of characters to choose from, each having their own moveset, which is aquired by wearing the appropriate gear and weapons . Abilities learned from gear and weapons can be  mastered by gaining AP (ability points) at the end of each battle. These classes and their different play styles keep gameplay fresh and interesting, which is a good thing because battling is pretty much all you will be doing. Gameplay is overall extremely satisfying for both role-playing and strategy fans alike, and is great if played for 15-20 minute bursts each time. The ease of making this a handheld game comes from the ability to save at any time. This is all great stuff and definately worth picking up if you are into this sort of stuff. And you will definately get your money's worth, because there are aroud 300 missions, and each battle will take around 20 minutes to complete. Granted, a lot of them are dispatch missions (you don't actually fight), but the time you will spend with this game is pretty impressive.  That is not to say that this game is without faults. All complaints are minor, but story is sort of shallow and forgettable, but this is not such a bad thing if you only play a little at a time. Also, dealing with a law system is very annoying when some battles forbid the basic command of "fight". Make a wrong move and your player gets sent to jail. It is a huge annoyance and should not have been part of the game. Lastly, the menus are a little overcomplicated and  difficult, especially buying and equipping items, but once you play long enough, you'll get used to it.  So this is definately a very fun game for your Gameboy advance that will keep you busy for months to come, and even though you will find some minor flaws, it is still one of the best tactical rpgs you will find, good enough in fact, to deserve a 5/5.	1
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a fun and addictive game...to a point.  Probably the best feature of the game is that it's perfect for the Gameboy Advance..or at least for frequent short play instead of long sittings.  It's quick to hop in to, doesn't have a whole lot of plot for you to forget (this was kind of a downpoint, but having played the game on and off over about 3 months it's become a good thing), and you can make accomplishments with about 10-15 minutes of gameplay (or even save during game in a pinch).  It's perfect for travelling.  The gameplay is fun and addictive.  It's been a while since I played the Playstation original, but the classes seem better and more balanced, and more meaningful when you combine abilities.  It's a great way to kill a half hour here and a half hour there.  Now the things that drag it down.  The Law system is by far it's most annoying feature.  It's basically  a list of things you can't do in a particular battle.  There are two results to breaking said law: 1) for a minor transgression, you get a yellow card.  after the battle, it will do somethingbad to your character like lower stats, etc.  2) more severe violations of the law (usually KOing someone with the illegal move) will take you out of the battle and put you straight into prison.  The problem is that the yellow card doesn't effect your opponents, because what happens after the battle is irrelevant to them, and usually 2-3 enemies every battle have an ability that converts any severe violations into a yellow card, so they never get removed from battle.  In effect, the Law system is a restriction on you and no one else.  Also, if your main character ever gets a severe violation, it's game over for you.  The further into the game you get, the more annoying it gets to be because they become more general and more numerous.  You'll end up in battles where Swords, Fight (the basic attack command), and color magic (white, black, red, etc) are all forbidden.  Great, so you've got about 1 character that can do anything worthwhile, meanwhile the other team is all suited up perfectly to not have to deal with those laws.  Sometimes in a long drawnout battle you'll forget what the laws are and accidentally break one.  It sucks to get gameover just because after a 45 minute battle (because 90% of your moves are handicapped it gets hard to win quickly) you accidentally break some obscure law like attacking the same opponent twice in a row.  Which brings me to my next complaint.  Not all of the laws are clearly spelled out.  You'll remember what they are after the first time you break them, but knowing ahead of time is often not possible.  For instance: "knightswords" will be banned.  None of the offending weapons are labeled as such, so you don't get to know if you're going to break the law until you actually do.  Similarly: "ganging up" has something to do with multiple allies attacking the same enemy; hard not to do when it's the last enemy on the board.  The Judge who enforces these laws (one in every battle) also is sort of annoying himself.  He stands in the battlefield and takes a turn (and a space) like everyone else.  He takes his turn extremely slow though...just sitting there for 20-30 seconds at a time most often, and then moving somewhere or rearranging KOed bodies for some reason.  It breaks the momentum of the game.	-1
I was ecstatic to hear that this game was coming out, and bought it on the day of release in Japan (since I'm half Japanese). I'm a huge fan of the original Final Fantasy Tactics (FFT) for the PS1, and playing FFT Advance on the GBA was a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps the game would have been better if it lost the Final Fantasy theme and title; I was looking forward to something that was similar to the first FFT, which was to me, perfect (although a two-player mode would have been amazing).  I didn't find the story interesting and the quests quickly became stale. Weapon-based ability gaining was also a chore. Didn't find it fun that I had to defend my land from bandits either. Laws were very annoying as well.  As you can see, I had a lot of complaints. However, the game's production is very good, from the graphics to the music.  PROS + Nice graphics + Interesting character designs + Nice music and sound effects + Nice menus/interface  CONS - Uninteresting plot - Weapon-based ability learning - Questing system - Defending land from bandits - Judges/Law system - Needed a few more music tracks in battles	1
Super Mario Brothers is, in my opinion, the best game ever made. Everything about it is perfect. Mario is an incredible, addictive, wonderful experience that every person in the world should have. If you have never played and/or can't get the original, BUY THIS GAME!	1
Super Mario Bros. 3 is certainly an impressive game for 1988 standards and holds up as an innovative platformer even today. The graphics, level design and gameplay make for a truly great playing experience.  I never did finish the first Super Mario Bros. (as of yet) and I've never even played Super Mario Bros. 2 but now, after liking this so much, I will seriously have to consider it.  In terms of originality you won't find anything particularly amazing about the jumping of one platform to the next and collecting power-ups but it's how it all comes together and works so well that makes SMB3 stand out from the rest of the competition.  Some levels are tough, but stick at them and you'll memorize and master the tricky bits pretty quickly. However, that didn't stop me from crying out loud in sheer, hopeless frustration every now and again.  The GBA version adds a save function (a godsend for those who hate having to spend 86 hours finishing a game in one go), slightly tweaked levels and compatibility with the Nintendo E-Reader that offers bonus levels.  Considering how good this game is it's no wonder Sonic had such tough competition from a short, fat Italian plumber. Definitely one to hunt down.  Graphics A Sound B (only because the famous Super Mario music is not featured) Gameplay A Lasting Appeal A	1
I played this game on my old 8 bit Nintendo Entertainment System years ago.  It's truly an awesome game.  I don't know if the Gameboy Advance version has added anything extra, but I know it didn't need to.  The game was perfect years ago, and it's still perfect today.  The only problem I had with the 8 bit game was it couldn't be saved and continued at another time.  I assume the Gameboy Advance version has a saving feature.  I don't know if the levels were painstakingly designed or just thrown together, but they're absolutely great.  Some of them are pretty tough though, especially towards the end where you have to go through all of the tank levels.  Some of the enemies on this game are pretty tough too, particularly the heavyset ones that shake the ground and stun you a bit.  My advice to those playing the game is this:  Don't use the warp whistles if you happen to find them.  They'll jump you ahead to levels that are so difficult you won't have enough lives and items to be prepared for them.  This is a tough game, and it's twice as tough if you try to take shortcuts.  Plus you miss so much when you skip levels.  You miss frog suits, and takooni suits, and the giant enemies, and all of the fun stuff.  This game just has so much variety.  New stuff is everywhere.  Play every level and have a good time.  Find that level with the giant boot to jump around in too.  I love that one.	1
After the very successful and fun Final Fantasy Tactics game that was on the Playstation 1 in 1998, it was only expected that a follow up would come in the not to distant future. Little did anyone expect that it would be on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.  The premise behind the new version of the scaled down game is the same. You start out with a hero who has to build a team of fighters of variying classes to take on others in turn based battles with each character on each team getting a seperate turn to take out various enemies on the field with their moves. All the classes are traditional Final Fantasy classes that we have seen through out the years in various FF games. Only unlike the PS version of the game this time the classes are seperated by race of the character you have in your party.  There are five races that you will meet in the land of Ivalice where the story takes place. Humans, Viera, Moogles, Bangaa and Nu Mou are the races that will fill up your team. Each race can hold certain jobs with only a few jobs being able to be used by more then one race. In typical FFT way, you must level up by fighting in battles and learning skills that a particular job can hold to retain them for later use even if you change your job to another one. Half the fun is building up characters with the various skills and jobs and building a dream team that is totaly under your control. You can have magic users, warriors and specialist all working on one grand team complimenting each other in perfect unison.  The game play is fun and pulls off a tactics type environment as well as can be expected on the GBA. The graphics aren't stunning like the first FFT game due to the system it is on but it does pull off everything graphicly well enough. Summon spells and magic looks stunning and you can clearly see what is going on without difficulty of making out each character is supposed to be. The game is colorful and easy enough to understand. There is some strategy to things as depending on where you stand when you are about to attack can make things easier for you. Also the various status of you or your enemies at the time of attack will matter too. Like if they are asleep you will hit them 100% as they can't defend you. If you face them with their back to you you will hit them more then 50% due to them having to turn around to defend themselves.  The game itself is a lot of fun but far from perfect. The storyline is a tad on the weak side, almost being secondary to the whole experience of playing the game. The game has the weird notion of making the main characters realizing that they are in a "Final Fantasy" game the whole time. Making many mentions of how the series is their favorite and everything they are going through is something out of a Final Fantasy game.  The story of the game is basicly a group of kids one being a new kid and another being a shy kid who lost his mother years ago and has been depressed and the last being a girl who is more of a tom boy all find a book that seems to date back decades in time. As they open the book something weird unknowing to them occurs. They go to sleep and wake up only to find their whole town has been transformed into a world out of a Final Fantasy game and now Marche the new kid has to figure out a way to get home while the boy who lost his mom, Mewt has become the prince of the land and enforces tough laws that must be followed during every battle or else you can be penalized or even be put in jail. Marche now must destroy crystals in order to get closer to bringing the world back from what seems to be all a figment of Mewt's imagination.  The story doesn't even seem to matter after awhile though, and even the writers didn't seem to focus to much on it. The game itself is fun just by building up your characters and classes and doing the missions and tasks that you will have to in order to expand through the game. The laws though get annoying after awhile. They add challenge to the game which is needed but sometimes they are just annoying rather then challenging. Laws are basicly what you can and can't do during said battle and it randomly changes every battle. Sometimes you can't use bows other times you can't use magic and as the game progresses more and more laws that can't be done are added making things harder as now you have 3 laws rather then just 1 that you can't do during a match.  It can be quite a tasking challenge at times to sort out what missions you have to do, what battles you have to do and what weapons have to be changed to learn new skills and will keep you more then occupied all the while. No its not up to the same standards and excellence that the PS1 version of the game was but that is only expected given the different abilities that the two systems can do. You definitely will get your monies worth here by adding this worthy addition in the FF line to your GBA. Its a game you can play often as you can always build different classes and try and get differnet abilities and weapons you never had before and its a lot of fun. There are some negatives to the game but no game is perfect and this pulls off the transition well enough to more then satisfy. A little more story and less annoying random battles that you have to do would have been nice (you will see that defending areas in battles will get to be draining and boring at times) but the pros definitely out weigh the cons.  Highly recommended is getting a strategy guide for the game as it will make your life easier when you have to figure out what weapon gives you what abilities and what you need to form what class. It can come in very handy when you have to over come the limitations of what info can be shown on the screen at a time when it comes to what you have over what you don't.  Over 300 missions, 34 jobs and multiplayer abilities this is a game that will keep you more then occupied as you navigate through the vast world of Ivalice. Check it out, you won't be sorry you did if you are a fan of Tactics games or a good role playing game.	1
This is a turn-based strategy game from SquareEnix.  The setup of the story is cute, quirky, fun, and at times even endearing.  However, it doesn't work too much to tie together the battles.  The main plot sort of arches over the gameplay, which are generally tangential subplots that don't contribute to the main story.  The battles are pretty standard fare, with the best aspects being the many classes, abilities, and items.  Lots of stuff to "get" in this game, hehe.  Graphics are very good.  Anime portraits are used to tell the story, and although most of the characters are supposed to be kids, they look rather metrosexual to me, haha.  Multiplayer for turn-based strategy is never very good.  And this one is no exception.  The game offers linking to trade items, but unless you have a friend who gets into this as much as you, I think this game will mostly remain a solo affair.  Good game, perfect to grind away the day with, perfect on a handheld, $30 a little too much IMO, but that's why I got it on sale.	1
This is a really good game and I strongly reccommend it for ANYBODY!!!!! I love all if the levels and they never get old!!!! This game is AWESOME!!!!	1
I loved this game back in the olden NES days. When this game came to the GBA I was very impressed with what has been done with it, there is no downfalls, only improvments!! The game is just the way I remember it with a few add ons here and there... a very excellent game revivalof the super woggio brothers 3!  Tho the name is confusing, it's Mario Advance 4. Yet it's Super Mario Bros. 3  Another cool thing about this version, as well as a few other things, if you have a gameshark, there is a code where you can use the flying cape from Mario world (4)!!!	1
Okay, to be frank, this game owns. I didn't like FFT because of the permanent death thing, but in FFTA, Marche can die and die and die and not die permanently.  ---Graphics-wise, this game is dumbed down from FFT, but the class sprites look good and the mugshots are far better than FFT. They are quite repetitive, but that's only a slight problem. Also the bright colors make up for the dark nature of the gameboy screen.  ---Sound-wise, this game is very good, many good tracks and very few problems, but its exceptional for a handheld.  ---Story-wise, I thought it leaned more to the childish side, but it was okay, it was still good. I didn't like the end and the fact that Marche was dense as all hell to Ritz's behavior towards him was kind of funny... but odd.  ---Gameplay-wise, this did damage to the score. Gameplay is fun, and addicting but it gets too old after awhile and enemy hordes have very simple patterns and the only time that changes is when you get stuck in a jagd, which are lawless parts of Ivalice, so you get pwned. (Yes I put pwned on purpose.)  All in all its a good game, albeit a slightly flawed one, but its worth the price, trust me on this one.	1
A fat plumber called Mario was quite the icon during my childhood days. In those days, you weren't cool unless you played a Super Mario Bros. game or two. Super Mario Bros. 3 was one such games, and it was no doubt one of the most popular games in Nintendo's 100-odd-years history.  Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is almost an exact replica of that game. Porting the game over to the GBA, Nintendo has made some minor changes to the it, but the large part of it remains essentially the same old of old. Which makes it a rather nostalgic run down the memory lane for gamers from the 80s' era, who are still gaming. Like me.  For the uninformed, the mission of Mario and Co. is simple. You will need to save a Princess (duh!), and to do that, you will need to battle through different levels in nine worlds. Going through all the worlds painstakingly is not compulsory though, if you happen to be strategic with some items you collect along the way, but the more accomplished Mario fans will tell you there's more fun in doing it "the right way".  Of course, doing it that way means a very long, and sometimes tough journey. You get upgrades when the game progresses, allowing you to change into various costumes. One of these is a raccoon suit that allows you to sweep your enemies with your tail, and to fly up to the sky. Pretty nifty, if you ask me. Other costumes lets you split fire, swim faster in water and throw hammers, etc. All of these give you some advantage in certain situations, but knowing when, and how to use them effectively is a different story.  Graphics wise, the colors look every bit as vibrant as they were, but the pictures are a little short when compared to modern standards. This has always been a problem with porting classic games onto the GBA. Still, I'm not a fussy person. Graphics have never been an issue for me when it comes to games, or I'd have bought an XBox.  The audios in this game are ok, although the music sounds like it has been remixed. Some of the in-game comments are a little corny, for example, when Mario gets a costume upgrade, he yells out: "That's what I needed!". This gets old after, like, two minutes. The special effect audios are as good as ever, so you get the classic "ting" sound when you latch onto coins, and the robotic tunnel-climbing sound when you get into one of those secret tubes, which is cool.  The changes in this version of Super Mario Bros. 3 now allow you to save your change. A welcomed move, surely, but the game is so easy, you probably won't need the feature if you intend to go through it speedily with the magic whistles. Oh, did I say magic whistles? Ok, I shall shut up. Other additions include five advance medallions per level, and a chance to take on the classic Mario Bros. game. If you're just buying this game for Super Mario Bros/ 3, you may conveniently ignore all these.  In conclusion, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a classic revisited. It's an adventure with the qualities to impress fans, whether young or old, and will no doubt add hours of fun for you on the GBA. This is a game truly worthy of the Super Mario Bros. franchise.	1
A fun, challenging game that you will love if your a Mario fan! It started out on the Super nintendo and decided to make its way on the Game boy Advance. Mario or Mario and Luigi start out to different levels and places even at deserts, oceans, dark places etc! Saving the king and princess takes time. Each level can be difficult or easy. Getting coins, getting stronger, fighting monsters, passing your way through different objects. Cool already! Going on ships, traveling your way through dungeons is fun and exciting.	1
Truly, this game is the best and greatest game eva made. I have played this game on two systems, the NES and SNES (part of the Super Mario All-Stars collection). I do have to say, i loved this game to death. One of the best Mario, no, one of the Best games eva made. The graphics are great, and the music was awesome. The gameplay, while normal, was awesome. While the storyline is classical and was the same as it's two predecessors, it was great. It was a pleasure for me to play this game.	1
Maybe a year or so after Squaresoft released the uber-masterpiece Final Fantasy VII, they released Final Fantasy Tactics, a more strategy-based game in which you move players around a playing field. It had a immensely deep job system where there were so many jobs and abilities you could've racked up over 100 hours at least if you wanted to get all characters with all the abilities. But the story was way too complicated for it's own good, thanks in large part to a shoddy translation. Now we have the "sequel" and it may look kiddy but it is deeper than the deepest ocean.  Story: After a snowball fight, main character Marche's friend Mewt says he's gonna buy a fantasy book. Marche suggests he brings it to his house and invites his other friend Ritz. The book is in a different language with someone reading out loud a passage. During the night, their world actually takes the form of the book's world, with different races and creatures. Now Marche must discover how to get home, but do his friends even want to, let alone him?  Graphics: Very...um, pretty is the word I'm looking for. Even vibrant. Like the amazon page says, it harkens back to the 16 bit days of Yoshi's Island and Chrono Trigger.  Sound/Music: I didn't notice anything particularly catchy but the music fit the areas. The enemies give out really weird death screams in some cases. But the sound effects from spells and hits are very nice.  Gameplay: Some pros and cons like all games. Gameplay is immensely deep but enemies earlier on can really kick your *** even when you don't have a lot of time in the game. Plus, don't be surprised if you're 2 squares away and your attack misses yet they perfectly nail you from far away. And your classic way of levelling up either comes from clan fights or story missions, which means you can't just wander around and beat enemies left and right. Or maybe you can, who knows but I haven't seen it yet.  The menus are ugh also. When you buy a weapon, it may have a spell that you want to learn but you don't know how useful it is in battle. Be ready for menus upon menus mixed with more menus.  Any fans of the original Tactics remembers that after every battle you obtained Job Points, collect enough and you can use them to "buy" a spell or ability. Now it takes the Final Fantasy IX system by having them attached to weapons/armor.  I'll try to explain: imagine Rod A has the Life spell and it needs 200 ability points to learn it. You get these by competing in many battles where at the end, you get the ability points. If you've obtained 200, you've learned Life and can de-equip Rod A and equip Rod B. However, if you haven't learned Rod A's Life spell and equip Rod B, you can't use Life unless you equip Rod A and get those 200.  This can be extremely annoying as this amazing useful ability is done by doing some off-the-wall missions you probably wouldn't bother with, or stealing off an enemy that you're more concerned is gonna kill you in 2 hits.  Also, there is 300 missions in this game. Some are optional for story advancement, others simply for completionists or for people levelling up. It's as short or as long as you want it to be but you'll probably enjoy yourself in the process.	1
This is one of the best FF titles out there.  Now at first glance the story may seem childish, but it isn't.  The story itself evolves throughout the game, and grows on you just like the characters.  It is absolute must for all rpg gamers, and would make a wonderful gift.  It is well worth its money for the countless hours of gameplay, and will keep your kids buisy without asking for anything else.  It even has exteneded gameplay for when you finish it.	1
After playing the original FFT on Playstation, I can say this game lives up to the challenge of recreating the same environment on the Gameboy Advance. Looks incredible....graphics are crisp/well-defined, there are large battlefields to explore, and spells look better than the Playstation. While there is a huge job system, it is not complex to learn or master. With over 300 battles to play, you can rush to the end and miss many items to come back later. In that regard, the replay value is very high. Even if you find every single item, I'd say the length of the game (40-120 hours) can more than make you forget a few places you've been.  Now a gripe I have is with the music. It can wear on you after awhile. I tend to enjoy good battle music, but the in game music drags and very often you might spend 5 minutes before a battle changing your characters' jobs & skills around. Don't want to have bad music there, as it can take away from the skills you'll need for the upcoming battle.  There are many unique attributes to the game, including to effect a battle using an item you previously won (or found) on a Mission. The environments still play a huge outcome in how the battle progresses. I like the whole idea of the recon/item missions. You could send a weak character out to pick up a rare item and their stats will come back improved. Later on, you can only find the rarest items by sending one powerful character out on the recon/item missions.  SquareEnix RPG's are well-known for their epic stories. Does not apply here. The entire game (**spoiler ahead**) is focused on the main character's ability to stop his brother from keeping him trapped inside a fantasy world. So you'll meet up w/ your little brother, have a few words, maybe fight a battle, and then you go about your recon/item missions. There are plenty of epic battles, but the story here lags a bit. I still give FFT high praise for its handling of subjects not often expressed in an RPG.  FFT: Advance has been called a 'kiddie RPG'. Not true. It's not Mortal Kombat...yeah... but it stands up to other RPG's on GBA and many on PS2 & GameCube. You'll find challenge, good music, many hours of play and an overall sense that you enjoyed yourself once you reach the ending (which is a bit predictable in my mind ;)  Pros: Incredible graphics, characters have personalities all their own, somewhat challenging battles, over 300 missions, cool LinkUp play, very good replay value  Cons: In game music gets a bit old after awhile, your characters are too darn powerful (challenge goes way down the more you build them up), music drags (again), not many LinkUp capabilities.  Play this if you liked: Golden Sun 2 or any Square RPG.  On a 10 point scale, I give this game 8/10 overall.	1
Though Nintendo had been the preeminent leader in video game systems since its debut in 1985, it was 1989's release of "Super Mario Brothers 3", the last of the original Super Mario Trilogy for the NES that sent Nintendo's popularity soaring into the stratosphere.  A truly complex and challenging game, "...3" re-invented the side-scroller genre.  Like so many longtime Nintendo loyalists, I have fond memories playing "Super Mario 3" for hours on end as I tried to defeat the bosses in the new and varied worlds like the Ice World, the Desert World, and the Sky World, to name a few.  It took 14 years, but Nintendo has giving this seminal game a spectacular rebirth on the handheld Gameboy Advance System.  While it is actually the fourth in the "Super Mario Advance" series for the GBA (preceded by Super Mario 2 [SMA1], Super Mario World [SMA2], Yoshi's Island [SMA3]), it is a complete port of "Super Mario Brothers 3".  It is exactly as I remembered the original game, save for the ability to play as Luigi (in addition to Mario) and some spruced up graphics.  The gameplay is a seamless re-creation of the original and it's simply amazing to be playing this marvelous game in a handheld format.  The only port more astounding for GBA was "Super Mario World [SMA2]", and that was simply because it was from a more advance system.  In addition to the wonderful nostalgia of playing "Super Mario 3", "SMA 4" also gives the gamer the original "Mario Bros" game to play individually or in multiplayer mode (all the "Super Mario Advance" games do this).  While Nintendo has made some missteps in understanding its core fan base with its handling of its last two platform systems, the "Super Mario Advance" series, especially "Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros 3" shows that Nintendo still has an intimate understanding of what its fans want in a portable gaming system.  BRING ON THE NINTENDO DS.	1
I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series and I thoroughly enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics for the PlayStation.  This game, however, I didn't care for much.  The sound and graphics were decent, but the playability was way down.  In the original, you were able to rotate the camera angle to get a better view; that feature doesn't exist in this version (I suppose due to the restricted available memory).  For some reason, game designers seem to think that more complicaated means more challenging.  The whole 'law' system I think is a big downfall.  You can make a game challenging without making complicated game mechanics.	-1
My rating for this game is assuming that you enjoyed (or at the very least did not want to gouge your eyes out while) playing the original Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSOne.  If you did not, then you will in all likelihood loathe this game.  However, if you're like me and enjoyed the stuffing out of the original, this is a very nice follow-up to it.  It isn't exactly a port, which disappointed me at first.  The battle system is almost exactly the same, but I was disconcerted by the fact that only certain species could use certain classes, not to mention the fact that I could no longer spend job points to buy skills (instead you have to have a weapon which teaches you the skill equipped until you've collected enough ability points to earn it).  And then there is the Judge System.  Everyone I'd talked to who played this game before me warned me that it was probably going to be enough to chase me off as it had them.  At first, it was very off-putting, just like the other changes that had been made; however, like the rest, as I played the game, I soon came to like (maybe even love in a few cases) the judges.  It added an extra spice to the game play and even saved my bacon in one boss fight (I had gotten my rear handed to me because this boss constantly cast charm, so I waited for a day where charm was illegal and the boss no longer used it).  The story at times seems very simple and maybe a little "kiddified," but I really have no problem with that.  It didn't stop me from enjoying Kingdom Hearts, and it doesn't stop me from enjoying this game, either.  Anyway, I highly reccomend this to basically any fan of FFT. :)	1
I loved the original for the playstation, but this one... Story 2.5/10:  The story is about as deep as a wading pool.  I thought from the start it wouldn't be great but I didn't expect it to be so bland and vapid.  The story opens on a school-yard snowball fight between the munchkins of a small public school, and a clever tutorial instructs you how to play the game throughout the snow fight.  Then three of the loser kids (including the protagonist) go to a house read a book, then wish they weren't losers and were in that fantasy world.  Then while they sleep the world changes and then the main guy ask the other two to help him get the world back to normal but they don't want to because they're not losers there... then you go on a million missions, and the story dies with your motivation to play. Gameplay 5/10:  The battle system is pretty much the same as the first, except you have to learn skills and magic by equipting weapons that have that skill on them.  This wouldn't bother me except that you often have to equip very weak weapons to learn skills you may have missed or haven't gotten to yet.  The battles feel slower then its big brother and they just aren't as fun. Graphics 5/10:  I guess they're good for a GBA game but the first has much better visuals.  The animations and attacks and spells almost put me to sleep, they are very simple and boring.  Overall the graphics just plain lack style or any zest at all.  Oh and the character clothing is outrageously bizzare!!  They look incredible weird even for a FF game, in short I don;t like it. Overall 4/10:  It is, at best, an ok game.  At least it's better than Final Fantasy Chrystal Chronicals  ;(  *shutters*	-1
THis isn't an RPG but more like turn based squad combat.  It's fun, many different classes to toy with, lots of secret stuff to find, and the graphics are sharp.  The set-up dialouge is kinda childish but hey it's a game boy advance game, what do you expect?  It is worth the $$$ so buy and enjoy.	1
This game is the same as the nes version! The only differences are that you can save the game  Make your way through 8 worlds while killing many enemies, and passing obstacles such as fire in this classic game. Get items to help you along the way such as a leaf that will allo you to fly, and collect coins to get extra lives.  The sound, graphics, and gameplay are great.  I would recommend this game to any mario fan.	1
I admit it Im one of the ones who think that Super Mario Bros 3 is the most overrated game of all time. Sure its fun but the graphics and controls were better in the sequel that is known as Super Mario World. I have to say though out of the 3 Mario games that were available on the original N.E.S. this is the best one with the original coming in a close second. This was also the first sign of Mario's evolution. I mean take the last level for example. The last levels in Mario 1 and 2 were pretty hard but not this hard. There is a fortress in the middle of it that is extremely comples. This is a game of skill and strategy.   Also I think that the graphics here are some of the best available on the Game Boy Advance. They aren't as good as Metroid Zero Mission but they are excellent for a 2 dimensional Mario game. Super Mario World is a better showcase but this comes in a mean second. If you have  a Game Boy Player hooked up to your Game Cube to play this game it will be like having a Super N.E.S. all over again.	1
I think this is the best re-release of Super Mario Bros. 3 that I've ever seen.  Although the graphics look identical to those from "Super Mario All-Stars" several years ago, the game has a few very nice added features which got me hooked on SMB3 all over again. Among my favorite features are the ability to save the game at ANY point.  The original SMB3 on the NES had no save feature whatsoever... the save feature on "SM All Stars" on the SNES was limited in that it only remembered what world you saved on, and it saved your items.  (For example, if you got all the way to World 3-10 when you hit "Save & Quit" you would resume back at the beginning of World 3-1 next time you played.) The GBA version of SMB 3 saves *everything* -- your score, the number of coins, all your items, and every single board you've cleared.  This is very handy considering that you could be playing on an airplane where you may be asked to shut off your electronic devices immediately and you don't have time to keep playing to a "save point" like in some games.  I would have also appreciated this feature when I was a kid and mom and dad didn't understand that you really did have to play 3 or 4 more stages before you could save the game and come to the dinner table. I love being able to resume where I picked up, especially including my score, coins and extra lives. The other big thing I love is, once you finish the game, you can go back and clear boards that you skipped the first time around.  Once you have a "perfect clear" on all 8 worlds, you have free reign on everything in the entire game... play any stage as much as you want, exit out of stages anytime, and go into any mushroom house or bonus game as much as you want.  Because of this, you can do things never possible before, like stocking up on later-stage items (like Hammer Bros. suits) and playing through the earlier stages with them.  That World 2 Fortress isn't so hard anymore when you can toss hammers at the Thwomps and the Boos! The fact that this game is still so popular after more than 14 years on the market just goes to show... you don't need to have the latest and greatest 3-D whizbang technology to be successful.  Sometimes it's nice to go back to basics, and this is probably one of the best re-releases Nintendo has ever produced on any platform.  If you loved (or even just liked) SMB3, you'll be very happy with this version.	1
I picked up a copy of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance because, while I honestly cannot stand RPGs, I confess the "turn-based war strategy" genre is my favorite niche.  I haven't played a really good one ever since Sierra's "Missionforce: Cyberstorm."  So, while I'm not used to fantasy-strategy, and though I haven't played the Playstation version, I thought I'd give FFTA a chance. It took me a long time to get fully into FFTA, and I'm only (ONLY?) ten hours into the game, but this has quickly become my favorite game for the Game Boy Advance.  In spite of their clunkiness, the menus are intuitive and navigable; the character art is outstanding; the game is absolutely adorable (maybe a little TOO adorable...).  The missions can become tedious, but when my nerves begin to wear, I simply set the GBA aside, and I usually find that my interest is re-whetted by the next day. This game is so dense and immersive, and there is so much to keep track of.  Characters are able to learn the skills that come with wielding a particular weapon, but they frequently need to be of a certain "race" (so what do I need to do to make Safra into a ninja, I often ask myself), certain laws of battle require you to rethink the way you fight and which of your characters you're going to send into a fray, and when one of your characters is away on a "mission," you're also going to need to think about whether you have someone who can pick up that missing character's slack. Playing this game gives me such a great sense of satisfaction.  It's incredible.  Long, sure, and sometimes tedious, but in the end, an outstanding game.	1
this game is ok. it was kinda confusing with learning techniques that only work for different battle types. i also thought it was kinda easy. you just need a strong stagety and it is all good. it wasn't half as fun as i thought it would be. i heard alot about final fanasty games and thoguht it would be good but it didn't live up to my excpectations. it also didn't have much of a story line. all you do is fight. it isn't to great. if you like games with a strong story line then i don't advise this.	1
Buy this classic Mario game because- Pros. Deep game that has a lot of different secrets,   Great Graphic and Music   Challenging level design   Great items that were new to the series at the time of the release of the original such as flight hammer bros. suit etc. Cons. That voices (of the mario bros.) get a little annoying after a while This is in my opinion the Nes' best game.  I hope you liked my review.  So go get this... now ;) Thanks.	1
this game is geat it remember me form when i was 10yrs old and had my nintendo well im 22 i have my game boy sp and i interact games with my brother he has this game is a beautiful classic and i have a few from the mario advance get this for teh collection is a most have great graphics very original will give you flash backs	1
Don't get me wrong - Super Mario Bros. 3 is one of the greatest games Nintendo ever made.  I remember paying an exorbitant amount of money so I could play the Japanese version before the original game was released in America - and then playing it literally all night and into the next morning.  In fact, I just had fun playing it the other day on my Super Nintendo. Which leads to the question - why the heck does this cost $29.99?  As far as I could tell, the only changes are some annoying random voice samples, and a few text changes that I can't explain (i.e. the "cards" that you get at the end of each level are now called something else - tiles, maybe?). I have a game called Mario All-Stars for my Super Nintendo.  It features four full Mario games, with extensive updates to the graphics and sound of each game.  Yet, if I remember correctly, that game sold for only $39.99 when it was brand new.  The fact that Nintendo now is selling a 10-year-old game for more than $10 is ridiculous.	-1
Sometimes, video games to me, always get a little bit too fancy, with all of the cheesy graphics, and gameplay that always has a flaw or two. Yet, there are just some classics that don't even come close to die. That does come through the case with Nintendo. They started revamping their classics from the Super Nintendo, and the original NES game systems recently, to a whole new audience, and a little thanks to the Game Boy Advance game system. Since they began in the 80's the Mario Brothers video games have never died down for a not, although there have been a few minor flaws, the whole lifeline of the most influential character from a video game, has never taken the wrong step away from the public. Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, is a remake among the classic 1990 video game Nintendo released from its original NES game system. Through it all, it works extremely well, as Mario goes through 8 different worlds, with over 80 different courses and stages, to go head-tohead with the menacing Bowser and his kids, Morton, Lemmy, Larry, Ludwig, Roy, Wendy and Iggy. The games works very well, as a new introduction to a whole new audience, since 1993, when it was issued on the classic compilation, Super Mario All-Stars for the Super NES system. This works very well, but there is a downside. The feeling of using the e-reader device here, to unlock levels, and to pay an extra amount of cash for the e-reader, and the extra e-reader cards for access to new levels for Super Mario Bros. 3 is not a very good idea. Still, you can't help but enjoy the original. It is just a great video game, and still remains as addictive as it was released over a decade ago. If you have played it before on the Super NES, as a part of the game Super Mario All-Stars, or the original release of it on the original NES, get this game. If you have the Game Boy Advance, or the Game Boy Player attachment for the Nintendo Gamecube, this is surely a must have for all gamers alike.	1
I grew up with this game so when it came out for gameboy advance, I HAD to have it.  All the old challanges and bosses, it's truly a classic.  I love the old Mario Bros. a lot more than the newer games.  All they focus on now are the graphics.  It's a pity they don't make games like this anymore.  Treasure this. About the game: Mario Bros. 3 is jammed back with levels, enemies and weapons.  It's especially good if you have an E-reader card where you can play NEVER BEFORE PLAYED levels.  As most games, each level you progress to gets harder and harder.  It's an excellent game...really, there isn't much more to say.  Buy it and you'll understand.	1
This is a great game. GREAT. It has great characters, cool graphics, tons of jobs and multiplayer. The story itself is pretty cool and the characters involved are neat. Some of them even join your team at the end of the game. I got at least 160 hours out of it. The job system is cool and you can create an awesome party. Definetly a must have. This a great game that will challenge you and amaze you. Go buy it. You'll thank me afterwards. I probably sound like an idiot, but it really is a great game.	1
Seriously, this game has taken my life away. I play during lunch break, I play during work and sometimes even at night. This is easily one of the most addictive and all around best games I have ever played. There are 5 races you can play as: Human, Verran ( a human-like species but with long ears like a rabbit), Nu Mou ( a great magic using race), Baanga ( a lizard-like race, just don't call them lizards!) & Moogle ( a standard species in nearly all Final Fantasy games ). To level and gain new abilities for your Clan( party of group members in the game, a maxium of 23 at one time ), your Clan must study abilities from weapons, armor, magical items, etc. Each ability is put into a class for each character which is called a Job. After mastering 1,2, or even 5 kinds of spelles, techniques, skills you can move on to another Job and use combo of two classes and become even more powerful. The battle system is turn based, which means you move your character, attack, use a spell, etc, then face a direction to end your move. It may seem easy enough so far, but The Judging System can mean the victory or defeat of your clan. Every battle has certian rules, for example, lets say Missle attack are banned from the fight, you will be penilized for using a missle( arrow attack ) but if you use the opposite of missle ( which is swords ) you will be rewarded with a Judge Point (JP). JP's can be used for Combo moves which deal masssive damage & with other characters which could lead into the hundreads of damage points, maybe even thousands... JP's can also be used for Totema, massive summoned creatures you get for progressing through the game, but I won't spoil any more than that. Overall this game is one of the best RPG/Strategy games EVER!! It's addictive as hell & fun as hell. For only $35 its worth any penny, every Game Boy Advance (or SP) owner should pick this up. You won't regret it.	1
Let me start off by saying that I've been a fan of the final fantsy series since FF5.  Each one has been different and had it's own good points and bad points.  As for FF Tactics Advanced, the bad far outweigh the good.  Let me tell you the good points first. 1. It's on GBA, meaning it's portable and that you can play it anywhere at anytime. 2. Player's are able to change jobs as in the original FF Tactics. 3.  The graphics are pretty decent for a GBA game. Now for the bad 1.  The Story - the story for FFTA has to be the most thoughtless and simple ones for any FF game to date.  Your character is warped into an alternate dimension where the Final Fantasy video game becomes real.  Your objective now is to find a way back home (how creative).  You join a clan of other characters and fight with other random clans throughout the game.  You advance the plot by completing various missions.  You eventually have to fight your friends from the real world who don't want to go home and convince them to go back with you.  You can basically know the whole lame story of this game before you even get halfway through the game.  I won't spoil the ending for those of you who haven't played the game (even though there's not much to spoil). 2. Laws - On FFTA the game has a set number of laws in each location and a judge watching the battle to make sure no one breaks them.  At times you can cleverly use these laws to bind your enemies from doing certain things.  However, later on in the game the game starts placing 3 laws in effect all at once.  This slows down the battles greatly and sometimes the 3 laws could be barring you from healing, using magic, or even using the fight command itself!  Sometimes they even barred me from doing dmg to animals in a battle where I was fighting 5 animals.  These laws end up being more annoying than helpful especially if you're like me and want to build characters to their max lvs and stats. 3.  Lack of Sidequests - This game has a huge lack of sidequests or other alternate things to do in the game.  You can accept extra missions from the Pubs but half of them don't even allow you to fight, but rather dispatch a clan member to complete the mission for a certain amount of time.  The extra missions where you can actually fight are often unrewarding and a waste of time.  This game lacks a Dungeon or bonus area where enemies are stronger than the final boss like in the other FF titles (ie. Deep Dungeon of FFT, Via Infinito of FFX-2, Research Cen. FF8, etc.) 4. Sound - If you've played any FF titles before then I'm sure you know what I mean when I say that the music on this game is weak.  The tunes on the other games were so good that you would go to some areas just to hear the music and would later find yourself humming the tunes.  However, on this game that isn't the case. 5. Difficulty - Square usually tries to balance the FF games.  Not make them to hard but then again not to easy either.  This one falls in the category with the "kiddie game stigma" that plagues Nintendo today.  The game is far too easy for anyone who's played and beaten the other FF titles.  They made this one in order to ensure that all 6-14yr olds would be able to beat this game. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to a normal RPG fan.  Get this one ONLY if you feel the need to have every Final Fantasy game in your collection or if you're not bothered by the huge number of flaws in this game (I would have listed more if I had more space).	-1
Ask any long-time Mario fan what the best game out of the series is, and a likely response will be Super Mario Bros. 3. This game introduced the idea of multiple abilities for Mario, and took the successful Mario Bros. 1 formula and extended it to more varied worlds. I spent innumerable hours playing the original SMB3, and I poured an equal amount of time into it on the SNES in the form of Mario All Stars. Now here we are again with SMB3 on the Game Boy Advance. Is it still fun? You bet! The game has been left largely unchanged except for graphical and audio upgrades, and the addition of a save game function - definitely a welcome feature, given the length and difficulty of the game. The GBA version has a few additions up its sleeve, namely the ability to scan items and levels in using the e-Reader add-on. You can read in items from Super Mario World (like the cape), levels from other Mario games, and other cool stuff. The only drawback here is that you need two GBA systems and a link cable, since there's no way to have the SMB3 cartridge inserted while also using the e-Reader. Definitely not a convenient feature, but a cool one nonetheless if you have the tools to do it. And the stuff you scan in is saved to the cartridge for later use. This fourth Mario Advance game also includes the now-tired rendition of the original Mario Bros. arcade game. Lord knows why Nintendo feels this is worth including with every game - a little variety would be nice! It's there if you want it, but it's nothing to write home about. Anyway, the final word on Super Mario Advance 4 is this: Mario Bros. 3 is still a blast to play, and I believe it deserves a place in the collections of both Mario newbies and veteran Nintendophiles alike. This is platform gaming at its finest, folks. Don't miss it!	1
To begin with, cast aside your doubts, oh ye who played the original Tactics on the PSX. Cast them aside and open your mind to the possibilities that a Tactics game could and DOES work on the GBA. As involving as this little game is, comparisons between the two would not do FFTA justice. This is a different game, different storyline, and a phenonmenal piece of gaming history all in it's own right. From the simple beginnings of Marche, you immerse yourself in a world of highly detailed combat, strategy, and intense blow-by-blow moves. Your troops can be customized to your liking. Don't like the Thief? Switch him to a Soldier. Need to customize? How about a Mage with Shield Break (from the Soldier's set)? This level of finesse deserves a bow to Square-Enix and to Nintendo. Remember, folks, FFTA is a strategy/RPG with heavy emphasis on the strategy portion. This is NOT FFX2! There is a storyline, yes, and it advances quite nicely at the finish of certain "jobs", however, what it does NOT have is bottomless depth. All in all, however, any fans of previous Square titles, and even those that were fans of the original FFT, will find a worthy addition to their GBA libraries. Sound, gameplay, mechanics, it's all here. Enjoy your adventures in this compact world.  :)	1
If you like final fantasy, you won't want to miss this. The fights take 10-20 mins each, but you can save at any time. The manual is a bit vague... just remember to hit start during a battle to save and nullify laws.... bottom line, buy it, even if you don't know anything about final fantasy.	1
With the never-ending onslaught of SNES re-releases being pumped out onto the GBA, it is surprising that it took them this long to release "Super Mario Bros 3", which is in my opinion the best of the entire series. As with the earlier Mario ports, the translation is flawless, and there are a few tweaks that bring it up to date for the GBA. I first played this game and beat it many times, so sitting down to play it again was like riding a bicycle...you never really forget. I quickly adapted and remembered all the hidden portals, the hidden 1 ups, and all the extra perks that made this game so much fun. As far as the port goes, it is very similar to the one on "Super Mario All Stars" for SNES, but with the graphics and music slightly pumped up. The game itself needs no introduction, except for the fact that it is one of the best video games of all time. The challenge, the new improvements made on an old concept (remember, this game was a product of the late 80's video game craze), all the classic elements are still here. There are some who would complain that the GBA is just a portable SNES, but what is the problem with that? It is great to this game made available for a whole new generation. The minor quibbles I have are nothing to do with the gameplay itself, but with the "extras" that are included. For starters, the addition of the original arcade version of "Super Mario Brothers", which is the exact same one they have included on the other two Mario ports on the GBA. It would be nice to have different games to play as extras, and the same game gets pretty tiring after a while. The other annoyance is the horrible voice characterizations in the game. Mario, in his cheesiest Italian accent, says "Mama Mia!" when he dies, and "Just what I needed!" when he gets a power-up. These were amusing for about 2 seconds on the other Mario ports, and are just annoying now after hearing them a million times! This is so far the best NES/SNES port to the GBA, and I had no hesitation about purchasing it again, despite knowing the game like the back of my hand. For any fan of classic gaming, this is essential. For the uninitiated, Mario never got better than this, so this is essential! Highly recommended.	1
I remember when this game first came out on the original NES, I rented it and had a sleepover with 3 friends. The funny thing was that there was a huge waiting line to rent the game and we waited like a month before we got to rent it. When we finally got it, the game had a red ribbon on it and was shaped wierd. It only took us turning on the NES to realize that we had gotten a Japanese version of the game! Who cared though! From that night on, I realized that a revolution in the Mario games was born. I was in 4th grade at the time. I truly can not express how happy that I am that I can play this graphically redone masterpiece again on my own television(game boy player for my Cube). I love this game and recommend it to everyone!	1
Try this game because it is great to be jumping on people it is a unique game and i hope you enjoy it.	1
It's simply awesome to have the classic Mario gameplay back, and on Gameboy Advance, too!  After getting my PS, PS2 and Xbox I stopped playing Mario for a while, partly because the game franchise was getting a bit stale.  But after all these years, it's refreshing to be playing this all-time classic on a portable console.  The graphics looks excellent on GBA SP with the backlighting.  If you are an old-timer Mario fan this is nothing new but it provides fun on the run.  If you have never played a Mario game before, this is the one to start with and you'll see why so many of us "old people" got hooked in the first place.	1
Nintendo could learn a thing or so from its past.  Being a gamer of the NES generation, I was never really taken in by Yoshi's Story, Super Mario 64, or even Super Mario Sunshine.  The concepts in those games seem remote, complicated, and foreign. I don't doubt that these are great games in someone's mind, but then again, I was exposed to Super Mario Bros. 3.  And after you've played SMB3, you realize that Mario probably hit his peak in this amazing title. In SMB3, we learn that beyond the Mushroom Kingdom lies the Mushroom World.  True to his nature, King Koopa abducts Princess Toadstool.  And this time, Koopa isn't alone.  He unleashes the seven Koopalings - his ill-mannered children - to wreck havoc in their airships all across the Mushroom World.  And to add insult to injury, they've used their Magic Wands to transform the rulers of the Mushroom World's seven realms into animals!  Naturally, it's up to Mario to restore the peace. Unlike SMB2 which had you throwing vegetables around, SMB3 gets back to basics by making Mario stomp on enemies to destroy them.  Of course, traversing 87 levels would be uninteresting if this were the only gameplay mechanic and Nintendo knew this.  In addition to Fiery Mario (who can shoot fireballs), SMB3 marked the introduction of Raccoon Mario and flight in general.  That's right - Mario can fly in this game and you'll need this ability to reach the multitude of secret areas here.  But that's not all.  There are also the special Frog, Tanuki, and Hammer suits, Lakitu's Cloud to float over troublesome areas, P-Wings to allow constant flight for one level, Anchors to prevent airships from escaping, Music Boxes to put the Hammer Bros. to sleep, and the list goes on!  Needless to say, there is a ton of stuff to do in SMB3, and I haven't even touched on the mini-games. This version of SMB3 primarily borrows graphics from the 16-bit Super Mario All-Stars interpretation, but adds some new features of its own.  Aside from various graphical embellishments (the walls closing in when you approach Boom-Boom the fortress guard, or the new intro sequence), some gameplay elements have also changed.  Coins seem sprinkled more liberally now.  Additionally, the spade square on the world map is now complemented with heart squares and others that allow you to get up to seven extra lives rather than three.  Personally, I never found SMB3 to be that difficult and it's somewhat mysterious that Nintendo would make it even easier.  Sound is akin to All-Stars once again, but most of the sound effects are lifted from Super Mario World.  Like the other Advance titles, Mario has the gift of gab here and speaks in his pseudo-Italian accent.  Lastly, you can save your progress on the world map (something that was conspicuously missing in the original SMB, but resolved in All-Stars). Overall, this is a superb game and argubly one of the best NES titles period.  I still remember buying that big yellow box about ten years ago and how I couldn't wait to play SMB3 on the NES.  Now that it's on the GBA, I can do it all over again.  And this game is just as sweet today as it was ten years ago and I would recommend it to everyone who owns a GBA.  Truly an astonishing game.  5/5 stars.	1
This the bes game ever to come out for gba and i love it i also play it everyday at school and at home on my big screen and gameboy player. My parents also love to play it on my gameboy player. I really recommed this game if u love mario and u actually need a good game to go along with your gba sp. Thanks	1
Final fantasy Tactics advance is probably among the greatest games i have ever played. when i was younger, i remeber watching my brother play final fantasy tactics for hours on end, and i became completely enthralled by it. Not only have thay managed to create an entirely diferent storyline, character class system etc... but they gave you an option of how long it lasts. The game starts out in the snowy town of St. Ivalice, and then, Mewt (a reccuring charicter whom you never use) opens a magic book, and wishes that the world could be like the game Final Fantasy (lets ignore the redundancy shall we?) and hazzah! the world becomes just like game. Within the game, you fing Montblanc, a moogle who lets you into his clan (small army), and from then on out, you fulfill missions,  lead your clan, and boost up your characters, all while trying to destroy five crystals, and finding a way back home. All in all, this game is emmensly addictive, they give you the option of beating it slowly or quickly depending on wheather or not yoiu want to make alot of sidequests. The battle play is increadibly fun, and your guys can learn some really cool attacks. graphics aren't the best ive ever seen, but are in no way bad. If you are looking for an absolutely fantastic game, i'd suggest Final Fantasy Tactics Advance hands down.	1
I have written 3 reviews changing my mind consantly,good bad ,now I its my favorite gba game. This game is not like any ff game Ive played,but its a good change. The graphics RULE the best Iv ever seen on gba(golden sun1and2 don't apply) 9/10 the gameplay is great and fits gameboy version 8/10  the sound sounds like it comes from the tv 9/10 Overall,9 and one half This game rocks, don't let others tell you diffrent, unless you don't like final fantasy. Buy this and you will enjoy it.	1
This is the best game EVER. Get it or be square j-nf	1
You can't. Oh yeah, it's back. Now, mind you, I never once owned the NES but this game did have arcade playability (remember those 6-in-one arcade machines where you had to dump in quarters for playing time?) Well, although they're probably absolete now, I was victim to playing this game almost every morning before going to elementary school, using an endless amount of pocket change. Now I look back, 14 years later, through all the 3-D stimulating crap surfacing on overly-priced state-of-the-art machinery, retro games are looking and playing a whole lot better. Thus, we have Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3. Anyone who's anyone, who was old enough to remember, has played this gem or heard about it or seen some screenshots ("The Wizard"). What can I say about this game? The graphics are top-notch, the controls are still the same, and don't let the shortness of each level fool you....after conquering some of the most challenging and mind-numbing puzzles and paradoxes laid before you, you'll be glad to find that pipe and clear a level. The many costumes Mario can acquire is genius. The flying raccoon, the jumping frog, the Hammer suit, the Tanooki suit....it gave an unique twist all it's own (don't forget the rabbit ears in Super Mario Land 2 on GB, in which he glides) The secrets, mini-games, bosses, level designs....who needs an eloborate story? It's straight-forward: save the land! I guess the next question now would be what's SMA5 gonna be? Until then, grab a feather and come fly with Mario in an unforgettable adventure!	1
This game rocked in the 80's and 90's and it still rocks today on the GBA! This game is cute and tons of fun to play when you're bored or traveling a long distance. It is exactly 100% like the Nintendo version from way back when and I highly reccomend this wonderful and exciting game for ALL ages!	1
The premise of the game is dirt simple, in that it's just a series of battles/missions, over and over.  Yet I can't put the thing down.  I get that determination - "I must make my characters stronger!  Level up!  Better armor!" and it's addictive. The battle scenes are turned based and play out slowly, and as such, you can play this game for a very long time.  After twenty hours of game time, I was still not even 1/3 finished.  Plus replayability is high, because you can create a new clan with an entirely different character makeup.	1
I must confess that I am far from finished with this game, I'm about half way into it, but I have played enough to get to know how I feel about it. Over all this highly anticipated title is great, and I'm grateful to see a Square (Now called Square Enix) game back on a Nintendo console. Although Square's support has been Sony exclusive for the last two generations Square is finally moving away from that bringing at least three titles to a Nintendo system in some form or another. Naturally if these games do well its a safe assumption that there will be more, and considering that many of the older Final Fantasy fans are Nintendo fans to begin with this is a guaranteed success.  FFTA is the sequel to the massively popular Final Fantasy Tactics on Playstation. The original took concepts of the Ogre Battle Series and merged them with the world of Final Fantasy to create what has been heralded by many as the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time, even if it is not a part of the main series. Tactics 2 is just as immersive, just as deep, and just as fun, but a lot more light hearted, a lot less dark, and a game that some could argue would be geared toward a younger audience. The story is far from unenjoyable, but it's not as dark, or thought provoking as its predecessor, or the latest entry in the Tactics Ogre series either. However, if you enjoy deep children's classic epics, along the lines of The Never-ending Story, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, etc then you will find this game very highly enjoyable, and frankly I am still a huge fan of the aforementioned films from which the game obviously draws its inspiration.  Game play wise, however there is one massively annoying flaw. The game features judges who impose laws on you that restrict your battle options. Many of the laws will completely hinder your progress unless you have the appropriate anti-law card with you and sometimes its hard to get just the right anti-law card for just the right occasion. It gets annoying to forget you're not supposed to use a sword in battle and suddenly the game is over because you strike a monster with one. The game would have still been very deep game play wise without the laws. The laws are an annoyance, but do not stop the game from being enjoyable. I merely hope that future installments of the series will abandon the law system. Square, it's nice to have you back, welcome home! I look forward to your next two games, Sword of Manna for GBA, and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for GameCube. Of course for you Playstation owners out there (which includes me too, I have all three systems) there's Final Fantasy X-2 and XI right around the corner. It'll be a good year for Square fans.	1
Poans any other gameboy advance game. I would give this game 50 stars if i could. I'm so gald they remade this game for the GBA the other mario games they had out for it were like super mario 2, and let me tell you i hated that mario. Numba 3 is d a bomb.	1
The Mario Bros. are back! And with more revenge. It certainly beats all other Super Mario Games by Nintendo. The story goes that the Kaopalings have stolen the magical wand from each world and have turned them into animals. The game is a pure thrill. I can guarintee u that u will enjoy it a lot. The levels are not so easy,not so tough. It's the perfect combination of skill and strategy. The Racoon and Tanooki Mario are super cool. I always enjoy throwing off the turtule shells into enemies. Thogh Mario is the main character,I prefer playing with Luigi too. This game goes to to The parent"s choice awards!	1
It is finally here.  Super Marion Brothers 3 is probably the best game of all time and it set the stage for future gaming.  It offers a wide variety of stages that are all challenging in their own unique way.  While the gameplay is pretty easy it dosen't seem to get repeditive.  I recommend this game to anyone.	1
I bought this game for my girlfriend in order to justify my staying up countless nights playing my XBox! She's always loved the Mario games, especially Super Mario Bros 3. As I suspected, she is loving it, but I am also having a hard time putting it down! The minor tweaks that were introduced in this version aren't as big as some would lead you to believe, and it's still the same games that we all enjoyed for the NES! This game alone is worth getting a Gameboy.	1
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a very different form of RPG. Like Crystal Chronicles, Tactics uses a completely different approach in terms of battle system. Battles are still turn based but the way you control the party is very different. Regular FF games in the numbered series have your party and the enemies lined up on different sides and take turns to attack. However, in Tactics, it employed a similar system with the N64 RPG Aidyn Chronicles: you have you to move around the battle field, find vantage points to get the highest damage rate to yoru enemies. Unlike Aidyn Chronicles, which you have a very free choice of locality in terms of positioning your party, Tactics employed the grid system. So instead of a battle arena, you have your party standing on a grid battle field with varied landscape and how many grid squares you could move will depend on how fast and what level and jobs your characters are. Similar to Aidyn Chronicles, you need to position your characters at favourable spots e.g. at the back of your enemies, or standing on a higher ground in order to score the best possible damage on your enemies. The good part is the system will show you the possible hit rate and damage you would score so that you can trial and error before actually carry out the actions. It might sound hideous to taditional turn based RPG players, especially hard core FF players, but it does provide you a lot more fun in determining what kind of strategy you should use: team work or individual attacks. Battles are carried out in form of clan wars and clan mission. Clans are basically yoru party. You can have any number of people in your clan as long as you welcome them into your party, however, at the most you would only be able to use 6 in any battle. There is a huge variety and combination possibility for clan members as there are Human, Viera, Ni Mu, Bangaa and Moogle for you to choose from, and each race have their strength and weaknesses that are compatible with a huge variety of jobs to be mastered. So you would need to plan on how you want your clan to develop in the long run. Clans earn their living by taking up missions and involving in clan wars. Missions are in the form of action mission, dispatch mission and negotiation mission. Action mission involves real battle controlled by yourself but the other two involve dispatching your clan members to handle them themselves. So the more well trained your clan members are the higher chance for you to be successful in those missions. Again this involves the tactics and strategies of developing your clan members. The story is unfolded during different missions (and they tend to me more expensive ones too) so if you want to proceed with the story you would definitely need to buy missions from the pub. Also your characters will level up automatically provided they score experience points with successful actions during the battles. So if you intend to train up a strong clan make sure everyone got a chance to participate in various battles. Further the stronger your clan, the bigger is the sphere of influence of your clan and the better negotiation power your clan will have in the world of Ivalice (your clan will level up in a similar manner as your character). In all, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a very strategic RPG game which is pretty addictive to players. Nonetheless, when you first start the games, battles might take ages to finish until your characters are strong enought to cause one or two hit kills. Lastly, always advice team works in battle and the most important is, you can link up with another GBA game with your friends and use two clans or more together to explore the world of Ivalice. Doesn't this sound cool?	1
When news of a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics spread, it seemed the world became merrier, peaceful, and precious.  So it is real, I may have thought, dreams can come true.  Yet, as hype can sometimes turn as a spiteful enemy, journalists professed that the next installment to FF Tactics was not proper to its heir.  Totally unsurprised and a wee bit infuriated, I still clung on to my gaming faith to see how Square Enix's first U.S. game fared.  Its been quite a wait, and a Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is finally available.  Those journalists were right though, the game doesn't truly feel as an authentic sequel.  Gone are the Lion Wars, the distraught St. Aujora, the heroics of Ramza, and a considerable number of things that charted the original. It's puzzling to assume why Square does what it does.  I mean wouldn't have you gained much, much more acclaim if you were to craft a direct sequel on the next generation console?  Instead they design an unrelated story and throw it on the Game Boy Advance.  It was hard to climb out of my mountain of expectations, but once I accepted what the game was, I was aware that Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is an honorable addition to the Square Enix collection.  Ignoring my lofty hopes of a greater predecessor, in terms of the Game Boy Advance, the latest strategy whirl on the Game Boy Advance pulls off exceedingly.  Starring Marche, a rather reticent kid, he befriends two of his classmates, and because of opening a magical tome, they all awake in the world of "Final Fantasy."  Stranded there, all of them go their separate ways, living an alter life of knights, princes, fighters, wizards, and all that which delineates the realm of fantasy.  Marche, intent on going back home, finds himself destroying the mythological crystals that closely connect the world of Final Fantasy.  Protected by mighty guardians, he fights them without the knowledge that the crystals are the very foundation of how the world exists.  To an extent, I did in fact wonder how the outcome would shape, but plenty of the story went drably by and the mere incentive to play was simply based on the enjoyment of the gameplay. If you're reading this I assume that you already know the basic mechanics.  Mirroring Tactics Ogre for the Game Boy Advance, FFTA is a traditional, Turn-Based Strategy/RPG.  New races such as the moogle, man-sized reptiles who welcome a good clash make up the bangaa, and the chubby, unphysical spell-masters are the nu mou.  In a nut-shell, humans usually take up most classes, moogle units are both magic oriented and brave enough to take ranks as knights, the Bangaa love to wield the sword but not that of a staff, and the nu mou are the entirely opposite of the bangaa.  Its best to mix up the squadron of units because each class has their own strength and particular class to take advantage of.  Races aside, the player is allowed to have the usual limit of six characters on the battlefield, plus the regular commands.  Akin to the original, most of the commands are determined by the which class is chosen, as well as the secondary class. The plot advances as the player chooses to sign up for Missions located in the pub of every town.  Players must pay for the information and agree to take up a Mission to take on villains.  After the battle, players are given profits and AP points.  Unlike the traditional benefits of gaining levels, where abilities are mastered, FFTA works in ways of FFVII.  Equipped weapons, like materia, present abilities to a character.  It takes a certain amount of AP points before the character permanently attains the ability desired.  Fortunately, gaining the abilities is quick, since most battles rewards players with plenty of points and EXP.  Also, Pub's offer solo missions for individual characters.  They can either fail or succeed, if so, they are rewarded individual AP points, gil, and items. Sharing a little from Secret of Mana on PS1, the player has the decision where to place locations on the map.  An observant player would also note that specific locations can trigger a treasure to pop up for the taking. Battle is also regulated by laws.  At every battle, the player can read what action is illegal.  Should a player break a law, the fully armored judge, who rides a chocobo, casts the defiant character with either a minor yellow card or a serious red card.  As a rule, the cards lead up to a jail sentence for an amount of time, depending on the character's history and actions.  At times a player can forget to check on the laws.  What's more, there are occurrences when I had to change weapons, classes, and try different approaches to saturate the enemy in defeat.  And when the essential things like items or cure spells are forbidden frustration can build up fast. As any other Tactical RPG, FFTA is a joy to see your cast grow up as their stats increase.  Buying and receiving an formidable arsenal and possessing the option to choose a myriad of classes is part of the fun.  I really immersed myself into the game.  Taking the role of clan to battle others was refreshing, and the clan itself, the default name of "Nutsy," having the ability to level up as well just augmented that.  As the player accomplishes more and more missions, and send individual units to partake in others, the clan stats increase depending on the kind of mission.  Superior to Tactics Ogre, yet another gem, FFTA maintains the Square Enix name we can usually trust.  With over 300 missions to conquer and other optional quests, FFTA can strip the player's hours without him even knowing.  Although, some say FFTA takes an extra step to get into, I would rebuke by saying this game is rather easy to master.  I knew FFTA would be different, and it is.  Despite its overall lackluster appearance, it still controls to grab the player's attention and be engrossed to the reminiscence of Final Fantasy Tactics.  FFTA is your average schmoe in the plot area.  Marche is given the chance to live his wildest dreams of a hero slaying the baddies, yet he feels going home is for the best.  After all he has a sick, wheel-chair ridden brother to take care of.  While, the story isn't as boorish as many claim, I had quite some fun engaging the story and penned up a fanfic.  So if a game can inspire a gamer to write a story behind it, then it can't be that bad can it?  But then again, I usually write one after each RPG I've bought.  Be the judge yourself.  Just don't send me to prison.  And don't throw me a red card, not the red card!  Where is Ezel, the nu mou inventor of the antilaw which supercedes the unlawful actions?  Where is he? Closely parallel to Tactics Ogre's performance, FFTA on the GBA screen is full of color.  The sprites are big, but do not reflect how the characters look in the actual gaming manual.  Such as the moogles, they are petite, but are far too overgrown on the screen.  No biggie though, its just the Game Boy Advance.  Graphically, you can't demand too much, for there is no mad need for eye-candy, is there?  As far as the audio goes, you can forget it to even reach as far as the original's unforgettable score.  FFTA's music is just decent and repetitive.  I suggest to conserve battery life, turn the music down, and just listen to your fancy of a musical genre.  The only important quibble I have on the graphics are the instances when slow down bog the game down and no rotating camera.  Slow down occurs when a character is moving and jumps on a higher or lower platform.  Despite it, its not too much of a threat.  With well over average tunes, a good look to it and distinguishable characters, the presentation is done right. Yeah, the title is very deceptive, but I have to forgive Square Enix, because there has been a real drought of RPGs.  In the wait for the more engrossing titles, you can sit back, take a load off (not literally), and get into this commendable game.  Handling easily enough, playing even better, FFTA was well worth the wait, but I don't agree to the common price of $40, nor the unconnected storyline.  Somehow I think I'm being cheated by the heavy price and misleading titles of late.  Oh well, I guess I have to bear it all, and suck it up like a man.  Gotta be thankful for all these incredible games, man.	1
This is not the traditional roaming Final Fantasy RPG game. Instead this is in the same format as the amazing Tactics Ogre (GBA) game, where it is a speed based strategy / RPG. This is not a sequel to Tactics Ogre, but it does use the same system, which is you are a commander of a band of do-gooders, called a "clan." Your clan can consist of dozens of members and to gain gold, you must visit pubs at towns and take on missions. The missions have different plots but they are all basically traveled to a place and defeat all of the enemies or a boss.  This is one of the most realistic role-playing games in existence, because with a normal RPG, you wander the countryside looking for a battle, when you find it, you have a choice, fight, use magic or run. With Ogre Tactics, when you battle you see an entire landscape of a battle area, trees you can hide behind, mountains, water and so on. Where you must then control each character of your army (up to six can be in a battle at a time). Control them to move, fight, use spells, special abilities, items, and use real battle tactics! Maneuver a character behind an enemy and have them stab the enemy in the back! Have your archers take the high ground and bombard the enemy with arrows or you can fight the enemy head on! There are dozens of weapons, spells with dazzling graphics, armor and so on to equip to characters of your clan. The reason why I am calling members of your clan  "characters" is because there are several character classes and races. There are classes such as knights, soldiers, magicians, clerics, archers, thieves, ninjas, beast tamers, dragon tamers, musket men and more. The races vary from humans, fairies, mermaids, moggles, lizard-like people and beasts such as antoids, griffins, dragons and giant hounds. Throughout the game randomly people will ask to join your clan. What is really nice about this game is to mix things up it has dispatch missions where it requires you send out someone of your clan for a few days to do the mission themselves. You do not see their action, but they come back successful or not. Another nice twist of the game is that there are rival clans to compete against and turf wars. For each battle you control in the game there are different rules for each area you battle in, rules such as no blinding, or ganging up. If a character dies during combat he is only "knocked out" until the battle is won, however there is also an impartial referee to carry out these rules, if you break a rule you get a warning, the second time you are thrown in prison for a penalty of a few days (so that person cannot compete in the present battle or any others while in prison). The story in this game is not as strong as it is thick, because of its endless twists and turns to the story. Each twist adds a new depth to the game.	1
SMB3 is the best Mario platform game (i can't say "the best of all" because i haven't played SM64 and the Mario game of the Game Cube), but what is that about "ripping" vegetables from the ground (a la SMB2) and using the magic cape? (ala SMW). The SMB2 remake for the GBA suffered from montruosity alterations from the original SMB2... is this game is going to be the same? if that's right, what a shame	1
Obviously as this review is written the game isn't out yet but who the hell didn't play Super Mario Bros. 3 in its older days? In 1990 this was THE game to get! It had the biggest selling release of all time until 1999 when the more than disappointing FFVIII came around. I'm not reviewing the NES one but rather the SNES one since that's the one we're going to get obviously! This is the best Mario game ever made! The only one that could possibly be better than this is probably Super Mario RPG on the SNES. I'll admit I was disappointed when Nintendo re-released Super Mario Brothers 2 and then they SKIPPED THE BEST MARIO GAME and came out with a re-release of Super Mario World and then Super Mario World 2.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard thatt they skipped this one! The reason why this is the greatest Mario game is because this focuses on EXACTLY what a game should focus on (Back 13 years ago especially) and that is gameplay! These days gameplay is what games tend to lack. They get tediously long (making you never want to go through it all again) and are much too focused on storyline that they forget what keeps people coming back to the game and that's gameplay. Graphically this was by far the best looking NES game in those days and on the SNES it was just so much better looking.  However, I can't say the same for the music. I LOVED the music on the NES version but in the SNES version the music got worse. Sadly because of the GBA it WILL be worse on the GBA (Super Mario Brothers 2 had worse music as well in it's re-releases). The controls scheme of course is top notch and easy to do as it is in most Mario games. If you're like me you were without a doubt a little displeased with Super Mario Sunshine.  But this game will make up for that. However, I still don't like that once again we're getting a RE-release of a classic game for the GBA. When are we going to get a NEW Mario game on the gameboy advance? We've been waiting FOREVER! Still, when this game is released remember the old NES days and the SNES days and you'll KNOW why this is the best Mario game of all time.	1
First thing: If you are a diehard fan of the PSX version, do not play this game expecting it do be the same.  It is a very different, and in my opinion, annoying at times.   The main character is a very young child, which goes along with the new trend of games (younger and younger).  The plot is shallow and easy to follow [I am halfway through the game].  There are many more job classes, however, most have the same abilities of each other, just with different names.  Skills are learned like in FF9; through equiped items.  The game is far too easy for any skilled player.  It allows 6 team members in a battle, but the battles can be won with only 2 [without building levels in random battles].  The only difficulty comes from 'Laws' governing your battles.  Because if you don't pay attention, your players can get arrested.  The 'Laws' are an original idea, however, and help make the game interesting.   Eventually, certain races can summon special monsters, which can kill bosses instantly.  No effort, no fun.   My main complaint is the characters.  There is no way to make them original.  You CANNOT name them.  Certain claases are only available to certain races.  Humans' genders change with job changes [Karl,my Fighter, switches to paladin.  His face changes to a female look with long hair, makeup, and earrings. Same with Illusionist and white mage].  Also since certain jobs are for certain races, everyone learns everything quickly and they all become too similar.  There are also just a handfull of secret players.   I do like some things, though.  The map placement is cool, and I like the Blue and Red mages.  The graphics rock, too.  Play control is excellent, and you can take back all of your moves.  'Life' is 100% always, and 'Item' is automatic.   OVERALL, It's Fianl Fantasy 9 set to Final Fantasy Tactics.  It's geared for players less than 15 years of age that get confused easily.  I don't know why its still addictive to me.	-1
Alot of problembs with this game. The Storyline, battlestyle, movement, charachters, and play is VERY CONFUSING. I Seriously LOVED FFTactics, but this, this is just...no. You don't call this FF and let it go unnoticed. I used to be a dedicated FF fan, they all got booring though. Please, for everyone's sake, don't get hooked on the Final Fantasy series. You just waste your money and time. I suggest *Onimusha, Metal Gear Solid, or the Tenchu series*. They all have very good storylines and ALOT of in-your-face action. Anyways, FFT:A's graphics and music are the ONLY things I liked about it. Otherwise, I just plain disliked it.	-1
Now first off, i have not played any FF game before this one so i cannot compare it to any of them. This game is great, and alot of fun. ok, the best part of this game is the job system. There are five races in the game and each have their own strength and weaknesses and have jobs to match. There are two types of jobs; Basic and Expert. Basic jobs are jobs that the characters can use and the don't require any abilities from other jobs to get. expert jobs usually require a certain number of skills from 1 or two basic (and maybe an expert job or two) jobs to get.  The battle system is a little tricky but it doesnt take long to get used to it. There are also a few kinds of missions; Story Missions (there is about 30 of them), those procede the story line. and then SubQuest Missions(which u get by completing story missions)that really don't procede the story but has u do certain things.(there are around 300 of these)  there are types of missions; Fighting(which is obvious) and dispatch(where u send one clan member on his/her own to do something)  Ok, the Graphics are all right, pretty good for a gba The sound is ok as well The Gameplay is awesome with hours of gameplay. The Job system is complicated but easy to understand Over all 5 stars. BTW the Players Guide for this game is highly recommended because it tells you how to get all the jobs, what each job is good for, what weapons give what abilites and who they give it to.  MAKE SURE U GET THE OFFICIAL NINTENDO PLAYERS GUIDE	1
I'd like to implore you to NOT compare this game to the FFTactics for the Playstation.  For just a moment, weigh this game against itself.  Evaluate it for what it IS, and not what it isn't. People may be upset because this is not like the original.  But for that reason I am very thankful.  Not to say that the original Tactics wasn't wonderful; it remains one of my favorite FF titles to date.  What I mean to say is that it's different.  I know that the story is not as mature as the first one.  I know that the music is not quite as bombastic as that of the original (From what I've heard so far, anyway).  But Final Fantasy Tactics Advance presents its own story, its own set of characters and its own battle system, which in my opinion is just as good as that of the first Tactics.   The Job system has been redesigned, and takes into account what race a character is.  While it's true that both a Human and a Moogle can obtain the Thief job, there are differences in stats and abilities due to their racial diversity.  There are five different races, and each one has advantages and weaknesses, along with several Jobs that are unique to that particular race.  This new concept is amazing and innovative, and results in very different, customized characters.   Abilities are obtained through the use of specific items, much like the ability system of FFIX.  Many items boast abilities for multiple classes, and each ability takes a certain amount of AP (Points received at the end of battles or side quests) to fully learn.  Once a character completely masters an ability, they no longer need to have the item equipped to use that skill.  Needless to say, this interesting system will lead to hours upon hours of gameplay.   Concerning the story, I do not understand everyone's complaints.  While it's a fact that the original FFTactics had a much more serious storyline, that does not mean that this one is not just as entertaining or creative, because that is exactly the type of plot Tactics Advance offers.  That said, I must admit that so far (I'm about six hours into the game) there is not as much CONTENT storywise, but what's there certainly shines.  Three young people who have grown tired of the cruel, boring life of the norm awaken mysterious writings within an ancient volume of unknown origin.  The book morphs their world into the realm of Final Fantasy, one that they have all longed for.  Differences emerge when the three attempt to decide whether to go home or stay in the adventure.   From whatever angle you look at it, this game is undeniably exceptional.  Consider the fact that this is a GBA game, and you MUST commend SquareEnix for this masterpiece.   Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the store to get a ton of batteries.	1
Final Fantasy Tactics surpised many Final Fnatasy gamers at the sudden twist in Gameplay and style, which ultimetly led it to be a cult classic in the gaming world.  Now Final Fantasy Tactics advanced has arrived with a little lighter storyline, same style graphics, gameplay, and more. The story here is that you the main character are the new kid in the town of Ivalice (the kingdom in the first game)and one day you are in a snowball fight.  Your partners are your friends Ritz and Miku.  Miku is a small lad who is always picked on and ultimetly you lose the fight.  Later on that day Miku shows the main characters a book of magic which ultimetly launches them into the world of Final Fantasy. Now the games not perfect, in fact now I shall list up the pros and cons. Pros: 1: Gameplay, graphics, and menu systems are identical to the first. 2: The story is compelling and it keeps you going. 3: The new jobs and attack options are breaths of fresh air. Cons: 1: You cannot rotate the map, which ultimatly hurts some areas of battles (for you can't see around corners). 2: With the exception of one area, none of your characters can die.  They may fall in battle but there is no timer to where they die for good if not revived. 3: The difficulty is uneven.  Some battles are really easy and some are barbarically difficult.  This is mostly due to a new option called Law Cards. While the pros and cons are about equal overall this is a great game to own in your GBA library, and a highly addicting title.	1
I love The Sims, its my second favorite game right after Final Fantasty.  The Sims 2 brings us better graphics which are in 3D!  Sims can have children and they children can finaly age into adults.  Adults can age into old people and and eventually die.  There is a new life score which keeps track of their life.  The houses in The Sims 2 can finally be over 2 stories, meaning 3 stories.  The neighbor hood will have the same amount as unleashed but it won't have pets.  You can finally have a teen sim instead of making it an adult sim or child.  Sims can now have a second house which is like thier vacation house.  The graphics and people are more realistic and the people don't look so edgy and more.  Any The Sim fan would want this!	1
This game is a masterpiece, and Maxis put all they could into making this the best life simulation game available. It has many little fine details which are put in (for instance, if a child's parent comes home from work and the kid is up, they'll run out and hug their parent).  The game does have some severe issues, though. Primarily unavoidable corruption. The version found here is just the base game, and the base game has a limit of 1,000 Sims. Once you hit that limit your neighborhood screws up bad. Buying an expansion pack later than Nightlife will increase the limit to 32,767.  If you get several mods (Google "Sims 2 essential mods") you can avoid corruption for quite a long time, though if you don't play neighborhoods for a long time then you probably won't ever experience corruption in the first place. It's also suggested by many to replace the original neighborhoods shipped on the disc with some fixed up versions (they play the same as the originals! same characters and everything, but everything is fixed as far as humanly possible and a lot of junk is cleaned out of them).  The game is an absolute treat to play, and I HIGHLY suggest buying this, though I highly suggest buying all of the expansions and stuff packs since the game is rather basic and you're limited in terms of what lots and mods you can install.	1
Love this game but incompatible with new computers / windows 10. Major graphic issues. Playable if that does not bother you.	1
really disapointed the game would not even run on my computer like i wanted to i tried everything like changing the compatibility mode and nothing worked i suggest you get the deluxe or double deluxe since it is a pain in a butt to work on the computer programs we use now do not waste you're 40.00 on this game	-1
This has got to be the best The Sims game in the series. The game can easily be modified to be compatible to Windows 10 as well.	1
The game has a few glitches but since it is older, you will have to let it load, unless you want it to crash. Otherwise it's a wonderful game to play.	1
Not good for Windows 8 or anything above that, had trouble keeping it installed, had to re-install each disk every time  went to play it. (Which includes 4 disks) and takes at least 15 minutes for the whole process... So in conclusion, I then ended up downloading the FREE Sims full game on my Windows computer since this worked awfully, even after I dumbed my computer down...	-1
Purchased for my daughter. She wanted the latest version but it reviewed poorly, this one reviewed well. Some maturish themes, but no worse than what is on television today. I played the first and found it to be too much work living a sims life, but she loves it and if it makes her happy... :-)	1
Great product	1
Daughter Loved !!!	1
I played this game when i was younger i bought a ps2 2 years ago i totally forgot how fun this game was	1
Fun game	1
This really is the best of the series. Probably a lot of ssx fans that love other games in the series get tired of hearing it, but that's pretty much 20% opinion and 80% true. They aren't calling it the best for nothing. SSX Tricky is the first to do uber tricks, but they can't deny, SSX 3 took it to the next level. They had their on radio station, and for just 3 peaks, they still had a lot of places to race.	1
Even after the sequels and expansion packs that have come and gone since, I keep finding myself going back to The Sims 2! The game play style was really revolutionary and addictive. I prefer it over The Sims 3 and have found many others that agree! If you're a fan of the original or just looking for something new to try out, you really can't go wrong here.	1
Another game my son loves	1
Love it, Love it, Love it.	1
Love it	1
The Sims 2 is the sequel to The Sims 1. This is the base game. The Sims 2 takes your world of Sims to a whole new level. The Sims 1 was all isometric camera angles, while this game is in full 3D. You have full control over your characters, and they go through many life stages. You can have babies, toddlers, teenagers, adults, and elders.  The game has many options from buy mode, build mode, you can share your work and the game runs very well even on older computers. If you enjoy the Sims , you will really love this game, and in my opinion, I find this game better than the Sims 1, 3, or 4!	1
Heaps of fun	1
I love this game just soooooooooooooooo much!!!!!! Alway's play it on my Play-station.	1
I played this when i was younger, and I still love this game.	1
I will say this I love the game	1
This is one of the best sims games along with sims 1!tottaly worth five stars!	1
I recently acquired an old PS2 from a buddy who is moving, I immediately went and re-bought this old classic. STILL love this game!	1
138$ for this lame, boring, annoying game??? I hope no one is dumb enough to pay that price.  The Sims 2 is just as boring, stupid, pointless and annoying as the first one.  Lets simulate going to work, raising a family, eating, using the bathroom wow what a game.  I play games to get away from reality for a few hours not to simulate it.....my god go and cook your dinner, pay your bills, go to work and have some kids....you just played sims.  LAME!!!	-1
Im sorry for saying this but this game is not worth a second look.me and my father love the MOH series, but we beat it in 3 hours. It is very unchallenging and a waist of money. Now that you can buy this game for 5 dollars i think its worth it. if your spending anything over 15 dollars don't consider buying this game. A complete putdown to moh lover.  the graphics are no good and its bugged. it takes 5 sniper rounds to kill 1 enemy, rediculous. also u can shoot the enemy in the head and he will flinch, :P   i know cause Im acually done beating it.  i don't recommend this game to any1.	-1
This game would take about about an hour to play if the controls and weapons were at all responsive. Some of the environments look pretty, put the enemy fighters are straight out of a windows 95 first person shooter. People complain about suppossed racism in the GTA series, but our group of racially mixed gamers found the asian enemies in Rising Sun to be offensive stereotypes beyond anything in Vice City. Unlike Vice City, which is violent with an obvious tongue in cheek sarcasm, this game wraps it's racial violence with themes of patriotism, making Rising Sun truly disturbing.	-1
The Medal of Honor games have always been great.  Until now.  This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline.  It is short and the AI, as far as I can tell, is actually worse than in the previous game.  The "Pacific Battlefield" looks like a sandwich made out of doo-doo brown and mud.  Real pretty it is.  I couldn't tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a Phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead (sp?)  The gameplay is a little tedious, as well. Maybe it is a good rental...This is worth about $10 +/-. If you pay $50 for this then I have a broken 32x for the Sega Genesis with no cables for just $200.  That's cash only, and this is a one-time offer.  Send all payments to: Raoul Drake 515 Pensacola Hooker Ave. Shattaboulasuchi, LA 99999999-9999. Stay sober!	-1
I am going to keep it simple, I am crying right now. This game is too short. DO NOT WASTE you 50$ It took me and my roommate 3 hrs to beat. :( my money WASTED	-1
the sims 2 is the best horrible game of all time.  let me explain.  the sims 1 was incredibly boring to me.  i got the idea of the game, but there was no point, the graphics were awful, and it was just lame.  so i was hesitant to try the sims 2.  however, when i first got it, i was amazed.  the graphics?  amazing.  the load times?  no problem on my computer.  the tutorials?  perfect.  the learning curve?  piece of cake.  i was up and running, and totally addicted in no time.  i played for hours on end, imagining that the sims 2 was the one shining star of video games, the one game that dared to do something different AND IT WORKED.  how completely, terribly wrong i was.  the sims 2 has a great deal of potential.  the problem was, they ruined it with their much-touted "aspirations" feature.  this means, for example, that if a sim's aspiration is to be a family man, he needs to go get a girl, marry her and have kids.  or if it's career, the sim needs to get a good job.  this doesn't sound like a problem, but it completely ruins an otherwise perfect game.  why?  because, you have NO free will in this game.  NONE.  i don't care what reviews say or what anyone else says, you have NONE.  at all times, you must meet the demands of two different panels, the needs panel and the aspirations panel (and avoid fears).  what does this mean?  AT ALL TIMES YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER IS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO AT ALL TIMES.  this is entertainment?  no.  it's no different than some guy telling you "ring this bell" over and over, and you have to do it to win a game that has no reward.  now, i knew the needs panel was going to be a factor, and it's (surprisingly) fun.  who knew it could be fun to do the dishes, or lay on the couch?  this is where the sims tricks you.  then as you get addicted, you realize, for one thing, YOU HAVE NOOOOO free time.  and i mean none.  AT ALL TIMES you will HAVE to do the dishes, take out the trash, pay bills, or whatever.  i mean literally at ALL times, because this game is that demanding.  your levels are constantly falling and you're constantly trying to keep them at a reasonable or better level.  it's work, work, work.  also the "free will" option is an absolute joke.  if you use the free will option, your sim will be in big trouble.  let's say you have 4 things to do:  take out the trash, take a shower, cook a pop-tart and put it in the trash.  on free will, your sim might do 2 of those things and then be completely helpless.  the name of the sims 2 should be MICRO-MANAGEMENT TO THE MAX.  i'm not saying there aren't great things about the sims 2.  it's a very different idea (at least it seems so at first), the graphics, details, even the music playing on the sims' radios is copmletely amazing and creative.  but considering they failed on the most fundamental level of video games (to give you some control over the game, and make the game your own) makes this game a true failure.  after all, isn't that the whole point of the sims??  to make something of your own?  to have free will???  if you don't believe me, notice that all the online reviews of the sims 2 were written by reviewers who didn't play it for very long.  same thing for amazon.  one amazon reviewer wrote she was hooked on the sims 2 for a month and then got sick of it.  that's about what happened to me.  i was hooked on it until i realized what i was doing.  now i don't even want to look at this stupid game.  so expect to enjoy it for a week or so, and then be bored to tears.  you've been warned.  p.s. i also had some other problems.  you start the game, and there are 3 different neighborhoods with different houses.  this was great, until i realized there's no way to re-play these families, so once you mess with them even a little bit, your gameplay is saved and irreversible.  also i have no interest in building a new house of my own or whatever, so this seemed even more stupid to me.  also i ran across a couple of bugs.  one ruined a whole family for me- a baby fell on the floor, and a bug made it where i couldn't pick the baby up no matter what.  this made the mother so upset, she couldn't do anything.  so i had to not play that family at all.  they could have at least included more families or a way to re-play the pre-set families.	-1
I had my fun with the SIMS and somewhat with the SIMS 2, but really, why would you play this game if you can do all the stuff yourself? It's like playing an interactive life.. just play a REAL life instead of this. I would only reccomend this game to people who can't get anything and make themselves and their crush live in a house and do.. stuff... ;)  I do not like this game anymore.. sorry.	-1
its not as good as frontline while the multiplayer is somewhat fun, it doesnt make up for the easy campaign mode which can be beaten in less then 10 hours.  i can only reccomend this game to really big fans of MOH or just a weekend rental.	-1
You gotta be pretty dumb to play this game 24/7! I turned it on, didn't understand one thing going on. Racing games need a new edge. They have AWESOME graphics, no doubt, but they lack a good time. I thought this was a terrible game. Dont get this game. EA sports has done a great job with madden and nba live, but this was a big disapointment! Later	-1
I bought this game like day or or 2 after the fay it came out and i was all exited when i was installing it had this little game of some sort to entertain you will it installs the 4 discs but when i was done installing it it said "Failed to find DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics adapters in this system! Please make sure you have DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest drivers by the manufacturer. The application will now terminate." i was shocked because i was waiting a long time to play this game and i have not played it on my computer because of this error.i suggest that you do not buy this game unless you have a new computer or all upgraded things on your computer	-1
This game does not work despite the patches and tech support.  It will always crash at random times during game play.  Also, if you do get it to work, it is so slow that you decide that you don't really want to play anymore.  I'd give it a higher rating if it actually worked.	-1
<Sigh> like Frodo Took's character used to say in the game. Where to start...Of why I am glad I wasted my parent's money on this game instead of my own.  Negatives...  1. The relationships made in this game are difficult and even  harder to maintain. How come you have to interact with everyone and they do not even notice you are alive? They never intiate any conversation with you when you are at a community lot or at your house. The men in the game have a unisex personality and do not differ from the women in the house. What's the difference between making the men, men and the women, women? Their interests are the same, their conversational options are the same, "Joke" and "Chat". Starting the relationships is VERY slow, you can talk and get close to people and 2 days later they aren't your friend anymore. Snore! There is no general idea of beauty in the game, the looks don't matter, so it doesn't matter what you look like and if this is a simulation game what's real about that? Marxism in its truest form.  2. The language was cute at first but it got annoying when you had to analyze the thought bubbles to figure out how the talk was going. I made a teenager and she was the stereotypical look of beauty and she was treated no different. If you are buying this game because you want to be defiant and deviant, then you have the wrong game. The sex in the game is so far and in between, the most I got out of these lame characters was one lame kiss. You are not treated any different if you have money or not.  3. The game is made for girls, its got the frivilous collecting and decorating.  4. The neighborhood is small and on your block where your house is, if you step out of your house and look down the road its blankness of emptiness. The sims AI is weak most times when they have a problem or need like a bathroom emergency, they are standing right next to the toliet and they don't react until you direct them. They need too much food to live, too much sleep to live and too much social to live. If you are looking for a free environment in this game, how bout all the people that want this idea take it, harness it and put it into the living world!  5. The jobs & the school the sims go to are invisible. So they just disappear. The books they read are only 3 subjects to earn a skill, Mechanical, cooking and cleaning.  6. The DNA code is not really that, its a standard code dictated by the Aspiration of your parents. That is not DNA its just a computer generated code that makes for the same signs are the parents.  7. The balanced aspiration characters are boring as people, the other unstable ones act like addicts. They stay up until the dead of night when they know that they have school or work the next day. So they stay up and obessess over whatever they are lacking in, if it be creative or fun. Then their whole cycle is thrown off because they are offset, not enough sleep, comfort, social or fun.  8. Once you get behind in homework there is no catching up.  Positives...  1. You can fence your sims in the backyard and starve them to Death.  2. You can put a dead Sim family member's grave in the fence with your starving sim.  3. Death comes to all terrible Sims. The animation for Death was the best graphics in the game.  4. The graphical detail was high in the game but what you saw got boring.  5. If you abuse your brats in the game the social workers come and pick them up. That is a great feature.  Still better than Animal Crossing, but that game was a turd on a stick.	-1
I normally don't write reviews, but this time I felt it was important.  The Sims 2 is a GREAT concept, I really enjoy playing the game, but the minimum system requirements listed on the box are completely made up.  If you want to be able to enjoy this game, you need at least 512MB of RAM and a GeForce 3 or better or Radeon 7200 or better video card with at least 128MB of RAM.  You should also have a fast CPU.  800mhz might work for you, if you don't mind choppy game play and you add in some extra RAM and/or a better video card.  Trust me.  This game cost me $200 after I did all the  necessary hardware upgrades to play it, and my system met their minimum specs before I started.	-1
This game would be awesome IF IT WORKED!!! I would probably give the game 5 stars IF it did. I got the game as a gift and like alot(thousands)of other people I am extremly dissapointed with this game..I mean BUG! My PC exceeds the recommended requirements and it crashed everytime. It WILL crash anywhere from 30 seconds to 60 minutes into the game. It will sometimes crash Windows entirely(I have XP!)I've tried every video driver out there to no avail. Maxis says they're aware of the problem that "some" people are having and are supposedly working on a patch. I'd bet the farm EVERYONE is having a problem. HEY MAXIS, HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A CONCEPT, TRY TESTING YOUR STUFF BEFORE RELEASE!! NO ONE WANTS A BUG FOR A GAME! I'm glad I didn't spend my hard earned cash on this trash.	-1
My mother bought this for the family since it had to do with Karaoke and one could sing into a microphone and hear their voice out of the Television for all to admire or painfully listen through because they love you. And maybe do some of the many "options" available while you're at it. But the reason I liked this game is the option to import MP3's and WMA's onto the Xbox. Unfortunately, except for the importer, this game is a heedlessly made abnormality trying to make it on the karaoke scene. Be Warned: This game is NOTHING like the hit Karaoke Revolution on the PS2. In fact, it is not even close to it at all. Sadly, I am too late with this warning for consumers. So many of you are most likely disappointed with this game. But with the cheap genius that is Microsoft, they took out a page from a little game called Madden 2002. Where EA made very few changes to the game at all, yet they just put on the Madden trademark and they had turned trash into gold. Just substitute few changes to Windows-style eye candy and Madden trademark with an MP3 Importer, and you have a match made in heaven! And even worse than this is that people have bought this game and they will continue to buy this game only for the Importer. It is Sheer Madness!!!!  Pros: 1. The MP3 Importer (Finally fixes the infamous unreadable CD-RW problem on the Xbox)  2. Windows-Style Eye Candy (SO distracted)  Cons: 1. Windows-Style Eye Candy (SO hypnotizing)  2. Actual songs, but very cheesy versions of them (If we wanted this, we'd torture ourselves with Kidz Bop!!!)  3. Very Limited Video making capabilities.  4. Songs downloadable for $5 (like any poor sap would download them anyway?)  5. WIll cost more money for Peripherals for Importing (you first have to download the PC exporter off the internet (free), but the System link cable for connecting the two will cost you $30!)  6. And the worst sin of all for a Karaoke game: You can barely hear yourself out of the speakers!!!!!! Even with the mic set on the highest volume you still can barely hear yourself over the voices (hey, maybe they were saving the family members from certain torture) But as I said, Sheer Madness!!!!!  Final Verdict: The only reason you are ever going to come along this game in the future is for the MP3 importer and only for the MP3 Importer. This is NOT a party tool, that Abominaton that is named Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is a better party tool than this (Okay, maybe i'm stretching it way too far, let's just leave it at Halo) But yes, If you have MP3's and you want to put them on the Xbox, this is your only option (makes me sad to say that.)	-1
Graphics. Amazing. Gameplay. Amazing. The seemless evolution from Sims 1 to Sims 2 features. Amazing. Seriouly, this is a well thoughtout game, is its design and innovation. However Ill tell you what's not amazing... The fact that I can't get the freaking thing to play on my machine. I have a 2.8 P4 with a Nvidia 128 card, and 1G ram. So you can understand how I felt more than confident my machine could handle it. Um, well, you see, the game, it simply locks up. Alot. Maybe about every 5 minutes it will freeze for no aparent reason, even my angry furys of ALT-Tab, ALT-Tab, ALT-Tab, could not save me from the frozen pixelated suburban nightmare on my screen. I spent the good part of the evening trying EVERYTHING to get this sucker to work. From using the absolute lowest resolution, to turning off all background processes, to even applying a no cd crack. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. No results. So my advice to you is to keep on checking back to the Maxis website for an official patch to fix these issues. Otherwise, buy at your own risk.	-1
I bought this thinking it would continue the "awesomeness" of the others before it. I was wrong. The controls are completely backwards, and the physics and overall "feel" of the game just suffers.	-1
i know i haven't played the game yet, but if it is like its prequel and other extreme sports games like tony hawk and dave mirra, this game will be RUBBISH	-1
I thought this game was going to be just like SSx Tricky, but I was wrong.  I loved ssx Trickey levels, but ssx trickey levels are not that great.  If you want a good snowboarding game then get SSx trickey not ssx 3.	-1
This is the worst bond game ever, and possibly the worst game ever. It is not a game, it's a movie. here are the reasons it sucks: 1)EA went with the trend and went 3rd person. This disallows for any entertaining gameplay at all, because you cannot sidestep. 2)The co-operative multiplayer is a completely different story than the single player, and all of the characters you start with are generic ppl. 3)The Co-operative mode is unbelievably hard. It is like trying to shove a rhino in a soda can. It is not entertaining, and is the most frustrating thing i've ever played. 4)You must beat the first "level", which consists of about 10 cansecutive levels, of co-operative to unlock arena mode. 5)I have repeatedly completed every goal to get a platinum medal on one mission, but the game refuses to award it to me. 6)The only good things about this game are the driving levels, but they soon become repetitive and boring. 7)Pierce Brosnan's scrip is worse than that of Dyanasty Warriors 3. After having a discussion with Q about metal, Q suggests he leave. Bond says "Platinum idea, Q, lets test Diavolo's mettle." The line "Bond, James Bond" is repeated at least 4 times, and it is not dilivered well. 8)I know it's a little sexist, but the girls are ugly as hell. 9)The game is basically a remixed, retextured Enter the Matrix, only with worse hand-to-hand combat, and no focus ability. 10)The only reasons to play this game are to see John Cleese as Q, and Willem Dafoe as Diavolo (2 letters away from the spanish word for devil)	-1
Well other than the console fanboys and paid reviews I didn't see much here so I'll write a real review. Basically EA took the same horribly crippled SSX engine and pasted in 'new' game-play. Much the way the tonyhawk line went, SSX 3 is just a more complex (not to be confused with sophisticated) version of the last game with even more bugs and play issues. In the first two games these flaws weren't enough to keep me from playing the game, but SSX 3 is so horrendously awful, that I just can't play it for more than a few minutes before It disgusts me. I'm not in the know about the stability on other console versions, but the Game-Cube version has crashed on me at least a dozen times in about seven hours of on and off game-play, more than the first two games combined over a period of months ( none of my other games have crashed except Resident Evil 1). The controller is often ignored during complex tricks (I've tried three controllers). The boost is little more than a colored streak with no effect on speed or tricks, and the tricks are outright boring since every character has the exact same tricks. You'll find that the whole mountain theme is just a new way to layout most of the same tracks from the first two games (there's no freedom to go wherever you want on the mountain even after you've unlocked everything, it's just a big track), and that you absolutely have to do linked combos to pass certain events. The problem with combos is that the default controller layout is virtually useless (you find out after using it for a while) and that there are so many ignored key presses that it's almost impossible to do a good combo or even a lot of tricks. The linking move for a combo is moronic (yet it's a copy from a competing poorly made game) and keeps you from controlling direction and speed. The different players are now a bunch of huge footed drab clones, but there's a new feature where you can dress your player. Unfortunately I didn't get SSX 3 to play dress-up, so it absolutely worthless, even changing your board has no effect whatsoever. The player characters have absolutely no personality unlike the earlier games. The tracks have even less. There are essentially five tracks that are modified to look different. The high scoring trickies are gone, there's almost no reason to do trickies in this game (the call them ubers and super ubers now, more complexity that doesn't enhance game-play in any way) and are 'uber' boring. Short cuts are there but you have to follow them strictly, there is almost no exploration like SSX tricky. Lastly I'd like to talk about the sound. The 'DJ' is so mind numbingly stupid, and the music so forgettable, that I can't imagine a reason to play it with any. Even with the music off, you'll hear your player character saying some of the stupidest things. Oh, and for those that played tricky and maxed out every player in gold, it's impossible in this game. Players good at tricks can never win a race against speed characters. Talk about lame, SSX 3 fits that bill.	-1
Is it just me, or is that the 007 games have just been getting worse and worse since Goldeneye?  In fact, with the latest addition to the Bond franchise, "Everything or Nothing", you could actually say that "Everything" about it is "Nothing".  This game is just plain dumb.  I thought when I just had herd about this game "oh great!  a third-person Bond game".  I was highly mistaken.  This game has terrible gameplay, terrible controls, and terrible cutscenes.  Bond fans, gamers or not, will be highly dissappointed with this game, because it has NOTHING compared to Agent Under Fire, and Goldeneye.  This game's predecessor, Nightfire, sucked equilly as much, and if they make another Bond game after this, it will flop so badly that the entire franchise will go out the window.  People tell me that it's "my opinion", but theyr're wrong.  This is THE opinion.  This game is a waste of time and money.  DO NOT BUY IT!	-1
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is one of the worst games I ever played. The third person is really annoying because you lock on to the targets you don't want to. Some of the missions are pointless like the one where you jump off a building and you have to dodge things while you fall. You cant even shoot anything in that mission. Dont buy this game.	-1
this game sucks!!!!!!!! u can not score at all!!!! if u try to go inside alls u get is a charge or a miss besides the new dunk button sucks u can never dunk it even if your 2 inchins away from the basket!!!!! wat im trying to say is  GET ESPN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i haven't played this game but i know from experience (i have 2003) that this probably sucks.  let me take a guess and say that yao ming and lebron james aren't even in the game.  as far as the dynasty mode goes, you realize that the averages per 48 minutes are completly out of whack, such as when i played tyson chandler for 40 minutes a game and he still had only 6.0 rebounds a game when simulating(the same average for when he played 19 minutes a game).  he should be averaging at least 10.5.  the rookies provide stats that are less than encouraging, nen had 9 points and 5 boards per game in 38 minutes!!!  also, where are the foreign players to be found in the rookie draft (they make up practically half of the first round). for the gameplay, the only exciting teams would be sacramento and dallas, yet the knicks offensive scheme is strictly run-and-gun.	-1
I rented this game this year instead of buying it because of the garbage that EA had last year. I also played the Espn game and it was horrible too. I can't believe that the people that own the best sports game out there (Madden) cannot create another franchise mode similar to the one that is so successful. If they cut and paste Madden's franchise mode to NBA live it would be one of the best games ever. Year after year since live has been on PS2 we have had the same gameplay, except for the freestyle gimmick which is useless, but I hope that they change the franchise mode and they never do. This year is the worst I've seen where only the star players get a rating in the 90's and the next best player on your team is a 70. Who came up with this rating system? And from year to year your players stats never change. You think you're going to be the Cavs and make Lebron awesome good luck, 10 years from now he's still 77 or whatever he starts out at the beginning of the game. I was totally heartbroken to see the pathetic attempts at basketball games this year from both companies and I hope that next year they can fix this because one of the reasons I have stopped becoming such a hardcore NBA fan is because there isn't a game that I can play anymore to get me in the mood to watch basketball.	-1
Remember Shining Force I and II? Remember? Those turn based top-down view rpgs on the Sega Mega Drive with cool characters, heaps of cool magic and detailed combat animations?  Well those were classic sega games that came out a full DECADE ago. Compared to those strategy rpgs of yore, Fire Emblem (this the 7th in the series) makes NO PROGRESS WHATSOEVER.  It has lacklustre character designs, an overly wordy plot, a simplistic and boring combat system, a lack of difficulty and an annoying "support" feature which is somehow the developers attempt at adding replay value to this game.  Overall, to the utter newbie whose only prior experience with these kind of games was with Advance Wars(which is arguably a better game than this one), Fire Emblem might seem like a solid choice. I agree, it IS a solid choice. It is also, however, a throwback of a game. A disappointing retread of gameplay that has been done bigger and better(on lower end systems I might add).  How to begin? I will make a short comparison between this game and Shining Force II, which many of you have already played. Let me remind you that:  *SFII had more exciting animations. In Fire Emblem, most of the art went to the character portraits. When it comes to the top-down graphics in battle, as well as the battle animations themselves, this game looks extremely poor for a GBA game.  *SFII had more varied character designs.  FE's characters might look "pretty", but are pretty much all same-ish anime fare, color-coded hair and all.  *SFII had HEAPS more: weapons, armours, spells, items. It was much more varied. Compared to this, all FE has going for it is a nice little "weapon triangle" system and your token herbs and potions. Not very exciting. In SFII you could cast spells like gigantic lightning storms which affect entire areas. In FE the magic works just like a weapon. You attack one square at a time. BO-Ring.  *SFII had BETWEEN-COMBAT exploration. In FE, it's pretty much battle after battle. Consequently the plot is FORCED to be told in huge CHUNKS pre and post-battle. Not very immersive.  *SFII was fun and worth replaying. Just go try it. In FE however, any semblance of replayability is in the form of placing different units next to each other and wait turn after turn in hope of getting new support combos. Wheee.  It seems abit ridiculous for me to compare this hand-held game with a console game, but bear in mind that the console game in question came out more than 10 years before this. The game boy advance is both graphically and performance wise better than the Mega Drive in every respect. Why can't Intelligent Sys. make a game that fully utilises its potential?	-1
The game...is too boring for me. YOU DO THE SAME CRAP OVER AND OVER AGAIN!(And I hate repetitiveness! Especially in games.)This was the first final fantasy game I was expecting a grand adventure where I save the world but the only thing my character was worry about is protecting her village from the stupid poisonous misama. And hate that I have to stay in a little bubble so my health doesn't be effected.   Here I am beating these monsters up for years (in the game) and there no progress, I'm going in circles because I can't go to the same place twice after I beat it, I have to wait until a couple years pass in the game. I was getting so pissed that I gave up and threw away the game in my closet to collect dust. Then a few years pass and I looked at a video of the game and I found out there's a freakin' final boss! (Which was hard for me to believe since the game doesn't make it obvious or conspicuous that there was one). The fighting gameplay, even a five year old can do it because all you do is press A.	-1
DO NOT BE FOOLED into such logic. This is quite possibly the worst game I have played in quite some time, and definitely the ONLY one I have EVER played where the best boss strategy was--wait for it--standing directly in front of the boss and mashing the "A" button. I mashed my way through 5 hours of this game, people, and I even beat one of the bosses while eating a sandwich and not fully turning back toward the screen until I heard the myrrh tree music. Make no mistake, this is no incredible feat on my part: this game is really that stupid.  In addition to the incredibly low level of challenge (god, was this game marketed for 10-year-olds? Then you shouldn't have put the FF title on it, Nintendo/SE!), I haven't seen a game this repetitive since Pacman. You heard me. It's as repetitive as an arcade game - only it was RELEASED IN 2004. This is truly a development that should put Square Enix to shame. All you do, per level, is wheel around in your crystal caravan, watching 10-second cutscenes at random, and fight your way through three levels (of your choice) til you fill your chalice with myrrh. W.O.W. Each level honestly takes fewer than 10 minutes, so you will probably complete a chapter in all of 30. What do you do for the next chapter, you ask? Does the plot advance? The answer is NO. You do the SAME DARN THING. AGAIN. After a few chapters pass, you even have the option of going back to the levels you have already visited. Gosh. What an EXCITING idea.  The ONLY cool things about this game--and believe me, I really mean this part--are graphics, which are beautiful, and character customization, though that is of course minimal. But compared to the rest of the game, I don't know, I guess I'll take anything.  Yet another complaint of mine is the rotating camera angle. For GOOD games, this isn't a problem, and your typical gamer would be hard put to find a situation in which it was actually a bad thing. But in FFCC, unlike most [good] RPGs, the game is MAPLESS - so don't you dare wander around in a town you aren't familiar with, or else you'll be running in circles forever due to the rotating camera that makes it impossible to tell which way you just came from--because you are -always- facing a different direction. I'm sure I've actually spent longer wandering stupidly in pointless towns where the townsfolk tell you parts of a story you aren't privy to than I've spent fighting bosses. Navigating was certainly more DIFFICULT, that's for sure.  In closing, the only reason I still own this game is because the store I purchased it from went out of business and I can no longer return it. Today, however, following this review, I will put this p.o.s. to rest underneath my massive pile of well-developed PS2 RPG's and forget it ever existed.	-1
I say stay away from this game. It was 20 dollars wasted. Only good thing i could say about it is its graphics. Ok, you have that one.  but seriously. the plot is extremely cliche. i remember one part of the game where it actually TELLS you.  The big deal about this game is the multiplayer. I heard it's great when you have friends to play with, but no one I know owns this game.  to be honest...i found this game difficult too. and im talking about playing with yourself. by the second stage i quit because it became frustrating. not really, but it became boring and uninteresting.	-1
From what I played, I did enjoy it.  The one thing that got me so frustrated was the controls, which is why I never finished the game.  I'm glad that they have improved that for the DS sequel (Ring of Fates).  My hope for this game is that they make a Wii version and reformat the control system (like Nintendo has done for Pikmin).  Or if they made a DS version of this game too, I would be happy with that!	-1
My bias is that from a Final Fantasy fan.  Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is NOT a Final Fantasy game.  It doesn't even come close to the Legend of Zelda in terms of action/adventure.  It is a waste of time, space, energy, and money.  All together.  I made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my Amazon Wish List when it first came out.  After testing it at stores and reading about it, I quickly realized the game was cheese.  I forgot, however, to remove it from my Wish List.  My brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year!  Aye yie yie!  So because of the $50 they scrounged together in my honor, I figured I'd give the game a thorough shot.  I couldn't take it anymore by the time I got to the second level.  It was atrocious.  I felt sorry for the Final Fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cash.  Enough of the emotional banter.  Let me try to give an analytical review of this game.  First of all, it does not meet the definition of a classic role-playing game.  (Within the last couple of years, however, I have noticed "RPG" taking on a new meaning.  Now it means simply playing as someone else.  Grand Theft Auto, for example, is now classified as an RPG.)  But with today's loose definition of "RPG," you can call it that, I guess.  But I grew up with real RPGs, like Dragon Warrior, the Final Fantasy titles, Lufia, Breath of Fire, etc.  (These were all turn-based RPGs.)  Second, FF:CC does not develop your characters sanely.  Sorry, but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of action/adventure.  Third, I recommend you boycott any GameCube title that requires the use of the Game Boy Advance to play multiplayer.  It is asinine to expect people/kids to pay money for such an inconvenient, expensive, and improper method to simply play with your friends.  Lastly, this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real RPGs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay.  Yes, FF:CC is an action/adventure, but unlike most others, the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style (it is more hack & slash than anything - the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review, but it was disappointing at best).  But other than that, the game will offer essentially ZERO to true RPG gamers, especially those who love the Final Fantasy series.  Stay away from this game if you love Final Fantasy titles.	-1
This game is LAME!!! It should be called Final Fantasy: the Crystal Losers Chronicles.  all the final fantasy fans, expected a big game, and because Square Enix begins again making games for Nintendo, got all of the Final Fantasy Fans excited.  The game is totally lame, has a serious lack of story!!! Seriously!!!!! You get to pick the name of your town, your character, gender, etc, and then, your on your own, you meet other caravans(but nothing big) and you fight monsters, (SPOILERS)  and when you fight the Final Boss, you discover that it's all based on memories,  (END OF SPOILERS)  and the end is a big piece of crap!  The multiplayer version, it's the same, but you can play with your friends, and it's almost impossible to play, cause every player needs a nintendo advance, to play, and to do the spells is very hard!!  I just hope that the sequel isn't as lame as this one!!	-1
I preordered this game and took it back a week after I got it.  The story is contrived and the gameplay is unfriendly.  My friends swore it was better when you played with others, but I found myself just as bored.  I especially didn't like using the Gameboy Advance with it; the GameCube controller is much more comfortable.  On the plus-side, the sound and graphics are decent, but that doesn't make a game, however.	-1
Yep. The Game Informer review said everything about this game. I bought this piece of crap played it for the first 2 "years" and just stopped playing it. It was a good idea, but if it had had a plot, then it would have been awesome. There was absolutely NO plot in this game. Gameplay was pretty good, except that you had to regain spells after each level (= annoying).  When I say  "don't buy this game"  I'm ALSO saying  "Don't throw your money in the garbage"  Ahh, the joys of Multitasking.	-1
I was looking forward to finally having a Final Fantasy game on my Gamecube, but I was very disappointed in this game. About the only good thing is the graphics. The game itself gets repetitive, all you do is carry a bucket around year after year through the same level. Soon it'll feel like your not getting anywhere in the game. I didn't even bother finishing the game, I gave up in the middle and moved on.  Another thing is that the way the charecters move in the cutscenes are like the way the charecter in Zelda for the N64 move. I don't even understand why Nintendo even decided to have a Final Fantasy game like this. they should have compared this to all the other Final Fantasy. So I think you should save your money and buy something worth buying.	-1
this game is terrible.  well, for one player, anyway.  to be honest, if you don't have at least 3 people, it's not going to be good.  if you have one person, that moogle can carry your lamp for you.  if you have 2 people, one the 2 people has to carry that stupid lamp around.  in other words, you have one person fighting, and one person running away from enemies because they have that STUPID LAMP IN THEIR HANDS.  so with 3, at least only 1 out of the three has to carry the stupid lamp around.  but it doesn't help that the game isn't that fun.  it has very bad play control (it takes your guy like a whole 2 seconds to attack after pressing the button).  the graphics are pretty, but not astounding.  replay?  hahahaha!  i didn't play it all the way though the first time!  who would?  so yeah, get another game instead.  suikoden IV and growlanser generations are out on ps2, and they are way better.	-1
I like the story, nice action packed fast paced the character is actually attractive. But the 1st person play is not very much fun for me. But is in Excellent condition.	-1
Spawn: Armageddon's storyline goes like this: A group of renegade angels have launched a massive weapon straight into the depths of hell in an attempt to destroy it. Unfortunately, the side effect of this weapon strike is that hell's minions now have an easy exit to the earth's surface. In addition to that is an escaped experimental supersoldier, developed by Spawn's primary earthly adversary, Jason Wynn. Now that you know what the game is about, you can know how bad it is. First off, you have an extremely lackluster fighting system.  Press punch once and you'll swing Spawn's axe.  Press it twice, and it does a different one swing attack.  Press it three times and you get 1 combo.  So basically it goes (1) uppercut slash, (2) a forward flip attack, and (3) a jumping axe slam attack. How exciting is that?  There's also a one swoop jump attack, but you will only need this in special cases and even then it becomes repetative. Second, the guns are pretty useless, when it comes down to it.  I'm curious why no one in the production team thought to ask why have guns, if you can't find enough ammo to use them adequately? If the game has any saving grace, I would have to say it lies in both your chain attacks and the special moves as they are fairly interesting.  The chain attacks are by far the best thing this game has going for it.  You can either use them to simply pummel your foes back to the underworld or you can send them there in pieces, literally splitting them to the four winds! The special moves are called "Hell Attacks" and there is a meter to regulate how much you can abuse it, because let's face it, you will.  Most of them are various projectile attacks, but the most useful ones would be the time-dilation effect and the furies from hell. The time-dialtion basically gives you the ability to move faster than everyone else, or slow everyone down, depending on how you look at it. As for the furies, Spawn has the ability to summon a group of spirits from hell to attack an intented victim.  A very satisfying move indeed. The absolute worst part of this game are the jump puzzles.  Who puts jump puzzles in a superhero game?  It defies all reason.  You will need to use your cape and chain power to pull off these ridiculous yet necessary excersizes. Don't expect good music either.  This game has the most dreariest hum tones I've ever heard.  There's simply no life to it. Finally, if you want a repetative poor excuse for a superhero game, or are just a die-hard Spawn fan, then this is the game for you.	-1
Namco has been known to make their Racing games (Ridge Racer), a few snippets of RPGs (Xenosaga), but the franchise that really sets them apart from the rest is Tekken and the recent triumph of Soul Calibur II.  They have earned the title of delivering the most elite fighting games ever.  So its not hard to be a little freaked out when they unleash a game like Kill. Switch.  If you asked me, I'd say that they derived the idea from their lackluster, action game Dead to Rights.  Neither impressive or a must-have title, Kill. Switch sadly shares a similar fate.  The game does in fact fume out a bag of potential, but what it lacks has transformed itself into grave issues that scatter in it.  Gamers may in turn be soured by having lost their money, when they could have purchased another game at the same price tag. Kill. Switch looks as if it were inspired by Metal Gear and other countless games that follow Snake Pilsken's trend.  Not to mention a lot of mindless, senseless, kill-anything-that-moves gameplay.  We live in a reality where we are told to be the "good guys," and consequentially, it was a pleasant surprise to take the role of a super solider being controlled by a man plotting utter ruination of the world.  He wants all countries warring with each other, to inspire fingers of the world to press the kaboom button.  That's where disappointment reigns, Namco does not amplify the story so the player can be as engrossed as it sounds.  Nor does he even care about the character he mans.  Instead he is forced to do the game's ultimate bidding; to gun and gun because it's filthy fun. The action consists of a third person and if desired, first person, view to get into the gun fest.  Basically you run into every level and spray bullets at enemy targets.  The mission layouts don't really augment your experience or juice up imaginations.  Most objectives, varied in each mission, simply has the player reach the end of the stage and perform redundant things such as planting explosives.  Extremely feather-light on the difficulty aspect, Kill. Switch's trademark relies on its blind fire concept.  Its sure seemed like it would push the fun factor, but how can it when its utterly useless?  Blind fire rarely ever hits the target while the player shields himself behind cover and throws away streams of bullets.  The player can just easily rush his assailants with an arsenal of weapons.  Forced to find cover when pitted with an excess of enemy soldiers, the game does emanate a sense of entertainment by the unmotivated yet nonstop action.  Kill. Switch's combat is startlingly fast. What really has me vexed is Namco filling the game with excellent and running-silky-smooth graphics.  I mean why waste all  of that effort for a mediocre, run and gun game?  The lighting effects are solidly done with awesome shadow effects.  The models are boosted all around in a nice myriad of fluid textures.  Vividly bright, the sight of breaking windows and swirling, sandy air helped me get into the combat.  The music is downright unremarkable with retro, poppy, techno sounds that seem to sloppily bounce. There is this gut feeling that Namco could have gone somewhere special with the game and make it deeply engaging.  I`m tired of playing as the blonde, blue-eyed hero in videogames.  I want to be an entity of villainy architect, set out to destroy what the "good" cling onto.  Namco let the opportunity slip away by spoon-feeing players with a boring turn of events.  They have drowned players by keeping the game abruptly concluded with no supplemental material.  Aside from that the gameplay keeps the game worth getting into, no matter if its only a weekend or two.  Kill. Switch is not worth the price of ownership, for it needs more than little touches here and there, it calls for an invasion of them.	-1
Spawn Armageddon is hack and slash game played in the third person perspective. Similar to "Devil May Cry", you use combo moves and slash at demonic creatures with your sword/shield. You can also collect and purchase weapons like guns and magic spells. When you kill demonic creatures you can collect their souls and add to your magic or energy level. The main problem with this game are the bland level designs, repetitious action and bad camera angles. Pros: +good attack combos +lots of abilities +good controls Cons: -boring level design -bad camera angles -cheap graphics -repetative -weak sound fx -junk heavy metal music -game has a generic feel This game is not worth buying because it just looks and feels so cheap and generic.	-1
I'm going to be short.  1) the game is fun.  2) grphics arnt bad but just not good.  3) story is just fine but not to engaging.  4) the game takes a sort of feird turn tword the end.  5) the game is chalenging.  6) wepon veriety is good.   In short if you realy want a fps get killzone. If you don't like the realizm of killzone get this game.	-1
This game is truly awful. It is, without a doubt, the WORST racing game I have ever played. Racing games I played on my old Sega Genesis were better than this boring, stupid game. The cars look ok, but they're not half as good as the ones in "GRAN TURISMO 3". They're just not fun to race. You can only race certain cars on certain tracks and that just plain STINKS! Even the opening movie is BORING. Two vettes endlessly racing down the highway for what seems an eternity. Take my advice and stay clear of this game. There are better racing titles out there like "BURNOUT", "NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND", "MIDNIGHT CLUB 2", "GRAN TURISMO 3" and even "FORD RACING 2". Try one of them but forget this game. It is TERRIBLE! -George Bauch.	-1
This game was terrible the worst game i ever played. The graphics was bootleg the storymode was garbage the character design was ugh! this was a bad game, bad meaning it was garbage they did a number on this game, this game was a pieace of trash.	-1
This game was horrible!  There was no story line and the graphics sucked!  The unlockables weren't that good and by the time you mash the buttons to do a special attack, the opponent is dead!  There wasn't any differences between the characters besides the looks.  They all had almost the exact same attacks.  There's no storyline at all!  Playing this stupid game, made my buttons on my GBA go soft!	-1
With the exception of Budokai, Dragon Ball Z games often fare poorly. DBZ: Taiketsu, sadly, joins their dismal ranks. If nothing else, Taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show. The large characters look clear and visible on the tiny GBA screen, but overall they can't compete with the superior graphics of GBA champions MK:DA and Street Fighter, and Taiketsu's herky-jerky animation is also particularly distracting. To save battery juice, go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effects-since the game lacks character voices, you won't miss anything important. Taiketsu's button-mashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic, even for a kid's fighting title. There are 15 characters total, including favorites from both the series (like Cell and Goku) and the movies (including the popular Brolly). Aside from the occasional super-move, each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos. Worse, there's very little difference between the various fighters. Players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat, but that gimmick burns out quickly. On the plus side, the game thoughtfully includes several play modes (like Tournament and Endurance) to help extend the replay value; unfortunately, none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable. Another nice touch is the Soul Calibur-esque secret system, which allows players to earn Z Points to unlock bonus modes, settings, and pictures. Overall, unless you're an eight-year-old DBZ fanatic, you'll find that this Saiyan is hardly super.	-1
This game has great voice acting, graphics, and plot. So far it sounds like a good game, but it isn't. I beat it in 5 days which consisted of running around in the same looking levels fighting the same looking bad guys. It's nearly impossble to beat without a guide book. You'll have no idea whats going on if you never played blood omen or the soul reavers. One awful thing is that you can't first play the game as kain and then as Raziel. It swiches off between them.	-1
Any DBZ product is bound to get a lot of attention. I could place a DBZ sticker on a pile of crap(literally) and sell it for 50 bucks. The DBZ audience is primarily younger kids though so they are bound to review this game with 5 stars no matter what. The graphics are choppy. Characters leave fuzzy trails which will hurt your eyes. Every character has the same moves. Of course everyone will give this game 50000 stars because their favorite character is in it. The problem though is that all the characters are the same. It is unrealistic when Brolly can't take down Cell. As for the fighting... It is all the same. They have special moves but they take 50308952805028 hours to pull off. It hurts my hands. On top of that... basically I could memorize the dictionary before I memorize Goku's Kamehameha. Of course, the game will get 4.5 stars. It's DBZ so it is bound to get top scores from 9 year olds. The truth is that this game is bad. It is a terrible game and a waste of money. Don't let these 9 year olds tell you differently because the game contains their favorite character. It is bad.	-1
Scratched and didn't work	-1
Revenge mode prevents WWE Wrestlemainia XIX from being a great game. If you own a Gamecube get this to play as u wait for Day of Reckoning!	-1
you cant even do  the 619 or west coast with rey mysterio. you do angleslam off the turnbuckle. What is revenge mode with throwing police officers around and without any wrestling. Here comes the pain is awsome. it even has a first blood match and elimination chamber. raw 2 is better then wreslemania. At least Raw 2 has a real season mode and not a stupid revenge mode. so wreslemania is the worst wrestling game ever!!!!	-1
hello i got this game last week and i thought i would tell everyone what i think about it ok #1 its boring #2 the revenge mode only took a hour to finish #3 the graphics are the worst i've ever seen from thq i mean damn .... they made stephanie mcmahon look like a transvestite if you want my opion don't waste your money on this game	-1
People, I don't know what you see in this game.  It's not really a bad game, it's just an average arcade shooter.  More often than not, I can't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly.  I pop out from behind something and I'm dead meat.  Pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good Time Crisis game.	-1
I'd like to give this game a good review, but unless you read the fine print, you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn't work on LCD televisions.  It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets.	-1
Wow. To say that this game is a disappointment would be like calling a screwdriver driven into my ear a "head-ache". Don't fork out your money for this one, unless you've rented it first and actually enjoyed playing it. The graphics are better than the last Wrestlemania game, but the controls are just as frustrating. Even when you put a finishing move on an opponent, it seems like too often they pop right up and knock you off of your ladder or cage or kick out of a three count. And if you find yourself in a triple threat or fatal fourway match? Frustration! You'll be trying so hard to face the right guy, that by the time you do, another opponent will come from behind and put a move on you. Ugh! There is no elimination chamber match. Don't buy this game thinking this is an option. Pretty much, it has all the same matches that were on the last Wrestlemania game. The story-mode is a load of poop. You go through a bunch of street-fights such as a construction sight and get double or tripled-teamed. All the story mode is good for is getting you to curse in anger. In short, I encourage you to rent this game. If you have a Gamecube and like wrestling games, try Def Jam Vendetta. If you have a PS2, the Smackdown series is totally better. Find out for yourself.	-1
When you play, it takes 1 sec after you press the button for the action to respond. There are no special moves, no special effects, you'd find yourself doing the same stunts over and over again. There's really no variety of enemies, overall this game is only worth a dollar.	-1
This game is fun if you're bored. You can go across the world, and play people in fake arcades. Before you play that, you're in for an extensive training mode, and even if you master it and beat all of the arcade mode.... no one you know will play with you.  This game is okay, if you have 2 billion hours to learn how to rock it.  Great game, if you have the time. If you wanna pick up and play with your friends, you might as well get some kind of Mario Party game, 'cause this is whack unless ya'll know what you're doing, which hinders the EFF out of this game.  I would give this a 10 outta 10, but due to the learning curve, and lack of competition in real life, this is more like a 3/10.	-1
I thought VF4: Evolution would be better than the normal VF4, but I was wrong. There's only better graphics, more arenas, and annoying guitar music along with a new mode. The game's addictive at first, but then I wondered why I was wasting my time on it because I ended up dragging myself through playing it. VF4: Evolution does not have a single bit of my recommendation.	-1
graphics are above average, but this game didn't grab my attention like gilty gear X2. It seems so normal and the fighting is just awful compared to gilty gear X2. get that instead. I hate fighting games with no weapons and this is no different. After playing it, I wondered why it got such great reviews. It just bad. the fighting seams robotic and slow.	-1
I am so disappointed not only on Virtua Fighter 4, but now even on this piece of waste. The graphics have improved alot, but Tekken 4 still has graphics far beyond better than thos game.   Why does it take time to get off the ground? The game should have fast gameplay to get right off the ground.   It as a mistake to make this game. I think now Virtua Fighter 5 will be even worse because Sega may be running out of ideas. With everything Sega used to make this game, they should have saved for Virtua Fighter 5.	-1
IM REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I WAS A FEVER FANATIC BACK IN 2002 AND 03 BUT ITS THE SAME GAME WITH ONE EXCEPTION READ AND LEAD .THE COMMENTARY WILL PUT U TO SLEEP RON PITTS IS BORING AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS AWFUL AND STILL NO DYNASY MODE AND MANY OTHER IN DEPTH MODES ARE MISSING FOR THE REAL LIFE PLAYER.THE POLYGON COUNT IS THE ONLY THING HIGHER TEN ANY OTHER TITLE THS YEAR BUT IM SORRY ITS JUST MISSING SO MUCH MADDEN 04 RUINS THIS GAME COMPLETELY MICROSOFT NEEDS TO START LISTENING TO THE FEEDBACK BECAUSE IM JUST  1 IN 10,000,0000 PEOPLE TO AGREE FEVER NEEDS A MAKEOVER  NOT JUST READ AND LEAD MY GOD THERE STILL DOING THE SAME STUFF SINCE 02 GUYS WAKE UP .	-1
the only reason I go on this is for excercise but just like it gets boring the more you play on it the less tired you get so you won't be breathing hard like you do when jogging for a long time. The beat freak game is my favourite because it does not get boring...the 2 best songs are sing it back and boogie night(I don't listen to this kind of music but it goes great with this mini game).	-1
worst ps2 game type-thing EVER!  first of all, the games that they supply (which is all that u can get) are the biggest load of crud that i have ever seen!!!!!  also the resolution and gameplay of it is the worst than i have seen.  "lets go play watch the rock erode in the river" is like new years in madison square garden compared to this. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS FOR THE SANITY AND SACREDNESS OF MAN-KIND!!	-1
when i first saw dis game i thought it would be cool but this game sucks. graphics are terrible, fighting styles,very lame, and weapons dissapear after u strike ur apponent with it(if i hit an enemy with a bat,i sure as hell wouldn't want it to dissapear....)	-1
I ended up returning the headset because the earpiece did not work.  We used the headset with the Karaoke Revolution game and the microphone worked but no sound came out of the earpiece.  After contacting the company I found out that you would only be able to hear your own voice through the earpiece without the music so instead of exchanging it I purchased another hand held microphone.	-1
I bout this to talk to people right,so i wouldn't have to type everything.but i had this product for about a month and it doesn't work anymore i can hear people but they cant hear me so i took it apart and the wires are the thinest i've ever seen in my life and just moving the mic peice around pretty much makes them break i've been through 2 of these and they both stoped working the same way,dont buy this headset.	-1
Sony must be trying to suck up some cash from people, and they are doing that from me. These things are 30 bucks and I have bought 4 of these and they are just breaking like crazy. I guess it's a good thing i live in a family with money.. but this thing is just a cheap piece of junk that needs some improving..	-1
You play as a voodoo doll, named "Voodoo Vince", your mission is to rescue the vodoo priestess who got kidnapped (she is your owner). As a voodoo doll, you have power to inflict injury to your enemies by first causing injury to yourself (of course). you can perform special voodoo attacks when you collect enough magic orbs (from defeated enemies). It's just a standard platformer game once you get past the novelty. You can do your basic spin attack, jumps, grabbing onto ledges and floating. The graphics are nice and have a deformed look to it, adding to the wacky atmosphere of the game. The sound effects and music, were good, but very repetative. The controls were okay. The game gets difficult fast, and will give younger players a hard time. Since younger players are the target audience I think it was a mistake to make the game this hard. The game is also very short and very linear. Pros: +good graphics +good controls +voodoo doll powers +funny Cons: -very difficult gameplay -weak sound effects -repetative music -very short game -linear gameplay -difficult puzzles -nothing innovating -dark looking levels -awkward camera There are lots of better platformer games out there. Voodoo Vince is not one of them.	-1
Want a game so bad it will give you nightmares.  So bad your eyes will bleed.  So bad you'll swear your GBA is possessed by a demon.  Well this is that game.  Now listen, I like Yu Yu Hakusho, I think it's a great story and a spectacular TV series.  But, this game stinks.  Lets begin by talking about the graphics.  The people look like they escaped from an old Atari 2600 game.  The enviroments look decent at first, then you realize that all the places look exactly the same.  I must have gone by this couch twenty times.  And then there's the audio.  The music is painful to say the least.  But the music isn't nearly as bad as the actual gameplay.  You're basically fighting or playing stupid mini-games like finding someone's homework.  Most mini-games will just involve following your compass from location to location.  Then you get to the fighting.  This is the stupidest part of the game.  First of all, everyone wants to get you.  Demons, school children, old ladies, everyone.  And they aren't exactly geniuses either.  The fighting isn't deep or involving.  Basically just mash the B button and you'll be fine.  So, the game isn't fun at all.  If your a die hard Yu Yu Hakusho fan you probably already have a copy.  As for everyone else, you might want to play a game that doesn't suck so much.	-1
As I bought this case, for some reason I thought it would be able to hold my GBA SP safely, and maybe a game or two extra. Yes it holds the GBA SP, but nothing else. Getting a game out of the miniscule pouch is an exercise in pure masochism. A much better idea is to buy a small case for the older GBA, and then use that. The extra space intended for the older system will allow you to put in more games, and your SP. Buying this is like putting your GBA in a tight pocket in your jeans. You know it's there, and safe, but God help you if you can get it out.	-1
Put your gameboy in a plastic bag and don't be a complete idiot with it. Problem solved. There is no need to buy this carrying case. I saw it and immediately said "no". Seriously, 2 games in the SP. If this thing held like 6 games and didn't look like a purse, than enjoy.	-1
I know some people love it, but I really don't.  First off, any game with 9,999 levels has got to be some kind of joke.  How can such a thing be possible without becoming a mind-numbing, repetitive grind?  Answer: it cannot.  Not that you have to get that high, but my point is, if you think that many levels is some kind of good thing, you and I have nothing in common, and you might as well stop reading right now.  This is actually one of the very few games I've ever traded in.  I just couldn't see myself ever inserting the disc again after the first few days.  The gameplay is silly, the story is silly, the voice acting is ... well, it's actually decent.  But I don't buy games for the voice acting alone.  The "innovative" lift-and-throw feature is interesting the first couple of times, but once you learn how to exploit it all the time, it becomes more of a chore, like something you're being forced to do instead of something fun.  Same with the ludicrous geo-color-nonsense.  Yes, you CAN kill everything on the screen with it, but how is that engaging or immersive?  To me, it just makes everything ridiculously simple, and it gets old fast.  And the bit about leveling up items?  Ugh.  Seriously, I cannot be bothered.  Not fun.  If you like RPGs that have a good story punctuated with truly strategic battles that actually make you think, if you are looking for a challenge and accept that you might actually lose a tough battle, or if you care at all about rules that make some kind of realistic sense, do NOT buy this game.  If, on the other hand, you like to powerlevel your dudes and easily pwn everything on the map in every fight with the same repetitive set of strategies, and if you think unsubtle sexual innuendo and jokes about bodily functions are the height of humor, this game is totally for you.	-1
It's kind of funny how many will point to this game and say what a shame it is that it didn't succeed, blah blah blah. There's a clear and easy reason why this was the case:  the game is nothing special.  It's similar to other platforming/adventure games but inferior to them in just about every way. The combat is subpar, the story is subpar, the stealth sections and vehicle sections are annoying... it just doesn't do a whole lot particularly well. It's not a terrible game, mind you: it's just a generic one. And it was ignored for a reason.	-1
First off, there are like two games in this, which would make one think that it would be great. 1.  The RPG gameplay is pathetic, it is to hard, and at night, you cannot see whatsoever. 2.  You cannot defeat ships or even hit the ships.  BAD! 3. TERRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I must say that this is one of the worst games I have played since Outpost. The manual is utterly useless. It has hardly any solid information about the controls or flow of the game. The controls are non-intuitive and sluggish. The game play is very poor and kluggy. This game is so bad, I thought there must be a patch for it. But I was wrong. I am playing this on a P4 H/T with a GB of RAM and a G-Force video card. Unless you enjoy disappointment, avoid this game at all cost.	-1
Whatever you do, do NOT buy this game!  The elevator battle towards the end of the game is the most poorly designed aspect in recent memory.  After more than 20 tries, I just couldn't beat it.  Whenever that happens, you know that a game is fatally flawed.  Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.  There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.  Performing precise wall-run attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time.  Then, vaulting over enemies doesn't work all the time either.  Because of these facts, this game is poorly designed and fatally flawed.  DO NOT BUY!	-1
the graphics in this game are great but, the endless puzzles like getting to rooftops gets old i don't usually get mad over video games but i thought about taking it out if the xbox console and tearing it	-1
I hate this fricking game!  Time and time again I screamed obscenities at the screen, throwing my controller down.  The game is just series of jumping off ledges, falling and trying again.  The battles feel like your running through mollasses.  The most annoying game I've ever played.  Just fancy graphics on top of a game you get free on your cellphone.	-1
90% of gamers will only see the first 15% of this game- for there is a respawning never ending battle level that simply cannot be won (I'm not kidding). I am a relatively advanced gamer, and I have to say that this battle system is amongst the worst I have ever tried to play. It results in an unplayable game that will stop you 15% of the way through it. What a rip off! No kidding- no cheats, nothing you can do but try and try again- ultimately failing. I even brought in other advanced games who all looked at me like I was crazy for suggesting they try to beat this battle it is so ill conceived. Simply the worst game out there masking under the veil of nice graphics - too bad since they are gorgous (from what I saw of them). When are these game developers going to realize that 90% of gamers out there won't deal with quality this poor. I cannot beleive anyone has ever gotten past this level it's that hard and rediculously stacked in the favor of the game. Don't waste your time unless you want to play 15% of a game only to hit a massive brick wall. Shame on Ubisoft for allowing this garbage out on store shelves!	-1
Sega products that this is supposed to be for (Sega Genesis model 2, 32X, Game Gear, Nomad) are rated for 10 Volts DC 850ma.  After seeing some of the other negative reviews about how their Game Gears got fried, I measured this with my volt meter before using as a precaution, and it outputs over 16.6 Volts.  I see why people are getting their consoles fried now.  Returned for a refund, I am not going to risk frying my 32X.	-1
This is horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The controls are tedious. The camera could not be worse. The game is touchy. I could not say "STAY AWAY" enough. I know many found this game fun, but I have been video gaming for over 25 years now and I say this is one of the worst!!!!!	-1
It seems impossible for any company to make a good game based on a franchise. This is no exception. While somewhat entertaining and strategic Falsebound kingdom can be infuriating and features basicly the same gameplay level after level. Hardcore fans will enjoy this but casual gamers most likely will not. Make sure to rent it  before you buy it. You might not want to be stuck owning this game.	-1
This game is way over rated!!!! camera problems, fighting control problems, and hyped up way too much!!! after reading reviews i expected the best game ever and now I feel robbed!! honestly i had more fun, actually WAY MORE FUN on the gameboy advance version!! with this title hope for the best , expect the worst...	-1
This game just clings on to the title of Yu-Gi-Oh!  It is like PokeMon Stadium only with an actual storyline.  Go pick up the uncut YGO dvds, import the dvds, or play one of the YGO GBA rpgs; but avoid this game.	-1
Although it has a few promising traits, this was a very bad first attempt for a next-gen Yu-Gi-Oh! game, the gameplay is repetitive and tediously slow. Your stuck with three minor monsters for a long time, and there are no cut-scenes to speak of. Over all, this makes the sims look like an action game. My advice? Only buy this if you have A LOT of time on your hands, and you don't get bord easily.	-1
Only die hard Yu-Gi-Oh fans could possibly find a slim bit of enjoyment in this game. It amazes me it is listed as third over all in Amazon's top seller list cause that tells me many are flocking in like sheep to waste their money on this game. There are at least 500 games i would want to own before i even considered this title. Heck I'd rather dust off the old N64 or even Super Nes and play some of those games before i put any time into this one. The graphics are very last generation (would only call the graphics "ok" even if it was on the playstatin 1) The game is not very fun,not much depth here,not much style. If it wasn't a Yu-Gi-Oh title and had made up characters and the same gameplay,everyone would be trading this one in at a used game store fast. I guess there are a few people out there who think its a cool game cause they say "wow i know that character and that one to from Yu-Gi-Oh" thats about the only thing positive you'll get out of the game,recognizing the characters...end of positive things to say about the game. If my opinion isn't enough,make sure you check out IGN and Gamepro reviews on this game before you go throwing away your money on this game for some kids birthday or Christmas gift. Most kids will be let down and having other titles in mind they wish you had gotten them instead if they open this as a Christmas gift. Prince of Persia,Beyond Good and Evil,Sphynx and the Mummy,Metal Arms:Glitch in the System,and Mario Kart are just a few examples of games that should be under your tree this year for your kids way before you ever consider this poor attempt at a Yu-Gi-Oh game. If you are stubborn and want to take a chance on this game at least rent it first so you don't foolishly throw away your money without seeing for yourself how lacking in fun this title is.	-1
This product didn't work at all. This is the third one I bought. Don't buy used. I am not mad. It's just that it doesn't work.	-1
It is a poor game, and contains nudity, Monsters also are naked woman body , this is contrary to our religion	-1
Not a very good addition to the Castlevania line of games. It might not be bad, but it just did not hold my interest. You play as a Belmont trying to get back his wife or fiance or something from someone who I don't think is Dracula. It's just not worth the money.	-1
boring	-1
This game could easily have been great. The main character moves with ease and his moves are complex. There's an expansive list of upgrades, items, and abilities, all great things for a Castlevania title. However, this game's perfect character interface is where the "good" ends, for me.  The world starts off good enough, great even. At least when you step out of the forest and beyond the Castle's first few rooms and into the first (of five) world(s) of the game. Soon, you realize that the developers were rushed to complete a game for Konami. The rooms and hallways, you'll notice within the first hour, have been 'cut and pasted' throughout the entirety of the game's 5 levels. The skins of the rooms might look different (a little), but you'll see the similarities, unless, of course, you are blind, that is.  The music is great, also, at first, anyway. The soundtrack when first entering the Castle is quiet, creepy, and atmospheric. As you continue onward, it gets better...for the first floor of the first level. Then, well...the soundtrack becomes a bouncy and annoying blend of club music and gothic-not a good mix, in my opinion, at least not to the extent that this soundtrack took it. The music was way too active and obnoxious for the lack of action that is really going on on the screen in front of you. That said, the first few tracks in the game are some of the best in the series.  The bosses are WAY too easy. The puzzles are WAY too simplistic. And eventually you find yourself wishing the game would have simply been made with 3D graphics and 2D level design (why not!?) Castlevania is, to me, a Platforming Action RPG. Lament of Innocence has a few moments of platforming throwbacks, but they're ruined by the game's unmovable camera. This game pretty much relies upon its stationary camera angle, because if you were allowed to move it, you'd be able to see all of the games "hidden" items plain as day: that's bad game design, if you ask me....  It's sad to say it, but as hard as I tried and wanted (believe me, I was pumped to play this game again) it to be a great CV game, it simply is not great. It's better all other 3D Castlevania games, however, Lords of Shadow included. But that's not saying much, being that game was a mediocre ripoff blending of God of War and Shadow of the Colossus.  I wish there could be a great 3D Castlevania, but until they keep the simple things in the game that make Castlevania Castlevania intact, they'll fail over and over again.	-1
It lacks camera controls, which I simply do not like in a game.  I put this game down after just a couple hours...seems to be a pure beat 'em up, which is not my personal cup of tea.	-1
I played this game and it made absolutely no sense - maybe if it was Yaoi or something it'd make it worth playing. But I recommended Devil May Cry 3 anyday.	-1
Well, when we look at this game, we are faced with the origin story of Leon, first and most vile (apparently) Belmont, and how he began his struggle against all monsters. He enters a castle in an attempt to rescue his beloved Sara.  This game sports killer graphics, nice animations and awesome renditions of some classic Castlevania enemies.  But it's not for Castlevania fans like me. Let me tell you why.  First, the sound. I have precious few problems here. The music wasn't up to the level of Symphony of the Night, but it was pretty good. The voices, in turn, were actually done quite well considering what they were asked to say (see story presentation.)  Secondly the graphics, from a technical standpoint, were really quite good, and the characters and monsters well-represented in appearance, but I had a few problems. First off, the cutscenes. When the cutscenes in the game were in effect, the characters would frequently sway back and forth or jerk around as if they were bored, and many of those body motions were quite uncalled-for. Secondly, the whip. In mid-game, you use a whip to "swing" from place to place and to attack monsters, but unlike a real whip, no skill is required to twirl it around or aim it at your enemies. You just thrust it forward like a sword. As for the whip-swinging, all you do is smack the whip against a pole and watch yourself get vaulted over it, like you're using an iron pole instead of a whip. Whip-swinging should look like web-swinging. The whip was handled better in "Circle of the Moon." Third, the environments. I'm sorry, folks, I really am, but the environments were ugly and confined. When one plays a game like Symphony of the Night, one finds oneself in vast, glorious halls dressed in a fancy style, and well-lit for the most part. This game just had a bunch of dark hallways no more than a dozen feel in any direction, and the few large rooms you do visit don't feel glorious at all.  My last problem with the graphics was that this game uses a static and rigid camera and although it's often a cooperative one, sometimes you'll get to an area and say "Gee, I wish I could see above me, or below me, or off to the side." That got truly annoying after a while.  Now, Story Concept. Well, it's a fairly interesting story about Leon Belmont, the first of the Belmont Clan to fight monsters. The story was, even in concept, destined to be a poor one, however, since the series' central draw (for me,) Count Vlad Tepes Dracula is missing from the game entirely.  Story Presentation, however, REALLY drags it down. The scriptwriting (or was it the translating?) was truly bad and just felt lame, cheesy and depressing. Leon uses a whip made from Alchemy, and no distinction is ever drawn between that alchemy and the one used by the vampires. Leon does not even strike me as being that good of a person, except in his description in the game intro before you meet him. In all the other games, a Belmont or someone else would enter the castle of Dracula (known as Castlevania) and slay him. In this one, Leon enters a Castle that is plainly NOT Castlevania, and slays several creatures that are plainly NOT Dracula, with weapons that are NOT plainly good. In past games, the Belmonts are always drawn up as good and holy men who always try to do what is best. Leon seems like more of a grief-crazed fanatic.  The gameplay itself doesn't even compensate. Gone is the experience engine of the past several games that made them more fun than most RPGs. Gone are the vast numbers of common and rare items that made SOTN and the GBA games such a hoot, and what has been added in their place is a bunch of switch-pushing puzzles, and maze-exploring.  I don't know why Konami thought this would be good. Instead of a righteous warrior, fighting evil beasts for the good of all, we are given a depressed, revenge-driven person who crawls through dark tunnels after the next big treasure like a mole or packrat, without the star-talent of the series' main villain as backup. I only rented this game, but I have already beaten it with all secrets (except the playthroughs in different modes.)  Is this 3D Castlevania game worth playing? Yes it is. But not more than once, and I wouldn't say it's worth buying. Frankly, I thought Circle of the Moon was better. I do think Konami could make a truly good 3D Castlevania, but this whole game felt like it shrunk in the wash. Considering how much this game lost in the 3D translation, I'd just as soon they stay 2D in the future, unless they can manage to do it right next time.	-1
Many of the video game magazines are of the opinion that this is the first 3D Castlevania game to be worthy of the name.  It is better than that joke on the Nintendo 64, but that's not saying much. The action is tedious and repetitive, and the levels are way too simple for their size.  You'll spend a lot of time just walking all over the place to hit switches.  BOOORING!  To make things worse, most of the rooms are nearly identical.  While playing this game, I felt like a rat, running through a maze, looking for my piece of cheese.  The music is weak too, and I was really expecting better in this department since the music for Super Castlevania 4, Bloodlines, Dracula X, and Symphony of the Night was first class! If this kind of game interests you, I'd suggest 'Devil May Cry' or 'Metroid Prime.' They're actually good!	-1
Konami's PS2 run in my opinion has been a huge disappointment with the exception of Metal Gear perhaps. Even that game forced you to play as a character other than Snake and what about the narrow minded and stripped down Suikoden IV? "But its 3D!!!" Who cares? Castlevania and the RPG mentioned above are admirable but are basically let-downs. When you really sit down and think about the game you are playing and what it is your doing you will realize that you are not enjoying yourself. You might think you are but your not: Granted, if you look at it like a simple old-school button masher with 3d graphics you might enjoy it. But I for one could not have been more disappointed. Basically, you run from room to room or corridor to room to corridor to room and whip monsters constantly by jumping around and pressing the fire button. You do this constantly. I repeat constantly. With no environmental interaction. Very little character growth (ie. experience, weapons). Very little of anything! You can't even look around the rooms to enjoy the great graphics! (Not as great as Devil May Cry. The wall clipping is a bit goofy too). The only "puzzles" you have are bacically navigating a few rooms and finding buttons or sculptures to push to unlock doors. Some rooms use the very bad camera angle to "challenge" you. (If you know what I mean). Eventually you come to a boss and defeat him and return to the castle entrance to pick another "world" and beat another boss. When you beat all 5 or 6 bosses (can't remember how many) you advance to towards the end half of the game. I felt tired of mashing ONE button for hours, travelling through similar and I mean SIMILAR rooms and corridors. Fighting a boss or two then repeating. Is this really what Castlevania has become. There is no way in that the same programmers from Symphony were paid to design this game. Utter, utter disappointment so far. I'd rather just play the 1st Devil May Cry instead. A real heart-breaker.... but its in 3D!!!!	-1
***Rating system***  1 Star  = disaster of a game, Nintendo GameCube  2 Stars = average game  3 Stars = good game, above average  4 Stars = awesome game  5 Stars = best game ever, changes the way we look at the   gaming idustry, very few of, Grand Theft Auto 3 (Castlevania: Lament of Innocence) Lament is an extremely plain and strait forward action game, it has really no plotline or character development.  In today's market of games this kind of strait forward action no longer gets it done.  Devil May Cry did much more in the way of graphics, interactive bosses, and environments, but even DMC isn't much better than an average game.  Lament of Innocence just seems outdated and plain, once you've swung that whip at creatures for the first 2 or 3 levels you've already done it all.  There isn't even the need to try to advance to harder levels as you can take on any of the 5 levels in any order you want. Not to mention you can enter and exit levels as you please so you get to see the concept of all levels from the start of the game. I was interested in seeing how much more this classic franchise had to offer and I found out it doesn't have much.  Konami might think about retiring this franchise and really focusing on Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill. The final verdict here is that swinging that whip provides some fun, you should rent this game a couple of times and finish it but it's definitely not worth buying.  If for some crazy reason you haven't played the original Devil May Cry yet, I'd suggest you buy that for about $9.99.  That's of course if this kind of game interests you.	-1
Didn't work, made scary loud noise, do not buy	-1
Do not buy this product it is not for a nes I bought it and the plug was to big for it. What a waste of time headed to walmart to get one that fits should have done in the first place	-1
There are somethings I'll never understand. Basic Geometry, how Michael Bolton became successful.....and how a great and iconic character like Batman can never have a decent video game. The first Batgame for Playstation 2, Vengence, had it's moments. Though it wasn't "great" it at least felt like a Batman game. Batman Dark Tomorrow was an outright disaster. And now it looks like Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu continues the downward slide for the Dark Knight. Rise of Sin Tzu's biggest downfall is it's gameplay. Where as Vengence attempted to be more of an adventure oriented game, Rise of Sin Tzu takes an entirely different approach. It's pretty much a straight forward beat 'em up game. But unfortunatley it doesn't know how to keep you interested in it to make you keep wanting to play. The game descends into punching and kicking your way past various non-descript bad guys and the occassional gas bomb lobbed in to the fray by the villain the Scarecrow. Two players can play in a co-operative mode simultaneously but it does little to change the gameplay. The game is interesting for about ten minutes then boredom quickley sets in. After the first few levels I could see that there was pretty much nothing else this game had to offer. The graphics on this game are decent. Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing all move with convincing ease and fluidity. But the environments are rather plain and sterile. They look like they could be just about any street anywhere. There was nothing to indicate that this was Gotham City. It could have been Cleveland for I knew. The sound was also very generic. Sure Batman and company uttered some pretty good "one liners", but it got old fast. The controls are very easy to manage. They are however wasted on a game like this. The time it will take you to become accustomed to the controls is maybe about five to ten minutes. This game managed to let me down on just about every level. I'm not even sure if a hardcore Batfan would even enjoy it. Ubi Soft has shamelessly squandered the potential for this licence. At this point the only thing that I think would inject new life into the franchise is if the game license changed hands and went to a company like Activision, Electronic Arts, Eidos or anyone else. If you can track down a copy of Batman: Vengence, you would be better served playing that. Though not perfect it's the better of the two Batman games.	-1
Oh boy oh boy I tried playing this game but just couldn't have fun wiht it.  the combat is aweful and repetitive. levels are dull narrow and boring. the game was just way too repetitive for me to enjoy.	-1
The review titled "Batman of the Rings" puts it best as far as my qualms with this game so I won't bother to repeat them.  I would like to say that I am very disappointed in what this game had to offer.  In Batman: Vengeance.  You got to explore, glide, fight, be strategic and be a detective, with Batman's entire arsenal from the TV show that we have come to know and love.  None of this takes place in "Rise of Sin Tzu."  You just fight and you fight an ungodly amount of thugs which just seems that the whole city of Gotham has strapped on their roughest clothing and a machine gun just to get Batman.  If this game had come out as a new Streets of Rage game, I would have been much more impressed.  In my opinion, the new villain, Sin Tzu was a horrible make up.  I believe they should have picked from the other villains already created by DC or the Animated Series.  I personally would have liked to have seen Red Claw (the international terrorist from Batman TAS) in the place of Sin Tzu.  They wouldn't have had to think up a new story for her and she would be cold and calculating, also taking over Gotham City with an iron fist.  The designers could have made a much more interesting storyline with her as the lead villain.    To wrap this up, the designers should have followed the trend of the Onimusha trilogy; subtle changes in each game and each story (using the smash hit game as a template) to keep the player excited, guessing what's next and wanting more, instead of trying to fix something that ain't broke.  It should have been similar to its prequel, Batman: Vengeance, which was a great game.  This game will continue to collect dust because the replay value stinks, the storyline stinks, and game play is absolutely raunchy compared to Batman: Vengeance.  Fellow fans, they dropped the bar WAY LOW for this one. Caveat Emptor!	-1
Batman of the Rings.  This has got to stop. Given the sheer quality of the Batman animated series, it blows me away that the games can be so sub-par. The games appear to be made for six year olds while the series itself often deals with concepts and ideas that are beyond them. How many other animated series have people dragged into drug rehab centers to see what drugs do to their kids or the level of sexual tension between Batman and Catwoman? There is no reason that I can see that a Batman or Superman game cannot approach the level of quality in game play that can be achieved by such titles as the Legacy of Kain series, Spider-Man or even SOCOM.  In playing through Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu, it dawned on me that I was probably going to wear out my Xbox controller given the sheer number of times I had to mash the buttons just to beat up wave after wave of bad guys. Quite literally, you are a one man (or woman) army against a never ending parade of thugs- Batman never beat up this many guys in an entire season of the cartoon! And it's always the same- work your way through some goons before you can move to the next area, (you cannot progress down a hallway thanks to invisible force fields that fade once you whack the previous area's bad guys), and pray you do it fast enough before the civilian dies or the bomb explodes. I hate artificial limitations in games- it smacks of bad design. I expect obstacles, but not overly obvious time wasters.  Either this game uses the Lord of the Rings game engine, or its an incredibly accurate copy. The game play is the same- earn XP to buy combat moves and special abilities or coins to unlock trophies to view. I wouldn't mind that so much, but the game play never changes- rush into an area, follow-the-path, and pound bad guys- that's it, that's all. In all honesty, it should have been more like the Spider-Man games- more three-dimensional movement and the ability to gain ground from opponents and search out health power ups if you get too low. Graphically, it is one big piece of eye candy as areas are beautifully detailed and effects are lively while the colors are vibrant, just like the animated series. All the voice actors are there as well, making pithy one-liners as they punch out the villains. The music is superb all around, and Carey Tagawa does an awesome job voicing Sin Tzu.  The combat system is neat, but too limited by its design and game premise. Earning more powerful attacks and combos is a great idea, but you are hampered by your environment, even though you're meant to use it against your foes, as they will against you. You can't explore- it's all combat. No ability to jump on to objects or climb, no real use of what Batman is known for- he's a detective! He solves crimes, but in this case his methodology involves beating up every scumbag in Gotham until he gets the right ones. The cut scenes are all Batman-based, so it's a little disconcerting when you defeat Clayface as Batgirl only to swap to Batman for the movie.  This game loses so many points for its annoying features- artificial impediments, being a fighting game masquerading as an adventure game, stupid mission goals that only vary between protect the civilian, protect the door, and disarm the bombs. And don't give me one way and only one way to beat the end-level boss, let me devise my own or pick from a list of possibilities. Make me think, let me solve puzzles, not just bash things, it gets old very fast. So mega points for the look and sound of the game, but minus loads of kudos for everything else. Let me jump, swing, climb, swim, explore, drive, and fly, not just follow the game designer's whims and the path they have laid out for me. I expect more for my money and so should you.	-1
Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are "cartoon" horrible and the need for "VR" points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on "VR" points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either.	-1
I won't be playing this version as it is for a guy. don't know what I will do with it. I ordered the.  another wonderful life as I found it was the girl version. I haven't had time to try it yet. but am looking forward to play it. I love my harvest moon magical melody and I know I'll love this one. I enjoy the animal crossing games too. I don't play fight or killing games. These games I play have lots to do in them and keeps you busy. this C.G.Global LLC sent the game right away. the game was in very good condition.	-1
comparing this game to the MM version, this one leaves a lot to be desired! graphics are ok but that is about it... not as entertaining as the other games. will play when i have a bout of insomnia so i can fall asleep right quick.	-1
I got HM:A Wondeful Life and LOVED it,simply LOVED it!  I played until midnight the day I got it,and kept on playing every day!  I decided to try the GBA HM a spin and I was disapointed with what I got.  Time goes by to quicker than in AWL and the years take too long  The biggest problem is that it gives you no reason to keep going.  In AWL,as the years go by,you get married,have a kid and watch him grow and help influence his career;sure,you can get married and have a kid in this one,but that only means you get to talk to them everyday so they don't hate you.  In AWL,you can do so much with your son,here you just talk to him.  These days,I have stopped playing AWL and FOMT is forgotten.  But I'll always love AWL and hate FOMT	-1
Throughout my childhood, Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town was a big part of my life. I still give it repeated plays and treasure the memories I had exploring the game. It will always be one of my favorite video games and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  But this game is NOT in the closest to earning that same praise from me. I learned about Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life from a younger friend. When I saw it being played at her house, the graphics looked so beautiful and it seemed like something to be enjoyed. Wow, looks can be deceiving. First of all, I want to praise this game for the beautiful graphics and design. It also brings in a lot of unique ideas such a different kinds of cows and ducks and being able to grow trees. I really liked how you interact more with your family and raise your son. Now, the negatives. The farm chores are incredibly boring and watering plants feels impossible. I prefer the class farming feel of the previous games. Days and months drag on and on. Maybe this is just me but I prefer a more high speed feel. It is more fun to just accomplish one big thing a day! The festivals are completely boring and all of the characters, besides the three main girls you can date, are dull and one dimensional.  NOTHING ever changes or happens in this game besides for your son. The town stays boring, the days stay boring, the farms stay boring, it is just an all around boring experience.  I feel like this game had some potential and good ideas but with such a terrible farming system and town, it just is not worth playing. You are much better off purchasing Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town or Harvest Moon 64.	-1
This game is really bad and hard.  You start as a rancher, but making money is very hard, you have to marry raise kids, like in real life, but it's not as it sounds, it's boring,cause you have to do everything all the time. Bottom line Don't buy it, if you haven't played the other ones	-1
These have been opened then sealed by third party not from manufacturer.	-1
Let's face it - Twin Snakes blows. Anyone who says it's good is totally lying to themselves or has not played the original MGS1 for PS1.  A majority of the cut-scenes were unnecessary and really stupid. Snake does some super-human moves that just ridiculous - this isn't The Matrix or some Steven Seagal movie.	-1
Like most anyone that even knows about this game, I am a Harvest Moon fan.  I've put many hours into playing HM: Friends of Mineral Town for GBA and HM: Back to Nature for PSOne, and they have been great experiences.  This game will have a good first impression (the reason for all of the good reviews); but it's extended-play and replay value are very poor. This game put me to sleep on several occasions (I'm in Chapter 4 of 6); I'm trying so hard to end this game (that's my motivation to play it right now).  It is so repetitive.  All the common tasks, such as watering crops and making cheese/butter, are done pretty slowly.  For example, watering crops take about 4-5 seconds EACH crop seed (no special can that waters more than one at a time like other HMs and still no sprinkler system).  This doesn't seem that long unless you factor in the number of crops (average of 30) and it must be done twice per game day.  I've stopped farming and took up sleeping as an occupation so that time will fly. The most annoying thing about this game is the events.  First of all, there are no special festivals such as animal contests and birthdays.  There are only three boring festivals where you just watch.  Festivals are what made the other HM games so special.  Moreover, the game description will brag about having over 100 trigger events, but most of them are just basically boring repeats.  Additionally, most of the events are so corny, maybe a 5-year old may find it funny. There are many other flaws, but the ones mentioned above are "enough said" ones. On the positive side, this game does have some cool features: -The graphics are nice to view. -The entire outdoors is preloaded into memory, so you don't have to wait for different sections to load. -Characters, including yours, now age. -You can ride your horse all over town. -Gift-giving requirements to make friends are reduced significantly. -and other minor ones. If you buy this game, make sure that you have a lot of energy before each play.	-1
Pigs, cows, and women, oh my!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I purchased MGS for GameCube and wish I hadn't. If you removed the laboriously long cut scenes there's actually very little game here. I get the impression Hideo wanted to make a film but could only get a job directing a video game and decided to make a film anyway. The controls and camera are very cumbersome and the bad guys always see you before you can see them. The weapons are very standard - no imagination there. I would have given the game three stars if not for two ridiculous features I've found that totally spoil it. I think Hideo has a crappy sense of humor. First, there's a spot early in the game where one of the characters tells you to use a radio frequency 'on the back of the package'. I went through the whole game again trying to find the package he was refering to. It turns out he's refering to the package the game came in! Talk about less than total immersion! Second was one of the bosses who can only be hurt if you use controller three. What the **** it this ****? One star and I'm being generous. If I ever see Hideo's name on another video game I'm going to run a mile.	-1
I remember playing this on my ps2 years ago and I thought I would break it out again. This has to be the worst game in reagards to controlling it. the story is excellent, but the controls are so lame, you can't control your characters actions especially  when driving. They did a good job with Mafia 2, but this original one is not good.	-1
Blah! I was looking for more free-to-roam games on the wiki and this game was on the list and when I read about it, it sounded fun so I brought it for Xmas only to be greatly disappointed.  What bothered me the most was that you HAD to do the missions and you HAD to drive a certain car. The game designers for this game were so up tight! He couldn't get into a car because of the lock, couldn't start the car after tearing the door down because again he never seen the lock before. Which makes no sense. If you are going to kick someone out of their car, they aren't taking heir keys with them!  Ugh! So I did the driving options. The countryside or city one and I loved the countryside because the graphics were nice but god forbid you mess that car up because he can't jack another one! Ugh! I'm starting to wonder why I got so bored with GTA San Anadreas.	-1
I never seen this game on the PC, but when it came out a few years ago, it got rave reviews.  So, I decided to check it out on the PS2.  Uhm, I shouldn't have.  It's one of the GTA 3 clones, and the worst one yet. First off, the graphics are great for a console.  The city resembles a little of Chicago of the 1930s.  The gameplay is decent, the navigation is easy.  There are no random search for items, backtracking, or impossible missions.  The constant save points tend to limit replaying the same part of the level over and over again.  The cutscenes, though sometimes are really dull and cliched, are decent enough to be watched. Though it tried to be like GTA3, It's unlike GTA3 in that the city and the missions are not seamlessly integrated.  It's basically drive to one place, and cut to the third person perspective.  Not that immersive. The driving is horrendous.  Definitely not as bad as the Getaway, but really slow and dull.  The police will sometimes stop you for speeding.  It's really more irritating than realistic.  The cars themselves are pretty clunky, though they improve somewhat later.  Finally, there really is nothing fun to do while driving.  They made it as dull as, well, driving across town in a station wagon.  Mostly all the missions require you to drive from a bar to some other part of town, and it's really mostly the same road.  There is no fun in exploring.  The music is some 1930s slow classical jazz that either annoys you or puts you to sleep. The third person perspective is fine, except for a couple of glaring glitches.  When an enemy comes up close to you, the firing mechanism just entirely fails.  They just ignore your shots and punch you to death or kill you with one shot.  Another bug is the fact that shooting at someone is completely random.  It might take one shot to kill a guy, but if you repeat the mission, it might take six head shots the next time.  Vice Versa the other way.  You might get blown away in one shot, while other times you'll traverse a huge mission while only losing ten percent of your health. Finally, the continuity of the game is just wrong.  Almost every mission starts off with a load time and a cutscene, and another load time. Then you have to get a gun right down the alley, this entails another cutscene.  Then a car right down the stairs, which has another cutscene.  Then you leave the head quarters, which triggers some more load time.  Usually you have to drive to the other side of the town.  The worst part is, while driving, the other half of the city triggers another load time.  It takes about ten to twenty minutes to actually start the mission.  About one third of my playing time was devoted to this stupidity.  Really, they couldn't just have given me the car, weapon, and start me off at the correct building and saved my sanity?  Really?  Also, in other parts of the missions, the automatic save points and other loading times lull me into sleep.  Some of the hardest parts of some missions was staying awake. Pros: Good graphics Easy Navigation Cutscenes are good No walkthrough needed Automatic save helps Cons: Dull driving Loading time Useless driving Missions contain useless parts Close range firing bugs Uneven combat Lack of continuity Cannot save at any point Bad music Time to complete: 15 hours Difficulty: Easy to Medium Frustration Level: Medium to High	-1
This is a decent game (the only reason I gave it 2 stars).  The story is great and it is a well developed game that goes along the lines of THE GETAWAY and GRAND THEFT AUTO III/VICE CITY.  But the loading times are REDICULOUS!!!!  They put missions on different parts of the city, knowing that you have a loading times across cities.  Not only that, but the loading times are unbelivably long.  It is a great game, but if you are not a very patient person, this game isn't for you.  Take away the load times and this game is an easy 4 or 5 star game.	-1
These have been opened then sealed by third party not from manufacturer.	-1
very hard to play and can get difficult at times	-1
My brother got this game last xmas, it came with this useless microphone lol, anyway we loaded the game, and it was pretty dissapointed, at least for me.. ill tell you why:  1. The in-game voice is not good, specially, I hate Daisy's voice.. is just not that good and it can be very repetitive. you will just like to turn off your TV.  2. Characters: The same old ones: Yoshi, Mario, Luigi wahh, but these ones are the original see? but then nintendo wanted to come up with this lame idea to put Wario, Daisy, and another guy that looks very tall... this is dissapointed cause they are just a bunch of duplicated characters with differents clothes.  3. The gameplay is good but is just the same trick in every sequel they make! is just the same thing with another set of graphics, and new minigames. The game here suffers in being repetitive specially when you play it alone (This is pointless cause this game is no fun if you are not playing it with someone else, is more funny in multiplayer) but as I said, is very very repetitive, the game chooses the minigames for you.. is just get very repetitive. Dont get me started, this game is pointless if you just have one GC controller...  4. The controls are nice, but it depends on which minigame you are playing, the learning curve will take about 15 or 30 minutes to learn, or maybe less, as I said it depends on the minigame.  5. The graphics are good but not excelent, this is why I gave it a 2 stars rating..  Well, if you have more  than one GC control pick this up, if not avoid it, otherwise it will get veryyyy repetitive in both multiplayer or story mode.	-1
I bought this game used so it had 3 files in used already. Started my own game, i put it on hold since i have console games to play but going back to it i have no flipping clue where to go or what to do. In this game instead of getting stars you get beans. Beans are key  collecting  item goal. I thought i got the bean in soda forest but the map says i didnt. Thus i am completly lost & have no intererest in playing anymore. Hardest part was some donkey part mini game. This game sucks	-1
My 6 year old likes this game a little bit.  My husband and I would rather scrape and paint the side of the house.  There are much better choices for games:  Animal Crossing is a good non-violent game, and Gauntlet Dark Legacy (if you can find it anywhere) has provided a lot of hours of fun too.	-1
Ok, now if this game was the very first mario party game ever, then i would like it.  BUT COME ON!!! There r already 4 MARIO PARTY GAMES!!! AND THEY R ALL EXACTLY THE SAME!!!! O sure, there might be a few differen't mini games and crap but ITS THE SAME EXACT CONCEPT!!! AHHHHH!!! IM GONNNA DIE!!!  The only reason you should buy this game is if you have NEVER EVER played a mario party game before or if u don't have ANY mario party games.  IT would just be wasting your money if u collected all these games.  And if you've never played a mario party game but wanna buy one, i would say u should probably buy an older one becuase the older ones r ALOT CHEAPER and still EXACTLY THE SAME!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!	-1
Its true. First of all its not as fun as Mario party 1,2,or 3. This is not good at all. Youll probably want Mario party 1,2,& 3. A person would probably fell disappointed If they bought Mario party 4 or even this. I think they will make a mario party 6. They dident did do a very good job with this or even mario party 4 or even this. They however did a good job with mario party 1,2,& 3.	-1
The main problem I had with MP5 is that it just takes so stinking long to play a game.  I also have Mario Party 3 (for Nintendo 64), which is the best game in the series, and it has options to allow you to skip the CPU's mini-games and speed up the movement of the characters.  MP5 doesn't have this.  What it does have is special "events" and bonuses on nearly every space. The result is that it took me about 75 minutes to play a 10-turn game the other night, when I can play a 15-turn game of MP3 in less than an hour. I do not like the concept of the "capsules," either.  Instead of buying bonus items from stores, you get a "free" item every time you pass a gumball machine, and you have to pay to use it.  Problem is, the game asks you before every turn whether you want to use a capsule or not.  Annoying! Also a problem (in this game even more than the other MP games) is the excess of animations that slow down the game even more. The boards also seem to be overly complex... sometimes you'll go through an entire game and none of the players will ever get a star. The mini-games, which are the heart of any MP game, seem very dull.  Only a couple seemed not to be derivative of the previous games.  On the plus side, the graphics and sound, of course, are very nice, especially the 3-D game boards.  But no one plays Mario Party for the graphics.	-1
The Mario Party franchise is one of the most well-known game series and has known to be one of the most fun. However, after playing and beating Mario Party 5, I must say that it is evident that the developers lost their touch and are running out ideas. All, and I seriously mean all, of the the mini games are either boring button mashers or mini games that we've seen in Mario Patry's 1, 2, 3, and 4. I was greatly disapointed by this title because I did love the first four Mario Partys, but this one is purely unoriginal. I know one could say that it looks good because they added a single player mode, and still has a great party mode. However, who honestly cares that a game has a single and party player mode if the gameplay itself is boring? The answer is no one. Take the word of a hardcore gamer that has beaten the single player mode of this game and played through the party mode, this game is not worth $50. If you want a party game, seriously, your better off getting Mario Party 4. It has the same graphics, better price, and is a better game. Only extremists of party games and the Mario Party series that have all of the previous installments should consider buying this game when it becomes cheaper. But, for the average gamer and as of right now, you'd be better off saving that $50.	-1
Mario party 5 is the worst out of all of them! The super duel mode is poor because the cars are slow, the capsules was a dumb idea because your never sure what your going to get and they don't do anything good at all. Most of the mini games are boaring and the levels are boaring also. They lost their touch! I asked my dad for it on christmas because I thought it would be better then all the other ones I played. Major disappointment! If you have a Gamecube get Mario party 4. Thats just my opinion though!	-1
You notice how in movies and books how 90% of the sequals are s***.  Well guess what?  It's the same thing for video games.  I must admit that the old Marios were tons of fun.  But then that stupid Nintendo 64 had to come around and start the new Marios.  You could by an old nintendo system and a classic mario game for almost half the price of this garbage.  And i can guarantee that you would get more enjoyment and playing time out of a classic then one of these imposters.  Plus 90% of gamecube games suck.  If the title of this game didn't have the word Mario in it, this game would have a hands down 1 star.  Do yourself a favor and run as far away from gamecube games as you can.	-1
We love Mario, but we can't figure this game out at all.  My 7 year old won't even play it anymore.  I don't get it.	-1
I don't know. I guess Im just not good at games like these. My mind doesnt work that way. Theres a lot of people who do have those skills though. I guess I just suck at RPGs except Zelda.	-1
This game really is bad after you've played one of the socom games. If only you are playing this game, it is really hard because your teamates always do the dumbest things. All you can tell them to do is follow you. Bad graphics and it feels unsmooth. With 2 people this game is very fun because you can split up and do separate objectives or distract a tank while your friend places a C4 next to it. Aiming is not set up good because it is auto aim and is too hard to hit the guy that you want to. ememy AI is still pretty dumb and will aimlessy run at you. You can stand right in frount of a tank, up next to it and it can't touch you. More challanging than the first and better missions. Very bad level design. Not a very big improvement over the first. You could possibly beat it in a rental. Smart that you can give and trade things with your partners.	-1
Game doesn't work.  Light scratches my butt.  So yeah sucks for me I guess.  At least I can use the game as a coaster.	-1
I can get as far as installing it. Then whenever I try to start it I get DirectX 3D errors. Don't get the PC version if you have a laptop- and even with a desktop, make sure all your audio/video card drivers are up to date- or this game is essentially a $30 coaster. I've uninstalled it and am waiting for Vivendi to release a patch(if they ever will, that is). My brother has a Gamecube, so I bought that version of the game, and It was good. But I never could get this one to work on my laptop.	-1
I thought this game was slow and boring.  The controls were ackward and movement was difficult.  The scenery was detailed, but I spent more time looking around than actually doing anything.  I can't really say what was specifically lacking.  I thought it was uninteresting, hard to manuver through, and rather dull.  I played it for a few days, hoping something about it would grab me, but nothing every did.	-1
Did not really like this game.	-1
horrible game that's all their is to be said	-1
too complicated not into racing	-1
Not as good as GT3	-1
As the subtitle of the game implies, it is the "Real Driving Simulator". GT4 attempts to imitate driving in real life and does a pretty good job. The cars and race tracks are beautiful. And there's plenty variety of cars to choose from. But gameplay can be frustrating and drive you up the wall if you can't master cornering or brake at the wrong time and spin out.  I for one just suck at this game, since I couldn't get used to cornering. Heck, I didn't want a realistic experience in driving or buying a car. I just wanted to race. So I jumped in head-first, picked the coolest car I could find, and drove like a maniac around the track, only to spin out and lose the race. This game, as I found out too late, is more suitable to those who want a classy, lifelike imitation of driving a real car. But I didn't want that. I never should've listened to that review of this game off of Youtube. This game is NOT easy. It's hard and requires much time and dedication, both of which I don't have much of, especially to a game of this difficulty.  Guess I should've gone for a racing game like Burnout, huh?  The "realistic" driving experience here is authethic, and I'm sure someone out there loves it. But this game was more infuriating than fun for me, and now has a permanent spot under the other games in my collection, wasting away. What a waste a money. I bought it "New", you know. And I can't get a refund for a product that works fine but I suck at using it. What a waste...	-1
Just as a disclaimer, my standards are very low when it comes to racing games. So when I say this game sucks, I mean most normal gamers will think this game sucks.  I loved GT3 so I thought this would be an improvement. But I was wrong. This game sucks in every possible way, interface sucks, the graphics are worse than GT3, and the events are the same as GT3. The license tests are embarrassing to the franchise.  I was hesitant to buy the game in the first place but after I saw the positive reviews on amazon (124 5stars and 36 1stars) I thought that many people can't be wrong, but I was SOOO WRONG. Those people were either paid off to make good reviews or the sellers of the game made fake reviews to con us into buying it. Either way they were wrong.  PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on this game.	-1
I liked GT3 AND loved! GT2, so let me begin by saying this game does not measure up...  The sad part is that there are a ton of cars, including used cars and really neat historical cars but that is not enough to save this game. My problem with this game is that driving cars is too darn hard, I cant even corner going 60 in a super car most of the time!  What else is wrong? NO F1 CARS!! I really don't know how they avoided putting them in this game. It was too tough to drive with cheap cars and the same was true for super cars, just stick with gt3 and save yourself the headache	-1
In order to be impressed by the graphics, you need a HDTV.  Without one it's a touched up GT3, jaggies and all.  The city tracks are nice to look at, but the actual race courses(laguna seca) are poorly done, especially considering there are only 6 cars per race.  I didn't want to use the F word(I'm not even getting it), but the side-by-side video between GT4 and Forza's Laguna Seca is an eye-opener.  The PS2 is capable of more than this.  To notice the physics differences, your going to have to have the $150 wheel.  This is the only real addition worth buying the game for, but most people are going to skip it due to it being as much as a new console.  The bottom line is the game in this day in age feels dated and wooden without the wheel.  Now this doesn't apply if you didn't play the other GT's, but what the hell kind of racing fan hasn't.  The interface is pretty much the same as always.  Sure some things like races are better organized, but they are just sprawled all over the place on the map.  And you know that little Garage icon from earlier GT's.  Say goodbye to that.  For all the delay hoopla, nothing meaningful was done except PD playing around with obscure japanese cars.  No online play, AI or damage will mark the GT series' downfall.  Enthusia, nevermind inevitably forza, might take the crown away this year.  Unless you meet the far-fetched criteria needed to see changes, you are better off passing on this game.	-1
I was so looking forward to this game and now that I finally got to play it, it is a HUGE disapointment.  Sure there are some minor improvements over GT3, but they certainly aren't worthy of all the development time that went into this game.  Those minor improvments are:  better graphics, improved physics engine (so they claim), more race tracks, slightly better car selection (a few more American cars now, but still none of the top racing brands, and way too many obscure Japanese cars that no body cares to use anyway.  Sure there are 600+ cars but most of them are just cheap filler, like 20 versions of the same car).  Most of the added features are just cheap gimmicks, like taking pictures of your cars; who cares???  The biggest thing that's missing is ONLINE PLAY!!! What happened? They promised online play for GT4 and it's not here! With out this major feature there really isn't much reason to buy this game!  Now we'll all just have to wait and hope that Forza Motorsport for XBox (which will have online play) will be able to deliver on what GT4 didn't!!  Save yourself $30 hard earned dollars and spend $20 on GT3 instead, and if you already own GT3, don't waste $50 on this minor update.	-1
After a long time playing with GT3, only thing that wasn't there and won't be there in the 4th installment is Online. First they say no, then yes, then guess what, no again. This game is going to play just like the last, only improvment is the newly added cars, still gameplay is the same, from the Prolouge game that came out on early August, and well, that's it. The no. 1 driving sim my A$$, there's no online mode, they kept me waiting saying that it'll be online, and when they announce the official release date, they manage to say that it's not online. How does Sony, the publishers of this game, don't seem to add in their trademark online mode? Makes you think!! NOT!  Guess i'll have to wait for Need For Speed Underground 2, atleast that game has online mode, the heck with wasting my cash on this garbage.	-1
This game is not worth the money wasted, it has no camera to know where you are going. Also you go through the same patterns all through the game. It is a game that when you try to get the support it claims for help YOU WILL NOT GET IT. Also I think who ever created this game should stick to coloring books because you sure don't know know anything about making a game. You waste people money and time. Your Spirits & Spells does not have a walkthrough because it a real boring, stupid game.  I even had to put a 1 point star to get this in, But my opinion it's a -100.	-1
There are much better games out there for PC. Kind of crude, but at least it is a open world platform.	-1
Doesn't work with windows 7..But just tried to see if it would	-1
By far the  worst game I've ever played. From the AI that cannot miss and to the swarms that come from nowhere to the no save check point system. I can list more that I don't like than I do. I'm glad I got this as part of a discounted pack. I'd be pissed if I paid for this junk.	-1
couldn't get it to work even though it asks to install	-1
I was fairly excited to see this game go on sale for $4 on Xbox Live a few weeks ago. I knew it is an older game so I didn't expect too much, but maybe my expectations are still too high for this game because I ended up uninstalling it after running through the 4th level. Here is why...  ...switching weapon bug. After picking up a weapon I noticed that I can't can't switch it. I hold down the yellow button on the controller and press it and nothing happens. I sometimes reload the checkpoint and it is resolved. For a game this old this problem should have been resolved. I would pick up a sniper rifle because this is probably the best weapon in the game to have if you like to play like I do. Which is kill everything, but from a safe distance. And I wasn't able to use it. Not cool!  ...Ok so here is probably the most irritating thing in the game and the deal breaker for me. If anybody has ever played Halo 4 they will know what I am talking about. AI using suppressing fire type guns should not be able to casually aim and hit you over and over again from a distance of 400+ yards away. Also there really wasn't any stealthiness to the game other than the premade ways to do it by the developers. Once you come into any sort of area where the enemy is they automatically know where you are and will start shooting at you. Even through walls. As gamers we have moved past the days with having to deal with AI like this. I am not kidding. I would be croutching and walking really slow and BOOM! They would see me and me running to me to get me and alert the insane amount of enemies in the area I was trying to sneak through.  ...There is an emphasis on being stealth in this game, but they don't give you moves or weapons to be stealthy with other than your stupid melee punch which doesn't work anyway because you can't get close enough to the enemy anyway because they will see you even if you sneak up from behind.  So basically I learn really quick that if I wanted to play through this game I would need to put the difficulty on easy and just deal with the gun bug. After I got through Mission 4 with basically just gung hoeing and strafing through enemy areas I put this stupid game down. Far Cry 3 is obviously is way better than this game. I dunno if the pc version is any better. I'm hoping it's just a bad porting job done for Xbox. So if you have an Xbox and see this game. STEER CLEAR. If you have a PC. It's probably way better.	-1
I'm shocked so many people like this game. I found it to be bad all around, even for its time. Unreal is much, much better in my opinion. The aiming is off & it seems a bit confused as to what it's trying to be. Lackluster experience all around here.	-1
This game is over due for the bone yard, it will not load in the latest 64 bit operating systems. I'll let this copy go cheap.	-1
I purchased this game about 2 months ago.  Initially I was very happy with it but about midway through it becomes ridiculously hard, even on the easy setting.  There are 5 different difficulty levels and even on the easiest I was being killed in 2-3 hits sometimes.  To progress through some of the areas you need to rely solely on luck.  I don't know where this mentality of making games so realistic came from, but if I'm dying several hundred times in the course of the game, constantly having to fight through the same areas over and over again just to get to the next auto-save point, it is not a good game in my opinion.  I was relieved when I finally beat it, I'll never play it again because of the constant frustration of dying in this game. I'm no novice to FPS games either, I've been playing them since Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.  This game does have it's good points though, the graphics are great, the setting (a chain of tropical islands) is expansive and scenic and the AI is very good.  So in conclusion, if you don't mind having to die hundreds of times and fight through the same groups of enemies dozens of times hoping to get lucky enough to progress, then this game is for you.	-1
I played the demo of this game a while back and liked it from what I had played (which was very little). A few years later I was looking for a new game to play and I saw this on the shelf at Best Buy. It was only 20 bucks so I decided to give it a go. I didn't remember how to play really and I was shocked at how quickly you get thrown into the thick of the game. I don't really like fighting eagle-eyed mercs from 1000 yards away with a pistol when they have armor and assault rifles. I didn't much care for the voice acting in the game and I felt the main character was extremely cliche'. One issue that really bugged me was the way that talking competed with the game. It seemed like every time Doyle would talk to me I would be in the middle of a firefight or I wouldn't be able to hear a word he said without stopping what I was doing and turning up the volume. The story was rather mediocre and the idea of genetically altered something or others is so overdone. My biggest peeve about this game is the lack of save points. I felt like I could play Far Cry for an hour without finding a save point. Maybe it is just me, but I hate getting through a difficult part only to get killed by something stupid and having to redo that entire difficult part. There were some parts of the game where I would have to stop playing for a few days and gather my nerves after trying to the same part for hours straight.  On the plus side, it has very good graphics and physics are good. The vehicles are fun to use as well. The weapon selection is pretty good too.  I wouldn't pay much more for this game than $20. Also, don't play on the hardest setting like I did. It will let you reap the benefits of normal blood pressure after about a week.	-1
from what i've played of far cry, i think it's a great game and just the kind of game i like.  unfortunately, i can't continue playing it because it won't let me!!!  chapter 1:  i start out playing the game but i noticed the sound is having problems cutting out for a little bit.  some guy online says to avoid a later patch, so i use an earlier one.  everything works fine until one point where the map tells me to go to a checkpoint.  i go there.  it's at the end of a dock.  i look around EVERYWHERE for what i'm supposed to find there, all around the beach and underwater.  nowhere to be found so i can't continue the game.  i uninstall it.  chapter 2:  i reinstall it and install the latest patch (1.4).  the sound problem still exists but it's not a big deal.  i just want to have fun with this game.  then i notice a strange quirk about the targetting icon.. when i aim at a person's head, it seems not to hit!!!  now i play an online multiplayer FPS a lot and get a lot of headshots, but just to make sure i'm not just sucking badly, i go up to a person really close and find the same stupid problem:  the bullets don't hit at all when i shoot his head or upper torso, but are fatal when i hit HIS STOMACH.  good lord.  i can't play a game like this.  i have to stop, again, for another stupid technical problem.  this is on top of 2 other problems..  the game detected my system as "very high" spec, yet obviously this was not the case because it crashed unless i played with the graphics on the "low" setting.  other problem is, ironically, the freakin' AI.  ok, let's say you play on normal difficulty like i would normally do on a game.  well, the enemies are WAY TOO EASY.  i stood there and literally watched as two men ran up to me and shot me over and over, missing and doing no damage.  that's good AI?  i don't think so.  so i put it on challenging level - oops!  too hard.  someone kills me from long range through a window, which i doubt he could see me through.  so i switch it back to normal with AI auto balance.. ahh, there we go.  it's really easy at first but as you blow through the enemies, it makes them harder.  then if you keep dying in the same place, it makes them easier.  that's a pretty good idea.  but i had to restart the game over and over to figure that out.. only to find it was aiming wrong.  geez.  i find it kind of strange other reviewers haven't mentioned all these technical issues with far cry.  maybe if i REMOVE the patches i can get it to work.  irony!  as for the multiplayer, i can't comment on it because i signed up for it but it still won't work.  update:  i tried again and found out why a guy shot me through a window - because of YET ANOTHER BUG!!!!!!!  that's right folks, i got everything to work right in this game except for ENEMIES SHOOTING ME THROUGH SOLID BUILDING WALLS.  that's with the latest patch!  how's that for buggy?  also i'm still not overly impressed with the AI.  i have seen amazing AI before, and this ain't it.  it's decent, but i've seen better.	-1
First, the good. The graphics in "Far Cry" are stunning, especially for being produced in 2003. The water effects are stellar, the foliage and trees life-like. The tropical scenery creates an overall impressive atmosphere. The artificial intelligence is also improved over many previous games. Enemies will actually hide in the underbrush and track you if you try and retreat. Obviously, there are still the typical problems with any computer AI that are a byproduct of the fact that a computer can't "think" like a human can.  Now, the bad, and there is lots of it. First, the ESRB rating system should either be trashed or severely reformed. They list this game as containing "Blood and Intense Violence," yet they somehow ignore the fact that just about every other sentence spoken by the characters contains at least one profanity. This is a splendid example of how ESRB doesn't actually monitor the entire game before rating it. Also, there is a moderate amount of sexual content present, yet there is no mention of that on the rating, either. A warning to parents: Don't let your kids play this title. The violent aspect aside, there is plenty of objectionable material. Don't go by the "Mature," "Teen," or "Everyone" rating alone - actually see what's in the game before letting your children play it. You can't trust the rating system.  Second on the bad list is the repetitive nature of the levels. The "tropical paradise" motif is interesting for a while, but it quickly becomes tiresome. There is very little level variety. Also, there are a number of pitiful graphics glitches that is evidence of either poor programming or a last-minute rush job to get the game out. At one point in the game, a slain mercenary actually "levitated" about five feet off the ground. Often times when you're driving a jeep or other vehicle, grass will literally punch its way through the floor of the car, displaying another of the many graphical glitches. The physics engine is also exceedingly messed up. Stuff will somehow "roll" down a perfectly flat area of land. After rolling down a hill or off a bridge, some things will get stuck in the water and make a continual "splash" sound that will drive you batty. Finally, the plot is absolutely pitiful. Yes, this is a first-person shooter and therefore we shouldn't expect masterful storytelling, but the plotline does not even attempt to be feasible or explain who the characters are or attribute any motivation to their actions. Jack Carver is a sea boat captain who picks up a pistol one day and suddenly becomes Rambo, dispatching hundreds of mercenaries and mutants? Similar to the Half-Life notion of a scientist becoming a skilled marksmen in a matter of hours, that's a bit far-fetched, even for a computer game.  Overall, I give "Far Cry" a losing score. Parents, keep this title out of the hands of your kids. And for you adults, of which I am one, chew on this nut: Is playing this game really the best way to spend your time? Violence and general trash does have an effect even on adults. There are many better computer games out there that do not contain such sordid content (pick any of the Star Wars games for an excellent example). My advice is to go there and avoid this trash.	-1
Just like with Doom 3 and to some extent Half Life 2, you should upgrade to good graphics card before playing this - (Geforce 6600GT or better).  2004 belonged to Half Life 2 and Doom 3. Or so it was until Far Cry hit the scene from out of nowhere. These three game defined the year FPSwise. I think Doom 3 was the better game with Far Cry and Half Life 2 splitting second place.  Pros.  - The graphics, most of the time, are great.  - The sniper rifle. The zoom, the satisfaction of taking out an enemiy from 300-400 feet leaving the chap next to him none the wiser  - The intensity when there are bad guys nearby, but you cant see them  - Immersive gameplay  - Fantastic AI  Cons  - The game has been called non-linear. Its not. Games like Boiling Point, Gothic 2 (best game ever) and Morrowind, are. Far Cry tries to give the impression og being non-linear, but combat helicopters will take you out if you try to wander off  to far, impassable chasms and steep hills and mountains limit you and force you back on the "right route". The non-linearity refers to the numerous way of approaching the enemy. This is not a big deal though.  - The enemies have incredible eyesight and hearing. Crouching in a shrub 200 feet away from a bad guy still makes him go: whos there? and then firing upon you.  - The though guy image of protagonist and the pretty girlie he is trying to rescue, is a bit American action B-movieesque. Luckily this happens only in the cut scenes.  To summarize:  Great game. Buy.  Jan, Norway.	-1
This game is a disappointment. All I heard from people was, "good Reviews, good Reviews, good Reviews!!!!!!!!" But I have no good Reviews for this game.  Great graphics, in fact..... AWESOME GRAPHICS, but still the weopons are unrealisic!!!!! The P90 has a 5.7mm bullet , ARMOR PIECING(realisic)!!!!!!But it still takes 15 to 20 shots to kill someone!!!!!(unrealisic)  The armor on this game is way to strong!!!!!!  P.S. Plus, there are no AK 103's!!!!!!!!	-1
This game has some kind of program that causes sudden drops in framerate, freezes, and untimely loading actions, although the graphics are excellent, this game was poorly programed. I would like to know the people that programed this mess, to see if they are mentally retarded. This game does not have the looks, or feel of ubisoft. This game isn't anything like Silent Hunter 3. I have never given such a bad review as this, but I felt that I must , inorder to warn other gamers. there are a lot of first person shooters out there that is a lot better. The reviewer that stated something about having a crappy computer, let me tell you something, BOZO... I have a Gateway 550GR pentium 4, 3.4 gig processor with H/T ,over a gig of DDR overclocking memory, 200 gig hard drive, ati radeon pci EXPRESS 128 meg graphics card with all the bells and whistles. I have a top of the line computer, but I still have problems. This game needs a patch ASAP. As for the reviewer that stated that he has played it once, and now he is going to play it twice, he probably have the farcry cheats. I have the farcry cheats, and have finished the game also,with all the settings set to very high,and ultra high. YOU SEE AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME AFTER YOU KILL THE LAST SCIENTIST ON THE VOLCANO, YOU RESCUE THE FINE LADY, JUMP ON A SHIP, AND GIVE HER THE SERUM, THAT KEEPS HER FROM BECOMING A MUTANT, THE .....END. My reviiew will stay the same, the water doesn't look as good as the water in Blackhawk Down, doesn't even come close to the water in silent hunter3 OR Pirates of the Caribean, Thank You p.s. go to ...cheaters heavens, you will find a zip file, download this file to your desktop, then extract all to the farcry folder.,and have yourself some fun.	-1
Decided to give Far Cry a chance, now that I bought a new computer ... read the conflicting reports on compatibility ... even went to UBI Software to see the "issues" with the game ... best I could tell; if you have virtual copying software the game won't run = WRONG ... I contacted Customer support and was told: "Far Cry will not run on CD-RW or DVD-RW drives ... I will need to install a basic CD drive" ... wasted $17 and now I'm wondering if Splinter Cell: Pandora's Tomorrow will run ... I'm not jumping through video game company hoops to play their games ... I'll buy another FPS/RPG/RTS that works on my system "as it is" ... yes, a basic CD drive is cheap, but I'm physically disabled and not going to pay someone $50 to install a $20 part to play one game/one game company's product that cost $20(... I never pay $40-50 - I wait till the hype is over)	-1
I can't believe I paid money for this.  This is the only game I intend to throw away once I pass it.  I'm only still playing it because I'm trying to get my money's worth.  First, thegraphics are not the best quality and yes, I do have a current video card with all of its uodates.  Whenever I shoot someone in the far distance I get blood pixelating before my eyes blocking my view.  The game freezes every few minutes.  I can't adjust the sound so I have to turn up my speaksers just to hear the gun shots and the voice overs are drowned out by the background noises.  What little dialogue I've heard was horrible voice overs.  The story is stupid.  I'm a professional story-teller so I'm picky about good quality stories.  I can't wait to get this game over with.  This game wasn't worth the gas money I spent to buy it.	-1
I've never had so much trouble getting a game to play.  My pc more than meets the recommended requirements and it seems like it's full of bugs.  The cars are way too hard to drive.  You have to use keys to turns left or right, they aren't mouse controlled.  For pete's sake, let gamers quicksave whenever they want!  I hate hate hate not being able to save.  Who wants to get so far only to get killed and have to backtrack through gameplay--not fun!  It's also a major ordeal getting cheatcodes that work.  Some do, most don't.  Huge disapointment.  I've had it with pc games like this.  Never again.	-1
Casual gamers need to take note that this is a VERY difficult game on any setting.  I finish all the big FPS games on normal difficulty without any problems, but this one was sending me to the load screen CONSTANTLY on its easy setting.  Your character spends most the game in a constant hail of bullets from enemies that are mere specks on the horizon.  Anonymous, unpredictable death is very common as the hitpoints for the player are extremely low (relative to other games) even though he's supposed to be wearing body armor.  If you're not a gaming ninja with unlimited time to spend honing your FPS skills, you may be in for a frustrating experience.	-1
Yeah, this games looks great. But this game ran on it's easiest level is next to impossible. Unless you have hours to spend dying and restarting in the first 5 minutes of the game. Save your money. It's better spent on something like PAINKILLER or UT2004. After reading all the reviews and then buying the game, I'm very disappointed.	-1
PLEASE NOTE: This is from the Demo, not the full version of the game. Myself and a number of friends downloaded this game. We all came to the same conclusions independent of each other (7 people - 2 game designers, 2 avid players, 3 average players) 1. you need a high end machine to run the game, but it is worth it. 2. Maps and scenery and ambiance.  Wonderful well done. 3. The AI was total crap.  Predictable, non-responsive, and generally reminded us of much older games.  It's easy to find spots the AI is blind to. They also snap back to patterns. You can have a firefight just a little bit away from the island, and they ignore it (less then 150m or so). You can drop a badguy in some ways so the others ignore his death, even walking over the body.  We found some other AI predictabilities, which got worse as the game progressed.  You just find the patterns, pick off the badguys, and move on. It was heartbreaking that such a pretty game had such bad gameplay.	-1
Just a friendly warning to all CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW drive owners.  UBI Soft as a "feature" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in "some" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination. UBI Soft's tech support has said that this "feature" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  "Flawed" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller. I'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their "feature", not about the game itself.	-1
...and it was, for a few minutes.  It really was satisfying to rack up a 30-hit combo while destroying five or six foot soldiers all at once, just like the old-school TMNT arcade games.  And the cel-shaded graphics look awesome.  Unfortunately, killing an endless stream of soldiers and robots (who rarely vary) gets old really fast, and the stages are pretty boring despite the colorful graphics.  One stage takes place on a subway platform, and I thought trains would be roaring by every now and then, but they don't.  As others have mentioned, the sound bites really are annoying, especially Mike's (Eat feet! Eat feet! Eat feet! Eat feet! ad nauseum).  The challenge is quite uneven - the stages are incredibly easy, but you'll waste all your lives when you get to the final boss.  And you won't want to start over when the stage took you 30 minutes to get through.	-1
The graphics are ugly and resemble a cartoon. The worst part though is the stupid phrases that come out of the turtles' mouth(talk about annoying). A game that little kids would enjoy, not adults.	-1
THE GROUND MISSIONS BLOW!  Everything else is just dandy.	-1
that pretty much sums it up. the first 2 were great and everyone had high expectations of this one. only to be slightly bored most of the time and have excitment few and far in between. YOU CAN LEAVE THE COCKPIT!!!!!! No friggin way!@!@ !@ yeah but the controls are aweful and all you do is give the A button a work out. There's a 2 player mode!!!!! yeah but the only thing exciting about that is the co-op of Rouge Leader. some of the missions are kinda cool though the problem is you'll have to play through so much garbage you'll be afraid to continue on to finds these rare gems. Ok os here is what you should do instead...go buy Rogue Leader. you can probably find it somewhere for like 10 bucks.k and if you already own that one....i don't know, take a nap or something.	-1
I don't often review games, but I had to write in on this one. This game was pretty bad. Soem major plot flaws. Some horrible control (can't control the camera on foot missions) and just plain stupid elelments like "sonic weapons" in space. When I came across that, I just turned the game off. Fortunately I rented this because I wasn't sure I like it. I loved Rogue 2 and it's one of my favorite games. I liked the idea of flying some missions with a friend, but the single player version is dumb dumb DUMB. People who like this game probably also like Jar-Jar.	-1
First of all, there are a ton of reviews for this product but the customer reviews here don't apply to this game! This game was just released, but the reviews are dated from last year and refer to old Lucas Arts games. That said.......this is a "nice" game but it leaves a lot to be desired. To defeat some of the tougher dudes and even the bosses, just find a high perch and keep shocking them with your dark force lightning power. They die easily without a fuss. Most of the Storm Troopers just stand idley by while you shoot or rip through their comrades with the light saber. I played this game on the second hardest setting and I was finished in 7 hours!!! Yes, $50 and all I got was 7 stinking hours of mediocre game play!!! I honestly believe if you are over 13 years old, you will be disappointed. There are some "Star Wars" loyalists out there that will say this game is great. Hey...I love the Star Wars trilogy too, but that does not make this game any better guys! It does not matter how mean or kind you are, it does not matter if you build up your Dark Force powers and use them alot. It has NO bearing or affect on game play. Truthfully, the Dark Powers makes this game easy to beat. You get the options of customizing your characters looks and clothing and you can customize your light saber's hilt and color, BUT again this offers no bearing on the game play. Just simple eye candy to make it look like the programmers did a lot of work. This game is not horrible but it is not much of an improvement over Jedi Knight II -  that is the real truth. If you played Jedi Knight II - wait for this game to come down in price. If you have not played any of the Jedi games, WAIT for this title to come down in price after Christmas...you will be glad you saved yourself some money. Did I mention I finished the game in 7 hours!!! Wait and save your bucks...games like Half Life 2, Doom III and others are just about to be released!	-1
How in the world can a game like this be released?  It is unexceptable.  You can not control your man.  What may be cursor key straight ahead in one camera shot, will be left in the next...though you are still hitting the forwad cursor. Your man never stands straight, he's always at an angle and you are guessing which cursor key to hit...oops pick the wrong one and you're off the cliff. It is this insanity throughout.  It is absolutley impossible to control your man and the camera angle.  Decent 3rd-person role-playing games are like Star Wars Jedi Outcast or Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness.  The camera should station behind your character so that you can move your mouse and cursor keys accordingly....hello? Game Developers! Every PLAY one of these games before making one and putting it out on the market and charging $45 bucks!?!?  Morons.	-1
To summarize.....  If you want to play a game where it is close to impossible to control the protagonist, solve puzzles that doesnt make any sense at all to the overall story, climb walls while jumping from a ledge to pole over a crate while doing backflips - this just might be a game for you.  Add no savegame option (there are savepoints, but these are very, very far between), gameplay so linear it makes Pac Man and Space Invaders seem open-ended, and a pretty lame story - Voila, you have got Prince of Persia, The Sands if Time in a nutshell.  Some graphics were ok though,,,,,  Bargain bin fodder? Na, trashcan rather  Jan, Norway	-1
Karateka and Prince of Persia were the two games I grew up on. More than any other arcade-style games, I can vividly remember these two games and how much fun they were. This is one of the reasons I was so disapointed with "Sands of Time." I was really impressed wiht this game when I first played it. Except it was called "Tomb Raider" bck then. And that's all this is, Tomb Raider with a slight face lift. The storyline is basically the same: run around ancient places doing flips and sommersaults, and avoiding trips. That's EXACTLY what you do in Prince of Persia. The only difference is that youfight more NPCs. This actually detracts from PoP because the combat system is so weak. Gameplay on the PC is very awkward and difficult. Instead of space bar causing you to jump, it causes you to sommersault. For anyone with experience playing FPS or basically ANY game, the space bar should be reserved for jumping. But as I said, the combat is very weak. You can't run from monsters, and you can't really do many special attacks. Besides what the game may say, most of the attacks are the same, they just look different. I dreadedthe combat system because it was so boring. I just hit random keys until the guys died.  Special save points. UNlike Tomb Raider, this game has pre-set save points, which means you're pretty much forced to get to a certain area before you quit, or you lose everything you did. Some may like this feature, I found it annoying. If the game had been challenging AND fun I wouldnt have minded it, but having to redo everything was just a pain.  Lastly, the absolute worst thing about this game is the movement. Unlikle other games, the moue does not control your character, it controls the camera angle. This makes for some VERY disorienting game play. Long-time gamers will have a lot to get used to if they pick up this game. What's more, many times I found myself thrown into angles thta made it almost impossible to play or see where I was going. Several times the camera would go into a wall and no amount of moving the mouse would get a better shot. I just had to restart. That is the main reason this game is inferior to Tomb Raider. While this game might work on the PS2, it ports over to PC very poorly.  If you have never played Tomb Raider, you may find "Sands of Time" exciting. But considering when it came out, it should have had much better graphics, an easier skill set, and a better storyline. I'll have more fun playing the original Prince of Persia rom than this.	-1
This game is so hard for my youngster that he has gotten bored with it after only a short while. There are no real cheats for this game and there is NO easy mode. If your child wasn't born a gammer don't get it.. I did write to the company complaining about this game because it is marketed for small children but is too difficult for them to play.. They could care less! I won't buy another scooby doo game.	-1
I rented this game and thought it was crap.  Gameplay isn't any good; Sound and music is the same as any other Lucas game; Graphics are ok, and some of the creatures are nifty looking.  Controls aren't very good either.  2 player mode is kinda fun.  Might as well take your 50 bucks somewhere else.  So thanks, Lucas, for another pitiful game.	-1
I had a love hate relationship with this game. there were a lot of things I loved about this game and a lot of things I hated.first off the good things: 1 I loved the masiveness of this game it is huge. I played for 6 months and only covered about 1/3 of the game this playing around ten hours a day 6 days a week (I am retired) It is also very addictive. 2 I loved the freedom of this game you don't have a story line to stick to you basicly go where you want when you want, just like in real life. 3 I liked being able to stop and talk to people, it is a masive chat room. I met people from all around the world really neat. 4 the graphics are terrific very cool. 5 I loved the spells there are so many and the graphics for them are cool too. 6 I loved the dungons and dragons story line and it being set in midevil times very cool, I really like this type of game. Ok, now I will tell you what I hated about this game:1 grouping, this game is very hard and nerve racking in order to get to the top of your game you are forced to group at first you could solo but as they kept adding the expantions they started smerffing the charictors making them weaker so you would have to group. I liked to solo because for one thing I didn't have to share the spoils of war with anyone, also some players did't want to share with the group they wanted all the spoils for themselvs when I grouped I expected to share and did, but left groups very fast when they started to hog the spoils. The grouping its self was not bad it was kind of fun to talk and get to know other people it was the looting part of it I hated. 2 this is a free market society you have to buy your weapons and armour of course the best stuff is the most expensive stuff that is where the spoils come in. In oreder to get the money you need you have to kill monsters and loot the spoils then either sell them to other players or to venders so when you get in a greedy group you don't get payed for your efforts and most of the groups are like that. Other games have elimanted this from their group games which makes grouping a lot more fair and more fun they just give all the members in the group the same rewards rather than making them loot a single item. 3 camping I hated having to camp first you had to find an area where a certain monster was that had a great piece of armor or a wepon or item that sold for a great price usally when you got there there were other players wating in line to camp. It took me 2 days to get one place and if you died others would take it from you or groups would root you out especally if you were soloing other games have elimanted this too to make theirs more enjoyable and fair. 4 the graphics with the first 3 games the charactors looked a lot better then in pop or sol for example the females in the first three they were very pretty and sexy but with pop and sol they turned very ugly their bodies looked like they were 65 yers old or so yuck!. 5 this game starts off easy but gets much harder as you go on there are 65 levels and then you have your inate levels that take as long to do as the regular levels I made it to 45 6 when you die you loose your hard fought experiance I really hated this you could die a couple of times and loose two days worth of work not only that but you had to go get your corpse in order to get your gear and weapons if you didn't you would lose them as well I have droped as much as 2 levels before just trying to get my corpse back 7 secrets most of the spells after level 45 for my charitor were with monsters that I had to fight for them however I could never find out which ones to fight or where they were. There I had worked hard to get to level 45 to get these really great spells and everything was a mystery no one knew. finally after waiting 2 days for a camp and dying with in 30 minutes coming back to find it taken over by a small group that would not let me have it back I had had enough I quit. In sumation this game is fasinating, fun, and huge but its also hard, nerveracking, agravating, and you must group to get anywhere. If you are not social and don't realy like to group than I would sugest finding a different game. I hope this helps	-1
I want Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection made by Microsoft Game Studios in the U.S.  But, I think most of these games are from Ubisoft, a European company. If it is from Ubisoft, the game can be installed in English, Dutch, German and a couple other languages. If you have the necessary system requirements, the game will probably work on your computer.	-1
Sturgeon's law states that 95% of everything is crap. I think he was optimistic - for every Hamlet, there are bezillions of sitcoms; For every Ring Cycle, there are several cubic yards of mindless MTV pap. And for every Myst, or Syberia, there are far too many games like Crystal Key 2. Crude and muddy graphics, pointless story line, endless exposition, and illogical puzzles based on the tried and trusted technique of 'search everywhere until you are frustrated; talk to everyone many times over; try everything in your inventory, in combination if necessary' No redeeming features, as far as I can see....	-1
Don't you just love a game that has technical problems right off the bat. I installed this game without any difficulties and the game would not launch. So I uninstalled the game, disabled my anti-virus, and reinstalled the game. Still would not launch. So $20 completely wasted because I cannot even start the game. I wrote technical support for the Adventure Company - we'll see if they even bother to respond. They didn't the last time I wrote them about a completely different problem with another one of their games. I ended up having to get a new video card in order to play this game. Although, I'm sure it will come in handy for future games it was a complete waste of money regarding this game. I hated this game and I admit that I could not even finish it. The graphics were absolutely terrible, bad enough that it made gaming more difficult since I often couldn't make out what I was looking at. I attempted to play this game right after playing Syberia II. I don't expect every game to look as beautiful and detailed as the Syberias but this game looks like something that could have been produced 10 years ago. The other thing that drove me crazy was the music. For some reason the game had a jazz-like soundtrack. That would be fine if the game took place in New Orleans or Chicago instead of some planet elsewhere in the galaxy. I do my best to finish games (after all who wants to waste the money) no matter how bad they are. I just couldn't do it with this one.	-1
After berating the game makers for being over five months late in releasing this game and then belittling them for dropping the price to a bargain-bin amount of 20 bucks even before it hit the shelves, my pre-review for this game concluded by saying: "Being such a hard-core adventure game fanatic, if and when it finally does come out, I'll gladly play it.  Like the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as bad chocolate'.  But, at this point, I'm not holding my breath for some Godiva-like quality with this one." Well, the game did finally arrive and after playing it for a couple of hours last night, I can honestly say that this game is actually like the product "Mocklate" in the 'Friends' episode where Monica is hired to cheerfully promote the faux-product.  It looks just like chocolate, but it leaves a really BAD taste in your mouth! My wife and I really love to play adventure games, it is the only game genre we play.  If you've seen some of our other game reviews, you will know this is true.  While the initial episode of Crystal Key was inexplicably a strong seller, the game itself was not exactly earth-shattering.  We've played a lot of adventure games and 'The Crystal Key' ranks well down on our list of favorites (but, by all means, not at the bottom).  It was just a good, solid, average adventure game.  When they announced a sequel, we figured that they probably learned from the competition, grown along with the technology of gaming, and created a new chapter of the story that matches or exceeds the original. Boy, could that NOT be further from the truth.  This game is truly awful!  With the delays and price-chopping factored in, we had set our expectations exceedingly low.  But, some how, they managed to sink even well below that level.  The pre-released screen shots and trailer for the game cannot prepare you for how bad the actual gameplay really is.  Here are just a few of the CONs to the game (there are no PROs): -The graphics are even worse than the original game (which is almost five years old now).  Like the first game, they are pre-rendered, 360 degree panning shots that you are forced to navigate from point to point.  However, the textures and details of these graphics are far worse than in game one.  Every scene looks washed out and out of focus.  Plus, the cylindrical views actually "jumped and popped" as we turned which got exceedingly annoying after a while. -The music soundtrack, I am not kidding, sounds like it was dubbed from a porno movie!  I think they meant to give the game a "hipper" beat but, oh my, I don't think they intended to make THAT association. -The characters of the game are immovable, pixilated add-ins that show absolutely no emotion.  The voice-over acting is adequate, but the dialog is sophomoric at best. This drivel looks like it was created by a twelve-year-old, indy game developer using an old 386 computer.  Unfortunately, the list of credits for this game includes many members of a professional creative team!  I would have been much more lenient with my review had it actually been an independent creation.  ...	-1
Allow me to preface this by giving kudos to the programmer who put all his energy into designing a game that came solely from his heart.  That alone is worth an added star.  That being said...  If you believe in the supernatural, then this game is for you.  If you like your supernature to be eerie, then this game is for you.  If you enjoy adventure games in which you interact with no one, then this game is for you.  If you like taking lots of notes, as well as hand-drawing cryptic designs, then this game is for you.  If you like open-ended unanswered questions at the conclusion, then this game is for you.  This game was not for me.  Don't get me wrong, those who appreciate a creepy atmosphere and worthy (albeit grainy) graphics will be quite satisfied. ...if that's all they want.  But I wanted and expected more than that, and this game left me thoroughly frustrated to have spent all that time suspending disbelief only to be disappointed overall.  I'm sorry, but for me, the cons heavily outweighed the pros.  I wish they didn't.	-1
Dark Fall looked like an intriguing game with atmospheric locations and the story about ghosts and hauntings really ought to have made it brilliant. However it's no more than bland and boring.  Yes, the visuals and the various rooms of the abandoned hotel and train station ARE very impressive. But there is so much of NOTHING to do in them. The gameplay is kind of like the Myst games, being that when the arrow is moved over something important, the icon changes. But almost every screen in Dark Fall is completely non-interactive, so it's no more than a slide-show tour of an old hotel. What's the point?  It could have been creepy and the idea of answering ringing phones to have a ghost talk to you is completely wasted as it doesn't affect the gameplay one bit. There is a bit of humor in the newspaper clippings (be prepared to read loads of them) and in the voices of snobby ghosts but it's not enough to save this dull game from dying so quickly.  If you absolutely MUST then don't spend more than a few pounds/dollars. But there are loads of better games out there so you'll probably never even give it that much of a chance.  Graphics B+  Sound C-  Gameplay D  Lasting Appeal D	-1
There are few games that are either good or bad -- whether you like a game will depend on your own personal preferences and personality.  I am NOT a patient person and therefore I like faster paced games that don't require wandering around for hours "painting the walls" with your cursor to look for hotspots.  And I don't like having to collect a bunch of cryptic clues in order to figure out the combination to a safe. That's why this game just didn't work for me.  And also, at my age (a bit older than most computer gamesters, I must admit) it takes more than eerie voices and ghost stories to create a truly spooky atmosphere. Okay, and I'll also admit that with my eyesight, games where everything is dark don't appeal to me at all!  I found the navigation a bit clunky, as well, with the worse "save" game system I've ever encountered.  All this doesn't mean it's a bad game or that you won't enjoy it. It obviously is a great game for those who like the slower paced, more cerebral puzzlers. But if you're like me and prefer to get on with the story (and interact with other characters -- besides disembodied voices), a game like Syberia or The Longest Journey might be more to your liking .....

An old Ross Perot quote pretty much sums up this game: "You're going to hear a giant sucking noise" as you play this game.  Whoo, baby, does this game stink!  I thought that 'The Crystal Key II' (another recent Dreamcatcher/Adventure Company game) was pretty awful, but I did not know there was a whole other level of bad below that!  Holy cow, how does dreck like this manage to get published with such flashy and professional packaging and marketing? Jeez, where to start?  How about with the incredibly bad interface.  The game is a standard point-and-click adventure game where you navigate from point to point and then pan around in 360 degree views.  Panning requires you to hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse in the direction you want to pan.  What is so awful about this interface is that when you have dragged your mouse the entire width of your mousepad, you have only panned about one quarter of way around the view.  You then have to lift and reposition your mouse to drag it some more in the direction you are panning!  Most games have an option to correct this by letting you set the mouse sensitivity to a speed that you (and your video card) are comfortable with.  Is that option available here? NO! Can you pan with your keyboard instead? NO! As a matter of fact there are absolutely NO games options whatsoever!  You are stuck with one panning rate, one music volume, one dialog volume (a real shame since the dialog is putrid), and...you get the picture. Getting an item into your inventory is pretty easy (just click on it), but getting it out is absolutely painful.  You first have to click on a screen icon to pull up your inventory list, click on an item to see a larger view of it in the middle of your screen, click on that large image to change your cursor into a representation of that item, and then click on the exit button of the inventory screen.  Finally you then have to click on the game spot where you think the item might be useful.  Unfortunately, you typically have no clue as to what might work at a specific hot spot, so you end up trying EVERYTHING in your inventory to see if something works (and there is a lot of junk in there sometimes)! The puzzles of the game are a joke.  As a matter of fact, the very first two puzzles you encounter are pretty much the same thing: try to find the correct sequence of clicks to get all the way through the puzzle; if you guess wrong, start over!  They don't get much more imaginative beyond that.  My game came with a "limited edition" game strategy guide included free.  I'm guessing that all of them will come with this guide because, otherwise, nobody will be able to (nor want to) finish this embarrassment. As a final insult, the developers thought they would try to spice up their incoherent game by adding a lot of humor.  Done well, humor can add a very entertaining aspect to an adventure game.  The classic Zork games are excellent examples.  When done badly, as in this case, it just becomes irritating to the point of distraction.  Most of it is just not funny (okay, maybe to a six year old) and does not "fit" in the atmosphere of this game.  Jive talking jungle natives?  Please. Again, like Crystal Key II, this looks like the work of an independent game developer who has spent years putting together a workable game using "knives and bearskins".  If so, I would have admired the work and enjoyed the game for what it was.  Unfortunately, this game was, again, developed by what looks to be a large team (Hexagon).  Games like these give the game genre, which I love the most, a huge black eye and are probably the reason why so many people get turned off by adventure games.  What a shame, because there are some really good ones out there.  Unfortunately, you have to dig through a lot of dung like this to find it.  Avoid this game.	-1
I've been trying for a week to get this to work.  I've been going back and forth with their support department and the game keeps locking up my machine.  From what I've seen of the game so far, it looks like you might want to stay away from this.	-1
Just couldn't get into this game. It was boring. I only played for a little while and it just didn't hold my interest.  I had just finished playing Syberia before this one so maybe that had something to do with it.	-1
I am a huge adventure game fan, I did Schizm and enjoyed it. I have played all the versions of MYST, and others with a simmilar game play style, as they are my forte, and most enjoyable to me.  I usually can finish a game with little or no help, and maybe at times, a hint, to get out of a bind, but this game seemed to have little or no logic, and having had to refer to a walkthrough for MOST of it, I found it frustrating, tedious and annoying.  Some of the bizzare sounds in it literally made me nauseous and I had to mute the game to get through those parts! I found that even with the walkthrough, I asked myself repeatedly, how was I supposed to figure THAT out!? The graphics are indeed awesome, or I would not have even bothered to take the time to see it through to the end. It made me tense and was really not worth my time.  I frankly would only recommend this game to someone who is a dedicated gamer, and who wants a challenge that could cause you to want to pull out your hair!! The puzzles are too frequent and too random, a trial and error solution for the most part, if this is your idea of fun then you might like it, but for me. . .thumbs down all the way.	-1
Unlike the first Mysterious Journey, this game TOO many puzzles and is very boring.  If you want to play a game for hours and days without getting anywhere, then this game is for you.  I do nothing but workout and play games with my spare time, and this game isn't worthy of that time.  I've played games like aliens vs predator 2, eternal darkness, rez evil, tomb raider, so I have plenty of patience when it comes to gaming.  The graphics are stunning, but that's it for me.  If you don't have the first game, then get it instead.	-1
Regarding the puzzles in this game, apparently, the publisher didn't learn.  This is a set of impossibly hard, arbitrary puzzles masquerading as an adventure game.  Basically, read the lowest rated reviews here for the earlier game, Schizm, and you'll see what this game is like.	-1
I just installed this game and played it for 5 minutes and I literally want to  throw up. The graphics are awesome and the game looks like it would be really fun, if it weren't for the 1st person navigation system. This full 360 degree viewing is totally gross. it's like you are inside a sphere, and when you move the mouse the sphere rolls the screen around, so every single thing you want to look at requires the entire screen to move, at a disgusting rate. i slowed the mouse movement down as far as it would go but it was still like i was on a rollercoaster. Have you ever seen clockwork orange? you know how they forcefeed the guy images to cure him and he freaks out, well that's how i felt after 5 seconds of game play. 15 minutes later now, and i still have motion sickness. give me still images please!!	-1
My husband and I are experienced puzzle game players and huge fans of the original Mysterious Journey.  It was with great anticipation that we started this game, but we have officially given it up halfway through.  Our biggest problem is that our machine, only one year older than the game's release date, with a decent graphics card, does not have the right setup for this game's graphics rendering.  Stuff flashes in and out of visibility, the cursor comes and goes, people's arms detach from their bodies, and any prolonged animated scene completely mucks up the whole works to the point that the machine has to be rebooted (IF we can access the save screen at all).  We may have been willing to fight longer if the game had drawn us in more, but the puzzles just aren't as interesting as they were in the original, except for a couple of good mathematically-based ones.  Also, the puzzles were extremely linear; there was rarely a matter of collecting information in general towards solving one of several open mysteries (as one encounters in, say, Riven), but always just one puzzle you needed to solve at a time, and always of the "solve this so you can get past this door/bridge" variety, which got a bit repetitive.  We moved on to a different game in our "to play" pile...  and were sad to leave this one unfinished, but just couldn't take it any more.	-1
I have not been able to play this game yet.  It would have been nice to know that you need a video card that supports TnL before I bought it.  Costing I found around 100.00 bucks.  So now I have to wait till I can afford it.  The company should have written somewhere that you need this, because I read the box, and the requirements before hand, and it said nothing about needing this video card.  Now I am stuck with a game I can't play right away.....thanks alot!!	-1
The Adventure Company has a knack for taking high concepts and making them into terrible games.  Take for example "The Mystery of the Mummy", a Sherlock Holmes mystery game that made the world's most famous detective seem insipid.  As lousy as some of their attempts have been in the past, high concepts keep players coming back to The Adventure Company.  "Jack the Ripper" has a concept so ideal it seems impossible to ruin, and yet the game is phenomenally atrocious.  The game is set in New York City in 1901.  A couple of poverty-stricken showgirls have been murdered in a fashion similar to the Jack the Ripper killings of 1888.  Jimmy Palmer, a na've young reporter, is assigned by his editor to write a series of newspaper articles on the killings.  As Jimmy looks into the murders, he discovers that the same serial killer might be responsible for both the 1888 and 1901 murders.  There's the high concept.  The game play is from the first-person perspective of Jimmy from beginning to end.  It consists of returning to the same locations and talking to the same people repeatedly, using dialogue options that aren't really all that optional.  Occasionally, Jimmy can collect items such as keys and money to appease stubborn suspects.  There are only one or two actual puzzles in the entire game.    The game parades many characters based loosely on actual suspects in the real-life Jack the Ripper murders, but Jimmy never seems to come any closer to solving the mystery.  A game called "Jack the Ripper" should at least guarantee a creepy ambience, and the game seems to succeed in that area initially, but it soon becomes apparent that ambience isn't enough.  Menacing footsteps when no one is following you, whispered dialogue that is unintelligible and unimportant to the storyline, and shady characters that can't be interacted with and don't contribute anything to the plot become annoying after a short while.  In one room, a hushed, secretive whisper resembling "I can sell you the most beautiful radishes" can be heard repeatedly.  Dark, blood-stained alleys lose their creepiness after a while.  The score is beautiful and unnerving, but it only adds to the misleading feeling that something frightening is going to happen, and it hardly ever does.  There are also several moments in the game where Jimmy appears to have a psychic connection with a raven, leading to trippy graphic sequence with no pay-off.  Many critics have noted the series of Irish folk tunes performed by one of the game's characters as a bright spot.  The songs themselves are beautiful and haunting, like the game's score, but the animated performances that accompany them are less varied and more mechanical than a floorshow at Chuck E. Cheese's.  Also, be warned that there isn't a twist ending, just an anticlimactic one.  Maybe someday still The Adventure Company will redeem itself.  In the meantime, avoid this game.	-1
Since other reviews touched on gameplay and it's graphics, I just want to say this...  1. Sure, your surroundings are a pretty picture.. but I like games that are interactive.  I want to go through drawers, look closer at pictures.. do something besides run around busy rooms that you can do nothing but run through.  2. The plot is weak.  I won't spoil the story-line, but each in game day you pretty much go to the same places, talking to the same people.  You have to meet certain requirements to make the game progress, and non of it is interesting.  The one thing I did like about the game, there are a couple real nice songs you can listen to while you play, or just wait in one of the bars and listen.  Unfortunately, I got this as a present for my mom, thinking it would be a puzzle game and be creepy.  Buzz, wrong!	-1
Rather than come out with a new Kate Archer game, the folks at Fox/Sierra/Monolith pushed out this overly short, ultimately senseless game to capitalize on the No One Lives Forever franchise.  The gameplay itself isn't bad and at times rather fun; I really enjoyed a few of the levels, but ultimately, it all fell rather flat. It lacked the enjoyment, humor and fun factor of the other No One Lives Forever games. It didn't help that the main character was a dud.  If you can get this for free and you have extra time on your hands, it's worth a spin; otherwise avoid it.	-1
This game completely fails to measure up to the rest of the NOLF series.  For one thing, this game is way too linear (even the original Castle Wolfenstein gave players more choice).  Throughout every level you are herded in one direction.  There is absolutely no possibility of strategically using alternate approaches.  For example, you'll be following a hallway filled with barrels and other junk.  As soon as you reach a specific point, a certain number of enemies will suddenly rush around the corner knowing exactly where you are, then it is just a matter of engaging in a shoot out.  Like NOLF 2, there is a button for sneaking, but it is absolutely useless.  Since baddies know exactly where you are once you reach the magic point in the hallway/street/etc., any attempt at sneaking doesn't matter.  Since you can't sneak up on baddies or eavesdrop, there are very few conversations to listen in on (all but one take place over announcement systems).  As a result, much of the humour (except for a few in-jokes) which made the previous games so much fun are missing.  The only plusses are that the graphics are stunning and the AI is quite good.  But considering how short and repetitious it all is (basically holding down the firing key as you run down halls, shooting at loads of interchangeable badies), I cannot give it a good rating.  Those more into shoot-em-up games with no stealth or strategy might enjoy it a bit more, but I doubt very much more.	-1
This game at full price new is a waste of money. First, there's a real lack of a good plot line to it. It consists mostly of shooting endless streams of enemies with only a meager plot line to each mission. The graphics are pretty good. The major drawback is that the environment isn't distructable like other FPS games. So you can't shoot crates or other things to discover hidden items. IMO, this is a real drawback. You also can only interact with certain items in the environment that are integral to your mission. The plot line in the game really doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. You never really know *why* Jack is going after the guy he's after except for money and there's no real good explaination why Jack's client wants the guy found. I was absolutely shocked when this game ended after around 10 missions. Not only is that way too short, it ends in a particularly unsatisfying abrupt way. This game did deserve its M rating though, it's perhaps one of the most graphic games I've ever seen in terms of blood as well as some of the language. The dialogue in the game is rather good IMO. Some of it is wry humor that I found amusing, although it really doesn't add anything to the game at all. As other reviewers have said, this game just has an expansion pack feel to it. There's also a limited amount of environments that the entire game takes place which I think is a drawback. There's even one level where all you do is shoot enemies, you can't move around because there's no place to go in the environment. That reminded me of old arcade games, not modern FPS. If you like NOLF, you'll probably want to play this game, but don't expect it to be near as good. As for Sierra's contention that it's a "prequel" to NOLF2, prequels usually have some explaination included in them that clears something up in games that have already been released. This game doesn't do that at all. Overall, I was dissapointed.	-1
I played No One Lives Forever 2. That was a great game. Funny, clever and involved. I finished this game on the 2nd hardest setting in 3 hours!!! Angry and feeling ripped off, I set the game to the hardest setting and tried again - I got through it in 4 hours - ONLY 4 HOURS !!!!!! PATHETIC!!!! Contract Jack is a sad attempt to cash in on that success. The weapons are limited and boring. The enemy AI is easy to figure out and beat, even on the hardest settings. The missions are lack luster. You keep waiting for something clever...it never comes. This is an absolute rip off. I would only recommend this game if it cost $10 or less. Don't think this is going to be fun or like No One Lives Forever 2. If you have not played NOLF2...spend your money on that instead!!!<P	-1
The game has an interesting story, and the setup as a writer who is on the ripper's trail is pretty good. However, the game's technology is outdated, and its implementation overly buggy. Also, the gameplay itself is extremely dull. But I played through it all because the whole "Jack the Ripper" story kinda intrigues me anyway. Now I do not want to spoil the game for you by telling you the ending, but really, there simply isn't much to spoil. It was not worth it at all. This is one of those games with a real story. It makes you wish that there were more games with a story like this. But then you realize how bad this is actually implemented and you kinda lose hope for the whole genre... If I were you, I'd steer clear.	-1
New York, 1901:  the seedy "Lowside" disctrict is rocked by a series of killings that resemble the London "Jack the Ripper" murders twelve yearas before.  You play James Palmer, a young reporter for the New York Today.  Your boss assigns you to cover the crimes and produce a series of articles that will regain sales lost to your paper's competitor.  When your articles start receiving attention, you begin to hear from the killer, himself.  Can you trace the hints he drops and prevent another murder? _Jack the Ripper_ (JTR) is the kind of game that will be familiar to Adventure Purists:  one with many fine points, one that has incredible potential to be remarkable, but one that had obviously no been given the time or attention to rise above the mediocre.  It's perfectly playable--mildly entertaining, even.  But when game developers complain that Adventure doesn't sell, they need look no farther than games like this to find the cause.  JTR is boring.  I personally don't think that games need lots of action, threats, and timed sequences to be exciting-and, except for one, you won't find them here.  But neither do you find very many interesting puzzles, engaging characters, inspiring conversations, great locations, or much of a plot. The game has its good points.  The graphics are nice. The music is actually superb. The navigation and gameplay are smooth and easy. The voice acting isn't bad. The structure is well thought-out.  But there just isn't enough going on.  Each "day" of the game presents you with certain tasks, and I always was surprised when the day came to an end;  I never felt like I had actually done anything.  Part of this was because the puzzles were so very easy.  Ninety percent were conversation;  the rest were a smattering of incredibly simplistic mechanical and inventory, with one timed activity.  I had downloaded the U-Hints file for this game, but the only time I ever looked at it was at the end, when I thought, "Is that IT???"  In general, I found the puzzles so unchallenging that at one point I resorted to translating a book in French that my character found, just for something to do. There are numerous red herrings in this game--threads that turn into nothing, places you can go where nothing happens.  I suppose this is a realistic representation of investigative journalism, but I found it tiresome.  There was also a strange plot element involving a raven and what seemed to be psychic phenomena that was never explained at all. I disliked the save-game feature. This gave you a limited number (16, I think) of spaces to save thumbnails of your game in progress.  16 slots were about half the number I wanted, and the thumbnails were so small you couldn't tell what they represented.  As your game was saved by time and date only, with no opportunity to label them for yourself, this was an irritation. JTR was also pretty glitchy, particularly in the early portion of the game.  Several cutscenes did not run properly and had to be skipped out of.  Conversations overlapped and the navigational cursor sometimes didn't appear.  Once the game crashed entirely--good thing I had just saved! The ending of JTR is a disappointment.  I realise that the real Jack the Ripper was never verufiably identified, so it would have been going out on a limb to identify him here.  But I would have preferred that to what I got.  The way the game ended was like the rest of it:  wimpy and without challenge. This game took me about 15 hours to complete, playing a couple hours a night.  It was mildly entertaining, as I said.  But probably better to wait for the jewel case release.	-1
I'm vacillating between two or three stars on this game so maybe it should be two and a half. The story is pretty obvious - Jack the Ripper or a copycat is in New York in 1901 killing off prostitutes in what the game calls the "Lowside District" of New York. Why in the world the developers decided to call lower Manhattan the Lowside District is beyond me. Or why the Pinkerton detective agency is called the "Pinterten" Detective agency. Or why a deranged raven shows up at the crime scene of a couple of the murders and then disappears until the very end of the game when you hear the words, "Nevermore, nevermore." What's Poe got to do with this game? They even have a story line about the World Series which didn't even exist in 1901. OK, but all that aside what drove me the most crazy about this game was that it was very linear. You have to keep going back over the same locations over and over because something wasn't done in the correct order. In the final chapter I ended up visiting every location three times. The only positive note is that navigation is easy. It you want to leave a location, just right-click and the map comes up so that you can visit another spot - again and again. The graphics are pretty good. There's really isn't an abundance of dialogue but the acting is fine. The music is something I rarely pay attention to - in fact if there is an option to turn it down I usually do because it interferes with the speaking voices and I find it annoying. This game did not have that option and there was only one time that the music was a problem. There really aren't any puzzles - just when to use inventory items in the right place at the right time. They were pretty straight forward. There was one timed sequence in the morgue that I actually thought was kind of a bit of sick humor - I had to use a walkthough for it. I never would have figured it out myself. After all that - the ending. It was terrible. Absolutely awful. All that detective work (reporter work actually)for nothing. I expected some big confrontation between the reporter and the villain or the heroine to be in actual danger and saved by the reporter - nope. Nothing, except a stupid, "Nevermore, nevermore."	-1
Right off the bat this game does almost everything wrong... The combat is dumbed down from the original Butokai, forcing an unnecessary and tedious RPG element. The difficulty is horribly scaled and no preset difficulty option exists. The game strays as far as it can from the story without straying far enough to make the game a unique and enjoyable experience. I get what they where trying to do with changing the game from a linear story to a board game but the execution was just awful. The original budokai had a better story and tournament mode and also more of a character selection with each character having better and time appropriate move-pools (when you fight Frieza the first time you will have access to the spirit bomb). The more modern Butokai Tenkaichi 3 has the series' best combat and this game just is not worth your money when both it's predecessor and successor are vastly superior. In this case talent definitely skipped a generation! (I am so tired of fighting colored Saibamen.)	-1
Ok if your a die hard fan of dbz....then go ahead buy u may like it, like this other fool did, but beaware this game SUCKS there are no good points remember the old one had a story mode which was like living out the cartoon, this one doest have that this one suck all the wayyyyyyy sorry to bust uall's bubble.	-1
Not really a good game to play kind of sucks	-1
Maybe this game was  controversial when released.  I guess that was part of  the attraction.  But the game  play is rather dull.  For a great deal of the game, you walk around with a club.  Clubbing people to death just doesn't do it for my  like the flash of a gun muzzle.  You have to sneak up on people to kill them, or you get mauled.  Stealth is fun to a point, but its tedious after three or four levels.  After two levels of nothing but clubs and  bricks, I was like "enough already! Bring on the guns!"  Just plain boring.	-1
Hide, hide, hide and hide. Kill, kill, kill and kill. Something wrong with my review? Yes, redundancy, awkward, and brainless. Well, that's what this game is all about. This is a typical game made by Rock Star. A good idea came up with terrible execution. Exactly like the way the did GTA III series. Yes, you read it right. I didn't made mistake. The game of the year, GTA III series. Manhunt and GTA share something in common. First of all, they all got horrible graphic. Hard to image that it's the same company who made Max Payne II. Secondly, they are all so-not-detail oriented which I personally believe it's the fundamental attitude to make a good games. This is the attitude that makes Japanese games superior and American games stupider. Probably this is the attitude made Toyota surpassed Ford. Anyway, if you love GTA series, this game is just that style and won't let you down. However, if you're those few who disagree the previews about GTA III or Vice City in all major video magazines in the market, stay away!!	-1
why the violence??? oh yeah its the only way it will sell... this game crossed that line and deserves to be banned. besides it just plain sux and is way over rated ... if this is what the video game industry is going to be about, then I'm gonna retire my controller and this junky hardware called playstation 2!	-1
I was very much looking forward to this game, since I think that the idea is awesome.  Instead, I was let down, disappointed and frustrated at what might have been.  Here is the rundown: GRAPHICS: Mediocre.  Maybe the Xbox and my PC have spoiled me, but the PS2's graphics are really starting to show their age.  The grainy texture, meant to simulate a video feed, conveniently hides low-res textures and graphics. SOUND: Good, though I've heard much better.  Splinter Cell (a game after which Manhunt is patterned in many ways) does it MUCH better. CONTROL: Laborious.  Remember how fights in GTA 3 were somewhat laborious, especially with multiple baddies?  That's Manhunt.  The control is a little better, but still rather stunted and jerky, lacking the precision of Splinter Cell or Metal Gear.  The fights are button mashing affairs, with little difference between the hard and fast strike buttons. GAMEPLAY: Linear, repetitive and forced.  The game won't let you escape an area without killing, so there goes the stealth aspect.  You MUST gore the hunters in order to proceed.  The weapons vary, but be prepared for drudgery at the lower levels: you have your fists, a shard or a plastic bag.  Again, it's like Splinter Cell without the sense of purpose or mission, as you mindlessly dispatch yet another identical clone on your way to the next level, where you... mindlessly dispatch another identical clone.  The atmosphere is pretty good, though again the control and graphics conspire against this game.  If you want to run around and create havoc, get GTA 3; if you want stealth action, get Splinter Cell.  If you want to waste money, get Manhunt.	-1
Max Payne is not a great game. It's all shooting, no fighting or dirving at all. Its story is so werid and freaked out that I can't understand it at all. I expected better from Rockstar.	-1
I hate this game. I cant stand it. If you want a football game get madden! This game is hard and not fun and the graphics aren't so great. so don't get it now.	-1
There is no auto save on this second installment. If you don't save the game yourself you might be upset later on. This game doesn't seem to connect like the first one did. The story is ok, but the graphics and controls are lousy.	-1
So, if you've played the original MP you know how extrordinarily beautiful and dark and twisted it was.  So, as usual you anticipate the follow up.  This installment, is a shoddy, trashy version.  The graphics look like a PS1 title,  the story is boring.  The deep save screens are terrible.  Also, since you spend more time watching and hearing the graphic novel than playing the game it gets frustrating. If you don't save every two seconds and you die, you have to watch all the cutscened (boring as they are) all over again. You can skip them, but the time it takes to load the game after you skip them is just as long as watching them.  There is no violence in this game.. The A.I. is terrible.  The bullet time and dodging is okay, but not as stellar as the first.  I'd skip this one, it's not worth it.  There are rumors of a Max Payne 3 that are promising to deliver because even the company said they were dissapointed in how this game turned out.  SO maybe we'll have that to look forward to.	-1
this versian of max payne is not very good. I played this at a friends house even though I have max payne 2 on my computer, and they took out some lets say "Adult" cheats.... Yes thats right there is something in the pc versian of max payne 2 that the x box and ps2 versian don't have. Mona in full Frontel Nudity.....Yes If you saw a brief scene with mona in the shower that is all you will get in the ps2 and x box versian.....But..In the pc versian there is a cheat were you can play mona with nothing but her gun if you know what I mean. And every thing is detailed in her body including her t**s and other places you don't want your 14 year old to see.. Basicly the pc versian of max payne 2 is the original MATURE RATED versian, but the ps2 and x box don't have that cheat. The graphics on the ps2 don't match up the awsome graphics of the pc versian. Bottom line is if you wanna see great graphics and great game play...not to mention explicit nudity...than get max payne 2 on pc than xbox and ps2.  It's your choice.	-1
The PC version of Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne managed to improve on the first game in some areas and was vastly enjoyable overall, however this Playstation 2 port of the game is severely disappointing.  A noticibly terrible frame rate, blurry textures, missing sound effects, an even worse save system, and ridiculously long loading times plague what could have been a stellar game.  The storyline, plot twists, and even the once mediocre graphic novel-esque cut scenes are the game's few saving graces, along with the run 'n gun bullet time action that was so enjoyable in the first game, but in the end Max Payne 2's flaws outweigh it's strengths.  It's a shame more time wasn't taken to make Max Payne 2 something as memorable as the first game; I really wanted to like this game despite it's flaws, but they're just too much.  All in all, Max Payne 2 is still worth a rental for fans who dug the original, but don't expect anything at all great from it.	-1
If there was never a max payne and this came out. Everyone would have liked it better, but there is one so I hate it. The slow diving and slow bullet dodging are still there but have changed for the worse. Graphics are chucky and the textures are ugly. Sound is OK. Running around seems hard and I think the plot is just about the worst for any game ever made. Very short. still a fun game, but not for the $50.	-1
I bought 2 of these so we could play gamecube games on the Wii.  They worked fine for a little while, and my son liked the small size.  However, one broke in 2 weeks (no functionality with the B button) and the other did the same thing a week later. We tried to take them apart to see if it was just a little mechanical glitch we could fix, but it wasn't.  We went for the regular nintendo controllers this time, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gamecube-Controller-Black/dp/B0000E5U6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gamecube Controller Black</a>.  These were 5x more expensive, but if they last at least 5x as long (that only being 5 months) they will be worth the price. These weren't.	-1
I bought Myst Anniversary Edition for my son, who loves puzzles. Unfortunately, all I get is a black screen with a hand and no option but to kill the window. As it turns out, you have to downgrade Quicktime to an old version to make it work. If you do, you can't run Itunes.  Don't buy the game.  Sorry, there will be other games, this one's a ripoff.	-1
Like most of the other reviews, I also had issues with these games. I surprisingly ran Myst (the first game) totally fine with Vista Home Premium on my Dell Inspiron 1501, and Riven (the second game) kind of worked. It installed and played the game, but froze up constantly. I got to a point where it corrupted a save, and I gave up on it. Online forums contained many pages of issues with many different computer setups and troubleshooting, so clearly these games have issues. I should have read these reviews BEFORE I purchased this set, but oh well, maybe next time.  The short and skinny: BUYER BEWARE, this product may not work.	-1
Before purchasing this product, do a quick web search on Riven to read about all the compatibility problems that people have had with this game.  I followed the recommendations on the Ubisoft web page including: Changing the compatibility mode of the game; Uninstalling Quicktime 7 and installing an earlier version; and downloading the Riven patch (which was released before the game itself), and was never able to get this game to work at all.  Very disappointing.	-1
This game is revolutionary in the history of computer gaming.  From a historical point of view, it is very noteworthy and shouldn't be ignored.  Other than that, it set the standard template for many adventure games that followed.  In other words, point and click games based on a QVR slide show, accompanied with music and sound effects.  The art work is surreal and awe inspiring, but I would much rather view the creations on the pages of a large coffe table art book then to stare at monitor (which is the equivalent of staring at a lightbulb) looking for hidden clues.  I do enjoy 3-D gaming.  There are good 3-D adventure games. But not many.  According to many critics, the all time greatest adventure game ever written is 1995's Grim Fandango.  Grim, on the surface, looks grostesque for those who have never played through the game.  Unfortunately, because the game has never been updated, most never will because it won't play well on XP with or without the compatibility mode and with the SP2 addition...it won't play at all (for that further separates XP from its predecessors).  I fell in love with Manny Calvera, as most do who play the game. I lost myself completely playing  Grim Fandango and I found myself transported to another world.  That did not happen with Myst.  The Myst 10th Anniversay Edition is the only game I didn't finish and I eventually gave it away.  I played Myst all the way through, and I had almost completed Exile when I just couldn't force myself to play the game anymore. The graphics, while stunning were so pristine they began to look sterile and even with all foresty foilage (towards the end of Exile)...nuked.  I didn't care about the characters or of the background storyline. I was looking at pretty pictures and going through the motions of trying to solve some inane puzzzles that reminded me of math word problems in school...I can say that because I was a math major.  Growing up, my dad was a big Rube Goldberg fan and I remember growing up looking at all the Rube Goldberg books of all these wild contraptions and inventions.  That's what many of the puzzles of Myst reminded me of.  To me, Myst isn't anything wildly inventive...it had been done before but in a sort of cartoony way.  The authors of Myst did pour a lot blood, sweat, and tears into this game,  but it has no soul.  Soap opera's can come up with better storylines.  There was nothing to love but pretty pictures and increasingly aggravating puzzles.  I really got angry when I was required to work many of the puzzles out on paper..."What am I playing this on a computer for if I have to work the problems out on paper!?"  I recently finished Morrowind GOTY PC-CD ROM, but of course Morrowind is never finished which is part of its appeal. That is truly a PC Game...and there are even a few puzzles in it. That game cannot be played  any other way but by a computer. It is a PC game at its purist point. Not even the XBOX adaption comes close because of the mods and the modding community surrounding the Morrowind computer edition. Half the time I was playing Myst, I was asking myself..."Why am I playing this on a computer?"  My biggest complaint of the game was its wear and tear on my computer. With a P4 at 3.2Ghz and 1.5GB DDR Ram, this should have loaded lickety split. Nope ... very long frame loads with all my fans going on and my computer obviously working very hard.  I looked through many of the reviews for Myst here at Amazon.  Peppered throughout the majority of favorable reviews of Myst are serious warnings about computer problems and this game. One reviewer stated he even took the game to work and tried it on a variety of computer brands and models and it was hard on all of them and many of the computers produced CTD's during gameplay.  UBI even has a disclaimer on the Myst carton stating that the copy protection might produce driver conflicts with the purchaser's computer and not play.  Not play is only half of it...wear the computer out is more accurate and a further reason I have marked this game low. No one should be encouraged to purchase games or any software that might potentially damage equipment.  marf	-1
The Myst series are such beautiful games and I was so excited that they were released on DVD specifically for XP.  The excitement lasted about 15 minutes into my first playing. . . Despite the fact that it is supposed to be made for XP, I am still experiencing a LOT of trouble running it.  In several different places in Myst, it crashes to desktop--bad thing when those places are pertinent to solving! As of this date, 16 May 2004, there is STILL no patch availble, or any signs that UbiSoft is working on the problem.	-1
why are there so many 5 star ratings for this game?  come on people lets give some honest and unbiased reviews about this game because other people besides ddr fanatics will be reading these reviews.  this game is 3 stars for fun because the first 2 times you play the game its fun to make fun of such a ridiculous game.  do not buy this unless you are one of the above ddr fanatics.  gets boring in less than 30 minutes of playing unless you are drinking, and in that case you have better things to do then play ddr, and there is no replay value whatsoever.  unless you are incredibly gifted the steps and the beats are way too hard to get down anyways.  do not buy this for your own good.	-1
To the fanboys of this game you are all in denial because you people don't know what a great wrestling is game this one is not it because the ai in season mode is very cheap and I had play this game on the easiet setting and still lossed I picked triple hhh kevin nash john cena goldberg the undertaker brock lesnar and still didnot win in season mode the intro is the worst intro of any wrestling game ever the legends in this game donot have any music at all the black and purple undertaker doesn't lod don't hillbilly jim doesn't the million dollar man ted dibiase don't either and to me that is just very stupid and it doesnot make any sense what so ever their are much better wrestling games out there than this overrated piece of garbage wcw nwo revenge wcw vs nwo world tour wrestlemania 2000 wwf no mercy smackdown shut your mouth smackdown 1 and 2 smackdown vs raw 2006 and 2010 wwf royal rumble genesis snes wwf raw genesis snes wrestlemania the arcade game genesis playstation sega saturn are all alot better than smackdown here comes the pain anyday of the week.	-1
Yeah, so I bought this game because I saw Sean O' Haire was in this game, and I always thought of him as an excellent wrestler. I loved him and the other Natural Born Thrillers in WCW and it's a shame WWE didn't do more with his devil's advocate character. Also, Ultimo Dragon was in this game, which I remember seeing online that he was coming to WWE. As far as I knew, those two were never in any other WWE games...And the main reason, I bought this game is...................................  This game is from pretty much the exact time RIGHT before I gave up on watching professional wrestling. I watched from like 96 to 2002...some of 2003 and 2004...and it just wasn't the same at all. I feel sad saying that. Like I'm now discussing a past romantic relationship that ended very horribly with feelings being deeply hurt. But there, I said it! So yeah, I got a burst of nostalgia looking at the roster and thought, for the price a used copy goes for, why not?  Well,let me tell you why not to buy this game.  1) As another reviewer said, I think he was more generous and gave the game 3 stars, this game is SO UNBALANCED. So yeah, I'm Shawn O' Haire and Roddy Pipper is my tag team partner. We have one match, and then win the tag team titles. I am fine playing against the Guerreos. But then the game keeps putting me against Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit...you know those guys who have like 20 points higher than I do on all my stats?!? So yeah, no matter how good I was I couldn't block a LOT of their attacks. Also, their momentum to gain a finisher builds up faster and their finishers do more damage than mine do. So I went to RAW and the game threw me against STEVE AUSTIN, THE ROCK, and GOLDBERG...Same thing happened. Couldn't beat any of these guys, but other opponents, with stats similar to mine, I could have a good match with.  I fought the ROCK in the gym area, and after like 4 to 5 finishers, he wouldn't stay down long enough for me to pin him. Then the Rock gives me 1...REPEAT 1 Rock Bottom and I get pinned. VERY FAIR!!! Did they even test this??? Wrestlemania 2000 had a better career mode! Enuff said.  2)So many animations. There are a lot of times the game will go into a mini movie to show someone pulling off a move. LET ME PLAY THE GAME!!!  3) The referee will never count a pin if someone is in the ring, WRONG PLACE TO BE REALISTIC IN, GAME, but he will ALWAYS Get in the way when you are trying to strike, which then leads to your opponent getting a second to recover and attack you.  4)The TAG MATCHES. The AI opponents outside the ring gain momentum and gain finishers. So you can be schooling your opponent and they make the tag. Then their partner comes in and does a finisher on you and BAM total 360...the match is over and you have lost.  5)The controls feel very loose and are horrible. I can't tell you how many times I meant to climb the turnbuckle, and my character starts running. Then when you start running there is no way to stop running unless you attack your opponent or the air.  6) Damage. When you take extreme damage. Your opponent gets up and holds themselves. Giving your opponent a COMPLETE opportunity to beat you down.  7) Story mode is dumb. MY MAIN GRIPE IS STORY MODE IS GLITCHY. I've seen the same person scheduled the match before mine, and then he's in the next match with me...HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE??? Also, the game showed the Rock talking to me about our match that night, but then Goldberg was in the match.???  You can move, but a lot of times there is no one to talk to in the outside arenas. I thought when I bought this game I could choose which superstars on the roster I wanted to interact with. In reality, you can watch and react to a bunch of spontaneous little cutscenes...that give you Superstar points which then let you challenge for different belts. But if you aren't a main guy, you will probably get beaten a lot and not get very far...like I did.  8) I think graphics look horrible. I think the Day of REckoning graphics, which was released like a year later, actually looked good. This looks like garabage.  9) Create a player is dumb. Seriously, you can't pick entrance music for your star!!! WWF ATTITUDE DID THIS BETTER AND IT WAS RELEASED HOW LONG AGO??? YOU WOULD THINK YOU COULD TURN OUT A BETTER PRODUCT THAN THE OLD DESIGNERS CAME UP WITH, RIGHT???!!?  10) Superstars songs just trail off. Yeah, WWF ATTITUDE, again how old is that???, let you actually listen to the whole song in create a player. Here I listen to my characters music after he wins and it just stops mid way in the song...LAME!  11) Legends don't even come out to their music.??? WHY???  12) OMG SO MUCH BUTTON MASHING. Seriously, my wrists still hurt. There is just so much button mashing. Button mashing was invented by lazy game developers. Instead of putting in real ways to get out of holds. TAP ANY BUTTON AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. So yeah, eventually you get carpral tunnel syndrome. THANKS GUYS!!!  13) Taunting does nothing!!! Remember in the n64 games where at least your attitude meter went up??? NOT HERE!!! NOTHING!!!  Yeah, so I think that's about it. I was just totally let down by this game in nearly every sense, and I seriously feel I got ripped off for the $5 I paid for this used. Everything was just so lame and seemed broken almost. To put it mildy, TNA IMPACT is a better game than this...and way more fun, too. I thought I was going to get a sense of nostalgia from when I used to love wrestling, but this only helped confirm what I already knew, WWE was getting lame and stupid around then. Thanks for help ruin the few good memories from back then with this atrocity of a game, guys!!!  THE PRO's??? I got to be in a relationship with Sable for a bit without being Brock Lesnar. So that was cool. And since I bought this used, Vince and co. didn't get financial gain from my purchase. TAKE THAT PG WRESTLING COMPANY!!!  BOTTOM LINE: NO MERCY 64 (OR ANY N64 WRESTLING GAME MADE BY AKI, LIKE VIRTUAL PRO WRESTLING AND VIRTUAL PRO WRESTLING 2) is still the best wrestling game ever made. If you want a newer wrestling game that isn't ugly and is actual fun to play once you get the controls down, go with DAY OF RECKONING for the GC. The 2nd DAy of RECKONING is pretty good, too. But stay, away from RAW And RAW 2 for the XBOX. Those last 2 were complete garbage, except for the stars that were on the roster in that game. THANKS FOR READING AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER!!!	-1
This is the saddest excuse for a game I have ever seen. I did not want to spend any of my hard earned money watching fat men in tights hug eachother. Sorry but I just don't flow that way. Nevertheless for all the people who do I still do not recommend this game for these key reasons-  1. The game lacks in storyline and shouldn't be set to standard with any other fighting game in the history of the gaming revolution  2. The graphics and playline engine are near non-existent and makes you feel like your playing pong  3. The game is way to pricey for its real value. The fact of the matter is, is that this game costs nothing whatsoever but even if I had the chance to get the game again for free I wouldn't. Thats how much it sucks!	-1
Ignore this game at all costs if you value winning. I cannot win ANY match on this stupid game. And how embrassing is it to be beat by someone named "Hillbilly Jim"??	-1
.How can this be a 5 star game. No way! It's stupid!! I've had it for 2 days and i'm already getting bored of it. The movies are ok, but the game play is boring, and most of the jokes are really corny. Spend your money on a different game, seriously.	-1
I don't really like this game because all you do is fight.	-1
The game is not cool it is not callngin like the odd parnts game bay that.	-1
The game literally didn't work! I wasted my money and time on a game that didn't even work. I tried everything, I know how these things work, its just too worn down to be sold, its not even playable.	-1
This game is not on the level of the other Nick Games we have played. My son and I just finished Sponge Bob: The Battle for Bikini Bottom, which was a very good game. We purchased this game thinking it would be as good as SpongeBob. It is not. The graphics are grainy and many parts have a Play Station One pixellated feel.  Wanda and Cosmo talk way too much. The game is pretty easy with a few semi-difficult parts.  The problem is if you die in a harder part it reloads, you wait for your system to reset and then you have to start back at your last save point.  Then you have to listen to all of Wanda and Cosmo's rambling again (or hit X a hundred times).  You can save the game if you find a save point but they are not placed very well. We spent more time doing easy parts over than than we did playing in a new and challenging area.  Not worth the money with so many other well designed games to choose from at your local game store.	-1
Secret Weapons Over Normandy is a combination of flight simulator and historical recreation of WW2. I had high hopes for this game, but it seems a bit outdated. You start out with some simple target practice - balloons, bombers and barrels. Soon you're moving against a variety of targets in the air, land and sea. There are 30 missions in all, plus the option for multiplayer combat. I've always been a huge fan of flight simulators and space combat simulators. So I was all ready for this fresh release to have great graphics and gameplay. I just wasn't impressed at all in either case. Yes, I suppose if you compare the graphics against the early flight simulators, it's amazing how far we've come. The plane has the details of the flaps and wing segments, the landscape has trees and roads. The radar display sweeps around. But nothing is up to the standards of current day productions. The same is true for the planes themselves, how they fly and how the AI flies against you. Your plane's controls are extremely simplistic. Yes, you stall if you fly straight up, as you would expect to! And yes if you plow head-first into a structure you crash. But there are many other cases where the game plays more like an arcade version set on "very easy" than a modern day WW2 combat game. This might be a good game for someone who has never played flight simulators before and who wants a very simple entry into that area before dealing with something more complex. But any advanced gamer, or a gamer who has played any style of airplane / spacecraft flying game, will want to rent this one first to see how they personally enjoy what it offers.	-1
Rent this game first before you buy. I purchased and played all the way through and was greatly dissapointed. Nothing like the original Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe not even close. If you play Crimson Skies then try this game you will know that this game is subpar by todays standards. I finished the game and sold as quickly as possible. The reason is i knew after playing this game it has terrible graphics and the missions are rediculously easy. This game price will drop when most find out how bad it really is, just wait and get your copy cheap but do yourself a huge favor and rent it first and only buy if you can get it cheaper than renting.	-1
Fatal Frame 2 does nothing to innovate the genre at all. It's an exact wannabe clone of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Explore a maze of rooms with some helpless and awkward to control characters all while solving some puzzles and reading some notes. Been there done that. The problem with Fatal Frame is that it's horror concept just isn't as cool as Resident Evil or Silent Hill, those two games each have their unique style, and little japanese girls taking pictures of spirits, ancient japanese rituals, and boring villages simply aren't as interesting. Sure Fatal Frame 2 is a pretty scary game, but making a scary game isn't hard, making a good game is. Not only is Fatal Frame 2 a clone of better games, it's also a nearly exact clone of the original Fatal Frame, and since Fatal Frame seems to only exist to try to claim the title of scariest game, it might be worth mentioning that this one isn't as scary as the original. Everything is the same, and anything different isn't even worth mentioning because the game is still BORING. To be fair Fatal Frame is much easier game than the original, which I think is good thing and the graphics are technically impressive with lighting and shadows that aren't seen other than in Resident Evil games for Nintendo GameCube.  The controls and everything are just a bit smoother and more polished than the original. Technically a well made game, but the CONCEPT is just not there. Make a horror game about something cool, no one wants a horror that takes place in Japan or old Japan.  People don't watch those old japanese movies where the lips don't match the words do they? Use your head Tecmo. This should be the last Fatal Frame installment, please go home Fatal Frame. BORING!!	-1
I waited with baited breath for this game. Lucasarts and Planet Moon Studios, who gave us the wonderfully original and funny Giants: Citizen Kabuto working together! It should be great right? Well, in essence, no. The best part of the game are the hilarious cut scenes that introduce the characters. These are very well written and laugh out loud funny. The game play is uninspired. Sure, you get to use the infamous land shark gun and the "corkscrew" weapon to literally turn the world upside down, but you get to use these power ups few and far in between. Most of the time you will be using your trusted machine gun to mow down endless waves of mooks. The game is extremely uninspired and gets repetitive within 5 minutes. I would rather buy a DVD with the cut scenes from the game than pay $50 for this game. Sorry, but it just falls well short.	-1
This game is a total flop. It has decent graphics which look very similar to the tv show; it feels like you are in the cartoon. There is a variety of gameplay implemented (though poorly done). Some levels you'll fly like a helicopter, others you swing around like spiderman, by jumping from one building to the next. In other levels you are inside a video game and the enviroment looks like virtual reality. And there is also a level where you are robot in the microscopic world. Sounds like fun huh? But it lacks the good humor from the tv show. It's very frustrating because there is no mini-map or directional arrows, then you end up getting lost in the level! This makes it too hard for the younger gamers and too boring for older gamers. I suggest that you get other kids game like "Crash Bandicoot" or "I-Ninja" Pros: +looks like the tv show +sounds like the tv show +variety in level play +good controls Cons: -stupid weapons -very, very short levels -very, very short game -you will get lost (no mini-map) -not as funny as tv show -too hard for kids -too boring for adults	-1
I've played all of the Dead or Alive games and found that they lack everything but boobs and girls. Sure there are guy ninjas like the awsome Hybusha but that's really the only reason I kept the game. Sure I like girls, but come on, i buy a fighting game to play a fighting game. Oh about the fighting physics they suck. You can about counter every freakin move. I used Hybusha for a few days and I beat a Super rank gamer on DOA online, how pathetic. The graphics are all that seemed to please the eyes except for B-factor. Anyways When it comes down to it, matrial art fighting is way better than this, To me this is  horrible tekken clone that diserves to be put down for good, DOA 4, a clone of this game with more characters, whooo who cares. Anyways if your looking for a awsome fighting game pick up the best, Soul Caliber II or if you like Tekken buy Tekken 5, but please save yourself the money and dignity skip this one...	-1
Although I am not a fan of DOA's, Virtua Fighter's, Tekken's, and other "modern fighting games'" play mechanics, I was actually considering buying this game. I'm glad I rented it instead.  This was supposed to be a remake of both Dead Or Alive 1 and 2 with upgrades. Instead, Dead or Alive Ultimate ends up as just another port. Sure it has extra outfits and stages and online play for those who can afford the excruciating monthly broaband fees, but it fixes none of the information problems in training mode, the characters are hard to control, and the optional English Language Dialogue that was in DoA 2 Hardcore for the PlayStation 2 has been stripped from the X-Box version.  As for the Dead or Alive series in general, if I want confusing combo moves, I'll play one of those stupid dancing games. I hope this isn't the future of fighting games and that "Street Fighter" gameplay will come back again.	-1
It's bad.  Really bad.  I give it two stars only because I've heard stories of it working, but could not get it to function in any way myself.  Otherwise I'd give it none.  I am not the most experienced in networking, but neither an I a novice.  The configuration of this thing is pretty straightforward, and I'm nearly positive I had it set up right, but still no little wireless light on.  I am using a D-link DI-614, with only WEP enabled (no mac filtering, public SSID, etc), and this thing didn't want to hook up.  Even tried disabling WEP, setting SSID to "default", and still no go in this thing's default mode.  Also, I gave up trying to get it working with the Xbox, and was just attempting to get it working with my PC's wired ethernet card at this point. Called tech support, they said it sounded defective.  Returned it, got another, same results, same answer from tech support.  Either their quality control standards are poor, their tech support is poor, or their product is poor. I think it's all three. Get the Xbox wireless adapter, if you're using Xbox.  Granted, it only works with the Xbox, which is somewhat lame.  Keyword, however, is WORKS.	-1
I have seen better games in 1980 era arcade's	-1
this version the controls are akward and hard too use. worst graphics ever seen on xbox, they should have left this alone and on the pc only, nice attempt but falls short of the original.	-1
Counter-Strike was or maybe still is, according to wikipedia, the most popular FPS played over the internet. Either it must be free, or people have never seen Halo.  Made by Valve (makers of Half-Life -- an infinitely better game) using a modified Quake engine. It's basically a multiplayer-based tactical shooter a lot like Rainbow Six, which looks and also is, infinitely better. Many of the weapons and items in CS are also used in Rainbow Six...  This game is ugly, flat, colorless and lifeless. It's also frustrating. A couple hits and you're dead and you then you must sit there and wait until the other players are dead or the game is over...There really isn't much to this game.  If you want good multiplayer for the xbox or 360, get Halo, Halo2, or Unreal Tournament (a multiplayer-based game). These games have many more options, are more fun, and just plain look better.  If you want a good game made by Valve for the xbox or 360, play Half-Life2 until the OrangeBox comes out.  And if you want to play something that feels like CS for the xbox or 360, play Rainbow Six 3 or Rainbow Six Vegas.  And lastly, if you want to play a cornball crappy looking multiplayer game like this, but have a lot more maps and weapons, try Red Faction II. It's not very good either, but at least not as bad as this...	-1
This stuff is great and the most fun I had!!!  I don't own it but a friend let me use it for some weeks and this is just plain fun.  Yes the graphics aren't the good but if you are complaining about that I have a huge list that also could have better graphics starting with the game Quake 4.  This may actually be a import from the PC to the Xbox but never played it on PC so can't say but for those that have an Xbox BUY THIS N0W! Probably take some days to get use to for those noob with FPS.  This game might not appeal to you the first 2 weeks you got this game but this game is those rare games that you play when you are bored and even with games like Halo and Unreal this one is picked up.  Verdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 This game might not be played much but still you will need it for those times that you are bored and need some gaming this one will entertain you for hours.	-1
Hey if you don't have xbox live don't bother getting this game. The AI is just plain stupid and the controls kinda suck i mean the highest look sensitivity is about equal to 4 on halo c'mon thats some slow crap. The only good thing about this game is its different than the usual halo or unreal online. But other than that...yeah if it comes down to $10 buy it i guess cause that's probably how much its worth.	-1
I saw this game and thought it might be fun, as I enjoy games like Ghost Recon; however, I was very disappointed.  There is not much you can do with this game unless you have X Box Live.  The single player missions are pretty boring and you will get tired of them within the first 15 minutes or so.  I don't have X Box Live, so I can not comment on the game play online.  Pros:  None that I could see.  There are better first person  shooters out there.  Cons:  Lack of game play offline.  Graphics were not the best and the IA was not very intelligent.  Overall:  Try Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, or some of the other Tom Clancy 1st Person shooters.	-1
I bought it because they convieniently put the best looking screen shots on the back of the box and the PC one was so much fun. When i opened it i played the off line version first so that i could get used to the controls, and i was pissed off to find that the graphics are a complete joke. It looks like something off the PS1. The bots walk and run like hunched over retards and use combat skills much to the same level, they are useless.  When i tried it on Xbox live it was not much different, with only 2 game scenarios, very few maps, too small maps and complete jackass' booting me from the game because i was using cheap weopan combos.(i had just played so i didn't know what was good, and since when have 2 pistols been better that an M4 assault rifle). They say that the game should only be bought by people who own Xbox live, but even they will be dissapointed. If you want a good, longlasting game that is always fun then get either Rainbow 6 or Halo 2, they both rock online, have good graphics and lots of people are always playing.	-1
this game is not much different than thecomputer version,  it wasa verylarge dissapointment	-1
Does anyone besides me see a problem here? I am a huge DDR fan and have been for years. I was so excited when I heard Karaoke Revolution was coming out. After all, how could it be bad with all that cool Bemani music? Well, I was wrong about a few things there. First of all, NONE of the music is Bemani, which means no more cool DDR music. I had assumed that DDR-inspired songs might be included, or at least some cool JRock/Jpop/Europop! Maybe even the Smile.dk songs that have been constantly excluded from the American DDR games could have been included. That was the second thing wrong with this game. All it is is terrible American popular music, and that disappointed me highly. I personally can't stand Michelle Branch or any of those whiny untalented American pop artists. This game is marketed to the American masses, not the true DDR fan. I'm sure the gameplay itself is a lot of fun if you ignore the songlist. If you love DDR, don't buy this game. If you love popular American radio music, be my guest.	-1
I picked this game up cheap and have been playing it on my dual 1.8 G5. It's a fun game, very similar to Warcraft III but it has major crash issues with dual processor machines. There is nothing worse then playing a strategy game for 2 hours to have it crash on you and lose everything. And the sad part is it crashes more then not. Macsoft support is nil, in-fact there is a patch for this game and all three locations linked on the Macsoft webpage to down load the patch are dead. Even for 15 bucks I would have to pass on this game, not worth the crashing and lost time. I am very disappointed they do not put some effort into porting there games to OSX.	-1
I would've given it 1 star, but there were a few little touches that were nice. That said, if anybody I knew asked me whether they should buy it, I would definitely say no.  It crashed, and crashed, and crashed. When it wasn't crashing, it would hang for minute after minute, loading, loading...on a machine that has far more than the recommended hardware requirements. And when it crashed, it often left the desktop messed up, changing the settings to a lower resolution so that I had to go into Control Panel and reset, then clean up the icons which were now scattered across the screen.  The game play itself had its fun moments, but it was sloooooow. And the voices--man, I wish I could just turn them off. (Maybe I could--I never bothered to find out.) Was it all one guy playing with different accents? The aliens were sometimes quite creepy, but never had any of the charm of the old X-Com.  I give the makers a couple points for trying to keep X-Com alive--it was one of the best games ever and has never had a sequel that came close to measuring up to the original. Unfortunately, this one is even farther from measuring up than most. Thank goodness I was only playing it on a friend's machine--at least I didn't waste any money on this one.	-1
This game, which claims to be the "spiritual sucessor to X-Com", disgraces the entire genre of squad-based strategy games.  Why? The interface is arkward and counterintuitive.  The player has to plot "waypoints" in order for team members to move.  Why?  Do you plot waypoints before you move? The game sacrafices plot for graphics.  X-Com UFO Defense (which arguably had lame graphics by today's standards) was thouroughly engaging plotwise.  You wanted to win the missons even if, for nothing else, to see what would happen next on the tech-tree.  Also, there was a certain uniqueness to each member of your squad that made you kind of "attatched".  Here, you are expected to be so awestruck by the flashy graphics and 3-D acceleration that you can overlook the substance of the storyline and characters.  In fact, the storyline is quite boring compared to the original x-com. Still, for me, one reason stands out among the rest.  The FONT!  What is wrong with computer game programmers nowadays.  Do they think that people want to play computer games with magnifying glasses?  I had to sit one foot away from my screen to go the tutorial.  The game is guaranteed to cause migraines!  I have noticed that this has become a trend with modern PC games, although I really don't know why.  Sure, I know it sounds knit-picky, but the overall effect is that it makes the unenjoyable games even less enjoyable.	-1
This gamepad is great - if it worked.  Just like ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS have described, my Left Analog stick is no longer functioning properly.  It will not respond when moving it to the right.  I have only had the controller for about 2+ weeks, and I am far from a heavy gamepad user.  These controllers should obviously be recalled.  UPDATE:  I have been able to recalibrate the controller by unplugging it from the USB connector on my PC.  I have to do this daily.  NOT GOOD.  UPDATE2:  I bought a new controller (and returned the old one), and so far after about 4 weeks, no more calibration problems.  Maybe they got the problem fixed?  If the calibration problem stays away, I would give this 4+ stars.	-1
Basically, this is a game that wraps multiple types of game play into one package. That is where this game went wrong. Also, some of the "HIGH" ratings were kids or people that reviewed this game based on the DEMO!!! You cannot truly rate a game unless you have played through the whole thing. THAT IS HOW THE GAMING MAGAZINES DO IT!!!  Any designer, manufacturer, builder knows that it is almost impossible to make an effective "ALL-IN-ONE" device because it usually does some things very well and some things fairly well or poorly.  In this game, you play from the 3rd person perspective, more like you hover over your currently active squad. You command your teams of soldiers with mouse clicks and key commands while receiving orders from an off-site commander.  Now this is unique! However, this is what stinks! You feel like your watching the action more than participating. You also have to wrestle with hard to observe terrain, angles, camera views and if you make a mistake, you cannot quickly respond. Ouch! Oh, did I mention that the game has designated save points? Yep! So if you blow it, you must go back to the last save point and start again. This is not horrible, but not pleasant either.  The good parts are that this game really requires you to think, use strategy, be patient, it is unique, there are some excellent tutorials (about 30-40 minutes worth) to help you learn the skills you'll need to get started, and the game brings in outside support like helicopter recon, mortar/artillery support, Armored Bradley vehicles. This game also offers Co-Op play which is a nice addition. I do like the hardcore cursing in this game (M****rF****r is one shining example) because I am an adult and I want adult level, realistic games. Kids don't need to play every game ok? That is what the ESRB ratings system is for. So I say thank you to the developers for doing it! You will not find ammo, health paks, aliens, space stations, rocket cars, jet packs, or secret weapons laying around or on the dead bodies or behind hidden walls. If you run out of ammo, your stuck!  The bad parts are complicated camera angles, buggy response to your commands at times, the game is a bit of a hog on resources, the action is not that exciting, the visuals are not bad but not great, there is a lot of unnecessary HARDCORE cursing(I LOVE it but any parent with a kid under 18 probably will not !!) This game is VERY short too! Just as your skills are starting to get good, the game is over!  Who is this game good for? -  If you like RTS(real time strategy) games but wish you could get more deeply immersed in them...this game will excite you. I doubt this will appeal to 1st person shooter fans that don't like RTS games.  Overall, I appreciate it for it's uniqueness. Yet, I also found it very unsatisfying. Due to the lack of excitement, poor camera angles, slow, clumsy response of your soldiers, mediocre AI for the enemies and buggy action...I cannot recommend this game.  I will make a prediction though - I bet that another company will make a similar game only better or there will be a FSW 2 and the developers will have tweaked it into a lean, mean, shoot'em up game by learning from their mistakes. For the present - I would not bother with this game.	-1
Well, I must say that I am extremely disappointed with FSW in many respects.  For one, the graphics are not exactly anything to rave about. They are ok, but that's about it.  And after all the hype this game received and the advertising it put out, it seems they should have saved some money for the developing.  Basically, the actuall gameplay is at a 4 year old level.  Click here, move there. THAT'S ALL YOU DO. And I can't stand the cheesey jargon used in the voiceovers. Horrible! I am an infantryman in the US Army, and I can tell you, no one I know talks like this or uses the goofy lingo the throw around in this game. Also,there is NO open ended gameplay, you can only move to certain areas on the map. The enemy AI and the weapons physics are ridiculous.  You can have your team fire at an enemy out in the open and he won't move, won't throw a frag, won't call in support etc. If you want a REAL war simulation, buy Operation Flashpoint.  It's dated, but still THE best squad/fps/command game ever made.  After all the patches and upgrades and addons and it's truly open ended gameplay,  OFP will probably be the only game that will permanently stay on my hard drive. FSW, nice try, no cigar.	-1
I've really tried to give FSW a chance, I really did, but this game is terrible and doesn't live up the hype at all. For all the talk about FSW being an accurate simulation of tactical combat FSW falls way short.  The Good  The graphics. That's about it. And even then there are plenty of problems. For starters you hardly have any control over any options. Want to turn off shadows (notorious frame rate killers), not possible. I have a pretty high-end rig and I encounter lousy frame rates, and tons of stuttering with the audio dialog. Only by turning down the visual features can I get acceptable performance, but then the stunning graphics are no more.  The Bad  Unfortunately for Pandemic, this would encompass the rest of the entire game. Enemy AI is lousy at a distance, and entirely scripted. Restart a level, and they'll be in the same places every time, so forget about replay value.  If FSW is an accurate representation of the Army's capabilities, then we are in real trouble. While the soldiers move and take up basic firing position correctly, their reactions are terrible. When directed to take cover, they'll frequently use some of the worst cover around. Their shooting accuracy is terrible, often spending more time shooting everything around a target rather than the target itself.  FSW is clearly built for a console and not a PC. Load times are terrible, save points (Doesn't every developer by now know that this is a terrible way to treat PC users), limited configuration options, and a gamepad-esq interface.  Don't think for a second the manual will prove useful. The instructions are vague, with poor text descriptions to define actions, with no supporting graphics.  While Pandemic attempted to reflect reality in the game through degrading cover, tactical movements, and liberal use of swearing (Great way to represent out soldiers, they swear more than a trucker in a shouting match with a longshoreman), FSW just falls flat on itself as a tactical shooter.  Save your money and move on to something better.	-1
This might seem like it is all you need at first. That's not true. First it has two squares around the thumbsticks in place of circles like you get on the F310 or F710. That makes it so the thumbsticks on it don't work correctly. I bought mine for under $11. I don't use it. I use the F310. It works correctly and I use it with almost all of my PC games. I see people selling this on here for $70. That's a ripoff. Don't be a victim. Buy the F310 or F710. They also happen to be the best PC gamepads available IMO.	-1
This controller stemmed like a good idea, but it's a bit outdated and doesn't work with all of my games. Sometimes it pays to go ahead and spend the few more dollars on an up to date controller!	-1
Do not buy if using a Mac	-1
Logitech products are known to be of prime quality and in a gamepad I was expecting something well made, responsive and accurate. Well, none of this are to be found on this gamepad. I believe and I think is a common notion nowadays that the best PC gamepad you can have as of today is the XBOX 360 PC compatible one. Don't look elsewhere.	-1
My bf (who worked at a Gamestop) bought me one of these pads on his discount. We went to his place and tried it out on his computer. It started out looking like a decent replacement for my Saitek, it had the "Key-Mapping" menu and very customizable. But I spent a good hour trying to make a profile for it to fit my SNES emulator. After getting that done I finally tried it out with a game I knew had diagonal in it: Secret of Mana.  The overly recessed D-pad sucked, big time. When I wanted to go diagonal it wanted to go up, down, left or right. Saitek P880's have some of the same problem, but not as badly. I like Logitech and Saitek's layouts and programmability but jeeeze, you guys gotta learn to make better D-pads. Either go with what's tried and true (snes 'cross') or make a flat touch sensitive pad (Triax's Turbo Touch 360)  And I've heard about those adapters that allow PS2 and Super Nintendo pads to be run on USB. My roomate says that can actually tear up pads because they don't recieve the correct voltage. I shouldn't HAVE TO do something like that. Companies should make better, more durable d-pads. The majority of people buying your pads are emu-geeks looking for a way to play Sega emulators without having to use their keyboards.	-1
Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.  What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!	-1
The D-Pad on this controller is terrible.  It feels mushy, but more importantly it impossible to consistenly hit any single direction.  If you try to go right, you will often press up or down in addition, resulting in diagonal movement.  This can be devastating, depending on the game.  For example, it is impossible to reliably perform even simple fighting game moves such as SubZero's freeze or Ken/Ryu's fireball.  Also, this pad lacks a button to swap the D-Pad with the left analog stick.  The Saitek P880 is much better in this area.  Also, Logitech fixed these issues when they made their Rumblepad 2, but it's a bit more expensive due to the rumble feature.  If you think you ever might want to use the D-Pad, buy one of those other controllers instead of this one.	-1
I want to make this review rather short. First, it's an easy to install Gamepad and looks very promising. You have the easy PS2 feel, dual-analog control pads, and a comfortable fit. You can install the drivers or not. It doesn't really make a difference because Windows will recognize it.  The problem with this Gamepad is that it is not very durable. I bought and tested this controller with MVP Baseball 2005 & Need for Speed Underground 2. What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.  There are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one.  Be aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it. The GamePad is useless. I would suggest you go with Nyko's AirFlo Gamepad instead. I've had no problems with that one.	-1
Pc gamepads suck compared to the concole gamepads. I got this one because it looks like a playstation replica. I paid 20 dollars for this gamepad and it had unsatisfactory results.  I played n64 games on my pc using this gamepad and let me tell you there is no point in having a D-pad because it just doesnt work. I thought maybe there something wrong with the emulator but actually it is the gamepads fault. As for action pc games such as GTA VICE CITY I still had problems with the D-pad. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE YOUR KEYBOARD.	-1
This controller doesn't stay calibrated for longer than a few seconds before going kaput, and the digital controls don't work for anything requiring holding them or rapid action.	-1
The directional pad simply sucks. I've only had it for a day, and despite the overally comfort and setup ease of this controller, the directional pad is another one of those "nearly impossible to just hold up without going diagonal as well" pads. You push up, and 95% of the time you will either be going up+right or up+left, and ditto for all other directions, down, left or right.... its the most frustrating thing in the world, ever try playing a game like Silent Hill on one of these controllers? Its a nightmare (no pun intended)	-1
junk	-1
This product came to me with a broken button.  I have tried to get returned, but with no success yet.	-1

I just got the "Xbox 360" and I didn't know that many "Xbox" games don't play on the "Xbox 360".  Well this is one of them.  Now I know for the future that when buying "Xbox" games to read all the one star reviews to make sure they can play on "Xbox 360" first.  I have most of these games on Playstation 2.  Now I know to hold onto my Playstation 2 for all of these old games.	-1
This game isn't any better than the sims i own both games and the only thing thats differnt from the sims and the sims busten out is the story line and that you watch you drive your vehicle i men how gay is that?I mean i don't know why they called this game sims bustin out i mean i don't even know why they wasted there time makeing this one. I sugest if you want to start with sims wait and get the sims 2.	-1
The Sims Bustin Out is a really really boring game. It is the same thing as every other sims game but you are in different places. All you do is control someones life. Dont buy it. It is a waste of monney.	-1
yyay ! another sims game boring... takes up a TON of memory card and it's the same as the first one	-1
Bad graphics, bad sound, not in anyway fun. To hard. This game is stressful, just like real life and I don't want to sit down and waste my time at this. You can't keep yourself happy and do all the other things in the short amount of time you get. In the games time, it takes him an hour and a half to eat, half hour to go to the bathroom, he needs to sleep for at least nine hours and need to be happy, clean, likes the house, is relaxed, and is social staduis is good. In the later levels you have to on top of that help run a gym and help people and stuff	-1
The Sims: Bustin' Out is a goal-oriented, console-style version of The Sims. The gameplay has been slightly watered-down, and given a more simplistic feel. Really, I think Bustin' Out was aimed at a somewhat younger audience.  The concept of the game is fun, however. You create your own 'sim' and control them in order to accomplish goals, make friends, and earn money. (To furnish your home with.) The game starts you out on your uncle's farm, where you become familiarized with some of the gameplay mechanics. Afterwards, you are sent out to explore SimValley, and meet its various denizens. From there, you will stumble upon various goals and will be required to fulfill them before moving on. After completing every goal in every chapter, you finish the game.  Unfortunately, it seems that the game was either rushed, or under-funded, as the graphics are not as up to par as they should be. In addition to this, there are several glitches which can cause certain goals to become unavailable, or incompletable. (Thus ruining any chance of actually finishing the game.) There seems to be no way around these glitches, either.  After having completed the game myself, I was sorely disappointed with the rewards of having done so. However, I will not spoil it for those who've yet to finish the game themselves. Regardless, I do think the gameplay is fun, in its own right. You won't find much entertainment in actually completing the game itself, though. Otherwise, I would recommend trying The Urbz: Sims in the City instead of Bustin' Out.	-1
I didn't realize this old X Box game wouldn't work on the 360 so I sold to a local video game store.	-1
We'll ignore for the moment that I don't particularly enjoy fighting games.  The graphics and backgrounds were beautiful, and the game managed to keep me entertained for four or five hours before it went back on the shelf to never see the light of day again. First of all, all of the maneuvers and combinations were just too much.  The game would have been made much more playable if there had been a real training area.  What it had was a guy who would stand there and let you hit him as you tried to reproduce the sometimes rediculous button combinations posted on the screen.  It would have been great if there had been a martial arts master to instruct you and fight against you as he taught you the moves. Second is the story, or lack there-of.  Dead or Alive 3 tries to present itself as a story, even having a few exchanges between the characetrs as you move through it, but you'd have to already know the story for it to make any sense. All you do is beat up the opponents, listen to a couple snips of dialog, and fight the end of level villain at the end.  It has about as much story as Gotham Racing. As beating people up was a matter of perfecting two or three maneuvers for each character, the fighting quickly became passe.  The story wasn't.  All in all the beautiful graphics were wasted in a game that had nothing going for it.  DoD Extreme Beach Volleyball has more plot then this game.	-1
What is it with game designers?  You come up with a good concept, which in this case has spawned an impressive game dynasty whose first three games were absolute classics, and then you screw it up. This game, luckily, doesn't try to be a 1st-person shooter; I haven't found a single good 1st-person shooter on the Game Boy Advance and am convinced that the GBA simply doesn't have the response and accuracy of controls necessary for games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, No One Lives Forever...or Medal of Honor.  It retains the excellent Michael Giacchino score which had distinguished this game series from the pack.  And the World War II locations and weapons remain accurate.  So what's the problem?  The level design, for one thing.  It made precious little sense to me why they would have two fairly player-friendly missions of low difficulty, allowing you to feel out the game, and then launch you into a multi-tier mission where you have to kill about 30 enemies back to back without being able to save.  Difficulty is a necessary part of any game, but this is just ridiculous -- so you survived an onslaught of 40 enemies?  How about we take away any ammo replenishments and send four bombers your way that can attack you behind barriers and kill on contact?  This game also has a hyper-annoying map system where you could take one step into an area and the game "seals off" your escape route so that you may find yourself suddenly cornered.  It makes no sense realistically speaking, and it certain does nothing except to frustrate your gameplay. The weapon aiming system is very poor.  Why would they veer your shots to the right?  To be more "realistic" because your soldier is right-handed?  This makes diagonal shots very difficult.  Also, your shots don't go straight -- they spray sideways, maybe in an emulation of gun recoil, but that's like saying to the player:  "You can aim, but not really."  Your enemies don't mind -- they have unlimited ammo, and they come in groups.  Having to charge towards your enemy a step just to shift your aim is already annoying, but this "right-hand bias" is just dumb.  And the minute an enemy shot hits you, you bounce back and lose control of your character...but you remain vulnerable to attack and so can lose your entire life from just one bullet hit.  Ridiculous. Somehow no Electronic Arts game I've played on the GBA has been without fundamental annoyances like these, and it's getting just tiresome.  I *was* going to give this game two stars, but after having played one level 30 times with the same result of being killed by flights of bombers, I simply said "*&^% this".  I'll bet the ... game developers had a wonderful time devising ways to kill off the player with hordes of enemies.  Well, this is the last Electronic Arts game I guy, and this game is going straight to a second-hand store.	-1
They say if it ain't broke, then don't fix it.  I loved the first Spider-Man game.  The graphics were crisp and detailed, the story was deep and involving, and the controls were precise and tight.  Then Grand Theft Auto: Vice City came out, which completely re-wrote the video game genre.  Games like True Crime and The Getaway were released that practically copied the GTA formula:  Free roaming cities, mini-missions, mayhem and violence, etc.  Add Spider-Man 2 to the list with mediocre results. I admit that I was initially excited when I heard that Spider-Man could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below.  Though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented, the latter is dull and repititious.  Like GTA, there is a mini-map of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  Whenever there is trouble, a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of variety in these missions.  You will either have to prevent a robber from getting away, take an injured civilian to the hospital, catch a civilian from falling to his or her death, or save people from a sinking boat.  After a few of these, you'll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story.  Solving these missions contribute to your "Hero Points" which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a Spidey Store.  Since when did Spidey have to buy his own moves and combos?  Strange... Unfortunately, due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game, the graphics are the first to suffer.  In most instances, the game resembled a Playstation 1 game.  Spidey generally looks good, but the other characters in the game look like spray-painted cardboard boxes.  I would have preferred a much scaled-down city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly, Spider-Man 2 is an ugly game. Fans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel.  Though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat, the gameplay and graphics truly suffer.  This one is definately a rental.	-1
The only thing that relates this rotten game to "The Secret of Mana" is the name.  Everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game.  The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous. The ring menu system from "The Secret of Mana" was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  "Sword of Mana" has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker. Another minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains. I doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown & Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.  They pulled the same dirty trick with "Breath of Fire" which was an okay game developed by Capcom, but it was not as good as a Square game. If they couldn't be bothered to do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all.	-1
I love the Mana series. I mean, the original Secret of Mana for the SNES is one of my favorite all-time games. It was an action RPG, good story and plot. So, when a sequel was slated for the GameBoy, I had to get it.  Well, I had to get it a couple of years after it was released. Shh. Details.  Anywho, I must say, I have never had so much aggravation and pain from playing a game. The AI is horrible, repeat, HORRIBLE! The story is convoluted, and the gameplay just downright frustrating. I almost regret the $20 I spent on the cartridge.  Gameplay  I am going to get the worst part of this out of the way. The gameplay flat-out stinks. You start the game by choosing either to play as the Hero or the Heroine. The basic difference in these two is one is better at physical attacks, and the heroine is better with Mana (magic). Depending upon who you choose, the game will play differently. I chose the heroine.  You start out (as the heroine) in a village, talking to your mother as you prepare to leave on a quest with some strange swordsman as a bodyguard. The village is attacked by soldiers that work for the Dark Lord. You escape, your village is slaughtered. You are taken to a manor by the mysterious soldier, where you meet the Hero. The manor is attacked, you escape again, and the Hero promises to protect you. He falls down, you run away, he is captured and beaten by soldiers.  Fast forward, you wake up in bed after a nightmare recalling all this. The soldier is by your side, and you learn that you have been living with him in hiding since your escape. The story takes off from there. The Dark Lord now controls the land, he is evil, you must avenge your people, yadda, yadda.  Oh yea, there is a mysterious sword called, get this, the Sword of Mana. And a goddess that turned herself into a tree to protect the people of the world. You worship this Mana goddess, because you are of the Mana tribe. It seems that you are the last of them.  You now know as much as I do, and I have played the game. The plot is that horrible. You meet townspeople that tell you pointless stories or offer side quests that make no sense. While the story itself is a bit linear (run to next obstacle, defeat boss, possibly get an item for someone, etc.), you will often find yourself wandering a map trying to figure out where to go.  Since save spots are few and far between, and healing in this game is a pain (either through the start menu, or using the appropriate Mana spirit, controlled through the right shoulder button on the GBA), you will find "Your strength is depleted" (i.e.; you die) happens at the worst possible time, with little warning. You then have to reset to your last save. Early in the game, this is horrible. The first cave you must travel, as the Heroine, has an enemy layout that killed me 5 times before I developed a strategy to get past the monsters.  Bosses vary in the game from easy to insanely difficult. One boss in particular was on a spinning platform, and you could only hit him when he landed. However, given your level, your weapons only do like 1-2 points of damage per hit, and he has over 400 hit points. It took me 45 minutes to kill this guy. Needless to say, he hits a LOT harder than 1-2 points of damage. AND he inflicts status effects like blindness, so you may not even hit him at all.  The next boss died within 2 minutes. Literally. I just ran and whacked.  AI has to be the worst I have ever seen. During the course of the game, you will be partnered with various people. The battles in the game are real-time, and as long as your character is in a battle "mode", you can switch between who you are actively controlling by using the "Select" button. However, if your main character dies, you will have to start over from your last save. If you are controlling the main character and your partner dies, you can resurrect them. It is a bit unfair.  The AI, though, even after I figured it out, stinks. There is a grid, with zones. You can either set your character to be aggressive or timid, use more magic or physical attacks. You position their icon within the grid to choose which attack style you would prefer. You have to manually do this for each new partner, otherwise, they will just stand there while you get yourself killed.  Then, even if you do get the AI set to where they will attack, they will attack using a method that may do no damage. If they are better with Mana, they will drain their mana casting at a monster, even if it is doing 0 damage, then move in to attack with melee. Also, they get "stuck" on a map, and can't or won't follow you up a jump, across an area, etc. Once you kill all the monsters on a map, they will "teleport" to you, but that does little to help you if the monsters are ganking you.  In terms of attacking and the like, it is standard RPG fare. As aformentioned, battles are realtime. You have to select the appropriate weapon/spirit to attack each type of monster. One monster may take a lot of damage from the Bow, however, another may take zero from the Bow but lots from a specific type of magic. It is up to you to cycle through each and attack appropriately.  Towns are small, with standards like Inns, save points, general stores, and blacksmiths. Weapons can only be upgraded if you have special vegetables or fruits. Which you can grow with seeds that you collect in your "Hot House". Weapons can be reinforced with different materials that you find. So in short, you need to find materials to reinforce your weapon and vegetables to assign attributes.  Lastly, levelling and the like is a bit confusing. You can choose a level in a class, and depending upon which you choose, you will gain in different attributes. You can choose to level any class at any time. However, your main class is fixed. So while you may decide to take a few points in say "Warrior", if you have the bulk of your points in "Sage", your main class will be like that of a Cleric. None of this is satisfactorily explained by the game.  Controls  The game controls, to their credit, are good. They respond well, and I have never had a situation where I was pressing the "A" button and felt the system didn't register the attack.  Controls, for the Heroine, are as follows:  Left Shoulder Button: Jump Left Shoulder Button + A: Meditate Right Shoulder Button tap: Stat/heal boost Right Shoulder Button hold: Attack w/ spirit assigned A Button: Attack/ Select a menu option B Button: Hold down to run/ Exit a menu Select: Switch active character in battle Start: Menu  For fighting, you simply have to mash the A button or use magic. There really isn't much strategy in that regard. Menus are complex, though, and there is no way to quickly assign a hotkey. So, for instance, if you want to change which kind of magic, you have to scroll through menus, find the new spirit, set it, back out of the menus, then use the right shoulder button. It is just as complicated to change weapon types.  Movement is like a standard GameBoy title. Not much to say there.  Graphics and Sound Graphics are reminiscent of another GameBoy title, Golden Sun. The graphics are sprites, and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful. Particle effects are not really pretty. Your character is nice to look at, and menu pictures are clear, if not really detailed.  Sound is standard GameBoy fare. 8-bit sounding and nothing overly special. I play with the sound off. There are different sounds for different game areas, but for the most part, you will be disgusted.  There is no voiceacting. All conversations are based on text, and some story choices are text-based.  Final Say  This title is cutesy, but the story doesn't make much sense. The gameplay is frustratingly unbalanced, the menus are too time consuming, and when it is all said and done, it seems like Square tried to throw so many silly side quests that serve no purpose into the title that the game borders on ridiculous. In the end, while it is a way to kill time, I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone, even the diehard fans. Save your money, and buy one of the many better GameBoy RPG titles out there, even something as text-heavy as Golden Sun. At least that one makes more sense.	-1
Well, it's not Secret of Mana.  It's not even Children of Mana.  It's a totally different beast of a game.  I tried on two separate occasions to get into this game, but one single thing turned me off:  time actually passes during the day.  Remember The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask?  Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time?  Yeah, I HATE that.  And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.  So in reality, I can't give you a true game review.  I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done.  If you can handle that, however, this may be the game for you.  Not recommended for anyone.  Epic fail.	-1
I bo't this b'cuz I'm quite fond of SQUARE 4 the Final Fantasy series. I was sorely disappointed. While it started out great it dragged itself along. The two stories (Here/Heroine) were different, with the Heroine story being the most compelling. The game's about a world that was destroyed the wrongful use of Mana power by an evil tyrant Vandole who was subdued by a powerful Sword created by the Goddess. So now it seems the Vandole has been reincarnated intends to do it all again. The sad thing thing is that there are too many characters that have nothing to do with the overall story (The Mavoles for example) - not to mention just too many characters - period. What was the purpose of the trip to the Ice Castle - just to kill the monster and unfreeze it's people. You're sent helping people just to satisfy the "journey" aspect of the game but it contrast this game offers no real adventure or journey, and the endgame was equally as disappointing. I got confused of who the real enemy actually was and in the end I was even more confused because the game offers no resolution.  The story itself was really uninspired as I had this game for a whole year without playing it, only to just "get it over with";  you will spend a GREAT DEAL OF TIME looking for Spirits, but if think the game or any character will TELL you how to find ALL 64 Spirits NO! GameFaqs will be your best friend for this game. A complete waste of time and money.	-1
Final Fantasy Adventure for the original game boy is one of the best games of all time.  Sword of Mana took the original game boy game and sucked all the life out of it.  What they got wrong: pacing, length, too much story, and unnecessary deviations from the original.  The original had many connections to the Final Fantasy series.  The original title for the game even called it a Final Fantasy game.  It was as good as the best Final Fantasy games.  This version would be a playable, slightly enjoyable waste of a few hours, but only if you've never played the original.  For those who have played the original this game will just make you wish you were playing the original again.  Bottom line: this is the saddest remake I've ever played in terms of its' destruction of the game its' based upon.	-1
Ther'es one specifc reason I don't like this game. Once you get to the final dungeon (the game is kind of like the legend of zelda) it locks you out and you can never go back!! If there's ever a game without any replay value, no matter how good, I would never get it...That's why I'm always cautious when buying my games, unless, of course, it's a puzzle game, etc. not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game. The last thing I have to say about this game is I got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door (read my review) but instead it doesent save at all once you're done beating the game! You're still in that damn final DUNGEON!!! Sadly, I might give this game a good rating IF it had replay value...Get this game if you don't care about replay value... ):	-1
The previous versions of this game we're A LOT more exciting! This one almost put me to sleep! The music isn't anything great, and where's the action? Not in here. Sorry, but they could have made a far better game than this! Congratulations I say to the gaming developers-You finally made a sequel to a game that sucks!	-1
okay so the frirst game got sent without an activation code., but thats not the bad part. If you have a computer thats less than 7 years old , it probably won't work. The game has issues with duel proccessing chips. It will install but it just won't play. i tried playing it in win 98, millenium, xp and every mode available. None of them worked. I sure hope they come out with a version that works on new computers. EA you need to get your crap together and find a way to make it work..like a patch. and another thing, people want stand alone games , not steam activated. you can get a copy through steam, but I don't know if it will work or not. Some of us prefer old fashion activation codes that worked on our own hard copy of the game, without the need to be online.	-1

Do you want to save your game sometimes? If so, you will have to finish an entire level. I thought I would never get that far. (Yes, I have spent a great deal of time playing games that are this difficult, but better designed). After you get the the 2nd level, what if you want to start a new game? The only way I could do it was to go to the Windows Task Manager and kill the process. After that, I had to restart the game and watch the video intro again. I know they are proud of the graphics (yes, I liked the movie), but....	-1
We bought this game for our son, who has an affinity for these types of hack-and-slash games, only to discover that the game won't run.  This is a brand new computer, with more than plenty of hard drive space & RAM to spare, with a 64mb graphics card.  Unfortunately, there are only TWO graphics cards that this game will recognize.  You can have the most powerful card in the world, and if it isn't NVIDIA or ATI Radeon, you are out of luck. Do we want to blow $100-$150 installing a new graphics card, all for the sake of one lousy game, especially one that has gotten the mixed reviews that this game has?  I really don't think so.  We have never had any problems with any other programs we have installed on this system.  The idea that I need to drag a brand new computer back in for an upgrade just strikes me as ridiculous.  This game's designers need to be more flexible when configuring the system requirements. Our son never got to play this game, but I know that he would have been driven crazy by the lack of a quick-save feature.  Once again, the game's designers display a profound lack of flexibility.  They must live in some fantasy world where people have all day to kill, slogging through an entire level before being able to save the game.  Get real folks. We have a couple of other EA games, and I have generally been lukewarm about what are obviously console games that have been reconfigured for a PC in a sometimes slap-dash manner.  This most recent, very disappointing experience leaves me extremely reluctant to purchase any EA products in the future.	-1
I won't get into a battle with words here. Let me kep it simple. PC GAMER magazine gave this game a rating of 58% out of 100%. That is bad!!! Let me quote some lines from their review in the January 2004 issue. " Frustrating camera controls, not enough diversity in character play styles, disappointing failure, stupidly difficult" Need anyone say anything more? Don't listen to the reviews that gave this high marks. They are LOTR extremists - the same guys that go to Star Trek conventions all dressed up like Kirk or Picard!!! First of all, most of the guys that gave this game 5 stars wrote reviews before the game was even released!!!! Second, most of them admit they have not even played the game!!! They just love LOTR. Ok..so do I, but don't go suckering some people into blowing their hard earned dollars... Are the graphics good in this game...YES. They are truly outstanding and unbelievable!! That is all the nice things I have to say about this game. The game play is terrible. You have to fight in 360 degrees which means that the enemies are between you and your guy. You cannot even see what your doing!!! Oh by the way, you cannot quick save. You can only save at the end of the level! Generally this is fine by me, but since this game is so hard and camera angles constantly make your life miserable....you absolutely need to be able to Quick Save!!!! THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING OF ALL - THE CUT-SCENES!!!!!! ELECTRONIC ARTS force you to watch all the cut-scenes. NO SKIPPING THEM!!!! And some of them are over 5 minutes long! Here is how the game starts - You have to go through all the production credits from EA Games, among others...get through the horrible THX ear blowing intro and about 3 other stupid intros...then the first cut scene happens - this one alone is about 5 minutes of scenes from the last movie. Then you get dumped into the game in the ehat of battle. Talk about confusing as all heck! Guess what...if you screw up the game or just want to start over...you have to sit through the credits and all of the games cut scenes all over again!!!!!! NO CHOICE!!!!!!!! Thanks a lot EA GAMES!!! You milked the MOH franchise to death and ruined what could have been great and now you are just out to milk money from the LOTR saga. I played this game through all the way. I normally would want to play a game all over again. Not this time!!!!!!! Borrow a copy from a friend or at the very least, download them demo and try it out before you buy!!!!!!!!!! Hey if you don't believe me...read the comments in some of the LOTR game forums out there! MANY, MANY other people that own this game will agree with me 100%!!! Send EAGAMES  a message, send them some e-mail and tell them to allow skipping past cut scenes, send them a message and skip this game. Trust me, your money is better spent else where... Get Halo, GTA:Vice City, Medal of Honor, or BloodRayne which is a blast and sells for less.	-1
Not my favorite game. Nice to be able to download from Amazon without having to wait for something in the mail tho!	-1
No matter what I do I cannot get this to run on my computer.  I am running an AMD 8 core, so I think the problem may lie with that, but I am not at all sure.  I have tried video cards from both Sapphire and Radeon with no luck.  After a while I just gave up.	-1
Not as good as he thought it was going to be	-1

Unless you are running windows xp, don't bother.  The graphics are so horrible.  You aren't left with many options to change the game settings. I don't know why they are selling such an obsolete game. And I also bought the newer version for $40. It's junk also.	-1
Even though I've given this game a two-star rating, the truth is it is quite fun, but the two-stars stems from a major design flaw in the game itself, and that pertains to the Health Care aspect of the game.  Maxis was founded in Orinda, California, an East Bay subburb of Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco.  Orinda, like most bay area cities has a small public health facility run by the metropolitan government, but most people living in Orinda do not frequent this facility.  Will Wright himself, founder and designer of the original Sim-City, probably never visited the public health facility in Orinda when he founded the company.  And if you were to look up the Yellow Pages for Orinda from the late 1980s up to today, you'll note a number of private practitioners in private hospitals or with offices nearby private run health care facilities.  In fact the entire San Francisco Bay Area is populated with private University hospitals, Kaiser Permanente, Mills in San Mateo, Seton Medical Center, and dozens and dozens and dozens of other private health care providers.  So, with that in mind, Sim City, in ALL OF ITS INCARNATIONS, does not have a free-enterprise health care system built into the game, and therefore your success with this so-called simulation, is literally contingent on how many Tax Dollars you funnel to the government run health care facilities you build and fund in the game.  This is true from the first Sim City way back in the 90s, to the current 2014 release, and this slightly older version titled Sim City 4.  For you people outisde the United States, that doesn't bother you too much because odds are your government does provide all your health care, save for select countries (Japan, the UK has private hospitals for the very wealthy and so forth).  But , in the United States, it is free-enterprise that gets the best medications and equipment for patients, and gives the best care anywhere in the entire globe (yes, that includes places like Sweden, Switzerland and Japan; our medical technology cannot be matched....life-styles on the other hand, is another issue altogether).  I doubt Will Wright so much as stepped into either a Santa Clara or San Mateo County health center for so much as a cold, and more likely stepped into a Kaiser or market competitor for some ailment.  So why, oh why, are there not more private health care providers represented in this game?  The paranoid and cynical might say that there was an agenda at work by one or more of the designers with political leanings to sublimate a public health care agenda to Gen-Xers and now the Youtube gen, EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANIES THEY WORK FOR USE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  Ergo, Sim-City 4, like its predecessors, is an interesting take on a version of a utopic society where finances, food, cars, and other goods and services, EXCEPT health care, are represented, even though the bio-technology and medical-technology knowhow in the United States of America, all propelled by private corporate and private free enterprise money research, is no where to be seen.  Look, I'm a poor guy.  I'm still using my old 4gig P4 computer to play this game, and when you got a guy like me raising his eyebrows about the subversive nature of this game, when I should be shouting prasies at it, you know something's amiss.  All in all it's an interesting take on an old and aged (and politically skewed) city-building genre, and it does entertain, but wouldn't it be cool if there was a REAL sim-city game somewhere in the offing?  Maybe in the next iteration we can have various game companies competing with one another, and see which simulation game company sells more; the utopic government-health-care provide for all your needs version, or some true game designers who puts in a buyer-be-ware mod, and markets the new game as his own.  Gee, where have I heard that idea before?  Buy it, give it a shot.  Have fun, but understand what it is you're buying.  So, Will, next time I go grab some medication at the pharmacy, will I see you at San Mateo County General or Orinda's Public Health Works, or will I bump into you at Kaiser?  Think about it.	-1
I found the art work, the inability to get in close, and the intensity of graphics (which eventually crashed my XP Home Edition computer) not anywhere near as appealing as SimCity 3000. I would never bother to buy a good video card just for this game. Editing 12.18.2015 for further information: Same problems with crashing on Windows 7 computer. Not user friendly in my opinion.	-1
I remember playing this game when it first came out.  I loved it.  for some reason, I cant seem to get this version going. Its just not as easy as I remember.  don't like this version at all.  Very disappointing.	-1
Would not p[lay on win10,,pc	-1
The game itself is great and I bought it for complete nostalgia. I don't own an Xbox (original) anymore, so I got it for the PC. It looks though to me a terrible port from the console version. The graphics can be up'ed a bit more and it does look nice compared to the consoles, but the car itself controls like crap. It just doesn't feel responsive and it seems to want to turn right on its own sometimes and sometimes when you turn it just wants to keep turning even though you let off the controls. This just makes the game unplayable, especially for a racing game where accuracy of your turns are everything. This is a problem with both the Xbox 360 controller I'm using and the keyboard. Just to make sure it wasn't just my equipment I found this game on a Gamecube emulator and tried it there, it worked perfectly. So my advice would be to just play this on an emulator and skip this PC version, or if you don' t feel that emulator are moral then get it for one of the original consoles.	-1
I've had this game for a week or so now and so far it's been decently fun, but few racing games are able to steer away from leading players into an utter hopeless feeling of frustration sometimes. Some days I put 8-10 hours of game play into it because in all truth, I'm competitive and I like racing games. Fun aside, the game is somewhat frustrating. First I would like to admit a few of my own personal flaws.  1. I like racing games, but I'm not too keen to adjustment details (not seen in this game, this game is very simple). Adjustment details that can be found in much more advance, higher caliber, detail concentrated games like Forza. 2. Because of number 1, I concentrate more on more simpler games. Thankfully there's NFS. My favorite NFS thus far is Most Wanted and the original older Hot Pursuit (PC). I like them because even though they're frustrating sometimes, the game is more easy going and you win more often. I know that's not the greatest reason, but I feel like the mixture of the two is more balanced in a positive way with those games. 3. I'm also not a fantastic or very constantly good player. One game I'm GOD, the next I can't go 100 ft without hitting something. 4. I have a bad temper, especially with frustrating games. My frustration is reasonable sometimes, even though I blame my lack of skills a bit more, but sometimes it just can't be helped.  So I'll go to the point of way I think this game is lacking and frustrating: (Note that I play in career mode aka underground.  1. I play this game and of course the graphics is not that great, it is a fairly old (2003~). Gaming has advanced significantly during that time. Anyhow, my point here is that the details are not adequate enough sometimes to let you see what's coming at you. When you race, you not only have to watch out for your rivals, but also what's in front of you and sometimes cars that not only go in your direction, but in the opposite direction as well. I can't really say that anyone is good enough to react fast enough to all occasions. Two examples would be going down hill where you momentarily go in slow motion through a third person often-side point of view and turning corners, whether sharp or not. I would race and the next thing I notice is a small bit of light and in a millisecond, crash. So during that moment, the details that I see, my head is trying to confirm whether it is a car or something else, maybe part of the scenary? The details are just not clear enough to tell you that to help you react fast enough, it's just very hard. The details in games that have you traveling at this speed with obstacles that are traveling at their speed towards you, should be spot on, clear, and crisp. This goes the same with a very similar other game called BURNOUT.  2. Car position and spawning. We're talking about random cars used as obstacles. Sometimes they would stop while crossing the street for no reason, right in front of you. Sometimes, they would spawn near or in front of you. Sometimes they just appear down a steep hill which makes it almost impossible to maneuverer around because you don't even see them until you're practically over them.  3. If you play this game, you'll probably notice that when you're near your rival racers, they tend to get into accidents a lot more. Sometimes, they would run into obvious objects to the point where it's just too obvious to be left unnoticed, where you start to understand that they're getting into accidents...not on accident, but on purpose. Like their main objective was to pretend to give you the feeling of a real race, where everyone can have accidents. However, off and away from your view, you'll start to notice that they almost always catch up and rarely get into accidents. If they get into accidents nearly as much as they do when you see them, how do they ever catch up? An obvious accident is running straight into another car even though the other car is still relatively far away.  4. I don't understand the upgrade part of the game. They give you upgrades only for you to keep up with the other cars? It's like you never get an increased advantage over the other cars due to your newly/recently acquired upgrades. The other cars will always be as good if not better. The only reason you ever catch up is because of your reckless speed. I know the game is made to do this to give you a challenge, but it also demeans the thought of upgrading. Also take note that the other cars will match your upgrade, so if you don't upgrade, they don't either.  5. New cars. I choose my car based on stats and until the 78/79th race where the Skyline is available/unlocked, all other cars have lower stats so what's the use in giving me new cars when my old car that I originally had the choice of choosing (Mazda), remains the best car in comparison? I keep unlocking new cars to drive, yet I don't see why I should even use them?  6. Money. I play mostly on hard mode and, until recently started going into medium because it started becoming a game of frustration than recreation. Anyhow, money in this game feels worthless. I have something like 40k++ and I don't see myself ever using it all. I'm almost completely upgraded accept the last three...since when you buy an upgrade(s) for one car, all the other cars that are available will also have those upgrades available to them, I don't understand where the money is going into? I bought all the level paints, almost all the upgrades, full 5 star, and I have tons of money left. Hard mode gives you more money, but I don't see the use of it. I read in some guides that playing it almost completely in medium mode should give you enough money for everything. That's nice, but I don't really want EVERYTHING. I'm a completionist in training, but only when it counts. I'm not a hoarder of stuff that I don't even want. So if I'm not buying a ton of worthless stuff that I don't care for or don't even like, what's the money for? I could very well play the whole game in the lowest difficulty and still probably have enough money.  7. There's really only a small handful of cars to use and in underground mode, there's a very, very small variety of maps to use. Mostly, they just make you go in reverse or open up an extra road here or there. You'll be racing in the same area over and over, that's a good and/or bad thing, depends on how you look at it.  8. Why is this game even called Underground anyway? I don't see anything "underground" from it that is different from the others in the NFS franchise.  OVERALL:  This game is a little too much based on luck, especially with so little detail that you literally have to squint to make out the details of what's in front of you. Cars jumping out of nowhere, not getting into random accidents during a lap of racing...one lap is something, trying to cheat your luck on all 6 lap for example...that's just a little too much. The longest I've played a single race is an hour. I wanted to punch my monitor, but it's an LCD monitor and I don't have the money or time to replace it so...  This game is so much based on luck, be prepared to click the restart button a few dozen times, especially on hard mode and even on medium mode.  Is the game fun though? Yeah. My advice is:  1. Keep racing till the end, sometimes for some weird reason, you might seem like you're losing for most of the race, but you might be able to win. Luck and reckless speeding is your bonus over the AI. However, if you're like 10-15:00 behind and you know you crash a lot, it's better to restart.  2. Just turn the difficulty down if it becomes frustrating. It's a game, it's suppose to be fun and being frustrated, I'd rather just go to work or something...However, I do notice that sometimes the change in difficulty doesn't always make the race significantly easier for you....	-1
If you like to fool around with boring games this is for you. The game sucks. It has horrible graphics and it is too hard to drive the slow goofy looking cars. It is a horrible game and it is not worth a penny.	-1
Horrible game. Not anything like the originals. Ea has horrible service. Thank You Amazon for the refund! I hope ea goes out of.business for ruining another great franchise.	-1
It wasn't what I expected. I thought I could be the SIM and not just look down on the city. Shouldve known since so cheap...smh	-1
This game is terrible. I love the old Sim City games, especially 3000. They obviously put a lot of effort into the graphics on this one and they are very good, but the game is a train wreck. They should have stuck to the old engine, but beefed up the amount of things you can do. They should have just added more and more detail, more buildings, more control over city functions, control over climate (global location) when building terrains, more detail in running a city, and then some better graphics. Being able to build cities in arctic surroundings or deserts would be neat. But no, they have to make it so convoluted that just getting started makes you want to scream. Some of the things they added are OK ideas, but it's such a bad game that none of that matters. I found building starting terrains to be an extremely long process in this one. I could have definitely done without the driving around saving the day and using helicopters to fight crime. That whole aspect really seems to belong in some other game. I know that some people may like it, but I think they should have focused on what has made the series what it is. It's only my opinion, but this game gives me a headache just thinking about it and compared to it's predecessors it's a joke. It's like they tried to jazz it up way too much. Isn't part of the reason these games have sold in the past been because people like to just build away? It doesn't need to be slowly morphed into grand theft auto in order to improve it. Definitely the worst of the series that I've ever played. The old Dos version beats this one hands down.	-1
My game came without the product code required for activation. Apparently this is a well-known problem. I suggest you avoid this game until the problem is fixed, or pruchase it at a retail location where you can open the box to confirm that an activation code is present.	-1
I have a P4 2.6GHZ W/HT and 1GB of Dual Channel high end Corsair RAM and a Radeon 9600 Pro, and the SATA Raptor 74 GIG HDD. Even with this system, the game cripples my computer and it is one of the extremely few times that I experience the "blue screen of death" that I haven't had to deal with since Windows 98. There are even times when Ctr. Alt. Del doesn't work and all I'm left with is the reset button on my computer. If you think that EA games is going to give you support your wrong. On the few occasions that it works, it is an outstanding game. I am aware of systems that don't have trouble with this game that are not as high end as my machine, but beware of the hardware combos, there is no telling which ones will work and which ones won't.	-1
Some would consider NFSU a classic, I do not share that same affection. The graphics are nice and glistening with lots of color, but the game is dark and the scenery blends together in a way that you barely make out where turns or walls are. Like an earlier reviewer mentioned before, you need to take your eyes off the road numerous times to glance at the map to judge where the next turn is. I found myself slamming against walls various times because I couldn't judge correctly where the next turn was. It's a frustrating experience to be in the lead nearly the entire race only to wipeout the last lap on a corner you couldn't see coming.  On the upside, there are many customizations that can be made to one of the many vehicles. From your paintjob, to decals, tires, nos/nitro, tinted windows and the like. I don't really find that as interesting though considering the game is essentially unplayable. I seriously can only make out things if I sit about two feet from my TV. I can't vouch for the PS2 version, but the XBOX version is a game I don't find the need to play again.	-1
Never worked once	-1
After all the hype about how great the game was, the reality was such a disappointment. The graphics were fine, but the colors were very drab and not crisp enough to convey anything unique. The hardest thing was that I actually found myself bored halfway through the game....you have to waste your time going back and forth to places with no reason to be there just to get information to get further in the game. The characters were boring, there were tons of unuseable items that were a distraction. And after all the time you waste, the ending is the biggest let down. They should have just wrote on the final screen "thanks for your money sucker". Just like with movies that have really bad endings, I have even less appreciation and respect for games like this that stink due to the fact that you have to work harder to get to the end. Unless you have the time to waste on this sleeper, I would save your money.	-1
This game has a protection called starforce. Starforce can cause your computer to mess up and also. By the lawsuit that is hanging in cort right now damage to your computer system and cd/dvd drive.	-1
For one thing, the anti-piracy block used on this game made it impossible for me to install it on my computer with Vista, even with loads of tech support, etc.  I ended up playing it on a friend's (older) computer and half the graphics were blurred.  Aside from the technical difficulties, I must admit at times I enjoyed this game for the most part.  The problems, though, are too numerous to overlook, and I won't be playing it again.  It's too slow and plodding as others have pointed out, and I got tired of hearing the same tired phrases over and over "Robert, may I speak to you a moment?  I have something I wish to talk to you about?" Substitute the name of any character for "Robert" each time you wanted to inquire of someone.  It got monotonous, and there were times I stopped playing it altogether for a week or two.  I wasn't as disappointed with the ending as some people were.  Perhaps, though, I was just glad to get it over with finally.	-1
This game is boring enough to fall asleep and never turn it back on. I found it very monotonous.	-1
I really wanted to like Black Mirror...the gothic atmosphere was great and the story had the potential to be world-class scary.  Unfortunately, the "click on everything a few times and come back to it later" setup was so annoying that I finally resorted to playing with a walkthrough so I could just enjoy some parts of the game without the frustration of counterintuitive actions--most of the puzzles weren't terribly difficult, but the walkthrough saved me from pixel hunting and multiple fruitless conversations.  And yes, the ending is as bad as everyone else said it was.	-1
I did not follow everyone else advice and went ahead and bought it.  Don't do it!  It's boring, slow, and not very exciting.  It takes a long time to even get playing and is very difficult to figure the game out.  Also the camera angels although they do allow you to rotate now are still not very helpful.	-1
This is not a fun game to play. I am very puzzled with it's tutorial. It doesn't help you much to understand the game as the tutorial is just some screenshots with some text on it. You have to memorize them all, then when you are on the game, you have to practice what the tutorial has told you before. Sigh...  On the gameplay, I found difficulties in building my first airport. As the tutorial given was not clear at all, I built my airport based on my trial-and-error method. This was really time consuming and wasting my money. I built some things wrongly and I had to demolish them and built the new one.  After I created my first airport, I didn't know what to do. I kept waiting and waiting until 20 minutes later an airline contract came in. The notification for the airline contract was not so clear. It was only representated by a tiny red dot on your control panel. Hh...  I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my 2nd contract. Oh! This game was so boring and not entertaining at all! I uninstalled this game from my PC. I would suggest you to avoid this worthless game!	-1
I bought this game for my 11 year old son because he loves roller coaster tycoon, ski resort tycoon, and zoo tycoon.  This tycoon game had nice graphics and music (when we found a computer that had an adequately equipped video card) but that was about it for positive qualities.  The manual is horrible, the online tutorial is useless, and gameplay is not intuitive when it comes to figuring out what the player should be doing as far as building and the business end of running an airport.  The money runs out way too fast and the contracts come in way too slow - not a lot of action or fun.  One of my biggest pet peeves about this program is that there are spelling and grammar errors throughout the program.  It is almost like the person who wrote it doesn't speak English as his/her first language.  Not a good example for kids unless you want to teach them how NOT to check their work...This is one tycoon game I would suggest avoiding.	-1
boring, old game	-1
I got a chance to finish this game one time all the way through, but this was before my system had problems with this game, like freezing up in certain seens on the game.  I still can't figure out what the problem is of why the game freezes up on my PC, I have a Dell 8200 running a P4 at 2.60Ghz and 1gig of RDRAM PC800, Radeon 9800 All in wonder card.  I'm still trying to figure out how to work around this, I have the latest drivers on all my hardware.  This is a great game, and there's a 90% chance it will work on your PC. Me, I've mostly been a Metal of Honor fan, never had no problems running that game.  This one is fun if you can get it to run in max graphics without freezing up.	-1
This game is just race and get new cars. One of the most boring games ever. Flashy cars, great graphics, but no interesting features what so ever. I have Project Gotham 1 and 2. I got bored of them after 2 days. Take my advice, theres better games out there! Later.	-1
It is an EXACT copy of Medal of Honor Allied Assault and the expansion packs that followed. Don't waste your money. They didn't even try to make it orginial. It is just the same old, scripted mission action repackaged. I enjoyed the game. I liked it...but I did not think it was worth my money. There are some new things that are nice...but that list is so short, it is still not worth $40 or $50!!! DON"T BELIEVE THE HYPE>>>>>>>> Download the demo or borrow a copy from a friend and TEST DRIVE it first people. If you like it...then buy it but don't rush out because of the overhyped 5 star votes in here!!!	-1
worst game ever, it ignore me every time I try to run thre game, it just appear the loading screen and then it dissipear, i try it again but it won't work. u like WWII games go buy medal of honor allied assault, it has better graphics, fun, way better then this stragity game. but if u like stragity game go buy starcraft best stragity game i ever play.	-1
Description DID say there was a small cosmetic tear in the cable, which there was a tear, yet much worse than described. The wire is badly exposed AND stripped and the controller only works here and there.. If im playing a game i have to keep the controller still, because if i move it, the xbox will say reconnect controller. 1 Star..	-1
I must say I HATE the controller S.  It is way too small and the button layout is confusing.  It feels cheap and fragile as well.  I played on one in a video store and I could barely play the game.  I will never buy one of these controllers, I will keep my original controllers.  If I ever need replacement XBOX controllers I will just go to Ebay and get the first ones that came out with the XBOX.	-1
Did not work games come on but then makes a loud noise at the start menu and won't do anything else after that.  I cant even press start.	-1

"Hey kids, fire up the XBOX and lets watch this movie!"  That is what is heard through households that own an XBOX but for some reason or another they are still in the 90's and don't already have a DVD player.  Like my title suggests, if you already have a DVD player, this is a waste of money. The only reason I purchased one is because my DVD player had problems playing some DVD-R's that I got from a friend. I had some money to burn so I just wanted to see if the XBOX DVD kit could play it to determine if the DVD was a bad burn or was it just my DVD player. I found that the XBOX was able to play the DVD-R's in question with no problem. However, aside from those two DVD-R's, all of the DVD's I own are bought from retail stores, so I really have no need to play DVD-R's, and my DVD player plays normal discs perfectly.  With that being said, I only used XBOX's DVD playback kit once to watch the DVD-R's I had problems with. Because of the content of these burned "movies", there is really no need to watch them again....... However if push comes to shove I can always use one of my PC's or Mac to watch the burned DVD; no need to use my XBOX for that. I meant to return the DVD kit the next day, but never got around to it.  The XBOX's DVD player is a good feature, but the fact that Microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the money.....unless of course you don't have a DVD player at all.	-1
My only experience with this product was after I opened it, and started to play a DVD in my Xbox, when I tried to pause it, it didn't work, and it had brand new batteries. I found (after much frustration) that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes. I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit, but it was sold out so I just got my money back. You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs.	-1

I wish I could have a better review on this item,two week after I got it,I started hearing grinding sounds from this PlayStation 2 not only the annoying grinding sounds..this PS2 WILL NOT play my DVD movies	-1
I bought this game a couple of weeks ago, and it is very difficult.  It is more than what I expected.  I can get through the first level, but after that, I can't get much further.  I have tried everything to get past the second level, but it is quite frustrating.  I hope that Nintendo releases a players guide for this game soon because that would really help out alot.  I got through the first Banjo-Kazooie on N64 with help from a players guide, but you need one for this game.  Unless Nintendo releases a players guide, I will not be able to figure this game out.	-1
Banjo Kazooie is like a joyride through nostalgia for me. Unfortunately, even nostalgia can't save this title.  Banjo Kazooie has never taken itself very seriously. That is what makes it so lovable. However, this game doesn't even try to catch your interest, or perhaps it tries too hard. Taking place between Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie, Gruntilda apparently sends her ghost to possess a robot and harasses Banjo and Kazooie. She kidnaps Kazooie and Banjo has to rescue his feathered buddy himself. Perhaps this is a pull at the heartstrings, separating Banjo and Kazooie, but without Kazooie's constant sarcasm, the story feels too dry. Story: 2/5  Graphics are not too bad for Game Boy Advance. Graphics: 4/5  Sounds and music are fairly consistent with previous titles. Sound: 4/5  Gameplay is where this game truly suffers. Unlike Tooie, previous abilities are absent. The lack of Kazooie makes much of the game feel slow. Worlds are very small and uninteresting. And then it's over before you know it. This game is incredibly short. Gameplay: 1/5  Replayability is very low. I have my doubts even the biggest Banjo Kazooie fan will play this one twice. Replay value: 1/5  Last, the title is kid friendly, as are all Banjo Kazooie titles.  Overall, this game does not do justice for the Banjo Kazooie name. If you're longing for another Banjo Kazooie game, do not look here, as this will just leave you wanting something more substantial. First timers should definitely avoid this one, as they will miss what makes Banjo Kazooie great.	-1
One of the things I love about the Banjo-Kazooie games is their personality. Even though Grunty's Revenge is a graphical breakthrough for the Game Boy Advance, it has none of that personality. It feels more like a re-hash of Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie, without hardly any inspiring elements about it.  The plot is supposed to take place between the two Nintendo 64 instalments. Gruntilda the witch has escaped from under her rocky tomb by means of a spirit machine Klungo has invented (even if he was never a genius), and now she kidnaps Kazooie and goes back in time to change the past. By doing this she hopes to make sure Kazooie and Banjo never meet, and thus never beat Grunty. Banjo travels to the past to save Kazooie and prevent Gruntilda from carrying out her evil plan.  This plot sounds promising enough. The trouble is that the game itself is a very confusing and, worse, uninspiring experience to play. This game has none of the character of the N64 games. There are no worlds like Treasure Trove Cove, Click Clock Wood or Jolly Roger's Lagoon. Instead we have a rather dull beach level, a town with some sludge and oil, and a farm (!) to name 3 of the 6 you play through. This should give you an idea as to what to expect. Interesting characters are practically non-existent as well, though we do at least get to meet a young Captain Blubber (even if I had to consult the Rare fandom to confirm this, because his appearance is very brief). Everything feels uninspiring and cold.  The gameplay is just as bad. A forefather of Bottles called Bozzeye is on hand to teach Banjo moves in exchange for notes. However, before Banjo consults him, he can't do a thing... except move around. That's right. It's no fun at all to have to find a mole to be able to climb a ladder. The layout of the game is very confusing as well. It has a semi-isometric viewpoint that makes it almost impossible to judge jumps and distances like you must frequently do. The Jiggies are either way too easy (more than one world has an easy 'slide' Jiggy) or ridiculously hard. One Jiggy in Spiller's Harbor is VERY frustrating to get because of the limited viewpoint and the ridiculously short timer you get. A couple of enemies kill you way too fast, and they re-spawn almost the second you turn your back. Honeycombs are also rare and in-between, and you never really feel that you're getting anywhere. Trust me, it isn't any more fun that it sounds.  This game may be called Banjo-Kazooie but it has none of the character and spirit to deserve that name. I consider Grunty's Revenge more of an experiment in what the Game Boy Advance is capable of than a good game, because sadly it's not. Dust off your Nintendo 64 if you want to know what makes a good Banjo game.	-1
I never got this consloe so i don't how it works and i go get another one somewhere else soon	-1

Thanks for knocking the ever so creative Sega Dreamcast out of the water, Sony. You could have at least given us something good and not a clunky black box with DVD playback. You could have at least offered an online service like Xbox. You could have at least produced an outstanding library like on Gamecube. But no. You just have to scare Dreamcast away, crush Gamecube, and fight with Xbox. I have no idea how you do that with such an ugly mess that groans and never works. I hate you Sony.	-1
The PS2 is designed to have disc read error after warranty expiration. It will just break down for no obvious reason. There is a class action lawsuit against Sony because so many people have complained about this problem.	-1
I have a Gamecube and Xbox and a PS2 and by far the PS2 is the worst.  The systems have their own speacal things.  The Xbox has great shooters, the Gamecube has great kids games (Mario Games) but the ps2 has nothing!  They barely have any original games!!  The gamecube and Xbox have many original games.  Also the PS2 games are not that great.  The memory cards also cost a lot more than the Gamecube memory cards are a lot cheaper.	-1
you like games take my word for it all of sony is junk.  buy a x box or gamecube	-1
Went and bought this for Xmas. Worked fine, then the next week, "Disc Read Error"? WTH?!!. Even though I read about this from other owners, I decided to take a chance. Never again. People poke fun at the older sytems, but my Playstation 1 has never, ever failed me, and I almost traded it in for this crap. My other older systems, such as the SNES, Genesis and N64 have performed well without any problems. I took this back and will stick with the ol' skool systems. But then again, I guess I'm not a "real" gamer until I own an XBOX or PS2, right? As for the reviewer who told the guy to get a brain because he said playstation 1 was better, why don't YOU get a life. People have their own preferences in what they like.	-1

Bottom line is game cube and xbox are better. 1 xbox may not come with a dvd player but I have a tip for all you xbox lovers. Go to the internet type in xbox mod chip. you can either get the mod chip and put it in yourself, or get it already put in! The mod chip: -gives you an automatic dvd player (using xbox controller)allows you to play copied games (copy games with whats called a DVD re-writable c-d )(there just a bunch of special blank c-ds you use) -Gives you a whole new menu. -is a complete step closer to being a cpu -Your start up screen will be blue not green so don't be alarmed -DO not drop xbox with mod chip in. will knock out of slot slightly and screw up -no worries, we have 5 ppl in our family  (3 kids). me my sis and my little monster bro (JK) and our xbox is still in one piece -Plug in xbox and look through side. if you see a green light, it means all systems are ago. if its red its either busted (which never happens ^^ ) or its not quite on -should come with instructions -you can find it cheap on ebay  Well I hope my tip gives you some insight or saves you a couple 100 hundered bucks heheheh.

Back in '95 when Playstation was released, it was the coolest thing to date. Lighting fast gameplay, sharp graphics, it couldn't get any better. Then, here comes PS2. Even better gameplay, graphics, and features. I've had my PS2 since 2001. It worked fine unti mid-2002. Then I started to get the usual disc-read error, and now, even a brand new game takes ages to get to work. As far as I know, Playstation 2 is a waste of money. At first I thought it was just my unit, but everyone I know has some kind of PS2 trouble. I'm not blowing it out proportion either, EVERYBODY PS2 that I've heard of had malfunctioned at least two years after it's shelf birthdate and purchase. It's not just PS2 either, pretty much anything Sony sucks these days. I doubt I'll be purchasing a PS3 since every PS1 and PS2 I have heard of has malfunctioned way too soon. Disc read errors happening in five years, maybe, but two, even one year for most! NO way. Besides these big negatives, PS2 is beautiful and has some great games and an awesome emotion system. If only the units were good quality, then it'd be a 5/5 system.	-1
Hey guys if you are even considering the PS2, don't do it. Don't even think about it. The PS2 sucks so bad it's not even funny. It would be great if it were portable, but it's supposed to be a home console! Here I'll give you a list of things that a home console should have but the PS2 doesn't - =It should have really fun games. =Good multiplayer capabilities. =Great graphics. =Cheap acessories. The ps2 does none of these. And here's something else - DVD incompatibility. I looked it up and it seems there are about 150 popular dvds that the ps2 for some reason won't play at all!!! 150!! And here's the killer - 30 that won't work on XBox. Only thirty!! And that problem with the stupid thing overheating. One person claimed that he was even able to play for a whole hour without out it heating up! OOh a whole hour. Well guess what I played Halo on Xbox with my friends for an all nighter (12 hours straight without turning it off) and when we did decide to call it quits, I felt the xbox and it wasn't even warm. BEAT THAT YOU STUPID POS2!!!	-1
THis system is a piece of junk. It freezes a lot. ALso, the memory on mine corrupted after only 1 YEAR! Thats nothing. You have to also buy a memory card unlike xbox. Oh yeah, and i forgot. LOADING......... LOADING LOADING LOADING LOADING STILL LOADING... You get my point. I played soul calibur on ps2 and on xbox. Their both the same, by the way, Heihachi sucks!, and ps2 took three times longer to load. Arrrrrrrgggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
PS2 has got to be the worst game system out of gamecube and X-box. X-box is NUMBER 1 if you want a game system get a X-box. here are some reasons. 1. an X-box has a gigantic hardrive PS2 you need to buy a expensive memory card 2. the graphics are so much better on the X-box. 3. X-box DVD is so much better than PS2 4. you need to wait so long for PS2 games to load its so much faster with X-box 5. when ever X-box comes out with a great game PS2 tries to make it for its consol. I could go on forever with this list...... so get an X-box becuase its worth the money!	-1
The screen is half the size of my Game Boy Advance SP. It's a smaller screen than a cheap Palm device. Yet the unit itself needs about twice as much pocket space as a GBA-SP, so forget about slipping it in a shirt pocket; it's bigger than any phone on the market. The large size, odd shape and brightly colored buttons pretty much guarantee that you'll look a complete tool if you try to use it as a phone. As if that wasn't bad enough, the interface is complicated and confusing; don't expect to be able to pick it up and use it without reading the manual. For the price of an N-Gage you could get a refurb iPod, a t68i and a GBA-SP. Sure, three devices, but three devices that together take up about the same amount of space, while being much more suited to their respective tasks than this jack-of-all-trades.	-1
The Nokia N-Gage is a product that should not have been released. First of all, it tries to be everything to everyone but fails in the end. The games are mediocre (forgotten Playstation 1 ports) and the phone capabilities are subpar at best. I would also mention that the screen is oddly shaped for gaming and you have to literally take apart the entire back of the system (battery and all) to change games and THEN wait 2-3 minutes for it to boot up. In a nutshell, save your $300 and get a GameBoy Advance. It is tailored more towards gaming with a much greater library and everything from the system design to screen size is what a portable gamer needs.	-1
In addition the the previous writer's comments about the game system, I would like to add that the system also has to be held at an extraordinarily strange angle while using the actual phone. The "gamepad" design makes the buttons counter-intuitive to use as a phone and impractical to use as a gaming system. The screen is far too narrow for games to be displayed with any degree of useful information about surroundings, and given the numerous addon costs involving in making the system any more than a deficient gaming device, you could see from miles off that this piece of plastic-fantastic casual-glance garbage isn't worth your money. I'll keep my 3210 and my Game Boy Advance, thankyou very much, Nokia. If you're going to treat phone users with this amount of contempt in all future products, when the time comes to trade up I might buy an Ericsson or Motorola.	-1
Oh brother. After eagerly awaiting to see what the N-Gage will be like, I get my hands on one and find it to be a tremendous disappointment. Let me put it to you this way: everything negative you've read about in all those videogame magazines is true. This is a device that should be marketed to the cell phone crowd, not the videogamers. Essentially, it comes across as a Nokia phone wrapped around a fancy new package, right down to the obvious "cell phone" screen. It does several things, but unfortunately does none of them well. The games look great in presentation, but they are presented on a vertical (!!!) phone-style screen which is simply too small and produces too many headaches from eyestrain. The cartridge position is ridiculous, I hated having to perform surgery on the silly thing just to play a game. A strange idea, especially when you read Nokia's official explanation as to why the cartridge is "buried" inside the device which makes no sense. The menus and built-in management were both a mess. Talking on it is an issue all by itself: not only is it terrible to hear in public areas, but its downright embarrassing holding this electronic taco up to your ear! And who wants to splurge on a handset when the option to use it as a normal phone could have been made so much better? Few games are available for it, but that's common. That's not my beef. The problem is that the system itself is simply filled with too many design flaws. If Nokia (obviously a phone company) REALLY wants to create a GAME machine and then market it as a GAME machine, they should have gotten together with an outfit like Nintendo to help them design it for gamers in mind. It's pretty obvious that they had no idea what they were doing. I seriously believe this thing was rushed out the door for Christmas, but the fact the Nokia refused to listen to early consumer complaints about it at showings doesn't support that theory. Let me put it to you this way: I have a beautiful cell phone I adore (a Panasonic GU87), a minidisc player and a GBA. I'd rather have those three than this any day since I get far better performance and usage out of them as opposed to this thing. I took mind back and got a refund. The N-Gage is, unfortunately, a victim of its own design. Part phone, part videogame, part MP3 player, part radio, etc., it really doesn't fit or perform well in any of those categories.	-1
The N-gage does, everything that the GBA-SP cant. The thing is, is that the GBA-SP does everything the N-gage doesn't as well. The N-gage can play mp3's, and can act as a cell phone. It uses something called Bluetooth technologhy that does, well, something. it plays old games that we've all seen before, with playstation like graphics. You can even play with people you don't know, as long as they have an N-gage you can play multiplayer games and connect to that person without a wire or anything. But what can it not do, play games decently. First of all this system has terrible graphics. I base this on the many many slow downs that continually happen. In fact the game system is always slowing and the frame rate always seems to be just too much for the little N-Gage. At the moment there is no must have game. This is because, well there is no reason there just aren't any good games for the system, no N-Gage exclusive nothing like that. That leaves us with this. The N-Gage us a new video gaming system that is more costly then the XBOX and PS2, is portable, has bad playstation graphics, with no games and no depth. And to top it all off it can be used as a mediocore phone. A phone that looks really wierd and can be embarassing if your seen with it. Overall don't buy this. I urge you not to buy it. Pick up a Nokia 6600 (still plays n-gage games if you really want them) or some type of verizon phone and try a GBASP. Thats alot better for ya.	-1
The system is flawed. This review is for the actual game system, get this. Do not buy the system for one huge problem, changing games. It is pretty complicated. You have to like remove the batteries, then insert something for sometime, then remove, then pretend to do something, then you scale a mountain, finally after a few key holds and such, you will win the nobel peace prize, and discover the start screen for your game. Honestly, Nokia there is something called the Game boy advance out. There is a really cool looking, and pretty small game boy sp, which everyone is happy with. Then there are 30 dollar phones that are twice as good as the n-gage. So lets bottom line it. Phone-30 bucks. Gameboy SP-70 bucks(Depending on where you get it, trade in your original gba and sometimes you can get rebates and such, i found a deal to get a new game boy advance sp for 50 bucks basically) That is like 100 bucks mabye, compared to the n-gage which is 300 dollars. I feel sorry for nokia though, they don't realize that noone is really intrested in their product. An awkward, expensive, and overall low-grade device is not worth so much money. If this phone was worth 30 bucks? Yea, tons of people would probably have it. It isn't though. Sorry Nokia, better luck next time.	-1
When I first heard about Sim City 2000 on the GBA, I thought dang that should be pretty sweet.  Then I realized that in actuality, the game would probably be pretty lousy due to the small screen and limits of the GBA. Still I decided to pick up a copy anyways but it wasn't worth the $20.  As some have said, yes the game can be fun for a short period of time but then you'll most likely never get the urge to play it again. Doing some simple tasks in the game proves to be a bigger chore than in other versions and the cities you create feel empty and lifeless. However, if you've got lots of time on your hands and don't mind some of the neater additions of the pc versions missing along with some slowdown when disasters occur, then you will probably enjoy this game.	-1
I have the original version of Black and White, it was a compelling game with great graphics at the time it was made. When I got my new PC loaded with XP. It would not work.  The box (which I saved for some reason) did not indicate XP as a compatible OS. I was upset but kept it anyway, just in case.  Then the Deluxe was offered and I read the box carefully; XP compatible it said. I was excited to get home only to be disappointed once again. They say they are going to fix it but I think not as B&W2 is due out this year. Save your money. Then wait, don't buy B&W 2 until you read the beta reviews to ensure you won't be disappointed again by Lion Head Studios (EA is not to blame, they just finance the operation the programming is done at Lion Head Studios. DONT BE SNOOKERED OUT OF $15	-1

As evidenced by my reviews of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Alien-Syndrome/dp/B000MGR686/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Alien Syndrome</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Phantasy-Star-Portable/dp/B001IB1YOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Phantasy Star Portable</a>, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to this kind of game.  It has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it, especially if I have someone to play it with.  My girlfriend decided she'd dive into some game or another with me on the PS2, so we'd be playing together on one screen, sitting together on the couch, nice fire going in the fireplace, and so on.  I happily dug out this dungeon crawler that I'd gotten some time ago, but never played.  If you want only to know if Champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game, then you can stop right here, because this will take awhile.  The answer is "yes," it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should.  You have a few different classes, you have a few different locales, you can kill things and take their stuff, and you can keep on doing that for hours, as the game offers three successive difficulty levels, each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges.  It supports up to four players locally with multitap, and has a client/server network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer running.  A few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes; healer, tank, ranged DPS (damage-per-second), and magic DPS, as well as a hybrid melee/magic class.  However, though they hit all the right notes in concept, execution is sloppy, to be polite.  The tank class, while quite hardy, has no real tools for managing aggro (who the enemy non-player characters are attacking), which means that the healer isn't really free to heal, since they're defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank.  The magic DPS class doesn't really do much damage, considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focus.  There's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay, but it's frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings, sit down to play, and discover that there's really nothing like what was described in the manual, insofar as gameplay, anywhere in the actual game.  It's not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawler.  Champions makes use of a pre-patch&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Diablo-2/dp/B00002CF9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Diablo 2</a>-style skill tree for each of five classes.  When I say pre-patch, I refer to the fact that when Diablo 2 first released, one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higher-level, and presumably better, skills later in the tree.  Towards the end of the game's life, later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree, such that "maxing" those skills, or raising them as high as the game allowed, wasn't necessarily a waste of points, since it improved the function of a descendant.  No such luck in Champions, as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them, but skills that often seem as though they're only in a certain part of the tree because there wasn't any better place to put them.  With a little digging online, you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level (some classes share a skill, but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each).  However, the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard, as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does, and the next level, if it exists.  There is also a surprising lack of skill-boosting gear in the game, at least so far as we've played it.  Combined with the all-sales-are-final approach to skill point management, the game progressively feels more and more punishing, as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly.  Not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of 20, such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns, but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in, only to discover you wish you hadn't, well.  Too bad.  In action, skills are assigned by means of an eight-way radial menu, managed with the D-pad, in concert with either the Triangle or Circle buttons.  This menu can be arranged from the character sheet, and used while playing, without pausing, to assign skills to either button.  When the action ebbs, it's a passable enough system, which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny, tiny buttons.  But when the blood and gore are a-flyin', its clumsiness is exacerbated.  Say you're a Cleric, for example, which often lives or dies by its numerous self-buffs, skills that improve stats in various categories for their duration.  For each of them, you must press and hold the D-pad in the direction of the skill you wish to assign, press the button to which you wish to assign it, then release the button, then release the D-pad, then press the button to actually cast it.  Then you get to repeat this process for each buff, all of which start with impossibly short durations, before finally re-re-assigning the button to a more regularly used active skill, like Holy Strike, a ranged spell attack.  Annoying enough when you're not even in combat, but potentially lethal to your character when you are.  (According to its manual,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Champions-Return-to-Arms/dp/B0007CGBDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Champions Return to Arms</a>, the sequel, solves this problem by allowing the player to press the Square button in combination with the D-pad to simply trigger a skill at that location, in addition to the assignment model from this game; a vast improvement, but that's another review.)  Like any other dungeon crawler, Champions is very loot-oriented, with the rapid cycle of kill something, take its stuff, equip it, and repeat generally making up the entirety of the game.  A storyline of sorts is sprinkled about here and there, but it's really just an excuse to change the backdrop and offer more things to kill, because those things have stuff you can take.  Whenever you're full, you use a gate scroll or one of the portal stones scattered about the landscape to return to the town for that act, sell what you don't want, keep what you do, resupply on health or mana potions, arrows, throwing spears, etc., and then return to the fray.  Unfortunately, the encumbrance system which limits how much you can carry (with the exception of quest items, which are uniformly weightless, regardless of how absurd that often is) is unbalanced and half-baked.  The answer is to raise your Strength stat, which directly increases the amount of weight you can carry, and/or to put points into a passive skill that every class shares, which increases the amount you can carry as well.  Naturally, this is a pretty useless skill for the Barbarian, which has a combat-based reason to raise Strength, as Strength impacts melee damage output.  On the other hand, this means it's also not really a problem for the Barbarian.  Unfortunately, our poor friend the Wizard has to decide where he wants to be wasteful; with a skill that has no impact on his already pathetic damage, or with a stat that's equally without value in all other regards.  Champions does make use of a slotting system, also very reminiscent of Diablo 2, wherein various items that have no purpose on their own can be irrevocably attached to an equippable item, provided it has enough slots to accept them.  These items can raise base stats like Strength or Intelligence, add elemental damage, provide resistance to such damage, etc.  Each comes in five tiers of effectiveness, but there is no mechanism by which lesser types can be cashed in for greater.  There is also curiously no level bar, or any other bar, to using them, although you cannot stack the same type multiple times in the same item.  That is, if you slot a rune into your sword that raises Strength by 45, you cannot put another one into that sword.  You can, however, put one into every single other piece of equipment you have (provided it does not already have a Strength bonus), effectively raising your Strength by over 300 right at level 1.  (For scale, your starting strength is anywhere between about 25 and 50.)  There is also no storage area, so if you find something that is for a Cleric but you're a Barbarian, and you think, "I'd like to make a Cleric and use that item," you will need to survive the obstacle course that is Champions' save and load system.  While your current game is indicated with an asterisk in the save and load menu, the rest of the data is almost uniformly worthless.  It tells you to which difficulty the game is set, it tells you the date and time it was saved, and it tells you the area in which it was saved.  No character names or levels, nothing to tell you who's actually in there.  That wouldn't be so bad if the entire save and load system didn't take so long or occasionally crash the system.  If you are careful, though, you can work around the lack of a vault by spawning endless copies of mules, characters who serve no purpose other than to store loot.  And since you can load any character into any game at almost any time, regardless of difficulty, you can also make as many copies of that loot as you want.  While this makes for some insanely overpowered items when slotted with infinite copies of socket items, it simultaneously neuters the cool-sounding "unique" items.  Ordinarily, if you couldn't make infinite copies of everything, finding a named chest plate, for example, that has a couple so-so mods and one free slot would be a boon.  However, given the choice between that item, or one with a similar armor value, and three slots, the decision is obvious.  The resistances, which can also be acquired on some jewelry, range from the very obvious (fire) to the completely obscure (magic).  But, much like the skill tree, since it's never really clear exactly what resistance does (whether it be reducing your chance to be hit by the damage type, or reducing the amount of damage you suffer from it), and in some cases, it's not even clear with which damage type you're being attacked (unfortunately, "not fire" isn't a category), the advantage of having some is equally murky.  And then there's presentation.  Voice actors don't seem to be sure what sort of accent they're affecting, and sadly, however unsurprisingly, a clear gender bias is present throughout.  Leave a female Shadow Knight idle long enough, and she'll let you know that "if you keep looking at me like that, I'll have to charge extra."  Because she's... already charging you to look at her?  You know, like a woman.  Take her into a lava-filled cavern, and the first thought that pops into her head, predictably, is that "this place is hotter and steamier than I am."  But, aren't you also really handy with a sword?  Sure, but who cares about that?  Hot and steamy!  I realize this game is now over six years old as I write this, but even today, this remains a real problem with this industry in general.  I understand target markets and all that, and I don't see anything wrong with visually pleasing characters of either gender being used to draw an audience.  At the same time, however, for the gaming industry to muse upon the mysterious, illusive female gamer while simultaneously and needlessly filling the huge majority of games with any sort of violence with such shameless sexism is hypocritical, not to mention lazy and pathetic.  Its degrading to women at large, and insulting to male gamers as well.  For the meat of the gameplay itself, there is some faint glimmer of elegance, as upgrading the speed of your weapon by way of a misty globe series socket item will change the pace with which you may use it.  That does not mean, however, that you can get away with just mashing the button as fast as possible, and capitalize on this.  It means instead that you must find the precise rhythm your weapon's speed requires (at the default speed, and each of the five varying tiers of misty globes), and tap the X button accordingly.  If you manage to do so, you will be rewarded with that increased attack rate, which offers potentially significant boosts to your damage.  It's not much, but frankly, in one of the worst dungeon crawlers I've played in years (and that's saying something), it's a welcome relief.  A game that was made bearable almost entirely because I was playing with my girlfriend, as we at turns shook our heads in disbelief at some aspects, and laughed at others, sometimes because we just didn't know what else to do, was elevated somewhat by the discovery of a crude semblance of challenging gameplay.  On the other hand, faced with more than two or three enemies at a time, at least in a two-player simultaneous game, the engine chugs, and there is noticeable slowdown.  This of course impacts that timing in a way that isn't quite sporting.  Mind you, it's still painfully easy to slog through the enemies of this game.  Player deaths are few and far between, and owe in equal measure to tactical error, a random itch now and again, and the occasional sudden appearance of absurdly cute little kittens in various unexpected parts of our home, the latter two of which we have found far more interesting.  The discovery that there was actually some challenge to aspire to meet anywhere in the game at all was a godsend.  I could go on for hours about everything that's wrong with this game, and cover what's right in just a few short sentences.  But, as I said, I'm generally pretty easy on this kind of game.  Can I kill stuff?  Check.  Can I take its stuff?  Check.  The graphics are as good as anything else on the PS2, so I should be good to go, right?  Well... given the limited selection of dungeon crawlers on PS2... yeah, I guess.	-1
ok so i knew it was like baldur's gate, but unfortunately it's worse!  it gives you too many options to deal with items, customizations and whatnot, and not enough fun action.  i was really hoping a big problem with baldur's gate (aiming arrows) would be fixed, but nope!  it wasn't.  in fact, the problem was worse.  screw this game.	-1
Wish I hadn't wasted the money.  First Glitch: Health and Mana viels could not be used. Reloaded and started the game at least ten times before finally deciding to try and venture on without.  Of course, it made for difficult and time consuming gameplay...running around circles during boss battles until my health replenished.  Diehard that I am, I still managed to put HOURS into this shotty game and survived until reaching level two. That's when I found the SECOND glitch which made continuation impossible.  Upon killing the Big Spider Boss, I decided to head back to unload my loot before entering the doors to level two.  Once done and "saved", I returned to the doors only to discover they were now CLOSED and I was unable to move forward without starting the entire game over again!  After 12 hours of struggling to work around the games many unresolved errors, problems and glitches; the oh-so-boring 'hack and slash' gameplay was hardly worth the time... OR the money I spent.	-1
I followed the instructions by the book when I first purchased this product on installation and use. Everything seemed to be functioning normally, but when I start the game, there was no effect whatsoever. I went to the codejunkies website, read all the FAQ's on troubleshooting...nothing helped. So I exchanged this product for a new one, thinking it was defective. Same symptoms occurred. So I contacted both UK and US support. Neither side could help. They just kept repeating the instructions mentioned in the Instruction booklet, wasting my time. Eventually, I threw a question at them that seemed to have boggled their minds. I asked them if early PS2 consoles produced in 2000 don't work with their product. Both sides say they cannot be certain, but there is a possibility since they did design the product based on a later produced PS2 console. The funny thing is, UK support asked me to contact SCEA to see if there was any hardware changes made in the PS2 production over the years. Why waste my time? I just returned this product. My recommendation is to purchase this product at a store that guarantees returns so you can test it on your console and return it without any hassle if it doesn't work. I purchased my PS2 back in early 2000 and AR MAX doesn't work on it. Whether it's because AR MAX isn't compatible with early PS2's or AR MAX is a terrible product, I cannot say for sure with the facts I've collected. Purchase at your own risk!	-1
I honestly do not like cheat devices, but since Wild Arms 4 came out, it actually now has a use. Let me explain...  Unfortunately, thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing (the company that translated Wild Arms 4) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device, or a similar device like a Gameshark. Since this is the cheapest of all said devices, if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game, you'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this.  If it wasn't for this reason, I wouldn't even be interested in this product.	-1
Then this will not work on your console. But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console. If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark.	-1
i have a brand new high end gaming comp. i have tried all compatability modes and even went on forums where some people say theres a fix that works. i tried the fix and nothing. i have bought 2 versions of this game and both have the same problem. they really shouldnt be selling this if it has compatabilty issues without a warning. If the game does run on your comp its one of the most played rts i have put time into. Id love to be able to play it but i ill have to wait fro command and conquer generals 2 in dec 2013.	-1
If it says it will work in XP on the box then it should be PATCHED to work in XP whether you CAN play it or not.  If it says in the manual that four out of the five games are Win 98 only it should say that on the box.  I do not have this I would never buy it, but know for a fact that NS Porshe Unleashed and NS IV do NOT work in XP.  I do have those original titles.	-1
On a whim I picked this up years ago and enjoyed it, although it was a bit easier on the difficulty-side, a little more frustrating, and much slower paced than its origins, I neglected these petty and trivial complaints at the time.  Unfortunately it came back to haunt me, as I felt severely underwhelmed by my first few minutes back in it once again.  "Oh look! Its a game that could never have stood on its own without the original and actually looks worse now (due to that new fangled 3D engine at the time didn't age so well after windows 98 era hardware) than the first freaking game."  Basically if you love the series to death- pick it up for sure.  However, if you realize that the spark of ingenuity, originality, humor and atmosphere (which is all coincidentally missing from the sequel) has suddenly wandered off with old age- don't bother.  In fact just keep signing useless petitions for another sequel that EA will never make as its not a cash-cow IP these days and never was.	-1
The game was shipped very fast, but in the end I was not able to play it. I was getting a Securom wrong disc error at game startup. After a few days of debugging, Securom informed me that my disk was part of a bad production lot and recommended getting a refund instead of a replacement. Amazon was quick to issue a return form to make this happen.	-1
I never myself liked any Tom Clancy games just because of their controls and style.. i am very picky when it comes to the games I like, and I must say this game was not to my liking.  First off, the single player is horrible, so simply don't bother with that.  Next off, the online mode is not very well done either, simply because there is not enough people online and the levels are too huge  Next, the graphics are horrible. I know graphics aren't everything, but these graphics are absolutely horrible.  Finally, the one and only good thing; the multi player. I found the split screen mode enjoyable to play with a friend because you actually have to make up strategies for this game; you can't run and gun in this game without a strategy.  All in all, this game is only good if you have a buddy next to you playing it with you.	-1
This game is an example of what not to do! The graphics are poor; the environments are almost as blocky & pixilated as Super Mario brothers. All of the natural foliage is totally devoid of detail. The A.I. is sub-par at best as the enemies react to shooting only part of the time. Hit detection is also poor, as one shot in the mid section can bring enemies down while other's miss their mark completely. Weapon selection is severely limited as you can only pick from two primary weapons and either have a hand gun OR grenades. To offset the poor weapon selection, Ubisoft made all of the weapons fire at a full auto rate, even the M16. The full auto weapons will really tick a lot of people off, especially the people who actually know what the real life counter parts are capable of and what they are not capable of.  With all of the GREAT shooters out, game designer's really need to make the games look and feel real to compete, and this one just does not have what it takes. The missions could have been great but, the poor environment detail and overall reality just cannot be overlooked. I had this game on pre-order and wish that I had waited to purchase it until after all of the reviews came out. While people will compare it to SOCOM II, that simply is not fair to Ghost Recon. Ghost Recon is merely an idea or concept of what a great shooter should be. IF, Ubisoft plans to compete in the very tough market of shooter's, they need to take a long, hard look at the other titles and take plenty of notes. OVERALL RATING: POOR! I would advise renting first if you are a die hard fan	-1
although the game's cel shaded graphics and design is simular to the batman animated series, drakes does not exceed my expectations..the game seems too rushed and the levels can become frustrating and unispired. majesco was on a roll with gunmetal and bloodrayne the 2 hit sleepers of 2002. but drake is sorely lacking. for shooting action and better graphics/playability, choose gungrave instead. better luck next time guys	-1
I really struggled for this one boy let me tell you. This game is worth 10/10 stars to me, I remember playing this as a kid growing up, except on the Origional Xbox. Those were the days. But i had to drop 3 stars on this particular product. When you get your disk it comes with a code, and if you want to play this game you must enter that code on steam. This prevents you from handing the disk to your buddy who doesnt have internet for his computer and SHARING a game. Whats wrong with sharing, Bethesda?	-1
I bought this believing it was just exactly like my original copy, just to have a reserve but it was only a game that had to be played through steam. I felt fooled, and ordered the one that is the original but not the game of the year, as it doesnt seem to be sold here that I can find. I do have the original, patch it, use mods, and play on my windows 7 pc, without any problems at all. None.  I have the expansion packs as well, and of course Oblivion too.  I noticed there are those trying to rip others off by Morrowind and offering it for over three hundred dollars, what a shame, Bethesda should offer the original Morrowind since its old, and stop that nonsense.  If you never have played it, perhaps it will seem dated but with the new mods, overhauls, rebirths, or rebuilt type of mods, its a delight all over again and Im enjoying it once more. I loved it the first time, love it now, and love the additional mods available too.  Thank you modders, you made the world off Morrowind alive again.  If Bethesda ever came out with a new Morrowind, I have no doubt people would buy it in a heart beat.	-1
I am having a real problem loading this 1 to my computer.	-1
Wanted a fantasy game that didn't require high-speed internet to play. Sorry...this game does. It won't even install without signing up to a web site. Bad form, old boy!	-1
I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This "game" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy!	-1
I am an avid computer gamer, primarily of real time strategy, but occassionally other genres. I enjoy RPGs as well including the Final Fantasy series, Dungeon Siege II, and Diablo II, but Elder Scrolls 3: Morrwind was just not a good game. Why you may ask?  Well my main problem with it is the battle interface, which is a primary aspect of the game. Hiting enemies, esspecally short ones, is very inaccurate and cumbersome, causing a great deal of fusteration. This completely ruins the 'fun' aspect of the game. Also, it can be occassionally difficult to figure out where you're going or what is happening. While this is true of many RPGs, I found it to be a much more significan issue with this game. I have a feeling that some of those who enjoy everquest type games will enjoy this, however, many casual RPGers and people who appreciate a good battle interface will not.  Also, while graphics are not that important to an RPG, this game is kind of weird here. Some aspects such as water and landscape are beautiful when the graphics are turned up. However, characters, monsters, etc., are very poorly rendered and akward looking and acting.  The game has an overal cheesy feel dispite it's depth. I have given this game probably 10 hours of play, and it was not fun at the beginning, and it still isn't.	-1
Why a 1?  a) The game is devoid of fun. b) You move about as fast as a crippled snail, even when running. c) The NPC's "talk" after you have concluded your text-based talking. d) The graphics may have been good about 5 years ago but they are just muddy and dull now. e) The game is open ended but as a result there is nothing really to do, and the land is so barren that you just get incredibly bored very fast.  I now know why there is no demo for this game, if there were no one would buy it.  BTW, some have argued that the "slowness factor" is a graphic/system problem but it is not.  Your "character" simply is exceedingly slow, there is little jaggies or system level slowness.  If you have played something like everquest or WoW, think of it like this; running in Morrowind is at the speed of walking in those games, and walking in Morrowind is about half that speed.  Also, the "since of wonder" at seeing stars is old, been done everywhere and doesn't impress.  Walking down a road and seeing a door stuck in the side of a mountain means "dungeon" in morrowind...there is no since of wander, the dungeons are doors in the side of a mountain.  finally, if you want to buy this thing go ahead, clearly it appeals to some people.  I rate it as one of the worst games I've ever spent money on and furthers my belief that if a game doesn't  over a demo then there is some reason they are hiding it until after you make the purchase.	-1
This could have been one of the best games.  The open playability is great, the characters and storyline are interesting, the fights are the right difficulty - BUT - the game is nearly impossibly to navigate.  Clumsy two handed controls just to move and a lot of letter keys to remember for any given action.  Also, while the graphics are decent, the viewing choices you are given go from bad to worse.  :(  I was really looking forward to this, and hoped I'd get used to the odd controls and view in time, but I finished the game still clumsy and disgruntled.	-1
This is ONE OF THE WORSE GAMES I have ever had the displeasure of buying and wasting money on.  I personally will never buy another game from Bethesda again.  After all of the hype about the game, me and my spouse bought it.  After 10 minutes of play, we found that this game required too much camera angling, two hands to use a mouse and keyboard.  The hot keys, even customized, required way too much time to even enjoy the game.  This game, in my opinion, is for people who enjoy complex playing, and not medium to simple play.  I am sure the game is great, but until a version comes along where I don't have to use one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse, pass this one by.	-1
This is a Third-Person-Shooter.  As in a movie, you are looking over the  shoulder of the hero.  You are not THE hero.  If that's what you're  into then the game is fine, but if you're like me and want to BE the  hero, then avoid this game.  As with other similar games such as 'Stranglehold', product descriptions  leave out this aspect, an unforgiveable omission.	-1
If you're fortunate to have one of the CD drives this game supports, it's decent, however there's no way for you to know ahead of time.  Their tech support is near worthless with my request for help having them tell me that I need a second computer to test it on... Yes, to get support you apparently have to have a computer lab to verify on.  The game worked on my old CD drive, the only difference is a new DVD drive.  My other DVD drive in this computer won't work either. They've had this long w/out patching their cruddy protection?  They aren't going to if they haven't by now.  Avoid this like the plague unless you feel safe downloading a no CD crack or need an expensive beer coaster.  The game picks up shortly after the first Max Payne game.  You have Bullet Time again, but this time you're able to move at normal speed, so any illusion of it just being enhanced perception is removed.  You are not a man, but inexplicably a super hero.  You also get to play as Mona Sax, who was supposedly killed in the first game, but for some reason has the same powers you do.  There are some levels where you switch between the two, one defending the other or completing different tasks.  There are some pretty cool levels where you end up in a gang war with computer characters blasting away at each other and there are some improvements like not dying in dream sequences, but the story falls short of the first game.	-1
I being a fan of the first Max payne, because of its storyline and gameplay, was not disappointed by the sequel. Although there was nothing new to the game, I still found it quite fun. I enjoyed the dark storyline and settings. Not to mention that the bullettime feature was somewhat improved. And even though this game is single-minded (running through every level mowing down countless numbers of mobsters), the compelling story and intense firefights compensated for this.   However, Max Payne 2 has little replay value. In my opinion Rockstar copped out when it came to adding replay value. All they did was include an alternate ending which can be unlocked by beating the game on the hardest setting. Pretty much you play the exact same game again to get 5 minutes of difference in the end. What really made me mad was that my friend found the alternate ending on kazaa by typing in "Max Payne 2 alternate ending". He got to see it in two minutes, while I spent five hours replaying the game to get the alternate ending.   Although the game provided good entertainment for a limited amount of time, it isin't worth spending $50 on. Especially since it is short and has no replay value. Either borrow it from a friend or rent it.	-1
I loved "Max Payne". From the day I bought it, I was hooked. I finished it, and anxiously awaited the sequel. When It cam out, I played it over at a friends house. I still have not bought it. I was just disappointed with how they took the storyline. In the game, there's no mention as your playing, of the first game(unless you play the "previously" video in the game). Secondly, Max looks NOTHING like he did in the original! I can understand that times change, and I read how super looking max now is, compared to the original, but His looks didn't strike me as great. Medicore, I would say. And last but not least, if you don't have high specs for this game, don't even bother wasting your money, or downloading the demo(especially if your a dial up user). It's just not worth it. I'll stick with the original instead, this game, in my opinion blows goats.	-1
When I first played this game I loved it. It was fun and pretty easy. But after 2 days it put me to sleep. Booooooooooring.	-1
I've been a big fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, in which the gameplay is centered on the fun of developing an amusement park and getting to see the rides in action, with the business-oriented "goals" for each scenario being kind of an afterthought. If you failed to meet the goals in time, it was still fun to design the park itself. This was my first Railroad Tycoon game, so perhaps this was just my misconception to expect the same idea. I imagined it would be like designing one of those miniature model train sets in your basement, and getting to watch the trains travel through minature towns, through mountains, over bridges, etc. Frustratingly, the game has almost nothing to do with this; it is barely a model train simulation, but rather, it is almost strictly a business simulation. The gameplay focusses heavily on raising funds via issuing stocks, or bonds; investing in stocks, determining which goods to have your trains pick up in which amounts at which stations, checking and rechecking investment portfolios and ledgers with profits minus expenses, etc. There is very little room for imagination in track design (why pay more than the shortest track between any two points?). The lanscapes are a little bleak and monotonous. Again, picture the opposite gameplay of Sid Meyer's Golf Sim, where the business aspect of the game takes a back seat to the fun of designing your own course, watching sim players play on it, and even being able to test out the course yourself. Here, I felt more like I was taking a required tutorial CD for Econ 101.	-1
Ok I just want to let you people know that in terms of gameplay, this is kart racing at its best. But the most important part of any racing game by far in my opinion is the tracks you have to race on. They have to be interesting and well designed. The tracks are what made MK64 so fun, they were well designed, long, creative, etc.... I expected a LOT better from Double dash. Theres probably about a total of 4 or 5 decent tracks in this game. Not very impressive! Very few shortcuts, boring design, nothing special at all. And as far as the 2 riders idea, its so overhyped its rediculous. Ok, so instead of seeing a banana peel flying from your cart..... um... you see another character throwing it? Each player has their own special item, but that doesnt really matter, its pretty much choosing which special weapon you like best. And switching drivers and riders in mid-race does absolutely nothing. I just wanted to warn the people who like awesome tracks in their racing games, and that this 2 rider idea adds nearly nothing to the game at all. Big stepdown from Mario Kart 64.	-1
Recently, I purchased Xbox Live for the biggest reason that I bought an Xbox: Halo. For some strange reason, I just assumed that the same corporation that owned the company that created Halo would automatically make their flagship game playable on Xbox Live. But, of course, I forgot that this same corporation was Microsoft, the corp. that brought us Windows. What was I thinking? Fortunately I have not activated my subscription, yet. This is just a warning to all those who might make the same mistake as me: don't get this if you want to play Halo online. Fortunately, the let down with this game should be remedied by its predecessor, Halo 2. Of course, the way Microsoft keeps delaying their release date for Halo 2 (it was originally slated to come out in February 2004, now they anticipate Fall of 2004) I probably won't be activating my subscription until about 2010. Thanks, Microsoft!!	-1
It may have been a one off but the unit wouldnt switch on properly. I would turn on my Gamecube and then I would have to change the channel or turn the tv off and on for it to work. I would not buy this again.	-1
I'm going to offer a dissenting opinion here and say that Grand Theft Auto (or at least this version of it for the Xbox) is not quite as wonderful as some of its fans would have you believe.  I picked up the Double Pack after hearing friends who had PS2's rave about these games for years.  I also read a few reviews that said even though the graphics may be a little out of date, the gameplay remained very compelling.  Well, GTA may have been groundbreaking in its day, but I was less than impressed after making several attemps to wade into these two games.  The graphics, even though they may have been updated a little more for the Xbox, are bad.  Distractingly bad.  The cars look okay, but the buildings in the distance (when you can see them) remind me of the background of a Sega Genesis game.  I am not kidding.  You'll see the same three or four characters repeated over and over again on the street, saying the same things.  The way the people move is also very cartoonish and off-putting.  The control scheme is frustratingly awkward as well.  Whoever translated them over from the PS2 controller to the Xbox's did a horrible job.  The combat system is poorly designed, and the way in which you target and fire guns leaves much to be desired.  Finally, within my first fifteen or twenty minutes of playing the game I noticed two glaring bugs, the first of which was a loss of sound and the second a slowing down of the framerate to a glacial pace.  Both of these occurred in Vice City, for what it's worth.  If you're an Xbox owner and have not played GTA before, I would recommend just renting these games to see if they're for you instead of just buying them on the basis of word of mouth.  The dialogue in the game is pretty funny and driving around the city is fun, but the missions are fairly repetitious and get to be more of a chore than anything else.  Ultimately I found the booklets that came with each game more entertaining than the game itself.	-1
This game doesn't compare to World of Warcraft.  Final Fantasy should never have gone online because it ruins the whole series.  FFX2 was bad enough...  Be a sport and switch over to WoW and see what a MMORPG is really made of.	-1
If you've read all the reviews here at Amazon on this game, you're probably pretty confused. Some people claim it's the greatest MMORPG ever. Others say it's the most boring and time consuming they've played. If you're looking to buy this game, it's hard to make that decision based on the conflicting information. I doubt my review will help as it's based on my experience only. This is exactly the nature of this game, you either love it or hate it.  Unfortunately for me, this game did not live up to my expectations. However, I'd like to start on the positives. Firstly, the game's graphics are pretty good. There are three main base cities to start off in (there are other cities that you can explore to, but your ranks and missions are generally based on the three base cities). The environment changes dramatically in the different zones, it's refreshing to just take some time and explore the different scenery in the game.  This game is also huge. I've played it for a couple of months and I doubt I've seen more than 50% of the world. Add to that, the recent expansion makes the game even more mammoth. This also has a negative, I'll address it later. FFXI features all you'd expect in a MMORPG. You have your different skills, you can multi-skill when you reach a specific level. You also have "crafts" which are side skills that you can do, e.g. fishing, farming, etc. The depth in this game is mind boggling. The number of side skills (I believe there are eight or nine) all have their own levels.  Currency is also traded with something called gil. You need gil to get anywhere in this game. FFXI is heavily cooperation inclined. You cannot play this game solo and reach anywhere. Anyone who says this would either be lying or have absolutely nothing else to do in their life. This is both a positive and a negative. The positive being it encourages players to group together, share knowledge and play together. The negatives being there's always competition to find the best groups. People also tend to clique together and play separately from the whole community.  I should note that FFXI is played amongst several servers. When you create your character, you are randomly placed on a server. You cannot move from one server to the other, this is your server for life. If you want to play on the same server as your friends, you must buy (with gil, not real money) something called a "Worlpass" which your friend can enter when they're creating their account. I have no problem with this system, I understand it's necessary for the maintenance of the popularity of this game.  In the game, there's a wide range of armor and weapons that can be bought or retrieved. In your character's class, there are tons of spells and skills to be learned at periodic levels. The battle system is similar to most FF games however the speed of the battles greatly depends on your equipment. I like the battle system, personally I find it very flowing.  On to the negatives, and there are many. As I mentioned earlier, the game is huge. This brings me to my greatest grievance with FFXI. It takes far too long to reach anywhere without the help of higher level spells or items (Airship). I'm sure the drop out rate with this game is high for new players. You can spend fifteen to twenty five minutes walking from one area to the other. I personally found myself spending more time walking than fighting. That's what drove me to stop playing.  Another big negative is the variety of mobs. There's a very limited number of mob classes available. Most zones are limited to only three or four different mob classes of varying strength. This makes fighting extremely repetitive, you are fighting the same looking thing each time. Every city has "[insert name] crab", "[insert name] worm", "[insert name] fly" that ALL look the same. The developers really failed in providing variety to players, especially since this game requires hundreds of hours to achieve mighty levels. A related negative would be the fact you have to consider every mob as you have no idea of the mob's strength if they look alike, even in the same room.  Big negative number three relates to people selling gil for real money. Yes, it plagues all MMORPGs, however most companies try to do something to clamp down on it. Square has done absolutely nothing to try to control the sale of gil for money. What this has caused is the cost (in gil) of items to be sky high to due the easy availability of gil to those who are willing to spend money for it. This makes the game extremely difficult for the average player who simply gains gil from killing, quests and trading items. FFXI is centered around trading items with other players (there's a central auction house for this) that you can't get around playing without buying your equipment. I'm not sure if it's related to the gil selling, however all the rare item drops are "camped" by dozens of people. The average player will never be able to achieve a valuable item without buying it.  Finally, because you can't solo in this game, you need to find yourself some friends to play with. If you can't join a group (called linkshells), you will be spending minutes or hours waiting to join parties. The number of hours required to reach anywhere in this game is ridiculous. That's probably why so many people are either terribly addicted to this game or absolutely frustrated. Unfortunately for me, FFXI wasn't for me. It's too demanding on time and far too repetitive for me. There are some people this game appeals to, I'm certainly not one of them.  If all the negatives I mentioned seemed negligible to you, perhaps you should give it a try.	-1
Really.  This game is dead.  Go buy World of Warcraft or EQ2.  Even with the latest "expansion pack," the game isn't that fun and doesn't offer a lot of innovation.	-1
This review has nothing to do with the actual gameplay of the game.  Because of bad business practices and incompentence on Playonline's part, I haven't been able to play the game at all.  Ok, to start off, I have owned this game for only twelve hours and am already completely frustrated.  For the twelve hours that I have owned this game, the servers have been down for six.  The registration server went down right after I gave them my credit card information (pretty convenient if you ask me).  Once that got going, they wanted me to download an update for the game.  That's cool, I was expecting this, but the update was like 16,000 files and several gigs of information!  Have they ever made update files before?  Why did I even spend the time to install the game if I had to redownload all the files anyways?  The setup continues...  Finally!  Now I have the updated FFXI and am ready to play.  My frustration is starting to subside.  I click the play button...  ...  ...  ...  All servers down for maintenance!?  Ok, here's a concept: backup servers!  At this point, I am completely frustrated.  I call the customer service number (which isn't toll free by the way) to ask for my money back.  Customer service number is busy.  Try again....  ...busy.  I love Final Fantasy games, and I also love MMORPGs.  I hate bad business practices, and Playonline is full of those.  Be warned, if you do purchase this game and want to take a few months off (three to be exact), you have to repurchase the game.  This is terrible terrible business, and I would have expected a lot more from the people who make Final Fantasy.  I would have loved to try this game, but that was not a possiblity.	-1
Besides FF10, this FF is just the worst of the series. It's also a terrible MMORPG. If you want real MMORPG, check out Ultima Online. It is actually reasonable on the quests. As with FF11, you have to level up to extreme levels just to ride chocobos, etc. The quests are boring and tedius. This is not for MMORPG, it's not even really for hardcore FF fans. FF is better single player, and I suggest starting at FF6 (known as FF3 on snes) and work you way up.	-1
I'm sorry to say that this is the worst Final Fantasy to date! I played for a month and the whole thing was basically just about running around and leveling up. Not really any kind of storyline to follow, very hard to get into since the instructions don't give you any clue as to where to go and how to get started. Not to mention you have to pay $12.00 a month to play such a boring game! I recommend you spend your money on Final Fantasy X-2 instead!	-1
I was an Intellivision junkie until I was about 12 years old. I can't even begin to remember all of the titles I once owned. Needless to say, I was excited to see that 60 games have been grouped together for use on the PS2. Unfortunately, the transition for INTV to PS2 was far from smooth. Cons-   1) The controls are horrible. Most of my favorite games (Tower of Doom, Utopia, and etc...) are unplayable. Who in the world did the QC on this product? Wasn't it pretty obvious that in order to "play" any of the games you must first be able to control the characters? 2) It was next to impossible for me to even get the game to play. "Blue Disc" or not- this is completely unacceptable. Once again, a decent QC department would never have allowed this product to be shipped. 3) A minor complaint is that some of the better games are missing. However, compared to problems 1 & 2 - this is pretty minor stuff. Pros-   1) It is nice having the games in one collection. Not because the games are playable, but more because it is like watching an old familar movie.	-1
I gave this a 2 star because it didn't have the classic D&D game treasures of Tarmin. That was the only reason I purchased this,But the game wasn't on there. They should provide a true list of all games on this PS2 disk.	-1
I receieved this game to find out that even though it was described to be playable on PS2, to find out this brand new disc does not even read on my PS2. Note I have no problems with any other PS2 games I own. This was the first one that was unplayable. I've heard this type of thing happening to other PS2 owners and now know the gaming tales are sadley true.	-1
Here is the games list, since I couldn't find it anywhere else.  Like others I found a good portion of them unplayable thanks to the control interface.

This game is tough. You have to sneak around steathily because if you get caught it is impossible. The plot is terrible and the voices are as bad as castlevania. It's dumb that the gaurds like can't see you in the dark if you are crouching down and right behind them stealing something from his pocket. Good level design. Graphics aren't really jaw droping. NOT VERY FUN	-1
item didn't even work when recieved	-1
Poor knockoff of the real thing. Just buy a Nintento controller if you care about having a good one. I buy them for Smash Melee every few years and this one is trash for that game. If you are just going to play casually and don't care much about the quality than it's fine but it won't last as long as a Nintendo made controller. cheap parts	-1
A terrible quality third party crap controller was what I received. The seller advertised it with the official Nintendo one pictured, so some people may actually receive what they want. But mine showed up as this junk. I learned not to buy unless it actually SAYS official Nintendo. But picturing one is pretty damn messed up and false advertising	-1
the right trigger gets stuck alot and doesn't work either. the controller was in need a good cleaning	-1
Would have rated it higher except it was really dirty when I got it and the amount of filth I wiped off was unreal! I mean cmon, you really couldn't have taken the time to make your product shine a bit?? shame on you!	-1
I purchased this because it said in the description that it was an official Nintendo controller, it is not. It does, however, look exactly like the official Nintendo controller so I figured there wouldn't be much difference, but boy was I wrong.  After a week the C stick would stick, meaning you would have to manually center it when not using it. The Z button also stuck, and I have yet to be able to to fix this... so when I play games with this controller it plays like the Z-button is constantly being held down.  Do not buy this, and I suspect many of the other GameCube controller deals online are similar to this. I'd recommend just going to the store and making sure you get an official Nintendo product, or even a quality 3rd party controller.	-1
I just bought this Controller about 3 days ago, Brand New and the Thumb Stick stop working on it I can only use Left and Right.. This controller also is not a Real Brand Nintendo controller buyers beware of after market brands	-1
the controller was sticky and bad thumb stick	-1
The controller was not all too bad, but the analog stick came in very loose, which I guess hadn't realized in the original description. However, the receipt said that it had been tested, and that it worked just fine. However, when i connected it to dolphin, it dragged uncontrollably, so I cannot really use it. Hopefully I can fix it...	-1
Boy did they really screw this game up...   First of all, you can tell that this is not emulated...   The games all have a different feel, sounds are not quite right etc...   The whole layout is bad, and takes place in an arcade... Funny the intellivision was a HOME system...   And the background music makes me want to pound my head into a wall after a few minutes..   Some games I can't even get to start...   This is almost as bad as the 25 in 1 controller...   Of all the "retro" out there, they really screwed up Intellivision big time..   Intellivision deserves much better than the cr*p they are putting out..   Spend the money at a yard sale and buy the real console because this is horrible..	-1
About 90% of this game is unplayable!! largly in part to the fact that the intellivision had a very uniqe controller thus rendering this game mostly unplayable. Buy this game only if you are a die hard collector. they really should have included a packaged controller, so what if the game would have cost more at least you would be able to play it!	-1
this product is built cheap and it doesn't last that long ,it probably only lasted a few months at best	-1
First off be careful where you get your used controller from. I got mine from Finest Play and from what I can tell, these controllers were all rebuilt fron parts of other controllers that were broken in one form or another. I got one controller that has the orange spice plug at the end instead of the silver plug and the other one had a black plug from the black controller. They are fine functionally but they were in worse condition than avertised. Used very good means that all parts on the contoller match and that they are free from major cosmetic damage. Thankfully I am good with the soldering iron and I got my controllers cord swapped for the spice cord and housing swapped for the one with the black end. Also while I was at it I cleaned all of the grime off of the controllers when I had them dissassembled.	-1
was really damaged	-1
The Gamecube has been out for two years and now we finally have a Pokemon game for it. Unfortunately this might not really be a game. Lets start with some details and what this game does right first. Apparently Prof. Oak has been hard at work on a television network for Pokemon (does the man have a life?). Now you've been chosen to test this network and see if it's any good. Right when the television is delivered guess who suddenly breaks into your house? If you said Pikachu you're unfortunately correct (more on that later). So now you and Pikachu (who is apparently allowed to break the law) are now tasked to watch this network and see how it works. Each channel has different Pokemon themed shows such as PNF (Pokemon News Flash), Shop n Squirtle, Pichu Bros Party Panic Anime, and Slowpokes weather report. There are more but they're neither interesting nor fun to watch. Let's start with the good. The graphics are okay, not heavily detailed, but they get the job done with the exception of some of the Pokemon models looking like they came from the N64 games. You can occasionally go outside and see different Pokemon, which is pretty cool. The shopping channel even sells bus passes which can take you to different areas to see different Pokemon. Now the bad and there are more of these than the good. If you hate Pikachu this WILL increase your hatred ten fold at least. He always wants to watch TV! It usually takes an act of congress to get him to go outside and see the different Pokemon, which is arguably the best part of this game. Now some of the shows are okay but noo he wants to watch all of them including crap like Smoochum exercising for five minutes. It's like babysitting some annoying child. After a few days of this you will try to get him run over by the bus (sadly you cannot). Now my biggest gripe: lack of interactivity to the point you question whether you have a DVD or a game. Everything here has you watching. Sure you get to click on things but after that you only get to see what Pikachu does with them (which if you don't like him anyway you won't want to see him roll around with a ball for example). As an interesting side note (and this is neither good nor bad) this game runs on real time like Animal Crossing. So if you're Gamecube's clock is set correctly and you turn this on at three PM it will be the same in the game. At first this intrigued me but it soon became clear that this feature is very limited here. For example there are no exact time specific events such as "Charmander only comes out from three to four in the afternoon". Instead it seems as though things are divided into three time sections each day: playing before noon, playing from noon to seven PM, and playing from seven PM to seven AM when the first section starts again. While simplistic it does keep the game from ending too quickly unless you mess with the clock. Each day when you save it unlocks things that when turned on in the proper time section the next day you can access. As stated before it isn't complex in the least but it does serve to stretch out what would be an otherwise short game. I know you're thinking I'm being too harsh on a game that's geared towards children right? Well it's because I know that tons of older Pokemon fans will pick this up and be disappointed. I almost did but thankfully I rented it first. Even at thirty dollars it's too much for what an older person would get out of it. However if you're a parent looking for good game for your pokemon-loving child this is actually a good choice. I could see a child enjoying it. Anyone over ten would be wise to wait until this can be picked up for at most half the price, I know I'm going to.	-1
I got this game to load up to the dream sequence at the beginning. After an hour of trying to figure out the controls and where the heck I'm going, the game crashed. Really bummed about the PC version not working, but I'd definitely pay the extra bucks to experience the game on the ps2.	-1
I know this game is older than many (published 5 years ago), and I bought it cheap. I am glad I did. I admit reviewing a game that is this old may not be fair, but it should have a bit more staying power.  In short, I found the third person camera annoying... The angles were distracting, and keyboard navigation was variable.  How can you fight something when the camera view is from behind your head?? It is really incomprehensible who would have thought that anything but a quick switch to first person in a fight mode would be the only way to present these scenes. I am new to Silent Hill, but this one makes me not want to try any others. There are newer games than this--with better graphics and better implementation. If Silent Hill 4 comes around for PC, I would hope that it would be updated with first person perspectives.	-1
