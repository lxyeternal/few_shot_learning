My son loves this and works well.  Just need have a hug bottle of bubbles on hand has it goes through them quickly.	1
I totally 100000% disagree with all the negative comments. This bubble machine is so awesome. I haven't had a problem. It's a no brainer! Use a light amount of bubble solution. I honestly think this company deserves a standing ovation for this amazing bubble machine. I am a real person. I don't B.S. I will tell you the REAL. THIS MACHINE WORKS AND IS WELL MADE. IF YOU ASK ME IT SHOULD COST MORE. THATS HOW AMAZING IT IS.	1
We really like this bubble maker. I saw a few comments that you have to buy Gazillion bubbles but thats not true. We use whatever bubble solution we have on hand and just pour it in. bubbles last a good amount of time then just refill. And honestly my 2 and 6 year old (and our 5 and 7 year old neighbors) really don't have a huge attention span and end up playing something else by the time the bubbles run out anyway. we did leave our out in a rain storm by accident and it fell and broke (our fault) but when it came time to buy a new one we got the same exact one we like it so much. We also use it for extra fun at bath time :) Oh and its cheaper on Amazon than TRU (plus it ships to your house free with PRIME)	1
Our daughter (2.5years) loves this bubble machine. Makes preparing dinner a lot easier because we can turn the bubbles on in the dining room, and she's occupied and within sight of the kitchen. The bubbles haven't had any ill-effects on our wood floor either, which is great. Honestly, when I read the description I thought they were exaggerating about how many bubbles per minute this little guy could put out.... After the first use, there was no doubt! Definitely a fun investment.	1
Tried several others, but his one actually works. Others requite complicated cleaning, this one is a breeze to clean and put up for next time.  It uses AA batteries, so it will last longer.  Others have AAA batteries and die after about 5 mins.	1
you h ave to set something on either side of this item because it vibrates kind of hard and will spin around. works very well though i am very pleased with it. it creats a TON of bubbles. very cool. uses alot of soap though so i would not recommend inside or it will created a very slippery floor or soaked carpet.	1
This is our second Gazillion Bubble Machine, but only because we moved and it was broken during the move. We purchased our second machine this year and it works just as well as our first one. This is a BIG hit with our 2 and 4 year old children. The little bottle that comes with it only lasted us a few minutes honestly. I knew this from our first one, so I ordered the big 64 oz. bottle as well. We went through that in about 5 days of frequent use. If you want a lot of bubbles for an extended period of time, you will need to buy more bubbles. I tried using other brands of bubbles that are cheaper, but honestly the Gazillion Bubbles work best.	1
My 2 year old loves this bubble machine as it really produces a gazillion of them!  Awesome quality and price!	1
We have used the Gazillion bubble solution before and liked it. This time we got the this bubble maker to go with the solution. What a success.  This thing makes lots of good bubbles, it does use quite a bit of solution, but it is worth it for the enjoyment it brings our young grandchildren. The battery life has been good.  It is sturdy and we do clean it between uses.  A good purchase we plan to use a lot.	1
extremely disappointed by this bubble machine, and I bought 2 (one was a gift for my nephew) of them. they both worked great the first few times we used them, then they stopped working and I can not get them to work again! new batteries will not fix it either. I would try to return them, but unfortunately the return window has closed. I guess I will be writing to gazillion bubbles to try and fix this!	-1
Bought this for use at a birthday party and it was awesome! The bubble solution that comes with it is best, but other formulas produce a decent amount of bubbles too. I wish it the bubble solution wouldn't spill out of the machine so easily when it is moved, but it's awesome otherwise. I definitely recommend this little wonder machine :)	1
I'm amazed at just how many bubbles come out of this thing - especially for how small it is. It makes loads of medium sized bubbles that filled the air. My dog probably loves the bubbles more than my 11 month old. It is easy to take apart and reassemble. It does require 6 batteries which seems like a lot. You need a screwdriver to get into the battery compartment - which is a nice safety feature.	1
This provides lots of fun for the grandkids.  Fills easily and produces tons of bubbles.  Just be sure to keep it clean after each use so that soap scum doesn't clog the works.	1
Worked for about 6 months then stopped working altogether for no reason, my son was very gentle with it but  I guess the motor just conked out. It was good while it lasted but you will have to just keep buying the machine over and over again each year!	-1
Found the same device on Wal-Mart.com and in the store for $9.88. That's $5.11 cheaper. They say it's free shipping but they basically raise the price to cover the difference. I would have given it 4 stars but since I got jipped I gave them one. Its getting frustrating having to double check Amazon's prices vs. Google Shopping. Then with and without shipping costs.  I trusted Amazon to have the lowest prices but now, I have to double check everything now.	-1
this is great outdoor fun for the kids.  My house is always a hit at summer parties for the kids.	1
this thing makes so many bubbles, so fast, so flawlessly.  my son absolutely loves this thing!  i have had no problems, it even comes apart(accident) and back together easily.  best used outside as it makes so many bubbles it will wet the area they land in no time.  p.s. u can use the cheap bubbles from dollar tree without any problems!	1
This is the second one we have purchased. And that's only bc we left the first one outside and the lawn guy ran it over. Our sons love bibles and boy does this make lots of them. All you have to do is keep the bubble solution on hand and your kids will have hours of fun!	1
What a pain.  Not worth the joy that the bubbles bring.  Seriously.  I have the tripod style with the three legs on the bottom and it's top heavy and tips over easy.  The bubble tray does not hold a large amount of solution and the kids are not satisfied long.  After a half dozen uses the wand wheel keeps sticking and won't turn.  Disappointed.	-1
This bubble machine is amazing! It shoots tons of bubbles in just a short time. My daughter loves to play with bubbles but lets be honest, its not the blowing of the bubbles that's fun is playing in them and trying to catch them. This fits the bill perfectly.	1
This bubble machine make lots of bubbles constantly.  It can continue to make plenty of bubble for a good 30 to 45 minutes before adding more solution.  You will have to be very careful not to let the bubble solution get into the battery department.  Get machine for children and pets.	1
Broke after using it twice. This is the reason I always buy prime, it is so easy to return garbage items like this. Should have listened to the other bad reviews.	-1
I was reluctant to buy this because of the many reviews saying it only lasted one go around. But I bought it for my son's second b-day party anyway. Luckily, it is still going weeks after the party. I do find that some bubble solutions work better than others but I don't think you have to refill with the kind this co. makes. Lots of people at the party wanted one!	1
I got this for my sons 6th birthday. He LOVES it! But I think my husband might like it better. When they get it out lots of the neighbors come out to watch. I will say thought that you defiantly need parent assistance and supervision. My little guy can even push the pump hard enough to make it go but he is rather small for his age. We all really love this. In fact we just ordered one for his cousins 7th birthday. We would recommend to others and buy again.	1
Maybe we had the wrong pump, but this didn't work for us. I gave it 2 stars in case of user error, but I don't think that's the case.	-1
This is flat out awesome.  Tons of fun.  I would NOT do this without a battery powered air compressor, though.  Indeed, they suggest two reds discs is the maximum, at 150 psi.  My air compressor would get to 150 and take another 10 seconds trying to burst the discs.  A bike pump would take forever.  With those two discs, the rocket goes far out of visual range, so I have zero idea how high it goes.  Then it'll come screaming down, usually within 25-50 feet of where you launched.  Great fun.	1
These go surprisingly high so unless you like rooftop retrieving-find some empty space. Not as exciting as an engine rocket, but fun for the kids. I would recommend a good quality pump, and don't forget extra boosters.	1
This has been a lot of fun for our whole family.  You can choose different combinations to launch higher with more effort put into the pump.  Adults can easily do the harder and higher combinations.  I'm glad we got this particular rocket because it does go high enough to wow the kids and keep them excited about doing it.	1
Bubble machines that work well and last are very hard to find. This is the best one I have found.	1
I purchased this bubble machine for a birthday party. It works great, and served its purpose. I was hoping the reservoir would be bigger. The only hassle was we had to refill the bubble solution so frequently, about every 30-45 mins. You have to be careful not to over-fill the reservoir, because it can leak and spill, causing a big mess. But for the price, it worked great!	1
This works great, produces lots of bubbles, is easy to clean, and batteries seem to last a while.  Durability is probably not great, and the battery cover does not stay put very well, but it does what it's supposed to.	1
This bubble machine is terrific, yes you have to clean it out every few uses, but it will keep it running. and take the batteries out if you are not going to use it for awhile.  BUT... to get so many bubbles you get lost, set it on a block or paint can and put a large circular fan behind it on low or medium.. high will blow it off the can... there were so many bubbles in the backyard you couldn't see anything but bubbles!!! .. You will have to add more bubble stuff every 5 minuts or so, (Im working on something to fix that... )  but its worth the fun for the kids!	1
As expected.	1
Works great.  With one disk I am getting 3-350 feet of air.  Perfect for me and my kid.  I am not sure if you can get 1000 feet but that is OK with me.	1
Absolutely a great toy, but make sure you have a quality bike pump.  You can launch the rockets so high you will lose sight of them.  The amazing thing is that even with a slight breeze, the rockets usually land within 50 feet of where they were launched.	1
This is a really cool rocket without using fire. My kids love it! The boosters make the rocket go pretty high. It does take a lot of strength to burst threw the boosters. Me or my husband have to give it the last few pumps. We use our regular bike pump.	1
This is a great little gift for a kid 1 to 3 years of age (maybe older, I don't know much about gifts for older kids).  The price is great, and it puts out tons of bubbles.  At this price I don't have high expectations for it working for a super long time, but its a fun little machine and my 15 month old loves it.  We received it as a gift, and I've since given it twice I liked it so much.  Combine it with a book or extra bubble stuff and its a nice little gift idea!	1
Our family loves these.  They make the most bubbles out of any machine we've tried.  They last us anywhere from 3 months to a 1 year but we keep picking them up for birthday parties. Can get expensive if you use all the time but worth it for birthday parties and special occasions.	1
Really liked this product. Kids had a blast chasing an popping bubbles on the breeze. Fun for outdoors but messy when used inside. That's to be expected though. Only complaint I really have is that its a bit easy to tip over as its base feet aren't spaced very far apart. This is the second unit we've owned and it suffered the same fate as the first. Started leaking after we stored it in a box with some other party supplies. I think that has more to do with it being banged around with the other items in the box. Not the actual construction of machine itself. I would definitely recommend this at the asking price.	1
you can have a blast with these air rockets. The air rocket is a hit every where you go. Just make sure you buy some spare rockets. they are fragile understandably since you want them to go as high as possible.	1
This is such a cool toy. It takes a little bit of elbow grease to launch the rocket but my husband will take it out to the front yard to launch rockets for the kids and everyone in the neighborhood stops to watch the show. Lots of fun!	1
I've owned two dozen of the original versions of these machines and found them all to be excellent. When I decided to replace five that finally died, I learned they were now called "Hurricanes" and had several new features, unfortunately all bad. First, the large round stable base on the original design has been replaced with three small feet. The machine is now extremely easy to knock over. Second, unlike the original base, the three feet allow vibrations from the motor to cause the machines to "walk," that is spin around and drift all over the surface. Finally, the machine used to come with a larger bottle of bubble solution. The new ones have a tiny bottle that barely fills the machine once.  The original machines were made in China. The new Hurricanes are made in Vietnam. Everyone... please email Funrise and ask them to go back to their original manufacturer.	-1
best kids toy ever. i was at the park with my grandson launching this rocket and before long we had a group of 20 kids and more adults watching and wanting to do it. I had kids as young as 2 and 1/2 helping and chasing after it. Kids LOVE this rocket.	1
Just as described	1
Absolutly out of site, literally! Works better then described!	1
Excellent	1
This toy blows bubbles.  I knocked off a star because its open design makes it kind of easy to spill, yet a little hard to fill.	1
Do you need EPIC bubbles? Like uncontrollable, tear your face off, laying the smack down torrential streams of bubbles? Gazillion is for you. This thing has so much sheer bubble blowing force it will blast itself backwards off a table if you don't prop it up. We refilled its unquenchable power thirst for solution several times with 75 cent solution from the grocery store, worked great.	1
The grandkids love it. They live 1,000 miles away so I don't know how long it lasted, etc. My son is not good about reporting back on things I have sent. Would stop sending but that would hurt the kids.  Bad son, bad son ... he was raised better. <grin>	1
My child just loves this product. It was a big hit on Halloween. But one thing I did notice that you can not use other bubbles or home made bubbles, it will not work as well.	1
This is a great bubble machine that produces a lot of bubbles very very quickly.  You will have to shut it off after a few minutes, or you will go through your bottle of bubble liquid in 10 minutes or so, will have to refill.  Definitely buy a big bottle of bubble liquid to go with this machine, if you are going to use it for a while.  Kids have a blast, it is perfect for parties.  You have to be careful moving the machine once you put the bottle upside down (it has a valve that you put on the bottle, then you put the bottle upside down on the side of the machine), then the liquid moves into the green area of the machine, in which the wand dips into the liquid, and then a constant air stream on the top portion of the machine blows out the bubbles.  When you move the machine too quickly, the bubble liquid can slosh around in that green basin and come out.  It is best to put it on a table or something up off the ground, as if you put it on the ground, then it seems like 1/3 of the bubbles go on the ground and pop.  There are other bubble machines that are out there, that have a handle that could be moved with one hand, this one if you are going to move it, you should put one hand on the upside down bottle, then the other one for the machine, or the bottle can easily fall off the machine.  This one is more compact than the others I have seen.	1
I bought this for my son's 2 year birthday party.  The bubbles are great.  It makes so many!  The only problem is the amount of solution it takes to make these bubbles.  We tested it out before the party and used all of the bubbles that came with it in about 10 minutes.  The bubbles are expensive too, but the machine was so cheap that I really don't mind.  Hopefully I find them on sale some time.  For now, I'm just buying the biggest container of bubbles each time so it's cheaper per ounce.	1
Nice way to get into rocketry.  No battery or heat producing engines, just plain fun. Easy to use, kids love it.	1
I purchased the LifeLine AAA 300 PSI 12 Volt DC Air Compressor to go with this as after 50 pumps on the thing I was wringing wet with sweat and my 4 year old was loosing interest in Daddy making the rocket go.  Once I bought the air compressor "IT was ON"!!  We have great fun when I break out the rocket.  It flies very high depending on what set up you go with.  We found that the ladies like just one white, while guys and boys like to MAX it out.  :-)  Would suggest this for family entertainment.  As always you should use your head when using this and have safety first with little kids around.  Common Sense.  I would suggest adding to your order Air Burst Extra Boosters (Pack of 60) and possibly the extra rockets as well as the nose on the rockets are very soft for safety purposes and do break, but that's the price you pay for safety.  We love this item.	1
Great air rocket. Grab your tire pump and launch rockets 1,000 feet and MORE. This thing is so great (gave it as a gift to a 7 year old and his dad) that I bought one for another family member and then got yet ANOTHER for myself.	1
I got one this summer for my son's 1st birthday party, it worked great. Even though it broke quickly, I didn't mind, since I did leave it out in the backyard for 2 days, and it got rained on. I told myself, it was 10 bucks, what do you expect. And now that my son has a new found love for bubbles, I decided to purchase him another, at this price, it's doable. And I was sure not to let it be rained on. However, this one I received, not only it took a bit of effort to unwrap. When I turned it on, it was vibrating so much, that it will not stay on any surface, it fall off the table after 1 minute of loud vibration, and the bubble solution was all over the place. There's no way to use it at all. It was really a disappointment.	-1
Perfect machine to keep my toddler busy.  I will say we had a gazillion bubbles with the bubble solution it came with.  When we used our own stuff (from the $1 store) they produced a lot, but nothing like the original solution.  He was still happy.  It's a simple and small machine. Perfect for anywhere.	1
We bought this for out son's 4th birthday party and it went over great!  The bubbles flow non-stop and provided quite a lot of entertainment.  The only downside is that it does go through bubble fluid like crazy, so be sure to have quite a lot on hand if you're looking to have this going for a while.	1
Nice great toy. Made my life easier, since I couldn't blow so many bubbles as it produces, it's amazing! You have to use its brand liquid edits magical the bubbles come out colored	1
Fun to see how high the rocket flies! It is hard to launch, made not as well as I thought for the price. Overall it was fine.	1
This is my second rocket launcher only because I couldn't find the first one after we moved.  Only downside is that the plastic legs could be a big sturdier, but otherwise this thing is a blast!  Better if shot in an area where the rocket will land in grass as the foam tip broke off on the very first landing which was on concrete.  Don't fire rocket on windy days or you can kiss the rocket goodbye.  I don't know exactly how high this rocket will fly but suffice it to say that when 2 red and 1 white 'fuel' booster is used that it shoots out of site.  Their recommendation of a sturdy bicycle pump is HIGHLY recommended by this user!  I own a nice, high PSI floor pump and it works well.  I've also used my pancake compressor dialed down to the proper PSI output but that takes some of the fun out of it plus all the neighbor kids enjoy taking turns pumping and pumping and pumping until the rocket finally launches!  Buy and extra set of rockets and definitely will want an extra pack or two of the boosters OR make your own with an old rubber pool or something similar.	1
Returned it. The motor would get stuck and stop turning. Would not even make one full revolution. Vibrates all over the place when it does run. If it's on a smooth top table, it'll vibrate in circles till it falls off the table.	-1
Don't waste your money. I saw bad reviews on here but went ahead and bought this. When you turn on the machine it kind of shakes or rattles, has you thinking 'ok is this thing going to fall over?!' It made super big fun bubbles ONCE. After that it just stopped making bubbles. The wands spin, the fan blows, we changed batteries but nothing...;( I won't give it one star because it's a bubble machine and I can't say I hate it I mean come on. The bubble solution does make big bubbles. We use the solution with a regular old wand so at least that is useable. I'd get the solution alone but the machine is kind of a waste.	-1
One of my  sons bought this and has had hours of fun with it.  He's also entertained many little children with these air burst rockets.	1
Bought this for my 7 & 9 year old boys.  They LOVE it!  It was hard for them to use the pump to make it fly and take off, but my husband helped.  It kept them amazed for awhile.  They are not bored with it even though they can't pump it well.  We did find that pumping the 2 red disk makes it nearly impossible to launch, but we believe it is because of our pump, not the rocket it self.  It goes very high and out of view, but then comes soaring down again.  We used it on the grass in our yard and the rockets held up great.  I would not recommend using on asphalt or concrete.  The wind was not strong so the rocket came back down in the same area.  I think I covered every aspect that may be important for people to purchase.  Product is wonderful and I would recommend it!	1
It does make a lot of bubbles, but it leaks bubble solution out and breaks easily. Also, it is hard to clean, and the battery compartment cover is weird and doesn't go on the right way. I've never bought any other bubble machines, but I bet there are better ones out there for not much more than this one.	-1
It's been 8 months and this is still working. Bubbles never get boring. Gives a fun party atmosphere. Have used this at least 4 times for 4 different parties and even if it breaks soon it is well worth it for the cost.	1
I bought this for a birthday party and the kids loved it! I recommend buying a lot of the Gazillion bubbles refills. This machine goes through bubble soap pretty quickly, and other bubble soap brands don't create the same amount of bubbles. I have a friend who also bought this machine a few years ago and it still works for him.	1
I got this for a party and it was a hit! I suggest getting a huge thing of bubbles as well, since you will go through the little bottle it comes with rather quickly! Also, don't forget BATTERIES! I made that mistake and had to have someone run to get them :/ Near the end of the party it took a fall (thanks kids!) and is now off kilter and not running as smoothly as it did when we 1st got it. I would recommend this product, however I do NOT recommend dropping it!	1
This had great reviews so I figured it would be fun for my one year old's birthday and it wasn't expensive. It made a ton of bubbles and the kids loved it. But it used the whole bottle, which I was prepared for based on the reviews here. We forgot to by this brand of and had some random bubble solution (it was a red bottle with no labels so I really have no idea what brand it was) that we got at someone else's party and it worked just fine with the machine. Fun fun fun!	1
I am very unhappy with this item it has worked great for a while. Now in the last week or so the wheel it doesn't turn as fast was it did. I would like to here from someone on this problem. Thank you Valerie	-1
I am giving this 5 stars because it works great at parties. I cannot attest to its overall longevity, but we have used it twice so far, in 10-15 minute spurts maybe 3-4 times per barbecue, and it worked well.  I used basic bubbles from the dollar store, which worked great. I also used a homemade bubble mixture of dish soap, corn syrup and water (a recipe given to me by a local kids museum), which worked just as nicely. I have no idea why people seem to think you HAVE to use Gazillion branded bubbles, because you dont. But if for some reason you simply have to, you can find Gazillion bubbles on Amazon and locally at Tar***. Easy peasy.	1
A must buy if you're a parent! This bubble machine is awesome! It's got a detachable reservoir that you can rinse off. Kids flock to us a the park! Everyone loves this bubble machine. The price was great! The bubble machine is great! No complaints here!	1
I'm actually surprised something like this hasn't come out yet.  For the price, this a great product (I actually thought it would be around $20 or so).  It is easy to use and truly produces a gazillion bubbles.  It couldn't be easier to use but does require a lot of batteries.  It's also pretty durable.  We accidentally dropped it off a height of about 5 feet.  The green cover flew off but easily popped back on. It has worked well since.  Our kids love it.	1
My 20 month old dances around in the bubbles it makes for as long as I keep it on and the batteries seem to last a little while too!	1
Awesome machine! I got the for my daughter's birthday party and the kids loved it. Unfortunately the soap goes quickly but that is what you get when you want many bubbles! Great buy really and good price. Will be using it often. Simple but makes your children happy happy.	1
my 3 boys loved this but as soon as it got knocked over once the bubble wands quit spinning.  now it's headed for the trash can.	-1
I wish it came with more bubbles.  You need a lot of batteries too.  Once up and running though, your kids will love it.	1
Nice product. Purchased for children who have great fun with the products and love the program. Will recommend for children. Makes great gifts.	1
True advertising. The little bottle of bubble solution was one filling which lasted approx five minutes. During that five minutes, there were a gazillion bubbles. Fun at first, but then a bit overwhelming for the little ones. The next time we used it, I took regular bubble solution and mixed it with a quarter cup of Dawn dish soap. I filled the tray and it lasted approx fifteen minutes. Not a gazillion bubbles, not a flood of bubbles that sent you running away. It blew just enough bubbles so that you could focus and chase about. Slow and steady and in my opinion, much better.	1
I have never purchased a bubble machine and had it work well.  This machine unfortunately is exactly what I expected.  We wash the bubble holder everytime we use it and let it dry, to make sure there isn't any bubble "gunk" left in the machine, but we are still having trouble with the machine staying on.  The switch almost seems to have a short in it, if I hold it with my finger at the one position, it will work and blow bubbles, if I take my finger off the switch, even though it is turned to the on position, it won't work.  We tried new batteries, cleaning it really good and buying new bubble solution, it just doesn't work well or reliably.  Kind of disappointing, considering we haven't been using it for more than 4 weeks.	-1
I made the mistake of thinking I could turn it on inside on our kitchen's linoleum. I had to put a towel down to catch the bubble residue, but cleaning it up was like hand washing the floor, so at least it's a 'clean' mess. My daughter absolutely loves the bubbles, though we've been through two of these gizmos already. The little engines tend to die easily.	1
This is the BEST bubble machine out there.  The first one we had got used SOOOO MUCH it died - so this was actually our second one.  Here comes summer we'll see if it makes it thru more than one!! I think it seriously makes a GAZILLION bubbles.  And you don't HAVE to use their bubble stuff - the bubble machine works awesome with just about any bubble solution (I haven't tried homeade yet tho)	1
This worked much better than the bucket style, where bubbles come out the top. Tons of bubbles exploded from this machine, to the delight of my 2 year old.  Be warned, it requires SIX AA batteries, and comes with a very small bottle of bubble juice.  Based on previous experience with other models, I expect this to last 4 months tops.  The gazillion bubbles juice was not available in my stores, and its possible using other brands contributes to the eventual destruction of my bubble machines.  I've tried washing, not washing, storing in airtight bags, thick solution, thin solution...whatever care the machine gets, it dies inside a year.	1
The gears on our machine disengage with one full rotation and has to be manually rotated. This happened the very first time we used it, very disappointing.	-1
Had high hopes of bubbles all summer long but it myseriously stopped working before the season ended.  Could have been the kids breaking it, but I still expected more from a battery operated bubble blower.  Took a lot of batteries to get a it going too.	-1
We have had so much fun with this bubble machine on the deck and at the pool. It produces so many bubbles and is great for the kids. It does work best when stationary - we tried taking it in the wagon for a 4th of July parade, and it didn't work too well, but we didn't expect it would. We have always used the Gazillion bubble solution, which is great stuff.	1
Battery life is good. The amount of bubbles is also good. I even use dish soap and water sometimes when out of bubbles. I take this to a daycare where I help out. All the the kids of all ages love chasing the bubbles. I plan on trying it in the bathroom at bath time. The downside to the product is it leaks at the bottom. We set it on a plate to catch the mess. Though it may be user error as I notice it more when we over fill the machine.	1
We bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday party.  I anguished over which one to get but then a friend used this at her party and it was fantastic.  So I got it for ours and it was great.  There are a ton of bubbles that come out, it is easy to use and clean.  Very fun for everyone!	1
My daughter broke her first one and we had to replace it. The first one broke because we left it outside and it got rained on, but otherwise it would have last a lot longer.	1
I picked this up because my kids love bubbles.  I worked nicely and became a favorite.  I think it got the big head, though because it quickly decided it was too good to work.  It stopped working properly and began clicking and the wheel turned.  It wasted a lot of bubble fluid also.  I was upset when it completely stopped working around 4-5 weeks after purchasing.  This equated to maybe 10-12 days it was actually used...  If you're looking for a good, reliable bubble maker, consider 'Amazing Bubbles Bubble Generator ' here on Amazon.  It as lasted me near 7 months now.	-1
I had high hopes for this to work, my Mom as a a wonder bubble machine that works great.  I should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper.  And Gazillion does have great bubbles, but the machine sucks.  It never blew a single bubble out of the machine.  I changed batteries twice, let it run for 30 minutes, washed it three times, tried two versions og bubbles.  Not a single bubble, not one.  Unless you count the ones when I was behind the machine blowing into the stupid thing to make them come out.  And even then it was sad.  I would not get this or any gasillion machine becuase of how bad this one was.	-1
My 2 year old daughter loves bubbles and received this for her birthday.  First off, it takes a tiny screwdriver to remove the battery compartment and this is no easy feat.  My husband is a pretty handy guy and the screws became stripped and it was a two man operation trying to get the compartment off to add batteries. ONce this was done we screwed the cover back on and voila - nothing! The bubble wheel barely turned (and we put new batteries in). No bubbles, major disappointment after my 2 year old daughter stood watching the both of us try to get this danged thing put together for 10 minutes.  Half of the bottle of bubbles that we poured in was now a total waste as were the brand new batteries we inserted because it wasn't worth the pain in the butt to remove them.  This is going directly back to the store. Dont waste your time on this product.  For that matter, I won't be buying any more gazillion products based off of my experience on this one. Booooooooo for cheaply made, but expensive toys!	-1
This puts out so many bubbles it was a little overwhelming for our son who just turned two. Seriously, the carpet was damp after 30seconds to one minute when the machine was on. The fan is strong but doesn't seem to leave a lot of sticky bubble residue in front of it or dripping down the sides. The clean up is SUPER easy! I'm so glad that it is, if I had to tear apart the machine and clean it every time we used it I wouldn't be as pleased.  The only cons are that it's not very durable (I won't let my son touch it and when we're using it it goes on the top of our entertainment center so he can't grab it). And it doesn't have any way of making the fan blow on a slower speed so that there aren't quite so many bubbles at one time.  Great for outdoors or parties. Make sure you have extra bubbles with you, They go fast!	1
My kids love this toy. It's a hit at every party. It's our second one, after the first quit working following man-handling by kids. Here are some tips:   1) You have to set it up in a place that will keep the kids from touching it. The kids get excited, but when they move it, it tends to cause spills or tip and leak juice that damages the unit.  2) This thing makes a TON of bubbles. Probably about 50 a second. Really, it's too many.  To cut down, I used pliers to cut every-other bubble wand off. Works great, and saves on bubble solution, too.  3) The bottle is designed to use a special cap (included) and sit upside down in the holder tray. The cap doesn't always work, so I just pour some of the juice into the tray and refill it every five minutes or so.  4) The unit corrodes and breaks. The wires between the batteries, switch and fan fail. To prolong it's life, you have to clean it after use (bubble solution is corrosive) and keep it out of the rain.	1
My Grand kids LOVE this.  I have also given this as a gift because it's so much fun!  I like that it uses batteries because we can take it with us to the park, etc.  Fun!	1
Love this bubble machine!  It makes tons and tons of beautiful, colorful bubbles! My only complaint is the bottle of bubbles should somehow screw on, or clamp down. The kids kept grabbing it and knocking it off (and spilling). Otherwise, this is a fun, fun item!	1
We have an older model of this exact machine that works PHENOMENALLY WELL! I actually wanted to buy another one just like it so we could have a backup or to use at parties, but couldn't find one at the end of the season last year. This year, they are back, but it is awful. It now tilts back a bit which with the weight of the machine inside, makes it tip over backwards, spilling the bubble solution (which as you know, is expensive, but works great). Secondly, it now has little tripod feet on it instead of a solid circular base which the old model had, so it vibrates and "walks" off of the ledge or whatever you have it sitting on...probably the bad design of weight distribution also has something to do with this. Third, it now has a teeny, tiny reservoir which doesn't last very long and you have to monitor it to keep filling it so it doesn't run out. The old model allowed you to put the bottle upside down for constant flow for at least 15-30 minutes of play time. I loved this feature because I would turn on the bubbles, go cook dinner and my kids were entertained without much maintenance. Oh, and the wands stopped turning within the first 2 minutes of use. I'm taking this model back to Costco where we purchased it. I am soooo terribly disappointed that they changed the design of this bubble machine because I thought the original was the coolest gadget on Earth and had recommended it to everyone I know. It has brought my two boys so much fun, enjoyment and laughter. (ages 5 & 2) I was checking Amazon to see if it was the same awful model as Costco sold because I wanted to buy a couple for birthday gifts. I won't be buying this one.	-1
This does produce a ton of bubbles but it does cost a lot for extra bubbles.  Also, the battery cover took me forever to take off.  Screws were on way too tight.  But it is a fun toy.	1
I just purchased one at the local supermarket, figuring that the price was right even if it didn't work well. I installed batteries, poured in the solution and switched it on.  And I was pleasantly surprised as the room almost immediately filled with bubbles!  My 6 month old puppy was as delighted as I was and immediately began snapping at bubbles and having a wonderful time. I'm going to order extra solution and let my young nieces play with it when they come to visit this summer.  The solution runs out quickly, but that is my only complaint.  It is wonderful fun and would make an excellent addition to any party!	1
Bought this bubble machine for my kids for Easter. Got it out for a test drive. Runs very well and smoothly. Pushes out tons of bubbles. Doesnt use alot of the solution to run like other bubble machines, bought in the past.:) Love it and sure my kids will love it.	1
---- PROS ----  * This thing kicks out a lot of bubbles. I don't think we were getting 4000 a minute, but there were definitely a lot of bubbles.  * It was cheap enough at Walmart that even if it stops working after a handful of times, we still got our money's worth out of it.  ---- CONS ----  * You will blow through the included bubbles (I'd call it a "sample" size) in about 10 minutes.  * Unfortunately, you really do need to use Gazillion Bubbles to get the best results. After we ran out, I tested my own homemade version and Miracle Bubbles and this is my ranking:  BEST: Gazillion Bubbles OKAY: Miracle Bubbles POOR: Homemade bubbles  * It feels and looks super cheaply made (but what can you expect for a ten spot?).  * It sits at an angle so in order for it to work on grass (without spilling) you need to set it on a flat surface (we used an upside down cake pan).  ---- OVERALL ----  Definitely worth the price for a few hours of bubble fun. I haven't yet had any issues with the battery compartment getting wet so YMMV on that (and I'll edit if I discover any issues).  EDITED 4/4/12: The machine just up and died (less than two weeks after we bought it). I had just put new batteries in and it was working like a champ...had it on for probably 20 minutes. Went to use it the next day and it was totally dead. Tried new batteries and nothing. Of course, I had just tossed the receipt so I didn't try to exchange it. Lesson learned...KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. So I am lowering my review from three stars to two stars and I also lowered the durability rating to one star.	-1
This toy was a bit hit! I actually bought one in a local superstore, and ended up giving away to my nieces and nephew, so I bought another one online. Both my own kids and my brother's kids really enjoyed playing with this toy.  It does use a lot of batteries, but seems to make them last quite a while. We haven't had any problems with it leaking or malfunctioning at all. We did overfill it once, and it didn't spin well, so be careful not to do that. It produces a TON of bubbles in a continuous spray, and it's great for use outside, or even inside! We used it in the bathroom while the kids were taking a bath and they loved it! I just aimed it toward the tub and they were showered with bubbles!  We've only used the Gazillion Bubbles formula with the machine, since that's what most reviewers have said works best. We bought a big bottle of it from Amazon (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Funrise-Gazillion-Bubble-64-oz-Solution/dp/B0009V89IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Funrise Gazillion Bubble 64 oz. Solution</a>) and so far, so good! I would highly recommend this for those bubble-lovers out there!	1
My little girl absolutely LOVES bubbles. She can play with bubbles for hours, but as a toddler, she's not great at blowing them herself. So of course Mom gets that job! Every time, after a short while, I would get light-headed & dizzy from all the blowing. So we got this, and it has been a life (or breath?) saver!! It's works very well and produces lots of bubbles. We've enjoyed this so much. It doesn't take very long to go through a bottle of bubbles, but the cheap ones work just as well in this machine. This would be fun for parties too, but it's perfect for any parents that can't blow bubbles as long as your child would like you to!	1
I posted this in a review a while back for one of the Gazillion bubble machines, figured it might be helpful here. These toys are so much fun until you are out of bubble solution. I went looking for refills and couldn't find any - you need Gazillion GOLD bubbles by the way because you are trying to make big bubbles, regular bubble stuff will not work. I could not find a refill anywhere - lots of places sold the bubblator we had, none sold refills. Grrr.  So I did some research and experimenting and came up with this replacement. Buy a big container of regular bubble stuff (I got a 100oz Miracle Bubbles) and a 4oz bottle of Glycerin (available in the soap / skin care section of drugs stores - but not all of them (Walgreens did not have it, I found mine in CVS, little plain brown bottle  Dump the entire bottle of glycerin into the Miracle Bubbles. Mix gently (don't shake vigorously). Do this a day or two in advance of using for best results (the glycerin needs to age a little) - however I did use it right away and did pretty well. Voila - 100oz of replacement bubbles for cheap rather than one tiny little bottle. Enjoy!  I haven't tested this in this product specifically, but it worked great in the Gazillion Bubblator we own.	1
I bought 2 of the Gazillion Bubble Machine's for a party and we ended up only needing one of them, because I think one really did make a gazillion bubbles.	1
This thing is AWESOME!!!  I can't believe how many bubbles this tiny machine can make!  You fill the little bubble bottle, tip it upside down on the little bottle holder on the machine, turn it on, and voila!  Gazillion bubbles indeed!  It's nice that it's so small, too.  You do have to keep it on a flat surface, or you'll spill bubble fluid all over the place, but other than that, there's nothing to it!  You can find bubbles at Toys'R'Us, Target, Walmart, and of course, Amazon!	1
This bubble machine is perfect! Not too big, not too small. I use the Funrise Gazillion Bubble 64 oz and I hate yet to run out of battery. I'm ordering another bottle of bubbles today. I've purchased other bubbles machines and they did not release 1/4 of the bubbles that this machine does. If you're looking for a bubble machine, look no more. Oh! But use it outside. Too many bubbles for indoors! And the higher you put the machine, the higher the bubbles go. This machine has been a life saver when my 4 1/2 month old son gets a little fussy. We set up the machine in the backyard and relax. Pretty entertaining if you have a dog too!  I would suggest this bubble machine for parties, babies, or just for fun!	1
Sorry about the pun!  We have had this product since May of 2007 and it sees a fair amount of use with three boys under 5.  Simply put, we love this bubble machine!  It is a very well thought out product that is of high quality and has put up with a significant amount of abuse over the past 4+ years not only from our three children, but from hundreds of children that are drawn to it like zombies to brains.  This machine has been knocked over, hit, bumped, dropped, kicked, pulled, pushed and fought over like it like it was the most prized possession on the face of this planet... all while suffering not so much as a scratch.  While I do absolutely love this bubble machine, there are two areas that I would upgrade/change if given the chance.  First of all, I would make the base slightly larger as the unit becomes top heavy on one side when you put the bottle full of liquid bubbles into the holder.  When this happens the machine is more apt to fall over... especially when the kids get a little grabby.  The second thing that I would change is a redo of the connection between the bottle and the unit itself.  While it doesn't leak it is easy for the kids to knock it off of the machine.  A simple screw in thread on the holder's receptacle would work nicely to help eliminate this problem.	1
We were given this bubble machine for my son's 2nd birthday last summer.  We accidentally left it on the back porch and it was rained on.  Needless to say...it did not withstand a rain storm.  So, I came on amazon and ordered this same product!  I was SOOO thankful they sold it! We always bring in the machine now when we are done. They do sell this brand at Target but not this actual model.  I prefer this model over the others.  This bubble machine produces the BEST bubbles and the MOST. I've had and seen other kinds of machines and they don't come close to comparing to the Gazillion one.  I HIGHLY recommend this for any young child who loves bubbles.  It's the ultimate bubble machine!  Beware though, you will want to purchase more Gazillion bubble refills for this machine.  We tried cheap bubble liquids at Target and they didn't go a quarter the distance or get as big.  Target stores do sell Gazillion bubble refills for much cheaper than Amazon. I'm SOLD on Gazillion bubble machines and refills!	1
The machine stopped working only after a few weeks. The little bottle falls over and the sticky liquid spills all over making the use of it very messy and sticky. Sometimes the machine would work and sometimes it wouldn't so each time i had to change 12 batteries or so just to see if it's the batteries or something else. i would not recommend this to anyone.	-1
I read the reviews on this bubble machine before I bought it and still bought it.  I shouldn't have.  It does make TONS of bubbles (all are the same size (about an inch and a half),) but the bubble solution only lasted 5 minutes.  I was going to order more online, but it's too expensive.  I only used it once and for 5 minutes!!  =(	-1
My 11 year old got this as a birthday gift for my 5 year old son - we didn't konw if he would have interest in such a toy - but since he has always enjoyed bubbles it was worth a try.  Turns out that this machine is out at least twice a week for some fun in the sun bubble chasing fun, running or biking through walls of bubbles, watching air flow down the driveway...or just plain ol' lazy bubble watching.  He likes breaking it out when friends come over.  It seems durable enough given my son's 5 year old carelessness and easy for him to operate and safe for carefree use - however, if I HAD to beef about this product I would say that the bubble solution spills far too easily from the machine - so steady hands are definately needed if they want to move the machine from one spot to the next. otherwise bubble solution is everywhere (at quite a cost).  Batteries have lasted long and refilling the bubble solution is easy and mostly mess free.  All around - an interesting toy which is well liked and enjoyed by the entire family - go figure.	1
We bought this last summer and it worked for 2 days and then it would not work no matter what we did. I did clean it after using it both times and I checked the batteries, but it just would not work. Like I said in the title my son loved it for the 2 days that it worked, but it just didn't work long enough. If you're looking for a good bubble machine that you'd like to use more than twice I'd look elsewhere.	-1
My son got this for his birthday.  He used it once, and somehow bubbles got into the inner mechanisms and it stopped working.  Even after removing the batteries and letting it dry out, no dice.  Not sure if there was a leak in the bubble dispenser, or it was just poorly made, but my son only got one use out of it.	-1
It was fun while it lasted, but I hate how poorly toys are put together these days. What happened to well-constructed American toys?  For one thing, it eats up WAY too many batteries. They should make it run on a 9V one instead. All those AAs cost money! And then after a couple months it just stopped working altogether. My husband tried to open it up and fix it and could only get it running again by wrapping the whole thing up in black electrical tape. Everytime it stopped working my toddler son and I had to jiggle it just right for something to connect right again. Frustration, frustration. We give up on ever getting one of these again!	-1
We first bought the Bubble Generator from Target, which only worked about a minute before breaking. So we were hesitant to try another machine, especially one in the same price range. But this machine is GREAT!! It works VERY well, it's a good value for the price, and it entertains my kids for a VERY long time. We are even planning on using it for my daughter's 5th birthday party. I would recomment this product to friends with confidence.	1
Great fun to begin with, tons and tons of bubbles.  Unfortunately we haven't had one live more than a week or so - we don't overfill it, we clean it with each use, we store it indoors, we replace the batteries to verify that isn't the issue, etc.  They simply aren't durable.	-1
Makes more bubbles than I've ever seen from another brand. The wand is also designed well. Has a lot of different sized holes.	1
The bubble formula is great.  As a warning, the product description and photo do not match what is sold.  The title says "refill", the photos show a wand, and the item description states: "Seven holed wand creates multiple bubbles."  Be warned if you want a small bottle with a wand, you might not get one.	-1
These bubbles were awesome and worked wonderful in the matching bubble machine, but I gave it 4 stars because of the price. Kind of pricey for the amount and it only lasted for about an hour in the machine.	1
I won't every buy any other bubbles, these are the best!!!!  I use them in the bubble machine and just to blow a few bubbles for laughs with my little guy and these are perfect everytime, I have tried some cheapy bubbles that only caused frustration and a mommy about to pass out trying to get just 1 bubble for a very frustrated toddler...........no more, we only buy these now, they are the sure thing.	1
these are not cheap but well worth the extra money as the bubbles they produce are sturdy and fun to play with. No disappointments here.	1
Be prepared to pay a little more for this bubble refill but it is WELL WORTH IT!!!!  We have tried several different kinds and this brand has the very best.  LOVE it!	1
My son has had this toy now for 2yrs so ours has held up quite well!  Although on occasion it goes off when it's not supposed to and doesn't go off when it IS supposed to, I'd say it works like my kids intend it to about 80% of the time which for a cool kid's toy at this price, I'm not complaining at all.  UNFORTUNATELY for me, the battery in it lasts and lasts and lasts...they've 'lost' it at the bottom of toy bins, their dresser drawers, under the bed then find it again and it works like a charm.  UNFORTUNATELY for me, I find it annoying when I'm on the phone say...with a client and I'm running downstairs for a drink of water or to answer the door and this thing goes off beeping like crazy when I've walked in it's path then my kids break out in hysterics but I knew what 'trouble' this thing would be when I bought it, right?  It's proved a great toy when the boys set it up in the kitchen near the cookie box so Daddy doesn't swipe all of their cookies or when big brother sets it up near his doorway so younger brother doesn't enter in his room undetected.  They've received quite a few of the Wild Planet Spy toys throughout the years and this one is one of their most played with - even 2yrs later! I think this would be a great gift alone - say as a stocking stuffer, grab bag alone OR is even better if purchased as a set with the Spy belt.  Although some of the Wild Planet toys haven't held up or worked quite well in the past, we're still big fans of their toys, this one is a winner.	1
This is a stand alone miniature motion detector with an audible alarm. Easy to hide, it lays under furniture, at corners, in drawers, facing doors, wherever you need advance warning that the other spies are coming. More affordable than the "Spy Tracker" system from Spy Gear, which uses three detectors with antenna to map out where your enemy is.  Very easy for kids to operate, the battery lasts a long time, and most importantly, IT WORKS! The biggest complaint about some of the toys sold in the Spy Gear line is that so many of them do not work, so always read reviews or lists first. The gadget has a cool look to it, a little silver dome that is hidden pretty easily and detects movement from up to 20 feet. It has a tiny LED light that lets you know when it's on.  Very fun and affordable toy, kids have fun for hours moving it all over the house and finding new ways to set it up.	1
I think it's perfect for children or adults for that matter.  But for kids in foster care, they can set it beside their stuff (books/toys) and if some one comes into the beam it will alert the owner that someone might be near their stuff.  I hope the foster adopted child our work bought gifts for Christmas will enjoy and use this.	1
I have a great time playing with this item.  But you should understand how it works to get the most out of it.  It is a light sensor.  When the light changes (a shadow falls over it) it rings.  This is why other reviewers said it went off when it should not, they walked in front of a light and cast a shadow.  This means it can not work without an external light. If you put a light directly across from it if the walk between the light and it it will go off, and it will have a large range.  If the light is behind it then, walking in front will not work.  If you want it to work in the dark, get an infer red light and place it in front of it  (should work), might try a laser pointer directly pointed at it and it should work.  half the fun is finding good configurations that work in minimal light.  it is also lite enough that you can loop some duck tape under it and hang it from walls or door jambs ect.	1
My mom bought me this toy a couple of years ago at a Discovery store in a mall. I was one of those kids who would rather have an electronic safe to put my money, then to put my money in a piggy bank. When she got it for me, I thought it was over-priced going at $40, now Amazon is selling it for a MUCH higher price (rip off!). I kept this mini ATM for a matter of years now because it became very useful to me and it actually was helpful of keeping track of my money and I accumlated a lot of wealth because of it. My dad encourage to open up a savings/checking account, but I refused because it would cost me money to store my money, stupid right? When I became a college student, all those fees went away, they actually gave me money just to open up an account, so I went ahead and did. haha  Pros:  -Great way to save money -Very useful to keep track of your spending -Doesn't draw a lot of battery power -Built very sturdy, so it's hard to break when dropped -Calculate coin drops -Mount to wall  Cons:  -Doesn't protect your money from other people, the case is very easy to crack open -The sound from this machine is loud and annoying, that's why I opened it up, so I can disable the noise myself -The machine is harder to open up then the case with the money, so it was HARD to disable the sound -The retail price for this product -No colorful LCD display, I mean for the price, come on! haha -Dorky name for the product and cheesy ways to call a VISA, MasterCard and American Express.  It's a great *toy* for your kids to know how to earn and save money. It'll teach him/her the value of a dollar, if you give them an allowence. I would say get this, so you kid can grow up to be more sucessful and instead of certain people who can't pay off their house bills.  I recommend this as a Christmas present.	1
We loved this when we first got it. Hard to keep up with the total it does not. U can't make deposits and withdrawals and it keep a total. Not good if you want to keep up with more than one account. I assumed my daughters could keep all the money in one bank and it keep a tally of who has what. Not the case. I guess I was wanting more out of this product than what it gave. Not worth it to me.	-1
I purchased this for my almost 6 year old.  He had no trouble figuring out how to use it and it works fairly well.  It has helped him grasp the meaning of saving money to work toward a goal.  It has also motivated him to want to save.  He recently started receiving a weekly allowance.  Now he is responsible for saving to buy toys that he wants.  It has elimiated the "MOM, can I have this?" everytime we are out.  After I told him a few times "Do you have money for it?  Do you want to spend your money on it?" the begging has nearly disappeared!  Highly recommended.  The only negatives I've found are:  1) The dollar bill intake does not always work - it can be circumvented by opening the safe and making a manual deposit  2) Sometimes when depositing coins, if the coin doesn't go in the slot on the first try, the bank will still register a deposit.  This will throw the total off.  Again, a manual adjustment can be made (but only if you are aware that there was a problem in the first place).	1
I bought one of these in 2004. We had a problem with the hose that brings the water to the top, but it has since been redesigned. The company replaced ours with the newer version. We used it about 10 times last summer and put it away after each use. This summer it was such a hit that we just left it out. It was used almost every day,and was inflated for 1-2 hours a day. Its still in perfect working condition. I don't have a single complaint!  My son is only 50 lbs and he plays on this with 220 lb daddy so it holds a lot of weight.	1
On Sunday, June 4, 2006 in the evening my [...] niece and her friend were sliding down the Banzai Falls Slide when the bumper stop at the end of the pool area snapped loosed and she went flying in the air and landed on the ground so hard that it shattered her left forearm. Today Thursday, June 8, 2006 she has to have surgery to have a plate put in her arm. This is NOT FAIR for an [...] child or any child to go through just for a NO GOOD PIECE OF JUNK SLIDE.	-1
We just bought this toy last weekend.  As soon as we saw it my husband wanted it for all the kids (six girls ages 2-16).  We were disappointed to find WalMart was out of the double slide one that takes 400lbs, but bought this one since it was the last one on the shelf.  Everything it advertised was as it should be: all the parts, quick set up and sturdy.  After no less than 6 hours of continuous fun for our girls and about 6 or 8 additional neighbor kids that showed up, we had to call it a day.  Clean up was a little longer, but then we waited for it to dry after my husband hosed it off. The only thing we did not count on was the amount of distruction that occurs with the lawn, from the combination of running and water, around the outside of the slide.  We moved it once during the day and probably should have done so another time or two.  It is very easy to move.  The instructions say no extension cords, but we had to use one (an outdoor heavy duty one) so we kept it suspended off the ground.  Additionally, it says to keep the motor from direct sun light for long periods of time so we put a side table over it which worked great.  You do need a hose that will reach your set up and continuous water of course.  Overall, we love it and can't wait until Sunday when we set it up again...however, we still wish we had bought the bigger one with two lanes for the additional $100.	1
This super fun and cool slide has made my kids the envy of the neighborhood I bought it for my 3 kids ages 3,4and 10 and I also use it as a treat for the daycare kids on hot days the only problem we had was when we first set it up the tube that you attach to the hose burst the very first time we tried to use it but since I bought it for my sons birthday party I didn't return it and decided to just keep the hose on low in the pool area no big deal the fun and excersize alone was worth every cent I even get up there and slide down the kids love this and I love that they would rather play on this than their playstation...	1
My 10 month old loves this toy.  He has played with it for several months now.  Every time he pulls a star off it triggers a little song so it keeps his attention.  He has even learned how to press the button to make the sound without using the stars (fine motor skills).  I'm sure he'll be playing with this toy for months to come.  For the price, this is a worthwhile purchase.	1
This has been a great toy and we still have it 4 years later for my youngest.	1
super	1
Love it	1
A fantastic addition to my therapeutic  toy box.	1
I like this toy. My baby loved the lights and sounds. As others have pointed out, you do not have to put the rings on in order. That was sort of a bummer but overall it is a great toy!	1
excelent	1
Excelent product	1
How can you go wrong with an item like this Great sounds fun lights no small pieces Easy to clean up and doesn't look sloppy when not being used A must for all children	1
My son only being 1 still doesn't quite understand this toy but I love it! It's very bright and cute. It's works great.	1
Perennial favorite among all my grandchildren. It teaches shapes, colors and different ways to place the rings on the post.	1
This is a nice toy.. it lights up and makes a nice sound every time you put on one of the stars or take them off.. the light keeps them busy and they really play with this one. It well made and still after a year it lights up and looks brand new. Great product.	1
I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 4 months old. It is the cutest stacker set I have ever seen!  Each star is colored but transparent so that when placed on the base, the bright shimmering lights cause each star "ring" to light up and plays a magical little tune. Once all stars are placed on top it performs a short musical and light up show.  This was one of my favorites out of all her 'infant & toddler' aged toys. We just retired it,finally, by sending it to her day care for others to enjoy. This is a very durable infant toy, and out of the 2 year she played with it, we never did have to replace the batteries. They hold up very well.	1
This was a Christmas gift for my great granddaughter.  I think it will be fine and work just fine. It looked just as advertised.	1
Bought this toy for my little one & it's really nice. It lights up & makes music. It's also well made, it seems delicate but my boy has thrown down this countless times and it didn't shatter. Would definitely recommend.	1
Love this toy. The lights, colors and music make this so much fun for little ones. I bought this for my now 8 year old and got another one for my second child. We love this sweet little toy.	1
Great toy for little ones. Lights up and make sounds. Construction is well built and although it may drive parents nuts with the sounds, it keeps children entertained.	1
my baby probably just wasn't inclined to using it when i got it for her - she was about 5 months at the time, and the lights and music are great! she would bore easily of it though. perhaps i should bring it back out now that she's older, at 15 months..... hmmm... will update my review :)	1
We bought this for a little boy and ended up playing with it a couple times as it sat on our dresser, waiting for his birthday.  I knew we had to get one for our little girl for Christmas.  She's going to love it!	1
My daughter loves the lights and music.  She plays with all of the rings also, even before she could really use the stacker.  I would recommend.	1
This toy is very stimulating. It lights up and has music.  I have had success using this toy for children with autism to engage them.	1
This is one of those toys that everyone wants to play with.  There is something satisfying about stacking the rings up correctly.	1
My 1yr old grandson loves this thing!!!!  Of all the toys he received at his birthday party, this was the toy he kept going back to. With each star he put on the post he was rewarded with music and lights. Would purchase this again.	1
although this toy seems very neat, makes sounds, is colorful, etc, my 8 month old daughter just has never really been that interested in it.	1
Stacker looks great and colourful. Hope my little one would like it. Will let my baby play with it when he is older.	1
Bought this for my 6 month old grandson.  He still occasionally plays with it at 15 months old.  He initially loved the sound and color.  It does seem to assist with hand/eye coordination.  Extremely durable, safe to play with and kids seem to love taking things apart.	1
I didn't imagine that it's so nice. It's funny to play with it, it looks like Christmas tree. Nice melodies and colors. I love it!  Thank you!	1
My Grandson loves the bright lights and music when you put the stars on the stacker. It is well made and fun!	1
This stacker has been a favorite with the bright flashing lights and bright colors. It travels well and is a much loved toy.	1
Our special-needs granddaughter is fascinated by lights and sound and she LOVES this!  It has encouraged her reaching and manipulation and she's even able to get the stars on and off the ring!  The sound is pleasant (you'll be able to live with it for a long time, I promise!) and if it ever wears out, I'm buying another one immediately!	1
Fun stacker with lots of music and fun. 7 months baby from Singapore love it. Fisher price die hard fan.	1
The toy itself is a very good stacker. My kid loves the music and buttons. Definitely an upgrade from the classic stacker.  Here's the downside. We purchased this toy new about 6 months ago. Even though the toy has never been submerged or exposed to water (other than drool), it is growing mold on the insides. I plan on contacting Fisher-Price after I finish this review, so hopefully they will take care of the issue. Just want to let other parents beware to keep an eye out for it. I'll attached an image of the mold in the customer images above.  Update 1: After speaking with Fisher-Price, they are going to send us a new one. They were very easy to work with which was such a nice change from some of the other toy vendors out there. (I adjusted the star rating up 2 stars for the company taking care of the issue promptly and while treating me kindly.	1
I bought this stacker for my son around 12 months when he could only tip it over to get the stars off, but was thoroughly entertained when we stacked the stars for him and played the music. After 4 months of heavy play, he's mastered star removal and stacking, and pushing both buttons. He still loves this toy and we've only had to change the batteries once.	1
My 6 month old really enjoys this. It's really cute and I love the way it lights up. I would recommend it.	1
The baby really liked to play with this stacking toy, and the sounds are an added bonus in my opinion.	1
I got this for my brother's little boy, and my brother won't pick up the phone so I can ask him how the baby likes the toy. My mom lives close by, and says it was really cute, and got there fast.	1
I have the classic stacker with the rings that don't light up or do anything, and my daughter was just not interested.  She's 6 months old and not really stacking yet, but the classic ring stacker wasn't even interesting enough for her to try.  This toy keeps her engaged so she interacts more with it, which leads to her learning through trial and error that the rings do stack.  She's already stopped what she was doing a few times as she got a ring on, to inspect what happened - with sudden fascination.  Overall, just a much better choice than the classic ring stacker.  I know that lights/music are sometimes seen as detracting from a classic toy, but in my opinion, this helped engage her.	1
as advertised, good play value, my grandson loved it as a christmas present...you won't be disappointd with the purchae of this product	1
my daughter loves this toy! she loves how it sings and lights up and she loves to stack the stars!	1
Just a great toy! Music and Lights so amazing in this stacker! Love it! My son got this for his 6 months. And he still likes to play with it (he is almost 3)!	1
I even like playing with this toy and I'm a grandma!!! Both my toddler granddaughter and infant granddaughter love this toy! As you take off the stars it makes pretty music and the lights flash. Same thing when taking the stars off. When you place the top star on it plays more music!!! Such a pretty toy and a delight to play with!!!  I wholly recommend!	1
My child enjoys it. He is a pro now. Good toy to invest. Helps on their motor skills. He loves this toy	1
My lo likes this...she is not quite old enough for it yet but she enjoys the lights and the music so far!!!	1
This was the second time I've ordered this stacker for a baby gift.  Both of the little ones it was ordered for loved it (ages 5 months and 9 months).	1
I love this toy and so does my grandson.  It's brightly colored, it lights up when the stars are put on, it makes sounds...everything a kid loves...AND he's learning about shapes, colors and dexterity in the process.	1
Yay for this purchase!!! It is very cool!!! I would recommend for any mom!!! Its so much better than the boring circles!!!	1
Think these are best out there by far, had this for our first 2 kids and when added a new addition to family quickly bough a new one, colorful and has music to get child's attention	1
Good buy for the money	1
This is the forth stacker we have bought at our house and by far the best! My baby loves that it lights up and makes noise. She is now 8 months old and it can keep her attention for longer than anything as she takes the rings off and tries to put them back on over and over again. I would definitely recommend! Probably the best baby toy for the price that I have found!	1
I have a petite 7 month old granddaughter who loves music and this turned out to be the ideal gift for her.  From the first time she saw it, she loved it.  I had read that some people felt that it was too hard for their babies to activate the music, so I was a little concerned, but the other positive reviews made me give it a chance anyway.  I am so glad I did.  Although she is not really all that coordinated yet, she is able to make it play music by spinning the stars, and by partially taking them off.  I am sure it will get lots of playtime as she continues to develop.  It is solidly made and the music is pleasant and fairly low volume, so I don't think it will become tiresome to the adults in her life.  Score one for Grandma and Grandpa!	1
`My son absolutely loves this! I love this! I love the cute songs and he loves the songs to. He plays them over and over and over.....lol	1
It's your standard stacking toy with a few upgrades! It has mesmerizing lights and music that isn't too annoying for parents. I like that it makes a rewarding little jingle every time a ring goes on or off and play a song when you push the button or put the star on the top.	1
What I love about the original stacker is that the child has to put the rings on in the correct order for them to properly fit. With this electronic one, it doesn't matter which ring goes on first - the rings slide all the way to the bottom lights and music will go off. I was looking for a toy that would help teach my child about size/proportion and problem solving. This version quickly went into the get rid of pile and I bought the original stacker, which my son loves!	-1
I originally received this toy as a gift for my first daughter and it was so much fun. It makes a great gift and I have happily bought it for my nephew.	1
My 11 month old loved it.  But it is the first sound making toy of the about thirty we own that stopped working.  And we only just got it a month a half ago and the return window is closed.  Not happy.	-1
My 6 month old was scared of this toy at first.  When the lights would flash and the music would play, He would start to do the pouty lip thing babies do, and then he bursted into tears. Then when I picked him up he keep looking back and toy and continue to cry so i had to actual remove the toy from his sight. LOL. But after about 5 days he warmed up to it. Now he likes knocking it over and biting on the rings.  Keeps him entertained. Im happy with it.	1
My 6 month old daughter loves this toy!  The star shapes are easy to grasp and the toy "twinkles" and plays a sweet sound every time a star is removed or placed on the stack.  The star on top is a little wobbly but actually makes it easy for her to remove.  When you push the top it plays a song which brings a huge smile to her face everytime she hears it.  It plays nice classical music at a perfect volume.  This is a great variation on the typical ring stacker!	1
My daughter LOVES this toy. She has figured out the buttons mean music. She stacks and removes, stacks and removes... now, repeat that for a few minutes.	1
My daughter almost 1 enjoyed this toy, but it stopped working and it was not rough handled.  I like the concept, but it simply is not well made.  The lights and sound no longer work and my return window is closed.	-1
My 5-month-old ignored this toy when she initially received it, but once she figured out what she was supposed to do with it, she couldn't leave it alone. It's been 2 months and it is still a favorite. At first it was used as a boxing bag to activate the music and lights. The fact that it stood up to that violence says a lot of its durability! The baby has adeptly removed the stars for about a month now (replacing them is only fluke occurrences). The wobble base is very clever, because it often rolls back to its correct position when it would otherwise have fallen over. It's such a pretty toy, both visually and aurally, and it still doesn't drive me nuts, even when played with for a long time, which is more than can be said of most of the battery-operated toys. Obviously, it can't be submerged for proper cleaning, but it's easy enough to wipe down for a superficial clean.	1
I ordered this for my son who was about 8 months old at the time and he really didn't take much interest in it. He would look at it if I made it light up but other than that he didn't know what to do with it. Now my son is a year old and he plays with it much more now. He doesn't try to stack the stars yet but he loves how it lights up and enjoys the music and noises that it makes. It's very easy to keep clean and I think it's great. It is also easy to put away and I have not had to change the batteries yet.	1
This is a super cute toy! babies love the music and lights! My nephew was the first to have one of these and it got handed down to my 1st son who absolutely loved it too! now 5yrs later I just bought it again for the newest addition to our family! I know he'll love it!	1
This was a gift from a grandparent before our baby was born. Our child loves it, and has since she was just a few months old. I would press the button for the music and she would watch the stacker light up and play music. Now she can play with it on her own, and even though she doesn't always get the stars on in the right order, she still has lots of fun. I think this toy is durable (it has survived multiple drops out of the playpen!) I also like that it plays classical songs and not just nursery songs, it doesn't get quite as irritating that way. Its also a nice volume, not too loud.	1
Our son got 2 of these for Christmas, we gave him one and left the other in the box.  One of our guest liked it so much she ended up buying the other one off us.  If you want a ring stacking toy this is a solid choice.	1
My son had this toy when he was a baby almost 10 years ago, and it was one of his very favorite toys.  So, I had to buy it for my daughter, too, hoping she would like it just as much and that the toy had remained the same.  To my surprise and happiness, it was a yes on both counts!  The clear, bright jewel colors of the rings on this stacker mixed with the blinking lights make this toy colorful and sparkly and a delight for my child, and for me.  The rings have different textures for sensory stimulation which is another plus.  When you stack the rings on the post the post lights up and songs play.  You can also make the songs play by pushing a small button on the top of the stacker where the star head sits.  The star goes on top and you can push it up and down for music and lights, or leave it off and push the button by itself.  The only thing I don't like about this toy is that the star doesn't sit on top very well, it is wobbly and falls right off most of the time.  But, the music is upbeat and not annoying to me at all, which in many toys is a rarity, and it means my child can play it over and over and over again without giving me a headache!  The base is not flat, it is curved so the toy can rock back and forth on a hard surface.  I also like to buy this toy as a gift because I have never seen a baby that doesn't enjoy it.	1
had one 9 yrs ago and just like that one this ones great to.  lights up plays music bright colors kids love it. the star doesn't stay on very well but still would buy again.	1
I bought this for my 1 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. He loves toys that light up and this one definitely does. The toy lights up each time the child slides a star ring onto the post. Then when all the star rings are stacked, the top star lights up the whole toy and plays a song. It is a very colorful interactive toy that rewards the child with lights & sound each time they succeed in stacking the rings.	1
We received this toy has a hand me down from a friend for our upcoming baby and brought it out one night while babysitting our 9 month old nephew.  And he LOVES it!  The lights and the music kept his attention and even if he got distracted by another toy for a few minutes he would keep going back to it.  I noticed one person said the rings were hard to put on and off... and I don't see that.  He has about as much difficulty as a typical 9 month old would putting stackable rings on something.  And the noise isn't so loud that it is too annoying for the adults in the room either!  A definite plus!	1
We found this toy at a yard sale last summer and my twins have loved it!  It was missing the little star on top, but was still one of their favorite toys.  We were able to pick up a complete one at another sale a few weeks ago.  Now I have two and they still work great even though they were probably well loved by the children who bought them new.  The lights are mesmerizing for toddlers and the music is great.  Awesome purchase for babies through toddler stage (19 months and still a hit!)	1
We bought this for our 9 month old son over the old fashioned one that doesn't light up. Our son loves blinking lights! He took the star off the top of the toy right away and STILL walks around with it. He loves toys with faces, so this little top star made his day..... even at 1 year old he still loves it, gums and chews on it all day long lol  He likes to take all the stars off and chew on the buttons on the top of the yellow base. His drool got inside the toy and made the whole thing glitch. It now goes off when it feels like it. We had to stick it in the back of the house and laughed while it ghost played musical sounds in the kitchen. If we shake it, we can get it to stop so we haven't taken the batteries out yet but right now it's pretty much useless unless we do take the batteries out as it will just keep playing lol  All in all though? Our son plays with the top star. Plays with all the star rings - carrying them all over. I'm betting if we take the batteries out, he would still chew on the base and this model is still far more cuter than the original plain one. It's a great toy and we joked for a week that we paid 15$ for the top star haha  I would just ask the manufacturer to make it drool proof next time ;)  AND HOPE THAT SOMEONE MAKES MORE LIGHT UP TOYS my son really loves them and they are hard to find for young kids! Come on!	1
i'm a "wooden toy" type of girl, but my parents got this for my baby and he LOVES it and now so do i. it has two buttons that trigger sound, one on the side and one on the top. the one on the side sticks out just far enough that when a star is put on or pulled off, it triggers it and a little *frrriiing* and the lights go off in succession in one direction, which is awesome because it's a great reward for the baby. teaches cause and effect. i'm guessing the people who said it's not letting them actually stack the stars is because the button sticks out too far, just put a little tape on it, or send it back because it's definitely defective, it shouldn't be like that. the top button is triggered only when the star is put on, and then a little musical ditty plays and the lights on the side go all crazy. it's cute. my 8 month old just learned how to press the top button and it's fun to see that he can get the music to play. NOTE: if you want the song to stop playing, just press the side button and the "fring" sound interrupts it.	1
We put this toy next to the changing table. When we would change my son as young as a week old, we would set it off.  He would stop squirming and look for this toy everytime he was changed.  He loved the lights and music. Now that he is older he loves playing with the stars.  The only downside is that the stars are pretty hard. So for the six month old that likes to bang things on their heads, it can be a bit too hard.	1
We got this for my son when he was 9 months.  Up until recently (he is now 16 months), he was not able to take the stars off or put them back on by himself - he did however figure out that pushing the buttom at the top makes music and lights.  He still has some difficulty getting the stars off due to the button on the side and occasionally requires my help.  He will sit for quit some time and play with this, which is really nice.  He will also hit the music button, dance around, hit the button again, dance around.  The stars also came in handy as an instant teether!  Overall, I recommend getting this product for your little one - they will have loads of fun with it for a very long time; and, you really can't beat the price!	1
One of two favorite toys at our house.  Our baby has loved it for a couple of months now.  And he appears to be even just triggering the music and then playing with something else, almost as if he just enjoys it as background music?  Either way, he plays with this daily, whether it's taking off or putting on the stars, or just listening to the music, it's a big hit.  Durable too, ours was a hand me down used by 3 other kids and still plays like it's brand new.  Highly recommended.	1
I bought this for my 3 1/2 mo old grandson. At this time I am stacking and making the music and flashing action but it is entertaining and amusing to him. Everybody has a stacker as a child. This stacker is fun to hear and fun in the dark, too. I go for the lights and music just to see his face light up and eyes grow wide. If it were to break, we would still have a stacker.	1
When you stack a star, it has to go past a button at the very top which makes the tower light up signifying to the baby that they did something right. Not such a bad idea. EXCEPT that the child can't just put the star over the top and let it slide down the rest of the way. The button is too stiff. The child has to get the star on the tower, and then PUSH it past the button, which is very difficult for a 1 year old to do! Despite the fact that we got this at the recommended age of 6 months old, and he loved the lights when we got it, and he quickly figured out that all he had to do to make it light up was push the little button with his fingure, never mind those annoying stars! So now he is 1.5 years old and it is dead because for the last year he has just pushed the button over and over and over and over with his finger. And its not that he's not smart enough to stack, we have since bought other stackers with which he has no problem, but he has no motivation to stack with this one because the button is annoying to slide past and the 'rewarding lights and sounds' are easily received by pushing the button with your finger. Fun idea, waste of money.	-1
I was very excited to receive this toy because it looks like so much fun on the picture.  However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the product.  I would recommend spending your money on something else.  Honestly, I rate almost everything a five star because others on amazon have made great recommendations but this product didn't work out.	-1
I was looking all over for this toy and was thankful to find it on Amazon!!  This is a great toy for infant/toddlers.  The lights and magical music entice children to explore and play.  This is a classic in our family.	1
This was our son's favorite toy.  The music, lights and sounds were so enthralling that it was hard to get him to stop playing with it - for several years!  He's older now and we're packing up the favorite baby/toddler toys to pass down to the next generation.  This one is definitely a keeper.	1
We have now seen both this and its predecessor in action, and it's fantastic. (Incidentally, the predecessor is alive and well at a friend's house, where multiple grandchildren have played with it.)  Son #1 loved it, it's currently in son #2's room waiting for him to grow a bit more coordinated so that he can stack the stars, too.	1
This was a gift for our son.  He doesn't care so much about the stacking rings but loves hitting the top bottom to make the song play.  Because of the side button (that chimes when a ring goes on or off) it can be more difficult to get the rings on and off.  The top light has also burnt out on the toy and there is no way to replace them.	1
This is a great toy, we bought it for my daughter when she was 8 months old and she played with it every day until she was about 18 months.  She loved making the light and music go off and never tired of playing with it.  This was a great buy!!	1
This is a favorite of my daughters.  She is 19 months and has loved it since we got it for her at 9months.  The lights and sounds are awesome!  We like to have a light show in the dark in her room when we push the top button.  The only problem I would say is, if any of the pieces end up submerged in water, you'll never get it out.  My pink star sticks on mine too.  Its hard to get on and off.  I need to help her with that one each time. This is a great updated version of the classic plastic ring stacker.	1
My daughter has had this toy from about 3 months. At first it was all about the visual experience; the colors, the sounds, the cause and effect of the button being pushed and the lights running up and down. Then, my daughter began with her fine motor skills. This was a great toy because the stars aren't too small/large or slippery. The raised lines and dots on them make getting a grip easier, also. However, the button on the side of the toy prohibits the baby from sliding the ring onto the peg with ease. I bought the old fashioned graduated ring set because this one button was frustrating her and causing her to avoid playing with the toy once she hit the block. If she were older I would have had her keep trying, but at such a young age of mere months, I don't think she needed that frustration. She would get so excited when she got the ring on the peg, but then couldn't figure out how to use force and push it/wiggle it down further and over the button. This is not a problem for my 15 month old nephew, but at 3-6 months THAT feature was not the best for her; however, I DO understand that this toy is marketed for children 6+ months. I'm just letting you know my experience with a younger baby. Now, at about 10 months she has no difficulty at all using the toy and I would still recommend this to younger babies as it is quite enticing to wiggle to or attempt to rollover to reach for.  Also, I MUST add...while I love this toy overall, it does NOT have an on/off button. I fell into this trap a few times after putting my baby to sleep while I was cleaning up her toys. Yes, I quickly learned that it doesn't ever really shut off and that my daughter absolutely the glittery, magical sounds of this toy so much that she is more than eager to wake up an play with it!	1
PROS: -It's cute and entertaining from 8 mo (when we got it) to 13 mo (current age) -The stars are textured, this makes them fun to bite -The lights really are eye catching, if my son is crying, we just get the lights going and voila - he runs over and starts playing  CONS: -There is no on/off switch, so if you place it in the toy box, be careful something is not resting on the top or it will keep going off and singing/flashing -The stars are all the same width, so you can place them in any order (this doesn't matter much to me, but I guess if you are looking at an educational angle, it doesn't "teach" as well as the old school stacker)  BEST USE: I think any age. I have fun playing with it ;)  RECOMMENDATION: At this price, it's a good buy. We have both this stacker, the plain ring plastic one AND the stuffed Melissa and Doug one -- the two fisher price ones are both among our son's fave toys (the stuffed one, not so much).	1
My daughter really enjoys this when she plays with it. Lately, she hasn't been as interested. But, when we first bought it she really enjoyed it. Hopefully she will come back to it again.	1
This was one of the toys I got our little granddaughter for Christmas this past year. She just loves it. She is only 6 months old, so she is not using it fully yet, but so far it really gets her attention every time. The music and noises it makes are so sweet. Not at all loud and obnoxious. We will see how it holds up as she grows and uses it more. So far, however, it has become one of her favorites.	1
My daughter has been playing with this toy for 4 months now.  She is almost 10 months old.  She loves the lights and the sounds!  A must have!	1
I got this for my twin 10 month olds.  When they touch/grab this toy, it makes a certain "magic charms" noise with flashing white lights inside that really gets their attention.  At first they let go, look at it, and then touch again.  Then they're likely to set off the actual music, and they appreciate that.  The lights, combined with the magic noise, gives this stacker an extra dimension.  It's another great toy at a very reasonable price, and if you buy several toys, I'd go ahead and get it.  Stackers are basic and this one is unique.  The only thing to watch out for is if the baby falls on the very top yellow piece, as that one looks to me as if it has some hard edges and could hurt.  Not so the other pieces, which the babies love to play with.  However, perhaps because I'm so vigilent, neither of my babies has fallen on the top hard plastic piece.  The bottom rocks, so it's deliberately not quite steady, and that makes a baby want to do something to it.  Little Super Star Classical Stacker has attributes that get a baby's attention and reward that attention.  I think all babies would like this stacker and the price seems reasonable to me.	1
8 month old my daughter likes to take all the rings out and throw them. she really enjoys doing it and I cannot wait to see her putting rings in the pole one day. music and light both entertain her.	1
My baby doesn't pay much attention to this toy no matter what sounds or lights are going off on it.	-1
This is a fun toy for our 9 month old daughter. It is a classic toy with a fun new twist. It still teaches the same way, but adds lights and sounds. Its colors are fun, and the lights make it even more festive. It's also very durable, as our daughter's favorite use of the toy currently is to bang the stars together and throw them. This is a fun toy for an infant.	1
My daughter's daycare has this toy (I think thye usually use it without the batteries...).  At 13 months, it is simple for her to stack the rings.  I believe this toy is more developmentally appropriate for this age than the toy that I grew up with (just like what we have at home), which Fisher Price calls Rock-A-Stack.  On the Rock-A-Stack, the pole is slanted, so the rings have to go on in a particular order in order for them to all fit.  That skill comes much later than the ability to stack.  With this toy, the rings can go in in any order, thus isolating stacking as the relevant developmental skill.	1
My son loved this toy immediately!  We got it when he was about 6 months old and he continues to be fascinated by it - he loves to push the button on top to get the music out.  The music itself is also pleasing (unlike some other toys) - it consists of a few measures of various familiar classical music pieces - the pieces change each time he pushes the button.  The measures are not too long or too short.  Overall, this is a great toy.	1
My son received this as a gift from Grandma for his first Christmas. He was three months at the time, so he didn't really play with it, but a little while passed and the stars became great teethers. He liked to throw them at me, too. lol He's now 13 months and he still loves this toy. He has excellent coordination and I know that this toy had a big part in that. He can stack the stars on very quickly, and loves to press the button over and over, I guess he really likes the songs it plays. It's not too loud and never really gets annoying. I would be willing to purchase another one, but there is no need..even after daily prolonged play (and I mean this thing has been thrown, dropped and used to beat on the floor) and it's still going strong. Not even the paint is showing wear. I really recommend this toy to all new parents..it's a must have.	1
We bought this toy for my daughter when she was 6 months old.  She loved the music!  Of course she was too young to put the stars back on, but she loved the music and lights.  10 months later, she still loves this toy!  She now knows how to stack up the stars, and loves to take them off and on.  The music is wonderful too.  It doesnt get annoying or anything like that.  I highly recommend this toy.. one of the best toys we have for our daughter!	1
My daughter has loved this toy since we bought it when she was about four months old.  She loves to see it light up, and she can slip the stars on and off.	1
i bought this for my daughter when she was 7 months. she absolutely loves this toy! in fact my husband loves to play with it too. my daughter will take off and put back on the star rings and hit the top to make it play music and light up. she loves to dance to the music. its one of her favorite toy. i would buy this again in a heartbeat.	1
So much better than just stacking the circles, this toy will keep your childs' attention longer.  It's bright, not too noisy and teaches fundamental physics, colors, and counting.  It also gives a child a sense of accomplishment.  Great learning toy and lots of entertainment.  Interact with your child and the Stacker.  It will be very rewarding for you also.  Let the dishes go for 30 minutes and laugh with your baby. Years from now that will be the precious memory you hold dear.  Nana Kat	1
My daycare one year old LOVES this toy. The music really excites her. I am so glad I bought this toy!	1
My baby is only two months old right now, so can't actually play with this yet.  I get it to light up for him, though, and he smiles and lights up with excitement.  Much nicer than the original stacker.	1
Both of my sons love this toy!  They like to take turns stacking the stars onto the base and watching the lights light up and the music play.  This is my favorite stacker toy, by far!!	1
Good toy to learn big shape and colors for older child.. As for younger 6 month year old like the music and the lights and trying to put the object back in the ring.  Very good toy.. simple and easy.	1
I bought this toy for my granddaughter and she loved it while it was still in the box.  The first time I took it out of the box and she heard the music, she cried (age 6 months).  I thought it was a fluke so I put the toy away.  I gave it to her a month later and the same thing happened. I also tried it last week (she's 8 months old today) and she still cried.  I cannot explain this because she has several other Fisher-Price musical toys that she loves. Maybe, some day, she'll enjoy it.  Edit:  At 11 months, this toy became one of her favorites.  She now plays with every part of the toy and constantly finds new creative ways to play with it.	-1
Both my son and daughter had one of the original ones and they started to play with it around 6 months.  They both loved it and had a wonderful time with it.  I do agree though there isn't much to it and it could be very boring for a 1 year old, but as a first toy it was great.  Once they figured out how to stack it they would stack and unstack all the time.  What was great is that they had no frustration because it didn't matter how you stacked it, it always went together.  I'm on my third and it will be on my wish list for this baby as well.	1
My son loved this toy from the time he was about 6 weeks old unit he was about one.  He loved looking at the lights and listening to the music.  When he got old enough he loved stacking the stars until they lit up and played music. Tons of fun!	1
Our daughter got this toy when she was born and still plays with it now (15 months later).  While she stacks, lights brighten up the stars and it plays a cute song when she reaches the top with the yellow star.  It encourages her to continue stacking while having fun.  We like to turn the lights out and play with it in the dark so that she can see the pretty colors - she absolutely loves this toy.  Great for any family and a perfect gift!  **UPDATE**  We recently purchased this toy for our 13 month old niece and she loves it.  As soon as it lights up she starts to giggle and pull at the stars.  Also, this is still one on my daughter's favorite toys and she is now 17 months old!	1
My daughter received this for her first birthday, and 7months later, still loves it! She loves to put the stars on in random patterns, and just claps and grins when she gets the big star on top! It is a little loud, but the tape idea is a winner, mutes it just enough. The music is not the usual annoying variety found in baby toys, it's definitely a step above. Overall, a durable and fun toy for babies, and it really does grow with them!	1
My son is still too little to understand stacking the stars back on the stacker, but he loves activating the music and watching the stars light up to different classical tunes. Fisher Price has made a classic toy even better with lights, music and multi-colors. Makes a great baby shower gift.	1
My daughter has had this toy for a year and still enjoys the music and the lights as well as stacking the stars.  She has learned her colors with this toy as well as being able to stack, and the cause and effect of the buttons.	1
We bought my daughter the classical stacker when she was about 6 months old. She is 9 months old now and still plays with it. It is a great toy because each star is a different color, and when seh picks one up, I will ask her if she has the "blue" star or which ever color she is holding. She loves to pull the star from the top and crawl around with it in her hands. She loves dancing to the music too. We had previously bought her just a regular stacking ring toy and she just used the rings as teethers, but with this one, the lights and the music just seem to get her intersted in figuring out "how they are supposed to go on that stick". All in all, a great toy! 5 stars in every area!	1
This is my son's favorite toy, and for eleven bucks that's quite a deal. He literally can play with this toy for hours if given the opportunity. He's learned to press the button on the top that plays the music, and as soon as he does, he looks at everyone in the room and gives them a "look how smart I am" smile. It's hilarious! He's just now learning (at 12 months) how to put the stars back on the base. He couldn't do this a couple of months ago; he could only get them off, so it has grown with him. I put scotch tape over the speaker because there is no volume control and it can be quite loud. The tape still lets the tunes be heard, but now I don't have to talk over it! My mother is a daycare provider and she also has this toy, and her children love it, too; they even fought over it until she bought another one. That means I know of at least three children who can't get enough of this toy. It's worth its weight in gold!	1
My daughter has been playing with this since she was about 3 months old. She is now 1 and still likes to play with it. Her favorite part is the star on top. She carries it everywhere. When we put it on the stacker she takes it right off and holds on to it.  The music it plays makes her dance and the lights make her laugh a little. This is a very inexpensive and fun toy to have.	1
My daughter got this as a Christmas present when she was 4 months old, and it wasn't until she was about 9 months old when she started really paying attention to it.  She doesn't yet have the dexterity to stack the stars, but she loves dumping the toy upside down so the stars fall off.  She likes watching me peer with one eye through the hole in the stars, and she even does it herself.  And the stars are easy to grasp and bang together.  Her favorite thing about this toy is when she pushes on the top button with her finger to cause the music and lights to start up.  That always makes her smile.  This is one of her favorite toys, but I think it will be awhile before she is using it to its full capacity.	1
This was a gift for my Daughter. She loves to push the buttons and here the twinkle sound or the music. Only problem...she likes to take the stars off and use the base as a bat. It hurts. Bad. But she likes the pretty colors when the stars light up! Also, the star on the top doesn't stay in place very good..but..it's still worth every penny her Grandpa paid for it! :)	1
What a smart idea!  Teach your baby the beauty and complexity of fine classical music with durable plastic and a midi-style computer chip.  Why spend the big bucks on a home stereo and expensive CDs when for mere dollars he can not only enjoy the classics, but can gum the source?  I originally rated the educational value as 5, but dropped it to a 4 when I discovered to my horror that if you stack the stars backwards (small to large) it plays "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones. Small children should not be exposed to that until about age six, so be sure you supervise their play with this toy.  I also rated durability as a 4, as the smallest star cracked in the vice, and the two largest stars did not flush readily down the toilet.  If you have a large dog, such as a Harlequin Great Dane named Beau-foo-rocious, be forewarned that even swallowed the music lives on...and on...and on.  Beau is SO embarrassed around the other dogs, with the little jingly sounds emanating from his tummy.  Great toy - great value!	1
I received this as a baby shower gift.  My daughter is just now learning how to take the stars off of the pole and she's totally fascinated with the lights and the noise that she is rewarded with when she succeeds.  Other stackers don't really do anything.  This one plays different musical tunes which keeps my daughter engaged.  I would recommend this toy.	1
My then 6 month old son got this for Christmas and now at a year old is still entertained by this toy.  He loves the way it lights up and is very pleased with himself when he gets it to play a song.  In the 6 months we've had this toy, with constant use, I have only had to replace the batteries once.  It is also not too annoyingly loud, although there is not adjustable volume.	1
We just bought this toy for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- They love it!  Daughter loves to dance with the music, carry the stars around, stack them, dump them, etc.  Wish I had bought it sooner!	1
I got this for my son when he was 2 months. I used to pushe it and he liked to watch the lights . He didn't really start playing with it by himself till he was 1 year. He likes to stack the stars and pust the top star to listen to the music and he dances to it. So cute!!!lol  Definitely worth the price. Would recomend to anyone with a baby.	1
This is perfect for indoor/outdoor. It's so cute and my girls really love it!	1
Granddaughter LOVES it...	1
We have had this house for 3 years now and it is perfect in every way. The doorbell is probably the best part in my toddlers mind. It's not as big and bulky as some of the house but still big enough for 2 to play in comfortably. The windows are perfect time for looking our and playing peakaboo. It even has a little table and 2 chairs. 3 years later and my kids still play in it daily. I give this an A+++++	1
We bought this for my daughters second birthday and she absolutely loves it! Very easy to assemble and well built for the price. Would definitely recommend!	1
Good first playhouse. Sadly, 2 small toddler would probably max the usable space out in this playhouse.  But, my daughter enjoys having her own little hang-out!	1
Just great. Excelent choice. And not that heavy.	1
As far as shipping, it arrived quickly and intact.  The product itself if nice, but there are definitely a lot of design flaws.  My husband and I had to put this together before Christmas, and it was quite the task to do so.  Many of the holes that we were supposed to place screws in, we had to create ourselves.  The "front door" doesn't close all the way and my daughter that inherited my OCD (apparently), gets frustrated with that easily.  It's an adorable house, but with it comes a couple of problems.  Overall, a good buy.	1
Very upset about this purchase! The hole for the table did not line up, so we had to make a different hole, the doorbell is broke, and the picture shows a thermostat , lights that look like real lights and a blue mail box, it's almost as if there should be decals for these spots, but there is not! Not happy at all	-1
Our granddaughters (now 3 and 2) loved it plus we could all keep an eye on them!	1
This play house is ridiculously small and flimsy! The door always falls off. I'm very disappointed in this purchase!	-1
I bought this for my sister's cats. They love it.	1
I purchased this for my 14 month old granddaughter .  It is the perfect size for her and she loves opening and closing the door and pushing the doorbell ! There are many small shelves inside that I always place small toys so she can find them when she comes over .  It's the right size for my spare bedroom.  The ONLY complaint I have is the door keeps falling off. It is easy to put back on , put just a hassle. The makers needed to make the connecting piece longer.	1
My daughter plays in this house for hours.  It was very easy to assemble and is a lot of fun in the back yard	1
I read all the reviews and was not sure this house was going to work out. I read how small and flimsy it was going to be. I have three children 10 months, 2, 4, and 6. I figured one of them would enjoy this house! Turns out it is a perfect house for the baby who will soon be one. She enjoys going in and ringing the door bell. The four year old also loves the house. It is definitely on the small side. My four year old loves it and does fit in the little seats but my 6 year old is already too big for it. It can fit two small kids inside. The table and chairs inside are very small. However, it easily fits in our playroom as well as a bedroom. I debated back and forth as to whether to buy this one or a bigger one. I am happy that I went with this small one. For around $100 it is a good purchase for a little play house for kids 3 and under in my opinion. It is very cute in person as well! Not sure how it would do outside. It seems like a playhouse for indoors or on a deck. If you are looking for a small playhouse I think this one is a hit!	1
size and colors are perfect. It would have been nice if there were a few more perks inside other than the table and chairs	1
We bought this house for my daughter's 2nd birthday... she's the perfect size (36 inches) and loves that it's pink and purple.  She was thrilled to see and play with the doorbell, thinks the mail box is fun and enjoys having little tea parties with her stuffed animals inside.  I can barely fit to sit on the floor inside to join her... it's small and narrow- we keep it inside the house so not sure how the durablity vote would change if we were to keep it outside.  Would definitely recommend for this age... my son also can enjoy it with her- he's 4 and just fits inside.  The seats are small for him, but he doesn't mind.  He has fun just the same.  The two of them enjoy having snacks at the small table inside:).  Would highly recommend if you're looking for a fun little playhouse and didn't want to spend a ton of money:).	1
I bought this for my 2 grandaughters, ages 1 & 2.  They love it!  We keep it in the house and they love pressing the doorbell and going in and out the door and sitting at the table.  I would not suggest it for children over 4 or 5, it seems a little flimsy for older children, but its great for my young grandaughters.	1
I thought this crawling Pooh was so cute in the commercials, I told my mom she should get it for my daughter for Christmas.  All the adults around when she opened it thought it was adorable, especially when he turned his head and said "Hello Baby".  But my daughter is totally scared of it.  We thought she'd warm up to him as she got older.  She's had him for over 8 months, and she still cries whenever we turn him on.  She'll touch him and even take him out of the toy box, as long as he is turned off.  But as far as dolls go, he is too hard to be cuddly to her.  The music is so loud and ear-piercing, and the velcro holding his tummy closed is always coming apart.  She learned to crawl fine, without watching Pooh as an example.  I think the good reviews are from parents who like him, regardless of how their babies feel.  Don't waste your money on this toy.	-1
This toy is so cute. I love all the pooh products. I did my first baby's in room in pooh so I had to get this when my son started to crawl. It really helped him to crawl.	1
We started using this pooh when the twins were learning to roll. And now at 6 months they are crawling around trying to catch pooh. They both seemed very intrested in this pooh and i think it actualy gave them the get up and go to follow pooh across the room. This is a great toy that i think any new little one would enjoy. The motor does seem a little loud. But my son and daugther didn't seem to mind and neither did we. We usualy have all sorts of other sounds going on so it blocks it out!	1
Great Halloween game!	1
I'm a 23 year old college student and have become quite the board game enthusiest. I picked this game up because I remember playing the VHS version of this board game in my childhood/pre-teen days. Besides Risk it was the only other board game I enjoyed playing at the time. I bought this as a throwback to those days. I remember the fun interaction with the gatekeeper coming up on screen and throwing twists (as well as insults) into the game. The great thing about this DVD version is that the game is random each time you play. With the VHS version you quickly start learning when things are going to happen at what time and what exactly will happen when the Gatekeeper appears on screen.  If you've never played before you pretty much have a hexagon game board that is split into 6 areas of a different color. Each person picks a crazy Halloween type of character like a vampire, werewolf, poltergeist, etc. Each person writes a fear of theres on a piece of paper and places it into the jar that sits in the middle of the board. Each player takes turns rolling the dice and moving around the board collecting a colored key from each area. Once a player has 1 of each color key he/she must go to the middle jar and pick on out. If the fear belongs to the player then they win. If not they must return to their specific starting area that each character has and try to go to the middle again. You have 49 minutes to complete the game or else the Gatekeeper wins. The Gatekeeper is this creepy guy that shows up randomly on the TV screen and throws in twists to the game and makes some of the players do funny/ridiculous things at times.  Atmosfear is not a well known game so introducing it to your friends is fun. The game supports 6 players max which is good and can be a problem at the same time. I throw game nights for my church college group frequently and there's always too many of us to play this game. I usually pull this game out near the end when some people have left already. However if you have between 3-6 players its good to go. However, a problem again with the amount of people is that if you are introducing the game to people, the gameplay moves slow and I've found that it is terribly difficult to win. The most recent game I can remember is that there was like 12 minutes left in the game (which isn't much at all) and the most keys a player had was like 2 or 3. That seems to be a common theme everytime I play this board game. at the 10 minute mark I believe the game speeds up and the Gatekeeper starts giving away keys like they are going outta style. Even then it seems hard to win. I don't think I've ever played this game where the GateKeeper hasn't won because the time ran out. I think I liked the VHS version in that regard.  Anyways this game is really fun regardless. Its definitely something for the halloween time of year. You can play it any other time too. The set up is easy. The only thing that takes long in setup is grouping all the keys into specific colors. I keep all the plastic keys in this game in a zip-locked bag but other than that it takes like 5 minutes to set up. The DVD has a "how to play" section so theres no need to read instructions. Although! I will say it comes with an instruction card that explains what certain tiles on the game board mean and every other rule. Make sure you have about an hour committed to play this game.  This game is worth a buy. If you want party games for more than 6 players then I'll throw you in the direction of Apples to Apples or Scene It or something.	1
This game comes with easy instructions on the DVD so you don't even need to go to the paper directions (a hated task). 4-6 players creates the fun; there is a person assigned to be the judge , jury etc (the chosen one) the DVD will keep track of time ; only 49 minutes to accomplish the tasks not to mention the stopping of play by the gatekeeper to make you miss a turn or give another player an opportunity to take your key to slow you down (watch the clock) time cards for special activity to be played when the time is noted on the TV during the countdown; so with all this activity and you trying to move around the board to accomplish all tasks, it creates great fun ;  can't wait to play this again and again	1
I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed.  One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring.  I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games.  Too bad for them.  Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me.	1
The kids each got one of these at Christmas and began squirreling away all the loose coins they found around the house and car. Squeeze the coins through the top slot and it correctly tallies up the total. The small reset hole near the battery compartment allows you to to clear the toal and start over from scratch. I wish it also had some kind of "manual" way to add dollar increments to the total---sometimes the kid wants to stuff a $5-10-20 bill "gift" in the jar, and we have to manually shove quarters through the slot to equal the value of the bill.	1
This is a great fun way to learn how to save money.  A little bit can add up.  The only thing that might be difficult is putting the coins in only at first.  There is a spring for the slot area and it is hard to push the coins in at first, but I think that will stop once we use it more.	1
I offered a review on this item with another store [...] and couldn't find a way to update it . . .  not one hour after reviewing it, my daughter called to tell me something she discovered . . . coins are a little hard to insert (which is good) but she discovered that if a coin is only partially insterted, it counts odd as it counts by the width of the coin . . . so if a quarter is partially inserted, the amount is defined by how much of the coin was inserted before it counts.  Still love it and would buy more for other people and am going to buy one for me and only hope it works as well!	1
This banks is cute and works well. the only problem I found with it was if you go to insert a coin and it doesnt go all the way thru the slot, the jar still counts it. Its good to have an idea of how much change you have accumulated tho.	1
This jar works great -- hasn't skipped a beat in keeping perfect count. I bought one for my husband and one for my seven year-old niece. I reviewed all the fancy coin counters that sort and wrap the coins, hoping I would find something really great. But every review for those fancy (non- commercial) sorters/counters moaned on about how it didn't recognize the coins every time or didn't keep an accurate count. For my husband, I wanted something he could put his pocket change into instead of plastic margarine tubs stored under our bed. I also wanted something to keep track of the amount of change so when it got high enough we could cash it out and have dinner or gas up both cars, etc. For my niece, I wanted to promote saving by watching the dollar amount rise as she dropped her coins in over time. This jar works really well for both purposes. It hasn't skipped a beat yet in keeping count of the change or knowing what coin was being dropped in. It's got a great big jar attached so it will hold a lot (probably a couple hundred dollars worth of change, easy) but is small enough to fit unassumingly onto any counter or side table. It's made of a heavy plastic material so it'll stand up to a beating and it's easy to grip for small hands, or even for an older relative whose hands might be shaky. I have no complaints about this -- it works great and fits the bill. No more margarine tubs under the bed!	1
This was a great gift for my son!  He loves to put the coins in the bank.  The bank actually shows you what each coin is & keeps a running tally on the amount in the bank.  We love it!	1
I am so pleased to have found a nice simple but yet fun for the kids money jar/bank! It is durable and simple to use. We have 5 kiddos and we/ve tried lots of different banks/atms etc. but now our youngest tried the money bank and whew, it's been the best for them to save and see the money through the clear jar! thanks for a great product! happy mom of 5. donna mallon	1
I bought this for my girls and I love it!  It really does properly count the money.  The only thing it doesn't count are half dollars (who uses those anyway LOL).  The actual product is made out of a hard plastic; seems very durable and the kid's can see their money while it is being counted.  I bought this for a lot cheaper from collections etc.	1
You have to push very hard to insert the coins. My son is 6 years old and has alot of trouble with it. While struggling to get the coins in, the meter will miscount that particular coin. For example: if you are trying to get a dime in and you have to take it out and try again, then it will register as 20 cents instead of 10 cents. He grew bored with it rather quickly.	-1
I was thrilled to get this bank for use of the "coffee fund" at my work. But I was rather disappointed to find that there is NO way to adjust the amount of money listed in the jar if you remove the money. You have to reset it and drop all the remaining change back into the jug to re-total it. Not very convenient when you're regularly taking out money to purchase things.	-1
I purchased 2 money jars for my daughters earlier this year.  I thought it was an awesome idea, until the counter quit within a couple weeks.  I then had replacements sent, and one of them was defective on delivery.  I wish they had worked as it really is awesome and exciting for the kids.  It encourages them to save more. Unfortunately, they are no more useful than a $1 piggy bank.	-1
I think all of us have a money jar of some sort in our house.  We need that jar in case we need spare change, or need to put spare change somewhere.  In some cases, people use money jars as a swear jar (if someone says a bad word they have to put money in the jar).  A swear jar is a good way to teach teenagers some respect.  Of course they wait until you go to bed just to take the money right back (and also take your car).  But the important thing is that teens and adults both understand how useful these jars are.  In my experience snooping around, I find that people don't always put the money jar in the same place in their homes.  Some people put them in their hallway, other people (like me) put them right next to the computer.  I think the most logical place would be to set them on the hutch, or wherever you put pictures of your family.  Put the money jar right there.  As people below have mentioned, there is something fascinating about emptying your money jar and counting how much money you have.  I sit here and look at the jar next to me and see mostly quarters and pennies.  I bet I could buy 10 pizzas.  I don't recommend shoving paper money in there, because the only way to get it back out would be to break the whole jar open with a hammer (unless you're an expert with tweezers).  There's only so much you can say about a money jar.  Please, purchase one if you haven't already.  No matter what the jar looks like, you can't go wrong.  You'll be surprised how often you put money in and take money out of one.	1
After purchasing the ATM Safe for our son, we purchased the Money Jar to keep in the kitchen.  It is a good tool to help teach the kids the value of money.  Now we designate the money in the jar for something special - say a trip to Chuck E. Cheese's.  The kids can watch the savings grow and anticipate what the reward will be for saving.  They are also learning delayed gratification and patience as well as the hard lesson that you can't get everything that you want NOW.  Not bad!!  The only negative - if you don't force each coin into the slots, they can pop back out and the jar registers a deposit for the coin even though it didn't actually make it in the jar.	1
Son loved it	1
Son loves this!	1
good quality	1
Horrible. Piece of Junk. Worthless. Bad. Everything that previous reviews have stated...  This Rubik's cube is a complete waste of money! It literally broke within 10 minutes of giving it as a Christmas present. The damage is irreparable. Really poorly made product. It was an embarrassment to have given it. The package claims to be "the original cube", which is why I bought it. If it was a "knockoff" I would say it was my fault for buying cheap imitations. You probably will be better off with an imitation. At least if it breaks, you probably won't be out the $20.  As of the date of writing of this review, I believe the company that I bought it from is no longer selling the Cube.  Do I recommend it? Heck no! Neither does the 13 year old who it was given to as a gift!!!	-1
VERY disappointed with this!!  (I have purchased less expensive cubes from other companies but was not impressed with their quality.  I assumed the original Rubik's Cube would be the best quality out there....guess I was wrong.  What a waste of money).  I purchased this cube for my 9 yr old son who is a whiz with solving many different kinds of cubes.  But, my son had to "earn it" with his allowance first.  I mixed up the 4X4 cube and he started working on it.  He was excited that it was a new challenge for him.  He worked on it for quite a while and almost had it solved when all of a sudden it "exploded" in his hands!  He was NOT being rough with it.  The only pieces left on the cube were the corner pieces.  NOT VERY impressed.  My son is very disappointed because he had worked hard saving up to buy this.  He never got the chance to experience the "glory" of actually solving it.  It is too expensive for me to "re-buy" it for him.  Maybe we just got a "dud"?  Would love to be refunded.	-1
Other brands cost less and feel better right out of the box.	-1
i was worried that it would be hard to twist and turn the rubik's cube with the 4x4 sides...but it works just as easily as a 3x3. it's really great quality. i got it for my 30 year old brother, it's been about a month since he's gotten it, and he's still figuring it out. i love the idea of this because he figured out the classic 3x3 in about a day. the shipping time was as expected.	1
I bought this for my 10 yr old for his birthday and he loves it. I can't even begin to solve this one, but he has come close to solving 2 sides at this point. But he has only had it a week now. This is wonderful for any cube lovers.	1
love it	1
Gift for Grandson	1
it's good for your money	1
toy fell apart the first time is was used, maybe this was just a lemon, I repurchased this company and it is holding up well, but all 4x4 do not have a center (like 3x3) so they are more delicate	-1
My granddaughter loves ths!	1
Way to step up your game Rubik's Cube!	1
Product is solid. No issues.	1
Thought I was buying a regular Rubik's Cube so I was surprised because of my ignorance.  Just as pictured. Cannot be taken apart.	1
Is as advertised, appears to be genuine Ribik's. Has permanent plastic colors which is great, moves ok, but catches a little	1
Product was exactly as described and arrived as expected.	1
I bought this for my oldest as he had mastered the art of the Rubik's 3x3 and wanted a challenge. Needless to say, he has been working on this and is enjoying the challenge! It was neatly packaged up and in perfect condition! Thanks!	1
I am nothing. Every touch cracks me, every look leaving my in pieces. I am broken. Here is my story.  I was born on a hot august day, two days after my due date, a healthy baby boy with five fingers and five toes. My mother tells me I was a good baby, nice and quiet and calm, only creating a fuss when I absolutely had to. As I grew I was substantially smarter then those in my youth. I could speak early, and by age five was further ahead in class then the rest of my peers. I was pushed to be moved to more advanced classes, but my anxiety held me back and I stayed where I was. It wasn't until fifth grade that I realized how much of an outcast I was. I would indulge myself with my work, completing worksheets in silence not noticing how others would point at me and snicker. It was the middle of the year when I finally opened to the world and found myself completely alone. I would wonder after the groups of children who would eat together at lunch, and have playdates after school. I wanted to be them. But I had dug myself to far in this hole, and I was the 'weirdo' the 'freak' and 'the kid who never talks' all together in one. It was as though fate read my mind because the next day I was presented with the new kid at school. He was hopeful, wonderful, and seemed to emit light from his soul, because he was that pure. His name was Chris, and he was my world. Chris was the kindest person I had ever met. He disregarded all other mention of my name, all couplings my name had with the word strange, and against the odds became my best and only friend. When I turned twelve Chris was still there for me. I watched each and every one of his soccer games, and he tried his best to go to all of my debate matches. It was the unusual pairing, but somehow it worked. On my thirteenth birthday, Chris game me a rubik's cube. He said it was because I liked puzzles a lot, and before I knew it I had thrown my arm around him. No one had ever loved me enough to get to know what I liked. When I was fifteen I realized that I was in love with him. It started slow and gradual, then it slammed into me like a hammer punched into my heart. At first I thought it was a fluke, after all he was my best friend, and a boy shouldn't feel like that about another boy. But then the feelings constricted around me, making it hard to breath whenever he was near, and I began to further myself from Chris. Chris called me every night, begging me to pick up the phone, but I knew that if I heard his voice I would confess to him. And that would just end in disappointment and regret. My life began to fumble downwards and I made myself sick. Skin stuck to my lifeless bones, from my throat came a constant stream of phlegm and gunk. Life without him was killing me. He confronted me three months after I stopped talking to him. He pushed me against a wall and demanded to know why I had abandoned him. He told me we were supposed to be friends, but now... Now he couldn't stand me because I left him. It was then that I allowed the tears to come, and he cupped my face asking why. Why did I push him away, why. I couldn't help myself so I told him I had fallen in love. He dropped his hands from my face as though he had been burned and walked away. That night I threw the rubik's cube against the wall and left it in pieces on my floor.  Two days later Chris came to me, his hands shoved in his pockets, and a look as though he had just been stomped on. I tensed, closing my eyes and waiting for him to slap me, hit me, throw me to the ground, anything that would help me forget how much of a screw-up I was. Instead I felt him kiss me.  He didn't want it to be public, so we kept it quiet, even hidden away from our parents. We would sneak out through bedroom windows, kiss under the cover of Chris's new Volkswagen and hold hands behind our backs. He discovered the broken rubik's cube two weeks after we had become public, and spent the night glueing it back together, his head in my lap. We made plans to go to college together. By then we were an established couple, the iconic two who couldn't be split apart. Nothing could split us apart, well except for war. When I found out that he was assigned to Iraq I fell to my knees, crying, clawing at my chest as though it was breaking apart. When he left I couldn't breath. It was hard but I adjusted. My courses at Notre Dame kept me busy and I wrote and replied to letters every night. Until they stopped coming.  I got the call on a late afternoon. The generals voice was deep and serious, the only things I could discern from the whole conversation was 'He died in action.' The rest was a rush of mumbles, and something that sounded a bit like crashing ocean waves before the click sounded, signaling the end of the conversation. It was then that I allowed myself to fall apart.  The next week I burned the rubik's cube.	-1
Great quality cube as you'd expect from the original manufacture.  Not a speed cube but looks great and is a challenge to solve.	1
enjoyed by my son and tougher than the 3 x3	1
just what I expected	1
great deal	1
No spins	-1
Just what was expected.	1
I have always LOVED the original 3x3 and wanted a more challenging puzzle. Sadly as soon as I started twisting away to get a feel for it, a white center piece popped out, or so I thought. Apparently it sheared off as I turned the puzzle.	-1
good	1
this cube can be fragile a lot of small parts  inside needs special lubricant to keep moving smooth keep it clean	1
This was really hard!  We passed it around all Christmas day!! Planning on buying the bigger one next year.  Give it a try!!!	1
This cube is absolutely atrocious.  Do not even THINK of buying it.  Just a disaster on all levels, honestly.  Buy a speed 4x4 instead.	-1
I bought this for as a Christmas gift for my son who collects Rubik's Cubes. It was really cool. It now just sits on a shelf.	1
I was expecting something more easy to move, being an original rubik's cube, but what I got is a 4x4x4 cube really hard to move. It almost always get stuck... Very disappointed, since I had four years ago an asian version and it was very soft and easy to move it around.	-1
Shipping was quick. Cant blame the seller. The product is inferior for an serious speed cuber. Pretty colorful paperweight. A required cube for a collection , not so much for the solver	-1
purchased as a gift for my son who has mastered the 3 x 3.  Product is as expected and the value and delivery time was good.	1
At first, I thought it turned pretty smooth besides the jams here and there. Some pieces ept popping out, so I found myself smacking them back into place. I wish V Cube would make a V cube 4 already. It was a little stiff here and there. Can be frustrating. Not bad for a 4x4x4, but I'm trying to find better.  I got pissed because the other night I was doing some speed solves and I was getting close to getting under 3 minutes finally, but suddenly it snapped and like half the pieces came out. It's totalled. This cube is finished. I'm pissed. If you don't cube as much as me (like maybe one to five solves a night) then you're straight. Get it... But I solve cubes literally hundreds of times in a day b ecause it's so addictive. This is not hte cube for the 4x4x4 realm.	-1
If you like the normal Rubik's cube, you'll love this!  If you hated the 3x3, don't waste your money!  The little stand is a nice touch!	1
For those of you who are just getting into cubing, I'm sure you have a positive opinion of the Rubik's company, the first, largest, and most famous of the companies that make these puzzly cubes.  Unfortunately, by this point the company has gotten fat, lazy, and complacent.  Their cubes blow.  In particular, with this one, the 4x4x4, the stickers will come off before long, meaning the puzzle won't be solvable because you'll have too many white cubes.  It's also not very well put together mechanically and will likely come apart.  I know the 4x4x4 and anything larger is not recommended for speedcubing for this reason, but still.  By this point, you should get your cubes from companies like Lanlan and Eastsheen.  Even though you may not recognize their names, they still put out better products that last longer.	-1
This compmpany makes the best rubix cubes! but one thing you should know about 4x4 cubes. first off they are obviously alot harder than 3x3 cubes, and also they are constructed different. 4x4 are easier to break because all of the squares move unlike a 3x3. so be gentle with it!	1
I ordered this for my son who is 15 years old. I purchased this thinking it would be more of a challenge for him vs. online gaming.  Turns out, it was. It's definitely a lot more difficult than the original so this product wouldn't be for younger kids. Something I noticed, the pieces tend to fall apart when turning the rows.  Other than that, it's a decent product overall. You just need to break it in a little bit when you first buy it.	1
Oh man what fun!  The best party games are those that are fast paced and involve everybody.  Tip of the tongue is a game of trivia in which each person has only 2 seconds to answer the question.  More often than not the questions are very easy although some are era specific so you'd have to be a baby boomer to know it.  Everyone takes turns being a questioner asking the trivia questions to the other players.  As soon as the question is asked the questioner pushes a button and 2 seconds later the buzzer goes off.  The fun is all in seeing whether or not you can quickly spout out the answer.  "A hard candy with a hole in the middle."  "What color are the Simpsons?"  "What is the Japanese currency?"  These are just a few examples of what you may have.  I only hope there are refills for the trivia cards because I'm sure we will run through these cards soon as fun as this game is.	1
I bought this game for my 13yo niece at our cottage up north. It was for her birthday. It is basically a two person game with one person reading questions and the game giving the other person 2 seconds to answer. It was so fun that other people kept calling out answers and trying to play too. She loved it.	1
We love random facts. This game is great. The questions arnt very hard although sometimes hard to think of fast. Hence the name. I play with people ages 10-60 and everybody has a blast.	1
...even better than the original 3 x 3 he mastered. He had it almost mastered in a couple days, except for a couple seemingly unfixable "parity" errors, so he got help from online videos. It has a very smooth action that he prefers to the somewhat stiff 3 x 3, too.  I can't even do the 2 x 2, but the joy these bring my son makes them a very good value.  Don't waste your money paying more than twice this price from the other rip-off company, not for this cube or for the even more ridiculously priced "last" Rubik's UFO.  Keep searching - you found this 4 x 4 for less than half their price, right? - or wait a couple weeks until another vendor adds one to the listing.  Be patient and you won't get screwed.	1
I almost forgot I have this game, but I do. It's a fun harmless game good for game nights or family car trips, as long as the person driving doesn't read the questions (wink!).  Simple concept. Answer the question before getting the raspberry. You can go in turns and have others try to guess if the first person is wrong. Questions seems to be of average difficulty, like top to middle-of-the-board Jeopardy clues. Since you need to hear the razz, this game would not be good for noisy places. Other than that, a nice fun trivia game.  Fundex has other fun games, like One Word, Chairs and the new game Privacy. Check those out as well.	1
Our adult friends love this game.  Our children, however, do not know a lot of the answers.  Very small and compact. You can carry it anywhere with you.	1
This was easy to put together! It looks just as good as the Melissa and Doug Easel and just as sturdy. My son, 3, loves it and we use it often. He enjoys painting standing up. I think we will use this for a long time.	1
The chalkboard is just OK.	1
Great easel!  Love that the height is adjustable so it can grow with our child!	1
This easel is great for my grandchildren aged 5 - 11. They've spent hours using it, and it's always the first thing they want to do when they come to visit. It assembled very easily, and the trays hold markers, chalk, and paints with ease.	1
Without a doubt, big hit with my 4 yr old granddaughter.	1
I had had my eye on this for a few months, after getting a great deal on the accessory set.  This ended up being a lightning deal on Prime day so I jumped at it! My 2 year old son (26 mos at time of writing) loves this thing!  Every morning, it's the first thing he does. The dry erase board is so easy to clean, he does it himself.  The chalk board is great too, for not being slate. I was a little intimidated by the assembly, but it's just screws and plastic bolts, so on paper, very simple.  However, so many of the plastic bolts were impossible to get on straight and tighten all the way, assembly took much longer than it should have. Once I finally got all bolts tightened enough to make the easel safe, it was actually quite sturdy. It is height adjustable in that you can assemble it by putting the boards and trays at 3 different heights.  My son is a tiny guy and the lowest assembly is good for him. It comes with a big, heavy roll of paper that is stored on a spindle inside the easel.  The rod comes loose a little too easily and my toddler has knocked it out on his own.	1
My daughter is quite the little artist. I came across this easel and thought it would make the perfect gift for er birthday! When she opened it she was SO excited! This a great product. It is high quality and very sturdy. The adjustability of the trays, white board, and chalk board are terrific and one of m favorite parts about this product. The two trays are large and have very well-designed compartments. Assembling the easel was not difficult it just took some time. The height is adjustable as well which is really nice. My daughter has sent hours coloring and painting and even retending to play school with her baby brother! I am so pleased with this product and I would recommend it to any parent!	1
Has everything I was looking for. Plus a place for 4 paint pots (we got the Melissa and Doug ones), brushes, a deep storage tray on the other side and paper roll cutter and clips to hold the paper roll. Love this easel! Been buying them for all my friends' kids, too.	1
This is a sturdy easel. The magnetic board, chalk board and paper roll really bring it together to make a great unit. I found it a bit difficult to put together. I gave it 4 stars because the paint tray is not easily removable. You have to remove screws to take the paint tray out to clean it. They should make the paint tray a drop in part that can be pulled out for easy cleaning.	1
Bought this for our homeschool room and we really love it. It was easy to put together and is very well thought-out. The height of the boards is adjustable so it will grow with our kids. I love that it has so many uses (chalkboard, we use it with magnetic letters/numbers, easel for painting/drawing, white board, etc). I am very pleased with this purchase and it seems like it will last for a long time!	1
I got this easel a couple of months ago based on the fact that it is an Alex product (love this brand!) and it is one of the few easels out on the market with a blackboard and a dry erase board. So far, my kids love this easel and I am so glad that it has the dry erase portion. My youngest has issues with math, and since he loves using the board, I have an easier time getting him to concentrate and become excited about practicing math.  To go with the easel, I got the Alex Ultimate Accessories Painting pack and it works wonderfully with this easel. Highly recommend this easel.	1
My daughter received this for christmas this year and loves it soooo much! It is nice quality, and will work at several heights, so will be great for years. She must use this thing 10X a day!	1
My granddaughter got this easel for Christmas and it was an instant hit.  It's pricy, but very sturdy. It was easy to assemble and I can see that this will be something that will be used well past when she starts school (for playing school etc).  For now (she's just under 2 years) it is currently being used by her for "art work" and "design" projects LOL, and the white board for magnetic letters numbers etc. Using markers of the white board will be for when she gets older. She uses it every day without being directed as well.  Very worthwhile purchase. We paid $99.00 in December 2013, but price has risen by 15% as of this post.	1
I searched long and hard for the "perfect" easel.  This was about as close as I could find without breaking the bank.  I bought this for my 6 year old whose 44" tall.  The Good: Adjustable height - this size is perfect.  She will be able to use this for a long time - even though we do have it at 48". Folds up - I have to be able to fold this up to put it away when we aren't using it.  It's not compact by any means but I've seen some where the brace that holds them open is screwed it and you can't fold them. Magnetic white board - amazing that this is not a standard feature on every white board. Large trays - for holding all the paint, pens, and supplies. Standard 18" width paper, and a nice size so you don't run out. Melissa and Doug no spill paint cups fit perfectly in the 4 holes. The quality seems pretty good to me.  The legs are solid and the trays are not flimsy.  Of course if someone tried to climb it, well, parts might break.  The Bad: Missing parts - 10 screws and 2 wooden dowels.  Box was intact too.  We called them and they shipped up replacements. It only comes with 2 puny little clips.  They work ok but I had to add some larger chip clips to hold individual sheets of paper securely for my aggressive painter. Chalk board is not very good.  We used liquid chalk pens thinking those would be easier to remove (after I saw bad reviews about the board).  Used 1 time and now there are permanent hearts and flowers on it that I can not get off.  I'll have to get some of that chalkboard paint and see if I can repaint it. Paint / markers will stain the light wood.  I don't really care about that but you might.  Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and my daughter loves it.  We will be able to use it for many art projects.	1
This easel has a chalkboard, a dry erase board and a spool for paper, like many other easels that are available.  But we chose this easel because the dry erase board is also a magnetic board.  And let me tell you, the magnetic board is a big hit with our child.  She likes to put her magnets on the board (we have the Curious George magnetic set [also an Amazon purchase], for example) and tell stories about them.  And, we use the magnetic board to help teach our child her letters and numbers as well.  As for the spool/paper-  the design works well.  And my daughter loves to draw on the paper.  Another nice thing about the easel is that it is largely made of wood.  So, it looks a lot nicer than some easels on the market.  And, it feels sturdy.  Finally, another nice feature is that you can adjust the height of the chalkboard and dry erase board/magnetic board as your child gets taller.  Instructions for assembly were not a model of clarity but nevertheless, we figured it out and it took less than 1/2 hour to put it together.  Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase.	1
The only MAGNETIC easel I could find for a reasonable price.  The instructions are not the best, they don't tell you to do things in the correct order, but it's pretty easy to figure out.  My kids love it and use it all the time.  My 4 year old writes her name and all the letters all day long.  It's great for fun teaching!!  I would buy again!!!	1
I purchased this for my kid's birthday after carefully reviewing the different options on Amazon.  It was the most expensive easel but the only one that combined white board, black board and magnetic board.  There are so many things wrong with this item that I returned it to Amazon after a few weeks.  Most of these issues are, in my opinion, related to poor product design.  If ALEX TOYS goes back to the drawing board, literally, and fixes these design flaws, they could have a winner on their hands despite the higher price tag.  WOOD FRAME The whole easel is made of untreated, unstained natural wood. This looked great on paper... but is a horrible idea: any kind of pen or chalk will write on it and the ink from even the most washable pens will stain the wood permanently.  Within the first 3 days, the easel was covered in little color marks that are very upsetting considering the price paid.  You may not care (after all, it's a drawing easel), but in my opinion this makes it look very dirty and cheap. A workaround could be to coat or stain the whole easel.  TRAYS The easel comes with two trays: a blue and a red one. They are made of relatively sturdy plastic, but there are only two little holes on the red tray used to attach it to the frame and they are too close to the border.  As a result, and unless your kid is old enough to never ever push downward on the dray, it's not a question of if, but just when it will break. Mine broke within the first 24 hours.  BLACK BOARD Even after having seasoned the black board as indicated several times, I could still not get it to work properly.  I'm not sure if it's because it's a low quality board, but the bottom line is that my kid never used it because no amount of chalk will make a drawing contrasted enough to visually stand out.  PAPER ROLL There's a slit at the bottom of the white board to hold the paper from the roll in place . However, it's not flush with the board, which makes it almost impossible to drive the paper inside of it.  I've tried four or five times, each time tearing the paper, then I gave up. This is the biggest defect in my opinion, and something so easy to redesign that it can only mean that ALEX TOYS hasn't tested their product in real conditions.  ASSEMBLY Not complicated, but very time consuming and frustrating.  Depending on the height at which you want to fix the white and black boards, you need to use different size bolts, and the user's manual does a terrible job at clarifying which ones to use.  BOTTOM LINE I was willing to pay a higher price for a good looking, high quality easel. What a mistake... Ikea's easel ([...]) is much simpler, much higher quality, doesn't require any assembly, has the same feature (except for the magnetic board) ... and only costs $14.99!	-1
I wanted an easel with a dry erase board that was also magnetic surface. I figured my kids (4 & 2 now, 2 & 12 mo when I bought this) wouldn't use the dry erase feature until they were older, but might enjoy a place to play with their plastic magnet letters and other magnet toys. Well, they really haven't done either. No dry erase markers, and no magnets. Instead I attach a big sheet of paper to each side and they paint or color with crayons or markers (both washable.)  I won't say they've never used magnets or dry earse markers or chalk, I just mean the vast majority of the times they use the eaasel, they want paper on it. And the paper grasp clips that come with the easel are pitiful, crappy things. I use large sized "chip clips" and the jumbo office binder clips to keep the paper in place. Like other reviewers I've had an issue with the screw peg caps coming off, and never going back on. I guess the threading is stripped, as ridiculous as that seems to me based on the gentle way in which they have been utilized by us. Again, I just think they are really crappy to begin with, like they were a designers last minute decorative touch that lacks any reasonable hardware functionality. Having said all that, I will also say that my kids enjoy the easel. it's a great creative outlet for them, and it is not in danger of collapsing or toppling over or anything similar, as far as I can tell. Also it's aesthetically pleasing, which for me means it's a traditional looking wooden easel instead of a big, unsightly hunk of molded plastic. It's a shame they cut corners on the quality of a few small features.	1
The only thing I can think of when looking at this is - MESSY!! But I have bought this for other people's tots and they love it. I don't know, with the warm weather coming up, this could become an outdoor activity. They can paint the birds and the trees and starry nighttime sky. But make sure you bring it inside after use, the wood frame will get warped from the weather. This easel comes with a roll of paper and easel clips but no paint and no drop cloth, which is an absolute must!  Reviewed by[...]	1
Breyer has the quality and beauty that my grand daughters love and expect. I know that it is a gift that they will love, collect, and pass on. Not a toss-a-way toy.	1
This is my favorite family game! My 5 & 14 year old girls love it too! Many new games are fad related or knock-offs of existing games. This rises to the top. It ranks up there with the bigger board games, but it is not so long & complicated! Been to or are going to Disneyland or Disney World... an ABSOLUTE MUST!	1
We bought this cute Disney board game a few years back to use for our family game nights when my son was in his late teens and my daughter in her early 20's. It has held up really well with much use since then.  This is a game for all ages, and it is particularly aimed at fans of the Disney amusement parks. As board games go, the rules for this one are fairly easy to learn. The size of the board spaces are a bit small, but that has not bothered us since we have had no small children playing with us.  We love the way the board looks like a real map of Disneyland. Yes, we would have preferred it be a map of Magic Kingdom at Disney World, but we are fans of Disneyland, too, so it is fine with us given that both parks share many of the same attractions.	1
I can't believe I found this game ... Great concept to get little ones ready for Disney World.  My boys are 3 and 5 and love setting up the game that comes with very detailed 3D game pieces that resemble familiar rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, Haunted Mansion, and the Castle.  Of course, my 3 year old needs assistance to play the game.  We play a different version where everyone's attraction cards are played face up to help my boys navigate around the board better.  You can also use the railroad track to move from attraction to attraction.  The event cards can really put a twist on the game by moving another player to a destination away from their select attraction cards or to gain another turn or to move up a certain number of spaces.  The spaces (stepping stones) to move around the park should be visually larger, especially for Grandmas.  A must have for any Disney fan!	1
Our 7 yr old and 12 yr old love playing this game, and it's perfectly fine for us to play along	1
Our kids love setting up the board and dreaming about our visit to WDW.  It was a great way for our 12 & 13 year old girls to prepare for the trip and the layout of the park.  We love the game but were confused because it has some of the Disneyland features and not the Disney World.	1
I knew my daughter was well under the recommended age for this product but she loves Disneyland so I thought this would be a nice gift to play as a family. The board is beautiful which makes things fun. The problem mostly is that my daughter is too young for this game. She gets the "Attraction" cards and doesn't want to go there, she wants to go where SHE wants to on the board. In a couple of years this will probably be one of her favorite games. I would recommend this game to families who enjoy Disneyland/Disneyworld and who have children within the recommended age range.	1
I'm not sure why so many reviewers think this game is hard to learn or complicated...? It's pretty simple: be the first to visit all 5 attractions and get out of the park. My sons were 3 and 4 1/2 when I bought this game. I didn't expect my 3-yr-old to really get it--and he doesn't--but he loves getting the cards and walking his "family" around the board anyway. My 4-yr-old, however, loves this game and we played every day when I first bought it.  We did adjust the rules at first so he could play with the cards face up. He didn't really understand the concept of making it *harder* for me to win. He was simply focusing on his own efforts to win. However, he has learned about strategy now, so we can play with our cards face down. He loves to send me to the information center or to the electrical light parade when I don't want to be there! He's also learning a valuable lesson in good sportsmanship that he can be sent to undesirable spaces too. And since there are several ways to get around the park, like walking or taking the train, he's learned to count spaces really think about the best way to get from A to B. He also has to add when he gets a card that allows him to move additional spaces.  The board spaces are tiny, that's true. And I think the cute 3-D board pieces that mark some of the more popular rides at the park are a little bulky and not really necessary. They look good, but they just get in the way. Sometimes we just don't set them up. But I think the board looks enough like the real Disney park maps to be realistic.  As for the comment about the board being Disneyland rather than the Magic Kingdom in Disney World, does it really matter? I've been to both parks many times (as have my sons, which is a big factor in why they like this game so much I'm sure!) and there are attractions from both on the board. I agree it's the Disneyland castle. Additionally, Small World is in the back of the park by itself rather than in Fantasyland and the monorail is an "attraction." However, there's no Matterhorn. On the other hand, as in Disney World, the board shows the Pooh ride is in Fantasyland, the roller coaster in Toontown is Goofy's Barnstormer, and Tomorrowland has the TTA.  I think a Disney fan can't help but love this game! A non-Disney fan or a kid who hasn't been to a Disney park may not enjoy it as much. I've played with other adults in my family, and it can get pretty competitive! I especially like that doesn't take long to finish, usually about 30 minutes. I love this game!	1
have older version-fun for kids and adults.  Bet this version is more fun, but kids under 5 or 6 will no t be fast enough.	1
Girls enjoy it; boys love it.  I use this at school as a reward or time filler if we have a few minutes to spare.  2 wishes for future models: adjust the volume more and include a variable timer.  Sometimes it seems like it's the game that never ends.  But the kids love it.  They don't realize it's educational - memory, sound awareness, attending, fast reflexes.	1
Great game to quickly pull out and have a couple rounds of good family fun.  We've had our game over 2 years.  It takes a 'whacing' and keeps on going.  Both my 5 and 2-yr olds enjoy playing it.  Granted the 2-yr old doesn't understand the rules yet, but that doesn't stop her from joining in the fun.  It's nice to have a game that the entire family can sit down and play.  Plus the kids' friends enjoy playing it as well; it takes no time to explain before they are off and playing.  The game helps to teach focus by the kids concentrating on the lights and/or sounds. It's also great for hand-eye coordination.	1
I originally wanted to get the mat version but I got this game off ebay for $10. my 3 year old has a lot of fun with this game. So far we have no issues with this toy. Not sure how much the pervious owner played with it, but between us and them it's holding up well.	1
This is one of those games that I bought on a whim to put under the Christmas tree a few years ago - I found it at a great price on Amazon.  My children are now 9, 8 and 5, and this for whatever reason) has remained a consistent favorite.  It has a few big pieces, so it is not easy to lose them.  The game has worked beautifully since day one.  The games are quick and easy, and my children and their friends always pull it out on play dates.  I guess sometimes simple is just better.  Definitely worth every penny!!	1
We've had this game for quite awhile.  It's a gas.  You have a hammer, you pick one of the silly little moles in front of you to whack, you turn the game on to either solo, easy or hard and go at her.  The easy game the moles helmets light up and you have a distinct sound that signals you're mole is lighting.  On the hard game there is no light and the game makes the sound of your mole to signal the whacking.  The game keeps score for you.  Everytime you whack correctly you are awarded points, every time you whack incorrectly the game deducts points.  You play to 100 to win, there are bonus whacks announced and anyone can whack their mole.  The sounds are all different and silly, barking dog, meowing cat, yoo hoo, a silly boingy sound.  The sounds change per mole whenever you play, you won't have the same sound each time, causing you to really pay attention.  We have been whacking on this game for about 3 years now.  I've yet to change the batteries.  My son, at 7, is probably too old for it now, but it still makes us giggle on a rainy afternoon.  If you have aggressive children you may want to think twice about handing them a hammer and encouraging them to whack the moles.  Also if you have poor sports you may want to set up some hammer ground rules.  After 3 years of whacking we still have the game and hammers intact.	1
We got Whac-A-Mole as one of my 3 year old daughter's first games. It is really easy for her to understand what she is supposed to do and she has a blast playing with it. It teaches hand eye coordination as well as listening skills...I had no idea games like this had educational value, so I was impressed. I was looking for a toy my daughter could understand and play on her own at times, so I am pleased that she can get alot more out of this game than I bargained for. I would highly recommend this game.	1
I bought this game because i have a 2 year old. 3 year old and 6  year old and i wanted a game we could all play. We turned off the tv and we played this game for an hour. everyone can play this and it was soo much fun. It comes a part alot but is eaasy to put back together. Make sure you have batteries cause your kids will want to play with it right away.	1
Love whac a mole. Was a little concerned, I admit, about the political correctness of this toy and teaching our little angel to "whac" things, especially with a new baby sister in the house, but the moles are so cute and funny, and the hammers so light, it's obvious that it doesn't hurt, and of course "the moles aren't real". I like the fact that there are different difficulty levels, but wish that the volume was a little louder (yes, I said LOUDER - hard for even me to believe) because with all the hilarity going on, is sometimes very hard to hear your mole. But overall, very very fun.	1
My grandchildren loved their Whac a mole.  All three of them could play together, or just one could play.  It makes a lot of noise, but I consider that payback to my son.	1
Cute game; daughter loves it.  Can play with people or alone.  I don't know how long it will hold her interest since she only got it a short while ago, but so far, she seems to enjoy it.  I wouldn't pay more than $15 or so for it though.  I feel like that about most toys out today!  Some are just way to pricey...not worth it.	1
My four year old certainly got bigger and more expensive presents this Christmas but if you asked him what present he wanted most this year he said...for weeks before Christmas...that it was Whack a mole.  It's different than the old time game you played at arcades.  The moles don't pop up but rather their heads light up quickly and you have to pound them on the heads with the plastic hammers before the light goes out.  He loves playing it with the family or just playing it by himself.  Fun game and we all get a lot of laughs playing it.  Very easy game for young kids to play and he gets a big kick out of it.  Recommended!	1
We've had this game for about a year and everyone in the family enjoys it.  There are three play modes: solo, easy and hard; in Easy, a light and sound let you know your mole should be whacked, while in Hard mode, only your unique sound is the cue.  Up to four can play and we have played this with many ages, from 3 to 63, and everyone has had a great time.  Our game has had a lot of whacks and still works very well.  Excellent value and lots of fun!	1
While summer is over, we adored this pool for our baby and we got some fond memories out of it too. We live in the city and can't get to a public swimming pool. This worked perfectly for us. It was small which made it easy to inflate in just a minute or two, yet it was plenty big for my child to splash around, play with toys and feel special. It never got a leak and was easy to crush down and store. Excellent value and perfect for a baby up to 10 months or so.	1
This was one of our favorite gifts this Chrismas for our four-year old.  She has been playing it with me all day!  I can see myself playing the game when she's not here!  It seems pretty well made, and the action is good, too.  I would recommend this toy.  It's really worth it.	1
Bought this at an outlet for $6 or 8 bucks.  The name was vaguely familiar and liked the idea of an action game.  We have had no problems for 9 months, still working great.  The time element brings out the competative spirit (watch those fingers).  My spouce and I play regularly and it has held up fine.  It is still a fun break from too many educational toys, and still promotes speed and real focus.  Our 4 and 6 year olds cannot play each other because the older one will bully the younger until she just stops.  Like every other game, parental involvement is needed (such a pity so many find this a negative). Worth a try for a competative, energetic kid!	1
I bought this pool in combination with a fishing pole with fishes as a birthday present. The kid who received it enjoys it very much.	1
Bought this for my Great-Grandson.  It really was his first pool and at 1 1/2 he really enjoyed it.  Fortunately, it's not too expensive because it really only lasts for one season.  But now he's ready for a bigger pool, so that's okay.	1
This is a great first pool.  It's an excellent size.  The sides are high enough to give little ones back support.  Perfect for hot days!	1
My daughter is just 4 months old. This tiny pool is perfect for babies. I hold her sitting up in it and standing. She stomps her feet and splashes. It's just what I needed for her.	1
I bought this for my 8month old to keep cool on our deck.  It's really small - which is fine - easy to inflate (due to small size) and is very durable.  We've filled it and deflated it several times.  No storage space needed for this pool!  It's perfect for everyday use or to take on trips.  I wouldn't take a vacation without it!	1
I was not excited about getting this toy, but after an hour of begging and pleading (from my HUSBAND), I was finally talked into it.  We got it, took it out of the box, and OH MY GOD, it's a blast!  My 4 year old has no problem concentrating on it and whacking the moles when they light up.  He loves the sounds they make and even my 1 year old tries to play!  She grabs the mallet and starts whacking...not necessarily the moles either LOL.  The game is a blast!  If you want a game everyone can play and enjoy, this is it!	1
My son has been asking for this game for weeks, so we got it for him for Christmas. I admit, I thought it might be cheaply made, not to mention aggravating just by virtue of the "whacking".  The moles themselves do not pop up. Rather, a light under their helmets go off, as well as a specific sound (for the easy game). For the hard game, it's sound only.  Initially, there is a "sign in" period where you whack the mole that you want to be yours. This tells the game how many are playing (unless you chose the solo game). You are then told to listen for the sound of your particular mole. Each game, the sound is different. It could be a bird whistle, a cat's meow, a dog bark, Duh!, Yoohoo!, Yeah!, etc. You're then told to listen for the bonus sound.  You get a point when you whack your own mole, as well as when you whack your mole when the bonus sound is made. At the end of the game, you're told who won, and how many points each player got.  My son is 6, and is sometimes not quick enough. But this game is great for reflexes, hand/eye coordination, etc. It's a blast to play, and my son enjoys it, too...sometimes even requesting the hard version! (although it's even more challenging for him to play audio only). Because the sounds change every game, it teaches listening skills and keeps the game fresh.  The plastic hammers are really soft, so they won't do a whole lot of damage should your child choose to use them elsewhere! We've banged the heck out of this game so far, and have had no trouble with its performance...it works perfectly.  Highly recommended!	1
I got this game from my hubby for Christmas, and I have to say that I'm not disappointed.  It covers many of the Disney animated movies, starting with "Steamboat Willy" from 1928 and going right up to "Tarzan" from 1999.  And the questions aren't all "Who is this character?"...some of them are quite challenging, especially if you haven't seen the particular movie!  The game comes with 2 sets of cards - the adult questions and the children questions, so everyone can play.  All in all, this is a great game for children and adults alike.	1
Dad  Mom  9 Year old brother  AND three year old sister!  We all love this game!!!!!!It really makes our family night that much funner!	1
I agree with the last reviewer that this is way overpriced for having only 300 questions cards--half of which are for children!  There are PLENTY of Disney trivia games geared towards children.  It would have been nice to have a Trivial Pursuit version for adults--after all, many adults grew up with Disney and know the material better than today's kids.  This should have had as as many questions as other versions.  Additionally, "children" don't find the kids' cards much fun either.  Lots of pictures of characters asking, "who am I?"  Come on!--my nieces know these movies by heart.  Give them a little credit!  Overall:  this game is beautiful in design, but doesn't have much replayability.  The few questions included are fun and can be challenging.  The box is sturdy, and well packed like other versions.  Perhaps Disney will release addtional question cards....	1
This game is fun but it is also tricky.  I have the game in a collectors tin which makes for nice keeping.  I have fun playing this game as I love board games but I can find some of the questions extremely tricky for adults as I wasn't old enough for a lot of the ?'s and then for the children's ?'s many are too easy.  So this game can get frustrating for us playing it.  I do wish they would come out with more ?'s as some have suggested as I too have finished mine.  I still have fun playing this game, but find those few things a con in this great game.	1
the racing game did not work when first attempted. in pac man, you can go through the ghost to eat them and ms. pac man literally goes right threw them. in galaga if you go to the right side to get away (they aren't suppose to be able to get you there) the enemy is still able to crash into you. later, none of the games worked.	-1
So it's $144 as of June 3 2015.....how much will this $10 plug and play be worth in 2020........perhaps $100,000,000.......we are in one sick world...	-1
It is what I expected.  We have lots of fun playing it.  My 7 year old loves the "mouse" game on it.  It works well.	1
This worked well when we bought it new. After I haven't played any games on this for over five years, it was still working fine and then after playing through some POLE POSITION, it started to crash, and every time I turn it back on, it continues crashing and crashing and crashing!!! So not worth the MONEY!!!  And if you're planning to sell it in case you don't need it anymore, PLEASE DON'T!!! The next person who buys it may experience some problems you might not have found when you tested it. You're better off dumping this into the recycle bin after your experiences of playing games on it. Whoever made this should have had time to look back so that no glitches or anything hidden causes the game to crash.  If you want to play these awesome arcade games, just play them on the cabinets for quarters or emulated versions on your computer or in ports on media for home or handheld gaming consoles.	-1
This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this).  I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games.  check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play.	1
My little brother got this Plug & Play game on his 7th birthday. His favorite game is Pole Position, which is a racing game. He played it non-stop. I warned him to turn the game off so that he would not waste the battery energy. He did not listen to me, and eventually, the batteries ran down.  My recommendation is NOT to give this Plug & Play game to someone who will play it non-stop, because BATTERIES ARE NOT FREE!	1
My four year old son just loves these plug and play games. He has Atari, Spongebob, Blue's Clues, et al. I was really excited when this Ms. Pacman game came out because the games on there are great!  Before buying this, I reviewed the online reviews on this website, and to my surprise almost everyone wrote about how defective the game is. "It can't be that bad" I thought. "Maybe it takes a little getting used to, but certainly the manufacturer would not have defective games in the field".  So, I purchased it, came home, got my son very excited about the game . . .  and turned it on. The graphics were phenominal, sound was great, etc. Then, I tried to move. This is were the trouble began. The joystick would not move left. It went up, down, and to the right with no problem, however no matter what I did, it would not move left---on ANY game.  Not just that, but the Pole Position software has a defect in that you simply cannot qualify. I would go through the qualifying lap flawlessly, yet could not make it. It would just give me extra time--but that's it. Nothing to "shoot for."  I personally cannot believe that Jaacks does not have a QA department that would assure the quality of it's products.  In nutshell, you are rolling the dice with this game. I would have LOVED to have one that works---but just no when you purchase it, you have a 1-10 chance (per the reviews) of getting a product that works.	-1
This unique console contains five great video games from the heyday of the arcade; Ms. Pac Man, Galaga, Pole Position, Xevious, and Mappy.  I must say that I bought this unit more or less for Galaga alone.  When I was a teenager, I could play Galaga for hours, and I was impressed by the exactness of the game on this unit.  The only qualm I have is that sometimes it is difficult to manipulate the fire button with your thumb.  It would be much easier if the game was designed for fingertip fire control.  Besides this, I really enjoy this unit very much.  The other games included on this unit are fun to play as well.  Pole Position works extremely well, and the top of the fire button can be "turned" like a steering wheel to keep the car on the track.  The other games are faithfully reproduced to give them their exact arcade look from the 80s.  I should also mention that this game does require four AA batteries.  I give this fun arcade game my highest recommendation.  The installation is quick and easy. Just plug it into the input/output jacks of your TV, and you're set to play some of the classic arcade favorites of the 1980s.	1
All of these Jakks Pacific game systems suffer from a terrible cheapness.  A great idea but a missed opportunity.  If they worked properly (and stayed working) people would love them.  As it is,  there's just no subsitute for the real thing.  Emulations,  simulations - they're all just pale copies of the real thing.  If you want to experience these great games as they were originally presented and as they originally played you'll just have to seek out a vintage arcade machine.  Otherwise you might be fooled into thinking the games weren't as good as you remembered them to be.  They are,  it's just these new cheap simulations that stink.	-1
"It's like CHUCK E CHEESE in a box!" was my first thought looking at the joystick unit that can play - MS PACMAN, POLE POSITION, GALAGA, XEVIOUS, and MAPPY.  All the games are from the EARLY 80s, and are pretty true to their arcade roots --  bright colors and crisp sounds.  Ms Pacman is the female sequel to Pacman, Pole Position is a great early driving game, Galaga is the sequel to Galaxian where you take on alien invaders, Xevious is a shooter game where you fly a craft into enemy territory destroying ships and ground bases, and Mappy is a game where you are a mouse detective avoiding CAT burglars and jumping on trampolines and shutting doors while retrieving stolen items.  They are all cute and fun, and my unit seems to work fine!  But ... The joystick takes some getting used to.  You have to "click" it into position on Ms. Pacman and if you don't you may continue in a direction you don't want to go.  You get used to it!  But it's still a little different and diagonal positions don't work ... be careful going from left or right to up or down!  On Pole Position you use the knob on top of the joystick as a steering wheel!  It works pretty well!  I find it easier to control than on my Gameboy or GameCube!  Galaga and Xevious work VERY well, and MAPPY has no problems either.  And yes, the unit produces a dimmer picture than the original NAMCO unit or the ATARI one -- but you can adjust the TV.  To me it's not defective - just takes some adjustments and getting used to.  You can pause the unit by pressing MENU while playing - something you couldn't do previously with plug and play!  Still no save for high scores and you have to get batteries.  There is also a RESET button you can press with a pen or pencil if the controller seems to be giving you more trouble than usual. Despite the issues ... I am having a blast with the games.  I haven't seen a better looking adaptation for Ms Pacman -- they got the aspect for a TV right! The control of POLE POSITION has never been better!  Xevious is arcade perfect (unlike its GBA counter"cart")!  Galaga plays exactly like the arcade!  And Mappy is cute and fun!  Jakks Pacific rereleased the ACTIVISION plug n play when people had trouble with the original controls, so you can wait and see if they tweak this one.  The original NAMCO PLUG N PLAY is still the best in this line of toys, and ATARI comes in a close second.  But it still is a value, and a lot of fun, portable, and highly recommended.	1
Of course they're great, they're Bee playing cards.  The edges at the top and bottom feel different than Bicycle cards, and there are advantages to that design at times, but this depends on what you are using them for.  I am a student of Magic, and only use cards for tricks, and tend to prefer Bicycle 808's, but I will try to work these into at least one card routine, simply because I like the crosshatching on the card backs.	1
They are good playing cards and they have the Bee patterns and designs but the cards seem a bit off when I hold them up to a deck that I've purchased locally.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are counterfeit cards... that said they are really pretty good cards overall.	1
I was looking for a deck that would be effective for base dealing and second dealing.  I wanted a high-quality deck with a borderless back with a repetitive/consistent pattern.  These cards definitely fit the bill; the backs really help conceal those moves.  They're also very smooth and shuffle nicely.  This is not a deck that you want to use for flourishing.  The patterns on the back do a great job of hiding certain sleight of hand things by making it hard to see the contrast between two cards that are offset slightly.  For flourishing, though, you want that contrast.  They also make fine playing cards.  They're not fancy but they're effective.	1
Like it	1
Bought these when our poker playing friend was visiting and we played cards all-weekend-long. And I remember alot of beer and laughing and poker chips and playing cards flying thru the air occasionally...but when all was said and done and cleaned, all the cards survived.	1
This does exactly hat it says. You float comfortably. It really holds you up and is great fun. We put it to great use in Mt. Shasta!	1
Awesome chair	1
I ordered 2 and although it's still too cold to try them out in our pool, we did inflate them (so easy) and I like the quality of the material. I think we will certainly enjoy them this swim season and beyond!	1
Excellent quality and price. Very comfortable chairs. The key to these chairs...be sure to adjust the straps for the best comfort level. Will be ordering more this season  :)	1
Perfect for the pool.  Great to sit and relax in.  We have purchased four because we like them so much.	1
ok	-1
It works as expected and I have not had any of the ripping or malfunction problems anyone else has had. Also, has anyone else noticed the price went from $26 and some change (from Amazon) to $96 (from Poolmaster)?!!  I was actually going to buy a couple more and saw the price hike. Definitely NOT worth that price. Don't bother if it stays at this price.	1
Meh, it's ok. He liked the noodles better. Not enough to keep a big person sitting straight up but it is not as bad as the other reviewers said it was. I think it will last a while. Tied a floating drink holder to it...bliss!	1
This is perfect for a hot day in the pool & grand kids loved it too!	1
Not at all what I expected! I ordered this to replace a chair that I purchased at Kmart about 6 years ago. This one is TINY!! it fits my children perfectly, though. At over $25 that is no reason to change my review. The material is cheap, too!!! Overall, I would NOT recommend it, nor would I ever consider purchasing again.	-1
Nice pool float!	1
This junker deserves a negative rating.  FINALLY the weather gets hot enough to play in the pool and relax on the new chair...3 uses/sessions/whatever later and both caps on the side arms have lost their stitching.  It literally just tore apart before our eyes.  If it were one side I'd get it, maybe a slight mfg error, but no they both just came apart.  I could've had several cheapos for I paid for this waste of money.	-1
Love this chair!! Got it for my husband for Father's Day and I want one now!!! It is comfortable and sits you in the water!! My husband is a tall man and he fits in it just fine and so does my 7 year old.  We all want to use the chair!!! Guess I have to get at least one more!!	1
Another great floating chair for the pool. Can sit up or lean back to float. Due to questions I've received about this product I am adding this info. -The chair is not stiff, it's held together with straps, so it won't hold you up...like, to read or keep your head/hair dry. It's a nice chair for floating and bobbing in the water.	1
Very nice pool seat.  Well built & worth the extra cost.	1
Seat large enough for larger people. Floats nicely. Cost supports having enough for your friends.	1
good	1
Everyone asks where to get them. I send them here. These have lasted several Arizona summers in the sun...what more can I say!	1
have 7 different pool floats and various noodles. this one gets the most use and positive feedback. people love it. probably be great for the river or lake as well. staps are adjustable. next model suggestion, add a cup holder.	1
Folds up nicely with back and sides still inflated.  Have floated around behind my boat almost weekly this summer.  Durable material.	1
Be the envy of all your friends. I bought two of these because we have a house on a lake plus a pool. I'm definitely going to buy more for next season. I hardly get to use them because everyone loves them. We took them to a public lake for a family reunion and people were walking up to me and asking me where I got them because they are that awesome.  My young kids love them. The old fart crew loves them.  They keep you at a perfect height in the water and are adjustable. Honestly, I haven't found anyone in my family or group of friends who doesn't like them. We had a friend with a one year old spend a day at our pool and this is what she sat in while her little one played on her lap.	1
This was a blow up toy style and hard to position in the water to sit on.  Sent mine back.	-1
Very poorly made. Not comfortable at all.	-1
It was hard at first to figure how to sit into this but once we figured it out it was great. Your body is half in the pool and half out.	1
Does exactly what we wanted. Did not want to sit in a float above the water. Too hot here. Float sits just beneath the water surface keeping us cool & relaxed. Perfect!	1
easy to inflate and easy to travel with folds nice and you don't have to deflate it.	1
I haven't gotten to use my water chair yet, but I love it!	1
I really like this.	1
Seems strong. takes a little while to get used to, but once your settled its great.	1
So far so good with this pool chair, the seat was a bit of a pain to fill as it didn't hold the air long enough for me to close the cap, however I did manage, I also thought the seat was bigger but it is not bad either.. It is very adjustable to many sizes, however I am a bit skeptical about one of the reviews I had read, a man saying they were 6' 1 over 300 lbs, that it held them very well, a family member is around 5' 8" and 320, he was able to use it to try it out, but it does sink quite a bit.. Maybe the older ones were made differently??? Still in the review process as well since we have only had it for a few day's now.. But so far it seems to be a good product for our 10 yr old daughter who is under 95 lbs, and our son who only ways about 120 lbs...	1
This chair is amazing!! Everyone loves it	1
The blow up process needs a pump for sure.  You can not blow it up by mouth.  There is no weight limit listed anywhere so if you are not the ideal 100-120 lbs then do not buy it.  It is really not for an adult but my husky 8 year old loves it and it holds him up.  Will not hold up an adult.	-1
I don't like this as much I thought I would.  You can't sit upright without constantly trying to balance yourself.  It is more for leaning back.  I do like how most of your body is in the water, unlike a lot of other pool floats.  As far as chilling in the water, this will work, but don't think of it as a chair to sit upright and talk to someone.	1
PERFECT! It took me many purchases to finally find a comfortable floating device that actually kept me in the water.	1
wife and kids love these, going to get the ones with the cupholder next time.	1
Well made, good quality. Very adjustable, can lounge or sit upright. Holds 250 pounds without issue. Wish it came in different colors.	1
awesome	1
This is much better than the noodle chair	1
This pool chair is the best one I have ever owned.  Super comfortable and you can use it as a chair to sit up or as a recliner and lay back.  It adjusts so that my 5 y.o. can use it too.	1
works well if I could get into it alone, my pups seem they belong in it and get their feet stuck, but for a relaxing soak it works well	1
It's durable, it's easy to blow up, it sort of works like a chair, a bit more of a reclining chair which is fine.	1
So uncomfortable. I don't get all the good reviews. Kept sliding off and couldn't properly sit or lean even after trying to adjust the straps all kinds of ways. Back it goes.	-1
After having looked all over for pool loungers that last at least a season, I feel I can finally stop looking. These chairs are the best we have found in 7 years. They have lasted 2 seasons and still going strong. If something should eventually happen to them I would order 2 more from here. Very comfortable.	1
This is the best. Relaxing. Your hair nor head hit the water. You can relax and float for hours.  Great price great quality.	1
Great simple product , great fun, easy to use and easily stored away, this is highly recomended for lazing around swimming pools, whilst keeping cool in the sun.	1
this is one of the nicest pool chairs.  I hate getting my hair wet because I dye it plus I hate getting water in my ears.  Most floats have your head laying mostly in the water but this one keeps it up and out.  I also like that the way I relax in this chair in the water is like using one of the zero gravity chairs.  I feel it take the pressure off my legs.  Bought extra for when this one wears out.	1
This float chair is completely wonderful!  In the water, it provides a lot of support and you're able to adjust the straps for yourself.  The only annoying part is that it takes a miracle to get air into those valves.  Some better made valves would be nice.	1
I love this floating chair. I have used it for sitting, reclining back and floating on my stomach doing kicks. It has lost some air, which not enough to go flat overnight. I have had it for a couple of weeks and just now adding some air to it. It does support a friend we have that is 350 pounds. Our pool is 48 inches deep and his feet don't touch the bottom of the pool when we are floating playing cards. He is 5'9. I have several other floating chairs that look more traditional, but everyone goes for this chair.  I love how you can go from sitting to laying back and are supported enough to be comfortable. I, also,love the fact I am not all the way out of the water when on it. I am not sure who is blowing this up in five breaths as other reviewers stated. We had to use the electric pump on it and it filled fast.	1
Love it! Comfortable. I can sleep in it! Very durable and will last for seasons. Will be getting more of these.  Can be adjusted for kids and adults	1
I really love this float!  I have spinal injuries and this thing allows me to exercise my arms and legs independently while completely allowing me to float in the most comfortable position for me.  This is the first one that does not make my lower back hurt when I try to get out of it.	1
I bought two of these floaties ten years ago and they have held up through kids and dogs and lakes and chlorine pools.  They are finally looking faded although they still do the job.  I am going to add two more to my flotilla because these are still my most popular floaties.	1
Very durable - comfortable for kids and adults. I ordered two more!  Very easy to get on and off - easy to sit up or lay down.  Edit - June 2014 - Just a quick update to say that in addition to being very comfy...this lounger has been extremely durable!  We are in our second season and they (we have 3) look new!	1
Compared to more expensive chairs, this has held up well.  You must inflate it (no big deal), but it hasn't leaked in 3 years of use.	1
This is a great lounge chair for the water.  You can lean back or sit up.  Very easy to get into and out-of...which is a real plus.  Highly recommend.	1
I use this all the time in the pool. It keeps you out of the water enough but in it enough as well. It's really comfortable and is adjustable too. I reach for this more than any other of my pool floats when I just want to float around.	1
I bought several types of pool chairs when we set up our pool. I had high hopes for the noodle chair, but it doesn't support larger adults very well. This chair will support anyone. It's blow-up, so it takes a few minutes to inflate. It's comfortable and will support me and a small child on my lap. This was my favorite of the pool chairs that I bought.	1
Received this promptly but it has four places that must be filled with air and this is not an easy thing to blow up..... stuck it back in box and figured I'd garage sale it  out ...who wants to sit at beach or on boat blowing up this thing for an hr.	-1
Since I am in my mid-twenties, I am too old to use this as a piggy bank. However, this still looks really cool sitting on my desk. I am a long time comic book fan and Superman is definitely one of (if not THE) coolest superhero of all time. This is a pretty big Superman bust and is something I never regret that I bought.	1
My son loves this. Good size and able to withstand a 3 year old's rough play.	1
me encanta	1
Looks like new considering how many times it has been dropped by my children.  Worth every "penny" , "nickel", "quarter" ...	1
Good quality. Was a christmas gift for my 5 year old and he thinks its great. He already filled it too though so that may be helping =)	1
Great for those super hero fans. I actually used it as a large cake topper for my sons birthday cake. Then we pushed Superman rings around the whole base of the sheet cake. Looked professional.	1
This was a great gift for Xmas sturdy and a nice surprise got it really quick too. My son loves superman	1
I can say that my desk is well looked after as Superman sits watch on my bookshelf. The colors and rendition are spot on!  This is a great addition to any Superman fan's collection and would look great in any setting.	1
This Superman bank is a great gift for anyone who is a fan of comics or superheros. It has great detail an paint job which makes it look great. You can also put him with other hero banks. Overall I highly recommend this for all ages of fans.	1
Mama cat and her sweet little kittens were a big hit at Christmas with our grandson-- and great addition to his stuffed kitty collection.  We have two elderly cats that he adores and is very gentle with.  This is a great toy for teaching about how mother mammals care for their babies.  It's also good for reinforcing treating animals with gentleness and respect.	1
We love this toy! I only wish there were an opportunity to buy more kittens.	1
Smaller than I had envisioned but super cute.  The kittens attache to the mother easily and my girls found that the kittens also attach to eachother like they're kissing.	1
Very cute! The baby kittens attach to the Momma with magnets inside the very soft furry fabric.	1
Cute item. Not a huge fan of the whiskers as they are just threads that hang. I would prefer them to be embroidered on as I don't want them getting in my baby's mouth. Not the biggest deal in the world, I think it'll still look fine if I just cut them off. Item seems slightly overpriced, but I'm still happy with my purchase. This company, in general, makes great toys (I've bought before) so I'm hoping this item will last as long and be as loved by my kids as the previous stuffed animals have been.	1
Nursing Nina  Our sweet little great niece, Nora, just turned five.  She wanted NURSING NINA so badly -- even though she owns two real dogs, she wanted this cat and her nursing kittens!  When she reached into her gift bag and pulled it out, NINA automatically became the hit of Nora's birthday party!  Made very well, this cat and her kittens will receive plenty of love from your little one.  If you wished, you could answer any of their questions about animals/humans nursing their young.  When we asked Nora what the kittens were doing, she looked at us as if we were nuts and said THEY ARE EATING DINNER!  This toy is made very well.  The kittens connect with magnets which are securely embedded inside each cat so they may attach to NINA.  Both mama and her three little kittens are soft, durable, and probably will have washing directions attached; I did not think to look at any washing directions when the gift was in my possession.  There is also a NURSING NANA dog with her three little puppies that is also available.  This toy is cute as the dickens and can help any questions your kids may throw at you!  Very cool gift for your special little girl!	1
Very cute and well made. The magnets are completely sewn into the kitties, so you don't have to worry about kiddo accidentally swallowing them. I love this nursing kitty toy! As you can see from the pictures, the toy is kitty approved!	1
Bought for a gift.	1
Great quality toy. We cut off the whiskers though as they looked awkward. My son is very much into baby animals so this was educational for him.	1
Got this for my toddler who loves nursing animals. I was hesitant because we have a dog who likes to chew things up, and toys with magnets + dog intestines sounds like a giant vet bill but I went for it anyway and I'm so glad I did! The kittens are sweet and attach well to mama cat. The mama cat is snuggly and cute. I'm so confused about the people who are unhappy with the whiskers, because they do stick out...like cat whiskers...but based on the reviews you'd think they were made out of porcupine quills or something. They're soft but stand up nicely, unlike the clear filament usually used for toys' whiskers! Even my 7 year old son loves this toy! Washes up like new in the washer, too.	1
The gift recipient was pleased. They are well made.	1
She's cute but my daughter has had her less than a week and the magnets in the mother's belly have already come out of place and are now lost inside the body so the kittens don't stick.  She's pretty bummed because she saved up her own money to buy this.	-1
Looked cheesy . Returned it.	-1
Purchased for my 3-yr-old daughter for Christmas.  I was expecting the whiskers to be a problem based on previous reviews but they are actually fairly soft (perhaps the product has been updated?).  My only disappointment was the mother cat seems kind of flat; I would describe this more as a "plush toy" than a "stuffed animal."  However, I still give it 5 stars as my daughter loves it and her delighted "meow!" screeches on Christmas morning were unforgettable.  Little girls love mother animals with babies.	1
My grandkids love the kitty with the kitty,  so cute, careful though the "nipples"  have magnets	1
Super cute, magnets work great. The kittens are adorable! My only complaint is that the whiskers (which are NOT scratchy or wiry like previous reviews) are kind of in the way. My daughter doesn't seem to care, but I could easily cut the mm off if they bothered her. I think it would be better without whiskers. Great toy!!	1
This toy is super cute!  I love it as much as my daughter does!  There are other reviewers complaining about the whiskers, but they aren't an issue for us.  They are crazy and going in different directions, but they aren't rough and don't hurt anyone.  My daughter doesn't seem to mind, she just loves having a momma kitty with babies.	1
Love Manhattan Toys and this is no exception. Kitty is adorable and babies are too. My daughter loves cats and dogs and has been asking for one for Christmas. She is a triplet so this one was perfect with the triplets kittens!! She adores it.	1
Such as sweet little group of stuffed animals.	1
Absolutely adorable!  Lovely set of kitties, mommy n kittens. The material is very soft. The magnetic attraction isn't too powerful on the nursing kitties. 6 nuring spots	1
Favorite Christmas present for our 7 year old daughter!  Love that the kittens attach magnetically to the teets.	1
This cat is so cute!  Well made, soft, sweet mama cat with babies!  This was a Christmas gift for my 6 year old son (from a relative) and he loves it!  He loves making the baby kitties nurse from their momma and playing with them all.  He carries it around everywhere so far and sleeps with it at night.  He's an animal lover.  I think the kitties are adorable and soft.  The toy seems well made and durable.  All the magnets work and the kittens attach to the mama cat's "nipples" just fine.  I love that it also helps show children how natural nursing- for all mammals.  A great toy for any animal or cat lover!	1
This toy is so cute... There is no other toy cat out there that comes with three kittens but this one. Good for very young kids... I wish it was designed to be more lifelike... It would be more cute.... Anyways, this is still a nice toy that is safe for little children... Can also be used for display... Nice to see a cat nursing her kittens....	1
Nursing Nina cat and kittens could not be cuter. Nurturing, attachment, comfort and safety, Lots of themes to explore through play. Purchased for early childhood learning environment.	1
Mama cat and her kitties are a big hit in our house. I'm a lactivist by heart, and am always preaching and practicing breastfeeding. "just like a baby kitten nurses from its mommy- baby humans nurse from their mommy too". And they get it. This toy gets lots of love from our family. Sometimes the individual kittens get lost and we have to sweep the house to recover them, but after having it for a year we still have them all. If I see the kids haven't played with it in awhile I'll set mama and her babies up on the back of the couch, like where a real cat might lay, and in mere seconds the kids have stolen her and runaway to play "cat babies" or "boobie cats!". This toy is educational, adorable, and a total keeper.	1
This cat with kittens is the best toy ever! My daughter got this as a gift and months later we had to buy my younger daughter this toy because she kept stealing her sisters! Ha ha! I would highly recommend this toy!	1
This is a cute little set of stuffed animals.  The babies attach to the mom with magnets. It's soft and cuddly. The only thing I didn't like were the whiskers.  They were too long and just didn't look good.	1
My 5 yr old daughter lives this toy. Just as pictured and great quality. Added bonus: She sticks the kittens on the shelves in our fridge/ freezer and thinks it's hilarious that the magnets hold them/ they dangle.	1
My girl just love her mommy cat and baby kitties this is so adorable and very well made	1
Grand baby loves it.	1
Twins arrived n sisters loved  this	1
I'm picky about cat themed items.  I don't like caractures and this one feels true to cat essence.  I love the softness of the fabric.  The whiskers are a little strange.  They don't go to the side of the face.  Instead, they point straight out.	1
This is sooo cute.  I ordered one for my little grandson.  The tiny girl of one of our church friends was there when he got it and she fell in love with it.  I had to order her one also.  The whiskers?  I didn't think there was a whisker problem and all the babies worked well.	1
adorable. My daughter loves it	1
Sweetest toy ever.  My favorite!!!!! Helps get kids used to the notion of milk production in all animals and humans. This was given to my two year old-while i was pregnant. This doll helped normalize breastfeeding thoughts about babies needing milk. Great little play toys too.	1
Granddaughter loved the whole family....	1
Bought this for my child's birthday and it is a big hit. Quality materials and very well constructed. They are super soft and cuddly. Now my other child wants the lamb version. Very happy with this purchase. Just want to mention that instead of a gray kitten, we received a black and white one, but the colors did not matter to my child.	1
Such a sweet toy and very well made.  My daughter really enjoys this.  She got the nursing nana when she was 4 and just got this one when she was 6!	1
Really really cute. The kitten stick with magnates, not Velcro. Really fun toy especially for a toddler who nursed for 2 years who realls that as the best thing ever.	1
5yo Daughter loves these! Quality construction	1
everyone and Hunter loves them  cute udea  Hunter hangs them on the fridge	1
My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter loves this cat and kittens.  I read the other reviews complaining about the whiskers, etc.  It's a stuffed animal with babies.  I find no issues with it and my granddaughter carries it with her everywhere.  It makes her happy - I think it's a great toy.  The magnets hold the kittens very well.  I had one for my own daughter, back then they used velcro, magnets are much better.	1
Very cute but not real big.	1
Very cute! I'm so excited to gift this to my daughter. Whiskers do look weird, I'll probably cut them off.	1
Granddaughter, 4, loves soft toys and for last 6 months has watched her mama breastfeed her twin brothers...even mimicking her by positioning a neck travel pillow around her middle as a Boppy for 2 of her dolls while she "nursed" them. This mama cat and kittens fit right into the family.	1
My daughter loves this! She especially loves the cute little kittens! The magnets work very well, and she carries it all around the house without the kittens falling off.	1
Love this toy. Cute, soft etc... We did cut all of the whiskers off though, because they were to stiff and scratchy, and honestly detracted from the toy. I would buy this again.	1
Nice soft toy and the kittens are magnetically joined to Mom. Just a little smaller than I expected.	1
Had stiff whiskers, but my granddaughter really liked it.	1
I actually bought this cat through Wal-Mart.com, but wanted to post a review because I always come to Amazon to look at reviews. I think this is an adorable stuffed animal. It is a bit smaller than I had pictured in my head, but it doesn't take away from how cute it is. I am so glad I purchased, and can't wait to give it to my daughter!!	1
This was my 4 year old daughter's favorite gift from Christmas.  The cats are all soft and cute.  My daughter loves that the kittens nurse from their mom.  I knew she would like it but I was surprised how long she'll sit and play by herself with the cat and kittens.  I'm really glad that I got this for her.	1
It's a cat with magnetic nipples...  what more needs to be said. Our 5 year old loves this stupid thing.  :o)	1
Absolutely adorable. This is one of my 2 year old's favorite toys. There are 6 magnet nipples on the mom cat which makes it easy to keep them all together.	1
very cute the little kitties are magnetic and attach to the mother.  they are soft and squishy.  my daughter loves it	1
I got this for my 5 year old son as he LOVES animals. And he loves this toy. He hasn't stopped playing with it since Christmas. All the cats are soft and the magnets work great. Some other reviews mentioned the whiskers being an issue. They didn't seem that bad to me and my son isn't bothered by them.	1
Wonderfully Beautiful and Captivating	1
A definite favorite	1
I received the order promptly and am thrilled with Nursing Nina!  My son loves cats and soft, cuddly stuffed animals, so I am positive he will be over the moon with Nina and her kittens.  She and her kittens seem well made and I don't think the whiskers are going to be a problem.  If you have any doubts about getting this based on that, I wouldn't fret much about it at all.  The kitties hang on very well with the magnets.  Such a lovely gift.  I know I would have loved them as a child!	1
Better than I expected.  Looks so adorable.  My niece will love it.	1
Oh the days we've spent looking for 1 of the 3 babies!!! Lol!! Love this mama cat! So soft and cute	1
My daughter has the nursing dog and LOVES it so I'm sure she will love this cat just as much come Christmas morning.	1
I got this for my 7 year old daughter when she asked Santa for a "pregnant cat" for Christmas. Fast forward to Christmas morning, and her eyes lit up! She was completely blown away and she loved it. Here it is almost a year later, and she is still talking about it. Except, she keeps threatening to ask him for a REAL pregnant cat this year filled with REAL kittens. :(	1
One of her cutest stuffies!	1
Who knew a little granddaughter could have so much fun helping kittens eat.	1
love it thank you	1
My toddler loves this mama cat and her little kittens! They nurse like she does! Nina and her kittens are very soft. They have been through the washing machine a few times, which is not recommended per the tag, and held together just fine. The magnets have shifted a little, but stayed in the same general area so it does not affect the use. I have always been impressed with the quality of Manhattan toys and this one is no exception. I would recommend this toy to anyone who has a baby or toddler who nurse, or loves cats.	1
Gift	1
My granddaughter loves stuffed animals, and she loves cats, so this was the perfect combination for her.  This is a very soft cat with embroidered eyes, nose and mouth. The three kittens that come with mama are attached with magnets. The magnets are enclosed so that they will not appear to young children. This is a nice time to discuss kittens and how and why they nurse. It is also a nice time to discuss how to care for cats and kittens. Unfortunately, these kittens do not grow, but they remain the same size and do not require feeding and a litter box.  My granddaughter was four, and she loved this mama and her kittens. She hopes to have a live kitten someday to care for and to love. The mama is goldish orange and the kittens are varied in colors. Mama looks peaceful and happy, and that is a good thing for all concerned.  Recommended. prisrob 07-13-15	1
This is just about the cutest toy! I think it has a cute message for breast feeding mamas that animals do the same. Little one enjoys putting the baby kittens on the mama cat. Her favorite stuffed animal toy.	1
Very sweet little toy. We also bought the companion book "Mama's Milk". We gave this to our daughter for a Christmas gift. One of the kittens has a magnet backwards so it doesn't stick very well. I also wish the mama cat had more magnets; on nose or paws to hold her kittens other ways. Overall I would recommend this toy that celebrates the sweet bond between a nursing mama and her babies.	1
super cute	1
My child loves it	1
This is such a cute stuffed animal. The babies attach to the momma cat by magnets. My daughter loves it!	1
Excellent	1
Outstanding toy!!!	1
Oh my gosh, the best toy I've purchased in a long time! I have five kids, my 4th child is 4 years old and was breastfed up until her fourth birthday. I know, I know what you're thinking and how you're judging! She's just a girl obsessed with moms and nursing and yummy milk! lol I spotted this while Christmas browsing and put it in my cart that very second. I *knew* she'd love it. I read a review that said the kittens connect to the mom with magnets and couldn't wait for the package to arrive to try that out. They really do with such a satisfying little tap. Anyone reading knows how fun it is to click two magnets together, add that to adorable baby kittens and their mama and you've got magic! If you have a son or daughter who loves daddying, mommying, babying, breastfeeding, or even just cats, this is the PERFECT toy. I give this 10 stars. Oh and on Christmas morning, when my daughter opened this... it was just about the cutest thing I've ever witnessed and having 5 kids and 11 years of being a mom means I've seen a lot of cute stuff, her opening the cat set and immediately "snapping" the kittens to their mom, and her making little sucking noises, and her having the mama cat comfort and care for the babies, was just SO cute! Worth every penny and then some!	1
Very cute and sweet!  My 2.5 year old daughter loves this!	1
great toy	1
Daughter loves it and plays with it for hours!	1
It is a very cute cat with baby ever ! I purchased it for 8 years old daughter who she loves it so much. They sells a dog as well. It is a nice nursery toy and a great concept for children.	1
My daughter is five and she loves this cat. It's very soft and well-made. She said it was her favorite Christmas gift.	1
My children love this toy, and it has held up super well after years of play.  They like to pretend the kittens are crying, and then take them to their mother to nurse and be "safe and warm."	1
This was my 3 year old son's favorite gift this Christmas. The little kittens have magnetic noses that stick to the Mama Cat's nipples. (Circles on the under side of the cat.) The kittens are small, about 5.5" from tail to nose. They have little whiskers. The Mama and Kittens are very soft and have some beads inside for some added weight. My 18 month old, 5 year old, 7 year old, and 8 year old were all jealous of this gift. Now they all want one!	1
Just to cute and the grandson loved it!	1
Nursing Nina is soft & so very cute- perfect for my 4 yr old kitty-girl! The whiskers are 'all over the place', so I taped them down for a few days. Nina is about 12-13 inches long...I put her & kittens in a basket with a blanket for a Christmas surprise! I am happy with this purchase.	1
When you pick up the mother,  the kittens all fall off. The magnets aren't strong enough.  I ordered this twice because it's so cute, but had the same problem with both orders. It's also much smaller than it appears. In my opinion it just isn't worth the money.	-1
Cute	1
My daughter, who has just turned two, has had this for three months now and she is absolutely obsessed with it. She carries it everywhere and has to sleep with it every night. Even my 6.5 year old son loves it and tries to play with it as often as his sister will let him.	1
Wife here: This sweet cat family with her nursing kittens is even cuter in person.  We can't wait until our granddaughter opens this present on Christmas. Thanks so much for a high quality, well constructed toy.  Shipping was fast as lightning too!	1
Very cute. Well made and soft (except for the whiskers).  A little pricey, but unusual and sweet.  Worth it for a little one that loves cats.  I made a little basket with an eyelet pillow for it to give as a gift.	1
My daughter will love this! Arrived as expected	1
Nursing Nina is the coolest cat ever. she is satisfied laying down and having her 3 babies attach to the momma cats tummy, They attach by magnets. This cat and kitties are darling, I also bought the accompanying book, "Mothers Milk". An intro for an older sibling about to get a new baby in the family and momma is feediing the baby. I can't wait to introduce this book and kitties to my 2 year old neighbor, She is a fan of kitties. she is going to be a cat for halloween. I sure hope this lessens the blow of getting a new brother in the begining.	1
My daughter loves this momma kitty and her babies so much!  She sleeps with them every night and has named all 4.  Don't look any further your kitty lover kid will love this toy.  Great quality!	1
Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter, and I know she will love it.  I agree with others that the whiskers are very untidy and stick out...It got the better of me, so I ironed them, shaping them in place and now they look great.	1
Bad copy of Kitty Surprise - poor quality. Stick with the original, much cuter....	-1
The product is about what I expected. Other reviewers have noted that the whiskers stick out at odd angles. This is true, but I don't think it takes away from the appeal. The mama cat is about 12" long. There are two rows of "nipples", not one like I thought. I am giving this product 4 stars because I would like the magnets to be a little stronger. It seems that some of them are stronger than others. I have only just received the toy, but I will update my review and rating after it is worn in a bit.	1
My granddaughter made a special bed for this little family and plays with it often.  They are very real looking, very soft, well made, and adorable.	1
My 3 year old loves this cat. She loves that the kittens are nursing and I love that she is learning what mammals do.	1
We've had this cat and her kittens for about 4 months.  We have one child who was 6 months old when she got this and is now 10 months old.  We all love it.  It seems high quality, even the kittens.  The mother cat has 6 nipples, all magnetic.  There are three on each side.  The cat is always laying on that one side though, so it can be kind of awkward to have kittens breastfeeding on the other set of nipples, but it's a nice detail anyway.  The magnets work great, no complaints.  They are a good strength, and you can even make the kittens kiss each other.  The feet are a little bit weighted with little balls, I don't know if you know what I mean, but it's pretty common in stuffed animals, and I really like when they have that because if you make the cat run around, his feet hit the ground in a satisfying way.  We always make the cat run around and say "ra-ow!" and now my daughter says "ra-ow!" for the cat and it's really cute.  My only complaint is the mother cat's whiskers.  They do not sit nicely on her face. They look like a mess.  And they are not attached very well.  At least 3 whiskers have already been pulled out of her face.  Which, I need to add, is not necessarily a bad thing.  She will probably look better without that mess of whiskers on her face.  So I'm not too upset about it.  Overall, we really love this cat and her breastfeeding kittens.  I think you will enjoy them too :)	1
My grandkids just love this nursing cat!  They have tons of stuffed animals but this is one of their favorites because they can play with the kittens separately from the mother if they want to.  Great toy!	1
Nice HEAVY chips with a good feel to them. The paint job is sloppy and though.	-1
Arrived for Christmas and discovered that without other sets this set could not make a circle. What a disappointment for a 2 year old. Just wanted the train to go around and the pieces did not form any typ of circle.	-1
Ordered both Abby cadabby and Elmo and very disappointed that they are two completely different sizes/styles. Elmo is much bigger, floppier, and fuzzier. While Abby cadabby is a few inches smaller and very stiff. Not cuddly at all.	-1
After reading all the other reviews I noticed at the bottom other products people looked at...I did not realize until then that The Simpsons Edition is made by another company...Hasbro. Maybe that explains the difference in the quality that all reviews seem upset about.  I have not check out to see if the current The Game of Life (still manufactured by Milton Bradley) is also as poorly constructed.  I would not go out to purchase this game, however, it is a request on a child's Christmas list that we are to purchase a gift for in our family name draw.	-1
My daughter and I agree that this is our least favorite toy. It's plasticky, not very cute and not much fun. The birds are about as well made as cat toys. Ordered it for Christmas, my husband thought she would like it so I washed it (turned lumpy, there are plastic pieces inside the fabric walls) and threw out the box. What a waste of money. Even our cat doesn't want to play with the birds.	-1
The plastic panel side is made from PVC. I learned that after requesting the information from the manufacturer. The toy is cute, but I will be throwing it out.	-1
I purchased this toy based on the great reviews for my son's first birthday.  He does not care about this toy in the least.  He never picks it up to play with it.  He would much rather play with "guys" or cars.  Looking back I wish I would have purchased the "dog" version of this toy as he may have had a little more interest in it.  That said, it really is a beautiful, well-made, "no batteries" toy, just not enjoyed in my house.	-1
I was underwhelmed with it.	-1
My daughter is 20 months and I bought this for her for Christmas and she has never really played with it.  I was really shocked because she LOVES, LOVES, LOVES Elmo.  Figure that one out??? Your kid may like it though, its really cute and is sturdy.  I am still shocked that she won't play with it. Buy your kid the little cheaper version first.	-1
This looked cute in the picture, but ended up being kinda cheap and synthetic-feeling. I thought that Gund was a high-end brand, but this was not as cuddly as I had hoped. Disappointed!	-1
Bought this for my 8 year old stepdaughter. She thinks it is ok. The device is much smaller than it looks on the website. I thought it asked random trivia questions, but the one they sent is about TV shows and my stepdaughter does not watch a lot of TV shows. I did not get to pick which one I wanted when purchasing so I was disappointed. The device works well, but I probably would not recommend it.	-1
The pusher pushes the engine off the railroad.  Does not do turns the weight distribution is off at the connection magnet. My kids still enjoy it but I would recommend a puller engine instead of this one(with this flaw the kids have to be more interactive with it).  Might cause frustration in younger children.  Thought about re-engineering it to make it a puller.	-1
Like many of the other children mentioned in the reviews, my son loves the jet engine episode.  And while he loves this toy, its design is a source of some frustration.  1)  The on/off switch is hard for my 3 year old to use, in fact, it is hard for adults to use.  We typically have to remove the train from the tracks to do it.  The button is too small and when it is turned on, it is flush with the rest of the model.  2)  My son sometimes prefers to use the jet engine without running the batteries; while there is a clutch to prevent damage to the motor, it would have been preferable if the car could have free-wheeled forward.  For a toy as expensive as this one, that's not asking much.  3)  The battery compartment screw is made of cheap metal and the head easily strips.  The other screws use a triangular head making it difficult to open and repair (which it will eventually require).  I am less concerned than other parents about the tendency of the engine to derail; you can design a track that is foolproof, and it is also an opportunity to learn about the dynamics of pushing something.  On a minor note, I would have preferred if the set actually looked like the jet engine in the episode.  I know there have been earlier iterations that did so.  This version smells of cost reductions.  Addendum:  the engine stopped running on Day Two!  I used a jewelers screwdriver to get past the screws with the triangular heads and found the culprit:  a single hair had wrapped around one of the inner sprocket axles.  It is a bit of a mystery how it got in there; the hair was not wrapped around any of the wheel axles.  There is an even chance that this was left over from manufacture.	-1
Sheesh, I feel like I must be doing something 'wrong' because I can't get this silly little game to beat me! Doesn't matter how simple my original thought is, nor how honestly I answer (since you can't really NOT be honest--I mean, why would you LIE to a toy??), the thing gives up after about three questions.  And it's not just this particular toy because I've tried numerous others when I go into stores all the time.  I began with obscure things to TRY to stump it, but then I simplified to easy things (because I was so frustrated)--like 'toy' and 'store' and I STILL couldn't even get 'em to guess those!  I read all these reviews and felt like a crazy person--I'm like the only one who thinks it's stupid and a waste of money and time, but I truly never got this toy to actually guess what I was thinking.  Heck, if I had to try something more than 50 times, and it still doesn't do what it says it will, I'm done with it!!	-1
This book was a let down. It's made alright and the colors are bright it just isn't interesting to baby at all she got at 4 months and it 10 months she still has no interest other then to throw it.	-1
The words are not visible because it has been stiched too close and cot off entire words.	-1
This is much better suited for a 9-12m-old. The bunny and the dragonfly are attached and this annoys my toddler to no end!  It doesn't hold her attention.	-1
I washed this book in cold water in our washer on delicate cycle. Not to label directions. Who makes a cloth book that you can't wash thoroughly, that your child will drool, chew and drop on the ground? I was appalled to see how faded the book became once it air dried. My child was sucking on the corner of that book. How much dye was she ingesting? What other substances/chemicals were in the books pages? I am not pleased with this and will not buy Manhattan Toy cloth books in the future.	-1
I bought this book for my 7 month old daughter.  It tries too hard.  There is way too much going on and she gets overwhelmed when reading it.  At 9 months she would still rather read the more simplistic Squishy Turtle book.	-1
Bought this for my daughter at 6 months and she showed no interest in it. I purchased it for a plane ride where we could sit and discover the book together but she was unimpressed, even now it remains in her toy bin untouched.  She enjoyed other cloth books but this one was a dud.	-1
I was surprised to find Doodle Pros everywhere and no Magna Doodles in stores, so I thought, why not, I'll get a Doodle Pro. I promptly returned it. Obviously they do not use high quality magnets in the Doodle Pro as they do in the Magna Doodle because the lines are not nearly as dark or as satisfying to make. The stamps are equally disappointing and leave only faint marks. The eraser bar is also very hard to drag across and does not fully erase unless you drag it back and forth. I love my Magna Doodle it is obviously a much higher quality of toy, dark rich lines, easy erasure. My only complaint is that the stamps fall out, but we always manage to find them. I would also mention that the age range seems too high to me. My two year old loves this and I love it because it is a good way to practice scribbling without mess.	-1
detail too small for seniors...bought a whole big, boxfull and my group will not use them, need to show "actual size" of card face.	-1
Didnt care much for this one. Hard to operate, hard to see the numbers and they have the suits in a different order than other games, which is confusing. It has no light or undo feature and is just overall awkward to use.	-1
Unit is very tiny with hard to see screen icons. Buttons are close together. Accidental button pushing happens frequently. There is a software flaw that causes the game to switch to a different game, if a game is won, erasing any total score. Card shuffling program often deals all red or all black hands. Three and four of a kind also appear frequently.	-1
Didn't last two month's before the screen wouldn't show some of the number's!!!!! I would say that it's just junk!!!!!	-1
screen to small	-1
Quit working after 2 days.	-1
After a few hours of use, I noticed that I couldn't move a six of diamonds! After studying my hand, I noticed that there were (2) six of diamonds showing!! Happened a second time when I tried to move what I thought was a 6 of Hearts that wouldn't respond to my moving it. Again it was a 6 of diamonds, which again, was a second 6 of dia. showing.  Not a good choice for a solitaire game. Would not recommend buying.	-1
not what was advertised	-1
Returned screen too small.	-1
It is a bummer to have to go through the hassle of sending it back.  My mom asked me to order it for her so it's got both of us bummed that it just doesn't work and there is nothing provided to help us get it to work.	-1
It plays a good solitaire game but does not keep a cumulative score.  This is a disappointment when playing a game.	-1
plain and simple solitaire is a fun game.but this handheld solitaire game system not half as durabile or easy to use as the older versions imo.if your looking to buy this game do yourself a favor and find and buy 1 of the older versions.even if it costs a lil more.	-1
I was looking for a game that had more solitaire options then the one I had. But the instructions were not clear, the buttons click way to fast and are too small.  There are better products for the price!	-1
Bought this for my baby but didn't realize how tiny it was and how many small parts there were.  Would be cute as decoration but needed to return it.	-1
We have owned this toy for going on 2 years and I am not satisfied with the overall quality. The glue that plan toys uses does not work well at all...this is the second toy that we own from this company that has glue issues. The green track underneath the toy became loose probably a month after owning it from everyday use...nothing abusive just a 9 month old playing with it. The balls are very hard and can hurt a child if thrown, but I expected as much from a wooden and supervised my children accordingly. Recently one side of the green track came off completely. I am really dissatisfied with the quality- I expected that any wooden toys that I've purchased would be saved for my kids to give to their own kids someday. My son still bangs the hammer around alot but that alone isn't worth what I paid for this.	-1
These are so tiny! I was really disappointed with the quality. The wood is not sealed. I bought them and returned them but was only given 75% of my money back.	-1
I love PlanToys, but my son quickly pulled apart the excavator toy. That was rather frustrating as these are expensive little toys.	-1
I was disappointed in the quality of this toy after two minutes the propellor was broken. I would have expected it to be a bit more durable, if the propeller was wooden like I thought it was from the picture, I think it would improve the helicopters overall quality.	-1
Came missing one of the chair cushions. Doesn't seem like a big deal but its annoying since we opened other doll house furniture sets today for Christmas and they had missing parts too!	-1
I ordered this living room set for the vibrant colors , I just loved it .. I recieved it the first time an I opened the package an everything was the way it looks in the above photo EXCEPT the cushions are this AWFUL WHITE , RED an BLUE checker which obviously looks just AWFUL with the bright orange an YELLOW an PURPLE lamp , so I called an had to repurchase the set an they said they would make sure to have the right cushions wellllll I just opened the second package an it is the SAME !! An I am still waiting to be refunded on the first package . So please be aware that it is most likely you will not get what is pictured an be prepared to have to get out your sewing kit to make some new cushions even though the whole point of me buying this is so i don't have to make it myself !!	-1
Too small.  Choke hazard.  Should be 4 yrs+	-1
I did not  like it because the vegies were too small and all the set looked cheap for me. The price was too expensive for it. If the parts were bigger I would keep it for my grandaughter, but not this tiny one. Sorry	-1
This kitchen is really much too large for dollhouse dolls. The counter is at most doll's eye-level. The fridge is 3 times the size of the Hape fridge, fyi. I liked the Hape kitchen better because its scale seemed more appropriate, however the Hape fridge is sooo tiny, I just bought another dollhouse fridge to use in its place. Also, the oven door doesn't stay closed like others have said.	-1
Our son got this Plan Toys parking garage set as a gift last Christmas. He has had it for about 10 months now and only plays with it on occasion inside the house. (He got it for his second birthday and was just a little bit young to really start playing with it until the last few months, when it seems to interest him a lot more.)  He has some hotwheels cars that work with it just fine, in addition to the little wooden one that came with it. I have no complaints about the single car - if you read the description carefully, you'll see that it tells you that you only get one car.  I came back to write this review now because the quality is so poor. Like other reviewers, I added this toy to his wish list instead of one of the plastic parking garage toys (that I have fond memories of from when I was a kid) because I liked the Plan Toys company and how they do business in such a responsible manner. We thought it would be worth the premium price tag to support that company. When we put it together last Christmas, my husband and I both remarked on how sturdy the wood seemed, how it felt like this toy would last forever and maybe even become a toy for our son's kids someday. That's turned out not to be the case.  I have now glued the lower ramp back on twice and found it lose again just this weekend. The design is weird - the pegs are on the bottom of the ramp and gravity just naturally works against it so that the pressure of cars on the ramp eventually push the pegs out. This next time I'll bypass the wood glue and use Gorilla glue on it. I also had to glue the top ramp last spring for the same reason. Most recently, however, the elevator stopped working. It might be hard to tell from the picture/description, but you turn the flat black knob on top to move the elevator up and down. It takes a little more elbow grease than the plastic versions of this toy require to move the elevator, which isn't really a problem for us, but I expect it to work properly. Inside the elevator shaft, there is a simple string mechanism that winds around the top as you turn the knob. Somehow the string has gotten off track or gotten stretched out or something and now the elevator doesn't work anymore. This part of the toy came pre-assembled, and there's no way that I can get to the string mechanism to try and trouble-shoot the problem or fix it without taking the toy apart in ways that look irreversible. It's pretty worthless at this point.  Our son is very small for his age (almost 3) and he is never rough or abusive with his toys. I wish I could attribute the problems with this toy to wear and tear, but the fact is that it's severely overpriced for what you get. We won't purchase any more toys from Plan. I'd recommend you not purchase this unless you find it on clearance someplace for less than $20. The lesson I've learned is just to buy the shiny plastic version of a toy like this - the kids like them better anyway. :)	-1
Just really is basic and doesn't have the addictiveness that plastic versions have.  the rampdoesn't cause racing, too big and clunky..	-1
I really wanted to love this toy.  Overall, it is very sturdy and super cute.  We had the old version, where the elevator hangs off to the side, which is still being sold in some places.  The old version has a bigger elevator - hence the "It does/does not fit matchbox cars" confusion.  The old version was supposed to have been discontinued in 2008ish but it is still being sold in some places - we just got it, for Christmas 2010.  Our elevator broke within ONE DAY.  Plan agreed to send me a new part - to their credit they are great about sending parts.  In the mean time I set about fixing the old one.  It's not easy getting that black knob off on top, but I managed.  Basically there is a tiny piece of plastic under that black knob on top that serves as a clicker - the gear around the spool under the knob clicks against this to make the elevator ratchet up and down rather than slip when you reposition your hand.  Without that clicker, the toy is very frustrating for little hands to work.  This is not a matter of a child being hard on a toy - it's a matter of poor design.  So if you're hoping like I was that your kids will be easier on the toy - it won't help.  I don't think my kids were rough with this.  I tried to replace the clicker that broke off with a bit of a starbucks gift card but it broke shortly, too.  (I had to drill into the dowel holding it, and hold it in place with hot glue)  I tried to find another sort of plastic that would be strong enough to hold up the elevator but not break under repeated stress.  I tested the "cookie cards" from our grocery store, which also break under repeated stress - as well as milk jug plastic, which seemed less prone to breakage didn't hold up the elevator consistantly (too thin).  In the mean time the new part came and I thought I would put it on and see how it holds up while I work on a fix for the old part - well the replacement part was put together backwards (roof was on wrong) so it could not be installed at all.  And I was down to one day left to return this toy to where I bought it.  I ended up returning this toy.  I wanted to love it so bad, but the elevator is the best part of the toy, and if that is going to break all the time, no thanks.  If I kept experimenting - I probably could have fixed it.  I am wondering if Ziplock container plastic might work, or a different design altogether with two soft parts working against each other and relying on friction.  I am amazed at how many people report the elevator broke, but they still love it.  I sense a little "I paid a lot, I will love it anyway" or else wooden toy loyalty mentality here.  I bought a wooden toy hoping for long term durability but this was not the case. Overall it's very sturdy, it's just the elevator mechanism that is suspect - although a lot of people report their kids play with it just fine even when it doesn't click.  My kids liked the click.  HUGE disappointment.  If I can find a used one for cheap, I might give perfecting the elevator another go, but for the price I paid for this, it shouldn't require major alterations right off the bat.  Big let down!  I would really love to know over the long haul how many people still have a clicking elevator.  Is there any reason to believe the new design is any more durable?  With the new design, I am wary of them going for that string and grabbing it to see what happens - plus I just don't like how the elevator is smaller.  Even the most hard core of wood loving parents will probably acquire some matchbox cars at some point - it's nice to have a toy that doesn't require such specialized add ons.  edit - yes there IS a much older (2002?) version of this toy where the elevator rides up and down on a dowel.  I have found one.  Why on earth would they have discontinued this method in place of the gear and ratchet which seems to cause so much trouble?  I am sure the new way is cheaper but these toys are still pricey and you should get better quality for that price.  It's gotta be cheaper to make it with the dowel in the first place than to send out new elevators and in some cases whole new garages when the elevators break.  edit again - I've developed an unhealthy obsession with this toy.  I got another clicky elevator one where the car hangs off the side of the shaft, determined to fix it if it broke again, which it did, in 2 days.  I replaced the plastic clicker with a piece of spring-steel corset stay from a shaper I bought for my wedding and which I will probably never see the inside of again.  So far, it is holding up well - so if you have a garage to fix, consider giving that a try.  You can buy corset stays at most fabric stores.	-1
The Parking Garage by Plan Toys was a present for our older son from his grandmother and at first it seemed like it would be a hit; however, after the first ten minutes he just lost interest and returned to his Play-Doh sets, his trains, Hot Wheels, and Pixar Cars that he is so fond of. Since then he has pretty ignored it. After finding the same product offered on Amazon I was very surprised at the high price, which I would never have paid myself. The Parking Garage is very plain to see, and comes with a plain blue employee, and an even plainer green car (whose tires come off very easily). At least it feels good to the touch as it is all made out of good quality wood without any dangerous chemicals, which is definitely something, but that's pretty much it.	-1
I am a fan of plan! As far as eco toys go plan is a good choice. My only complaint: the yellow stain is very light and seems to be wearing thin in some spots (the top where my son holds it). Don't know if this toy will be in good enough shape to pass to another child when my son outgrows it. But that is worth it to me to know that buying plan is sustainable and eco-friendly.  I am updating this a few months after the initial purchase. My son loved this toy, but I had to be taken away because the wheels fell off. I can't find a glue that will hold it back on either! What a waste of money!	-1
My son is obsessed with cars and has the Plan garage, so I thought he'd love this. However we ran into the same problems other people have mentioned, namely that the back gate won't stay closed and the front and back come unhitched constantly. In addition, after about an hour's use I discovered the wooden piece that makes the back gate had cracked and is now broken. This is going back.	-1
My son got the Plan City car transporter for Christmas to go with the road system that Santa brought.  I love Plan City and all the pieces of it, but this one frustrates my 2-1/2 year old.  I completely agree with the two main complaints addressed by other reviewers, which are:  1) the two pieces (the trailer and cab) come unhitched too easily. It allows for it to turn easily, but they come apart all the time.  My son can put it back together now, but still, they should come up with a way to fix this.  2) the door on the back has no way to "lock" upright, so it always flips down and the cars slide off.  This is especially irritating with the road system that includes the bridge, because the car transporter cannot go uphill to cross the bridge - the cars slide right off!  Duh.  Again, seems like Plan Toys would have immediately realized this and fixed it, because it was immediately apparent to us!	-1
If I could give it no stars I would - we have been through two of them and the back lift gate does not stay up - total bummer.  If it worked, it would be great.	-1
Not a toddler toy. The magnets are not very strong and do not hold together well, once you get your train built and try to pull it around it topples over. We had better luck pushing it. Although the toy itself is a finely crafted masterpiece, its not for playing, more of an ornament on a night stand. Would not recommend.	-1
I wouldn't buy this toy.  My 2.5 year old son was immediately drawn to "my train" when he saw the picture on the box.  It was packaged very nice opening it, with tissue paper around each piece.  However, the magnets are not very strong and don't hold together.  The colors are vibrant and bright, but there are so few pieces that it is hard to put anything together that even remotely resembles a "choo choo".  Because the magnets are not strong, my son lost interest in this toy within 5 minutes of opening the box.	-1
I really wanted to like this! It doesn't work as a train toy. The magnets stick the toy together, but the magnets aren't strong enough that you can push on the blocks to make the train go.  The blocks are great! They're brightly painted wooden blocks with little magnets in each block. The blocks are the right size for little hands. I would love a big box of these blocks. My 2 year old does have fun with the magnetic blocks, but there are only 11 pieces and that includes both wheel bases. There aren't enough pieces to make anything but the train.  The magnets allow things to stick together enough for building. But they're not strong enough to push the train. When the train is built, you can't really reach the bottom of the train (the base pieces to which the wheels are attached). And when you try to push on the upper blocks, you just push the blocks off because the magnets aren't strong enough. Instead of magnets, this would have been better with pegs and holes.  I'm sad about this and wish it was better. It's really a bummer because they're quality wooden blocks. As it is, if you try to push the back of the train it just jackknifes. An adult can push it straight without jackknifing, but a 2 year old can't.	-1
Blocks are hardley magnetic	-1
Maybe this would work better for an older child, but the blocks do not stick tightly together, so it is very difficult to push the train without all of the blocks toppling over or sliding off the wheelbase. Even if you push the back of the wheelbase, the train just jackknifes.  Its very cute, but frustrating to actually play with. Perfect if you want something cute to sit on the shelf though.	-1
I thought this would be very educational for my 18 month. . but she constantly hits the buttons without listening to the entire song.  All this toy does is play songs.  How boring and uneducational is that!!?  It is also very loud.  I would get this for babies who are just trying to stand by themselves and who are just started to push things.  My daughter just might be too old for it already.	-1
My 17 month old was playing happily with the table until the Cookie Monster GROWLED at her!  She burst into tears.  Then a few minutes later while she was playing with something on the other side of the room it Growled again.  Now she is scared to go near it. Add to that the legs keep falling off, the ABC spinner doesn't work, and Elmo's head is a very cheap looking imitation- and this toy is going right back to the store.	-1
Blocks are hardley magnetic	-1
Got these for 15 month old grandson.  Wish I had read the reviews.  Only one side magnetic and only round blocks .  Do not buy these blocks because they say they are magnetic.  They are not what you think.  They are pretty and that is it.	-1
Terrible magnets if my husband hadn't opened and thrown the box away, would have been returned!!	-1
The blocks are beautifully painted but to call them magnetic is a far stretch.  You have to hunt to find the positive and negative sides that will attract to each other and if you let go of one of the blocks, it falls.  We will use them as regular blocks and NOT get Frustrated trying to find the magnet that is not really strong enough to be used.	-1
Fun toy but awful design!  Why they didn't test out the three leg design before putting this toy out on the market is beyond me.  My 8 month old has already pulled it over on top of her three times in the few hours she has had it.  She loves it but if we removed the legs it just wouldn't be the same, nevermind the fact that we would have to break them to get them out.  It seems that we will have to bolt it to some kind of platform that she can stand on too so that it won't tip over.  That's just too much work for a $30 toy.	-1
Magnets hardly work	-1
We bought these for my 2 1/2 yr old son. They don't really have a strong magnetic force on all of them. Kinda lame and he hasn't really ever played with them.	-1
terrible product. magnets don't work. box flimsy . an adult would throw them out immediately	-1
This is a cute idea and would be wonderful if the bell made sound when the trains passed it....	-1
Grandson never played with it	-1
Came in Spanish ONLY packaging, and the batteries were dying, so it didn't work well. Package was beat up. Wouldn't buy again.	-1
This product is very low quality. Very low volume on feedback. It does nothing but change the voice pitch. Even four year olds lost interest immediately. Would not recommend or buy again.	-1
The packaging was completely in Spanish, no directions included only description on back, which was only Spanish.  The toy did not work even though batteries were included.  When I took off the battery cover two of the three batteries were corroded - they are the small round batteries so we had none around the house to replace them with.  Very disappointing for my 8 year old son.	-1
This is way smaller than it looks.  And really not worth buying.  One of my son's still hasn't even taken it out of the package, and he got it 6 months ago.  That's how unimpressive it is.	-1
I know that is a toy, of course, but is expensive for the quality. It's too simple, you need record your ovice all the time, don't have a small memory, for example. Ok, myabe that no is a problem buy the sound queality is toooooooooooooo bad, the sound is like a old congratulations paper card with music Do you remember? Yes, but sound, well my money went to the trash. Ah, you just can record about of 5 second....  [...]	-1
I had this same toy from LeapFrog but it was the washing car one. It created large marks in my fridge due to a series of numbers on the back of it that were sharp.  LeapFrog is not willing to take responsibility for this, and they didn't even care to have me send the product back to see what happened.  Dont buy, and if you do, don't use on your fridge.	-1
Other then the magnet halves being ALL over my house, this toy was not a huge hit. The sounds are great, but it's hard for little hands to manipulate the magnets into just the right spot to make it work. I found once they were able to figure it out the entertainment value was pretty low and didn't last long.  There were only a few facts about each animal and they were pretty basic. The main song is repetitive. I wouldn't buy this toy again.	-1
Would have given this a 4-star rating, except we noticed yesterday that the paint is chipping off of every piece that our child has eaten over the last 2 days.  Not that this toy is for eating, but if it's being sold to 1 year-old children, expect it to go in the mouth.  We're hoping the paint is non-toxic.  That said, if your child isn't an in-the-mouth-goes-everything kind of kid, it's a lot of fun for them to mix and match animals.  What's quite nice is that there's no "wrong" answer; even animals that don't belong together teach a lesson of mix-and-match, and provide appropriate animal sounds.  Downside for small hands is that the magnets are relatively strong, and fit well inside the "barn doors," which means getting them out if your a little person isn't so easy.  So, would have been better if not edible, if easier to use for small hands.  For older todlers and children, would certainly recommend.	-1
Thought it was really cute, but the tray part broke within a month	-1
Very low quality. Broke on the very first use - and was not being rough with it!  It was not fixable. Very disappointed since my granddaughter really liked it.	-1
Our item didn't come with the right tools , no screws.. would of shipped back if it wasn't a birthday present	-1
Came cracked. My husband was able to use wood glue and clamps to fix it. Not sure how long it will last :-/	-1
After fully assembling this, I am really surprised that this has 4.5 stars.  The finish on the chair scratches SO easily - I'm sure it will look like complete junk after my daughter plays with it once.  The screws are junk - they strip so easily.  It seems like it will be easy for my daughter to use for her dolls- the tray lifts like a hinge for easy doll insertion and removal.  It seems plenty big to accommodate the american girl doll that she is getting for Christmas.  However, I just can't get over how easily it scratches.  There are pits in the tray, the material looks worn where the screws went in (the paint chipped off and the particle board splintered).  I definitely would not have purchased this if I had seen it in person.  In addition, I tried to share my feedback with the company, but their 'contact us' form is disabled.  Try a different brand!	-1
Broke very quickly. Very little use and my two pretty gentle little girls.	-1
I bought this for my grand daughter.  I brought it with me to Texas to give on Christmas morning.  I was assembling it on Christmas Eve, about 3 pm, when I discovered one of the long screws needed to hold on the tray was defective.  It should have had threads on the end to screw into the chair but instead was smooth.  Thank goodness the local hardware store was still open and I could purchase a screw that would work. I was very upset that this happened, especially on Christmas eve.  I filled out the replacement form on their web page---long and needlessly tedious.  What made me want to scream was on the last page of filling out the form they wanted a number from the BOX.  The box that was pitched.  Come on, this was the last straw.  Would I buy from them again, NO.	-1
Cute but poorly made. The tray broke within a few weeks of proper use. No strap to hold the doll in place. Once the tray broke it's pretty much unusable. The style is cute I just wish the tray was better designed. If it was a better design this would be a 5 star easily.	-1
guess you get what you pay for in this case. Item came broken with a sharp screw sticking out. Its cute but not well made	-1
Put it together by instructions, the screws keep coming out of the tray to chair.  Stepping up to locktight not very safe for a 3 yr old if screws will not stay in place.	-1
This highchair is adorable but it is a piece of crap! My two year old got it for christmas and its already break just a few days later. The tray ripped off from the highchair just from opening and closing it. While my husband can wood glue and clamp it, the quality is obviously not there. I would pick a different option, since this only lasted a few days. If it were better quality, it would have been a great choice because it fits her babies great and it was easy for a two year old to get her babies in and out.	-1
This was a big let down.  Ours was wobbling within a week and completely broke in a month.  I don't know what the material it is made out of, but it almost seemed like compressed chipboard with paint.  For a simple gift, buy it... For an heirloom, steer clear.	-1
My daughter really enjoys this highchair however the arm was broke when it arrived. Thank god I have a handy Husband who fixed it. Then the next day the other arm was broke. My Husband fixed that also and now it's fine. It's cute but seems fragile.	-1
This highchair is not well made.  The screw holding the tray in place will not stay in, the pink plate/dish arrived all melted and brown (appears to be a defective piece--yuck), and I'm very disappointed!  It appears as though the quality control is lacking.  The gross looking pink dish should have never made it into the box.  I'm sure I can contact the company for a replacement.  Who has time to call companies and tell them they are screwing up all the time?  It seems like the more we move manufacturing to other countries, the more problems with have with quality.  Let's go back to making durable goods with pride in the USA.  Even though as a parent I am very disappointed, my daughter has fun playing with it.	-1
The tray ripped off.  And it came without the washers it's supposed to have to let the arms raise and lift freely.  Such potential, but it turned out to be junk.	-1
The doll bed itself was ok. The coverlet had some sort of brown stains on it. Looked very disgusting and I would not let my granddaughter use it on the doll bed.	-1
Extremely poor construction.  Very unstable.  The screws do not fit tightly in the holes, so the entire bed sways back and forth. I am immediately going to send back for a return.	-1
Wouldnt go together, had to return.	-1
Very poorly made.	-1
Looks very cure but no easy to assemble at all! Doesn't stay put  together well. Falls aprt easily. To put together as insructed is impossible.	-1
Might have got ripped on this one. Really basic to the point of almost cheap. To bad it wasn't cheap in price. Expected just a little more. I could have put a wash rag in the beds and it would have been thicker and better quality than the linens you get.	-1
Top wood side broke 1 month after bought. Very cheap made. It looks nice in the picture but it doesn't last.	-1
This was a little different than I anticipated. The tricks are a bit too tricky for my almost 6 year old. And I don't like how hard it is to keep all the stuff together in the box with the box shut.	-1
MISSING PLASTIC SLIDE FOR MAGIC COIN BOX; EGYPTIAN PREDICTION AND MAGIC NUMBER PREDICTION TOO COMPLICATED;	-1
The set looks neat but the majority of the tricks are not fun to learn or to do.	-1
Box appears to be full of nice wood items, but the wood used is the cheapest possible kind and the manufacturing of the props clearly has minimal QA. More bluntly, it looks like cheap, outsourced labor. The angles of things are off, fabric is sloppily glued on and is already coming off after first use. Instead of oohs and ahhs, it was met with, "huh, well that's disappointing." The outer box is not solid wood at all, but rather heavy foam covered by what might be a very light layering of wood. It's also conveniently covered by labels that hid the easy damage the outer box took either before or during shipping. It will be hard to send this back for a refund too, given all the tiny parts that came out before we even saw the outside damage. Honestly, if you're going to make a big deal of these being wood, do them right or use another material. A sturdy plastic would have been preferred.  Everyone was underwhelmed.	-1
Um, well, we bought this kit because we've bought Melissa and Doug products for many years now and equate their products with quality. I was disappointed in this magic kit. It says it is for 8 years and older and it was so completely basic for my 8 year old daughter... there were a couple decent tricks, but most were incredibly obvious or downright kind of dumb. And, one of the tricks was completely defective (Egyptian Magician box's blank rubber disc was defective - probably shrunk while this kit was waiting to sell - and so this trick was absolutely useless)... We just returned it and are going to try Penn & Teller's set of 200 tricks.	-1
This was a big disappointment. It is far below the quality of the other M&D products we have.  I bought this for my granddaughter, age 8. She was excited to get it and tore into it immediately. Sadly, this was the start of a week long disaster involving trips to the hardware and craft stores and more than a few tears.  The biggest problem is the box. It has nothing to keep it closed  no latch or catch or even a strap  so it constantly flops open. The image in the product page is pretty much how it looks all the time  ajar with the contents spilling out onto the table or floor. The child has to be careful to set it down on its side. Otherwise, the box will not stay closed and parts will fall out. This is a serious problem as it is filled with a bunch of small, loose parts that can be easily lost or broken. It is difficult enough for an 8 year old to keep a box of small parts together without losing or damaging them. This box makes it impossible.  The instructions say that the box doubles as a stage, which means that all of the trick parts must be removed. This is a terrible design.  I wanted to send it back, but she wouldnt let me. She had been looking forward to a magic set for weeks. First, we went to the hardware store to buy a strap to hold it closed. I considered a latch, but wasn't sure the cheap-looking plywood would hold the screws. If not, wed still need the strap and wed have damaged the finish, such as it is.  Then we cut a piece of cardboard into a circle to cover the opening in the top. It looked kinda hokey, so we went to the craft store to get some magic markers and decals.  A day and $10-$15 later, she now had a box that will stay closed and I no longer have to follow her around picking up the pieces that leak out.  The box *is* wood, but it is cheap-looking plywood. It is painted black with a rough finish. The inside looks like a middle school shop project.  The box is lined with a cheap, very thin piece of black cardboard that is folded to make a 5-sided liner. The sides are secured with a single piece of cellophane tape. There is a piece of dessicant glued to the side with a label that says Dessicant  Do not eat  Throw away in several languages. Even if you are very careful trying to detach it from the cardboard, it will rip the some of the black top layer leaving both an ugly tear and some sticky glue residue. The cardboard liner only partially closes the circular hole in the top as shown in the image, leaving one more way for small pieces to fall out.  The tricks are OK. The explanations are the absolute minimum. Many are just a few sentences with almost no explanations. She was able to make a few of them work. A few of the smaller pieces got lost and one of the magic boxes fell on the floor and got stepped on and cracked. This kit is not made for an 8 year old. With help, she was able to make a few more work, but they are awkward. She has already started to lose interest.  If this had been my first M&D product, it would have been the last.	-1
Largest wooden box had a huge dent/hole in it	-1
Junky... very dissapointed my son doesn't even bother with it after two days. Don't waste your money	-1
Crap. But 7-yr old Jack loved it. Too expensive for junk.	-1
I really wanted our daughter to love this, and she was initially excited when she opened it.  Sadly, there's just too much in this kit with mediocre instructions.  Lots of pieces to get lost, too.  It has collected dust since the day she opened it.	-1
Purchased this set for son for birthday.  It looked cute online, it shipped quickly, and looked cute in person.  Then we opened it and the real problem surfaced:  very poor construction.  It is a very cute idea but poorly designed.  One piece broke immediately, which is frustrating.  It has now been two days since it was opened and another piece has broken too.  He is not rough with his toys at all, just trying to do "magic shows" and the parts don't hold up.  There are other magic kits online, buy one of those instead this one is just pure crap.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I got this on clearance at a local store so I don't feel too badly for spending money on this poor quality toy by M&D. The wooden puzzle pieces, first of all, are pretty light and don't appear very sturdy. Secondly the sounds: no matter what cut out you hold over any shape, it will make the sound of the shape on the base of the puzzle, if that makes sense. For example, if you hold the octagon puzzle piece over the square, it'll say "Square." I wish it would say the shape after the child has accurately placed the right cutout in the right spot. This can be very confusing for children. Also, I got this two days ago and the sounds stopped working altogether. If I didn't pay $6 for it, I would be pretty unhappy.  Skip this and go for the non-sound puzzle with bigger and thicker shape pieces if you have a young toddler.	-1
Does not come in the packaging as shown and the logo is screen printed on this ball, not embossed like in the picture.	-1
Does not bounce as high as the original superballs	-1
I had heard the tales of the original Superball and I'm sure it was super but this remake? Not so much. It's hard, thick rubber that feels good but just doesn't bounce that high. Oh well.	-1
not	-1
I had high expectations for this ball after researching it online/reading reviews, but it was a sore disappointment. Maybe it's just my opinion, but I think standard $.50 bouncy balls can bounce higher than this one...and they cost 1/10th as much if you include shipping. Sad.	-1
My son loves this toy and we have had little to no trouble with it except for the fact that you can not purchase more slime in the stores. The slime does not last and yes we clean it up after each use, never leave it our and even ziplock it but it still disappears before our eyes! Anyways if it was easy to purchase more then I would give this toy 4 stars because my 5 year old loves it.	-1
My parents bought this toy for my 5 1/2 year old for Christmas. My first reaction was WHY? IT HAS SLIME!! Yikes. You can't let the slime touch clothing, furniture, rugs etc.  Hmmm...  And how do we play with it then?  If I had my way it would have been returned to the store immediately. We all wish it had been, so he could be enjoying a replacement toy now. Anyway, my dad put it together at his house for him right away - it took about 90 minutes. Then the car that came with it wouldn't work - didn't get all the way up the ramp.  They finally gave up on it and found other htings to do. We took it home and I attempted to put it back together (many parts fell off on the move to our house) and it took me nearly another hour.  I couldn't get it to work either. Pieces were constantly falling off (some are actually MEANT to fall of every time the car goes by! Ugh!) the car didn't make it through ANY of the "obstacles". And I certainly wasn't about to open the tub of slime. The only way my son played with it was to take the pieces that had fallen off and bang on the volcano with them trying to make it "open".  He received another HW set as a gift for Christmas and that one went RIGHT back to the store.  I will never buy another HOt Wheels playset. This one is currently in pieces in a box in the closet til I find someone to pawn it off on.  On a positive note (though not positive for this toy) I exchanged his other HW set for a Matchbox set that has been a HUGE hit at our house.  Matchbox sets work, Hot Wheels don't.	-1
-Xylophone is wood and barely makes any noise -Harmonica is much to large for little mouths to concentrate their breath on -Kazoo barely buzzes	-1
The kazoo was broken out of the box. The recorder was put together so that all of the holes on the three sections do not line up. Very disappointed.	-1
I bought this at a store instead of online. I was so incredibly disappointed. I have never had such a problem with Melissa and Doug before. I own a great deal of their toys. this was just horrible. The wind instruments (kazoo, recorder, and harmonica) did not work at all. The recorder mouth piece was wiggly and kept falling off and the sound made was unbearable. The kazoo made no sound at all. The Harmonica made some sound, every time i was out of breath. The xylophone was just as bad the sound was muted and sounded like wood hitting wood.	-1
My son likes this but I was not impressed with the quality.  The harmonica is plastic and cheap.  You literally cannot get it to work.  The eleastic holding the clappers together broke and I had to replace it. The xylophone barely makes any noise even when I hit it hard as an adult. I wouldn't recommend this.	-1
Very poor quality, poor sound.  (Inspiro is better.)	-1
I was really disappointed in this purchase. The kazoo thing isn't actually a kazoo, and it doesn't make any noise, the xylophone isn't tuned and one of the keys doesn't work, the handle falls off the drum, the box it came in was cracked (probably not their fault,) and the recorder doesn't work well. I am not expecting it to sound great or anything, but it isn't even working as well as the $15 recorder I purchased at a second hand store. I am going to submit for a return.	-1
The xylophone, kazoo, harmonica and recorder simply do not work.  These are toys, not actual instruments.  I recommend you purchase individual instruments in an actual music shop.  I had to return this set.	-1
I just sold mine because it is way too small.  The hangers broke the first week we had them.  None of the doll clothes fit into this.  It is not worth it.  Don't waste your money, go for something larger in the Our Generation Line of dolls.	-1
Very disappointed.  Two stars is being generous, and partly out of my loyalty to Melissa and Doug, since I usually love their product quality.  I feel like this was made by a knock-off company!  The sanding is rough, the paint smell was strong when I opened it, and the quality and sound of pretty much all the instruments was surprisingly poor.  Everything sounds tinny, cheap, and out of tune.  I wish I had returned it, but the packaging was so odd I wasn't sure I could.  If you're looking for quality kids instruments, get the Hohner brand.	-1
poor quality. it's a return for us.	-1
Cheap set and poorly constructed as musical instruments. the things that bang and clap are, in general, okay, but anything that should have a tone is pretty horrible. The blue and purple keys of the xylophone are almost identical in sound and the rest of the keys are not in tune at all making clashing chords.  the kazoo doesn't function at all, and the recorder sounds pretty awful as well. The only reason I am not returning the set is because its a hassle and the wooden pieces are actually fairly sturdy so I don't think they will break and the kids don't notice how horrible the noise is.	-1
Triangles are nice, everything else was cheap. Some stuff didn't work. Was incredibly disappointed at knock piano, it's virtually useless. Harmonica is only ok for children messing around. Not something you use for making actual music. Buy something else.	-1
We typically really like Melissa & Doug products, but this was a disappointment. The "jingle sticks" broke within days of use, the xylophone is incredibly out of tune, the recorder barely plays and you certainly can't change the notes by covering the holes. My son does enjoy the "noisy instruments" like the castanets and the clapper stick, but that's about it. Definitely not worth the money for this very non-musical set.	-1
My son received this as a birthday gift for his second birthday fom a well-meaning friend.  I have to agree with others that upon opening it I was pretty disappointed.  The xylophone, which looks colorful and cute, is wooden.  Which is fine, but paired with the awkward wooden blocks on sticks they include to bang on, the resulting sound is pretty dull.  Also - square xylophone sticks? For this age group? Just be aware that aside from dinging up the xylophone immediately, you will most likely also end up with dinged up walls, coffee tables, etc. as well.  The kazoo in ours was broken.  The flute/recorder makes a flat tooting noise and covering up any of the holes results in zero sound variation.  The ridged sticks are fine, and my son uses them like drumsticks. Actually, he uses almost everything in here as drumsticks. It's basically just a big box of different shaped sticks fo banging on things.  The harmonica is ok but he already has a Hoehner one that sounds much better. The castanets are ok and he uses them as pinchers to pick up things. The tambourine sticks are ok. The clapper is fun, and the triangle, actually, is the bomb.  These two are the only redeeming factors in the set.  All this being said, my son is two, and loves to bang on things with sticks.  As this box essentially contains lots of different shaped sticks, he quite enjoys it, which is why I gave it two stars.  But, for the money,and the resulting sounds that emit fom this set, he could have easily been just as entertained with my kitchen utensil drawer.	-1
FIrst off, I was excited about this toy. I am a music teacher and couldn't wait to play with this. I'll keep this short. 1. The xylophone was out of tune. There was no correct mallet to play it. 2. The kazoo is poor quality and doesn't resonate well. Baby does like to carry it around. 3. The recorder fell apart when I tried to clean it. Also NOT in tune. 4. Castanets were nice but strings were too small to allow them to be played correctly. 5. Jingle sticks were ok but require a lot of force to get them to play. 12 month old boy was unable to do it unassisted.  Overall, this set is lacking and disappointing for me. If you are not bothered by what I mentioned above, then buy this toy. You will most likely enjoy it. As a professional I would not purchase it again, nor would I give it as a gift to anyone. In short, Its CHEAPLY MADE AND EXECUTED. Also, it comes in a sharp wooden box that must be disposed of immediately.	-1
I had several issues with this toy and wish I hadn't bought it.  They are as follows, and these are the same problems many other people have had.   First of all, this toy was horribly made.  The jingle sticks in particular were rough on the handles.  Were these sanded down at all?  I seriously doubt they were.  I seriously feared splinters from them.  I mean, wood chips were all over in the box when we opened it.   I know this is a toy, but the point should still be to foster a love of music in kids that play with it.  That will not happen with these instruments.  It is impossible to make any kind of real music with these.  The xylophone is made of wood which is so soft that my child dented it the first day, and all the "notes" it plays sound the same.  The notes on the recorder are the same way.  They are just screeches with no distinction between the notes.  The rest of the instruments are just random wooden things meant for banging, so you really can't mess them up.   There are some good toy instruments out there, but I really wouldn't want someone to think they had found them with this toy.  This is definitely not worth even half as much as this costs.	-1
On the upside the harmonica is excellent quality, my 2 year old loves playing it for his baby sisters. The shake things with the metal in them are nice, we walk around the house shaking them, dancing. The crate is really nice, we keep our melissa/doug pound and roll in it so the balls don't go all over the house.  On the downside is my son doesn't really like the triangle, he can't figure out the (yellow/red) hand the clappity things, the long clapper (red/blue/green) doesn't impress him, the kazoo we thought was a whistle gets little use, the end of the flute came off and is no where to be found, we're not sure what the hallow piece of wood instrument is for. They xylophone is really monotone, it all sounds the same, one of the wooden knobs that holds the one of the red pieces on fell off so not that piece slides around.  In conclusion, the set is cute, all solid wood, but gets little use. I'd recommend getting a metal xylophone instead. We bought a nice one on novanatural made of metal and wood for $20. Find a different kazoo, we have a metal one he loves, it was kind of nice having 2 of them because his friends could play too. Invest in a harmonica, this one or another.	-1
The quality of this toy does not match its price. First of all, it's about 2 inches shy of the advertised 13 inch height. What's worse, the Corduroy we received has a lopsided face and ears and feels flimsy--like something purchased from a discount store. I feel bad about rejecting this Corduroy, given his difficult history, but he has to go back. It's unfortunate that kids' toys these days are made with so little attention to quality control. I think I'll just buy a nice German-made bear and make him some green corduroy overalls...	-1
I ordered Corduroy and received the dog from Curious George. Incredibly annoying and frustrating especially since it is to be a gift for a new baby and it will now be delayed.	-1
I was so excited to get these for our children because they love magnets, but they weren't even strong enough to stick to the fridge!  Very disappointed!	-1
I had planned to use these as an educational tool.  The magnets in the horseshoe are very weak and were barely able to pick anything up.  When it did, it would only pick up 1 item...one small magnetic chip at that.  It couldn't even pick up multiple paper clips.  The seller was great though, and I had no problems returning the item.	-1
Overall, it's fine.  But it's very annoying the color of some the state pieces on the box are not the same as the actual puzzle pieces - the color should match to help little ones find the right state. Plus, it's frustrating to little ones that both sides of the puzzle pieces have words on them - it makes it very hard for them to know which side is "right side up."	-1
This guitar does not allow a child to learn to play and really strum the strings.  It is a push botton toy for very young children.  Its educational value is very low.	-1
I already returned it. It is very small and not good for the children.	-1
Too bad you can't give this produt less than one star! We ordered this piano (under my husband's Amazon profile) once and it came in with a broken wooden part. So we had to return it. We reordered a second one and it was a complete mess. Half of the keys were off tune and not actually fully grounded, I'm not sure how to better explain it, but I did submit pictures. Also, we paid extra for the engraving, the first one came in engraved, the second one wasn't. Piece of junk. Don't waste your money.	-1
Very disappointed in this product.  I missed the return window so I will probably just throw it out.  I understand it is a toy piano, but it sounds horrible.  I can't let him play with it due to the sound and it rattles.  It is a shame because he would love it.  I ignored the other reviews and I really shouldn't have.	-1
Bought this last year for my granddaughter.  Finally have it to get. The keys either stick or don't work.  I do not understand the decent reviews of this toy.  Terrible waste of money.  So disappointed.	-1
For something advertised as a "learn to play" toy,  you would think it would at least play the correct note! The strikers inside are very loose, so when I hit E, sometimes it plays E, sometimes D, and sometimes both. I understand it's a kids toy, so I was okay with the really tinny sound. But I thought I'd at least be able to plunk out "twinkle twinkle little star!" It's cute to look at, but I'm really disappointed.	-1
the sound the keys make are not good quality.	-1
Broke after minimal use. MADE IN CHINA.	-1
It's cute and my 2 year old loves it. But man oh man does it ever sound horrendous. I wasn't expecting a grand piano's tone, but this sounds like the alley cat of kiddie instruments!	-1
Definitely not what it is advertised as.  It is a toy xylophone.	-1
Off tune. Some parts the paint is peeling.	-1
had to return this. i really wanted to love it, but the letters were missing so it was pointless to keep it since my kid won't be able to follow the music book	-1
Awful! It's super small, and sounds like a toy piano not a real one	-1
It's a cute mini piano but it sounds quite awful. I thought perhaps it broke while being shipped when I first opened it and played the notes, but then I read the negative reviews and saw that it was something others had complained about as well. In my opinion it's too expensive for how off the keys are. Would not recommend.	-1
My granddaughter loves this, but it was badly broken on the back side when we received it. That was very disappointing.	-1
Mine arrived broken and had to be returned.  This is a very cheaply made product that definitely would not withstand use from most toddlers for long.  I expect more from Melissa & Doug items.	-1
I normally don't like writing bad reviews as I realize it can affect sales, but this product has a serious flaw.  It is held together by eight phillips screws.  My 9 month old banged on this for a few days (which is what babies do), and I noticed her put something in her mouth.  Before she was able to swallow it, I discovered it was a screw.  It had loosened on the bottom of the machine and dislodged (see photos).  This is a very serious design flaw.  These screws should be encased inside, or have some sort of protective covers on them, thankfully I was able to get the screw out of my baby's mouth before she could swallow it, the manufacturer of this product should take a long hard look at a re-design, as any one of these screws can come out, I ended up taping them over so that when the piano gets banged upon, they won't come loose.	-1
Ours arrived broken and the sounds the keys made (the ones that worked) sounded more like a glockenspiel and not a piano or keyboard.	-1
Colorful very short to the ground and does not sound like a real piano!!!!!!!!	-1
one of the keys stuck the first day I got it.  And now after I can not return it (30-day return policy) other keys are sticking.  The piano doesn't sound great either.  Definitely wouldn't buy again.	-1
Good gift to give X- wife or X-husband.  Sounds like a banging on a xylophone.	-1
Plywood, poor construction, crappy sound, some of the keys don't work reliably. The music sheet and note indicators over the keys are just made of paper, so you might as well throw them in the trash immediately and save yourself the trouble and aggravation later.	-1
It was totally useless for my daughter. She took the background sticker with the keys so now we don't know which button is which. It was a speedy delivery and arrived as promised.	-1
Luckily I bought this when it was on sale for 34.99 and didn't pay full price. It's actually kind of cheaply made. I was sort of disappointed since usually m&d stuff is awesome. This is just "eh". Not worth paying full price for that's for sure	-1
sturdy piano, but it's painfully out of tune and some of the hammers got misaligned fairly soon after purchase.	-1
Extremely small for 65.00. Like 12"x12"x8"	-1
nothing like the sound of a piano	-1
This piano is TINY, definitely not big enough for a toddler unless you want them sitting on the floor. Thankfully, it was not a problem to send it back to Amazon.	-1
The sound it makes is not that of a piano, which is annoying.  About half of the keys stick and you really do have to push down with a bit of force to get a sound.  The important thing is that my 21 month old son loves it.  As long as it doesn't fall apart (like I saw happened to other reviewers) and the keys don't stick permanently, we'll keep it around four quite awhile.  If I had it to do over, I would have probably chosen another piano, this one isn't worth the price.	-1
Got this for my 6 month old. It is a good size for her and she likes to play all day long. However not all of the keys work which is disappointing because my 3 year old and I would like to play songs.  For the price I knew over time some keys might stick, but initially I expected all the keys to work.	-1
I am sending this back it was broken and cracked in the wood upon arrival and the sound of the keys was terrible didn't sound like a piano should at all. It was also quiet a bit smaller than I had hoped especially for a toddler for the age range its stated for.  Dissappointed.	-1
This toy was perfect for my granddaughter; perfect size, colorful, and sounded pretty.  However, as we unwrapped it, we discovered that the top of the piano was dented and split on the backside.  I would have expected this piano to be delivered in perfect condition, but that was not the case.	-1
We ended up returning this. Like others said, there was a smell to it when we opened it. I think that would have gone away eventually. But the reason we returned the item was because the top key didn't work immediately. I had to jiggle it to get it to work. I felt like if my son tried playing with the other keys, they could all decide to stop working. The sound is a very much a "tink tink" sound and nothing like a piano. I expected that and was not surprised. What bothered me more was that it was slightly off-key. If it had been on-key, the "tink tink" quality to the sound wouldn't have been bad. Since we got this at 50% off, we debated returning it. It might be worth it to keep if you paid about $30. I would not buy it at full price.	-1
I gave this to my 4 year old grandson on his birthday.  All the kids were playing with it.  After a while the keys started sticking down.  They would come up slowly.  The color note chart got torn off by his 1 year old brother the same day.  The size was very small.  I thought it would be bigger.  I would recommend this for 18 mos to 3 years.  I expected more of Melissa & Doug toys.  So, I'm disappointed in this.  I had a toy piano when I was small.  It was a no brand one.  But, I still remember the sound and it was taller.  I was hoping to recreate the feel of the one I loved so much.	-1
I've owned this toy for 2 years. I bought it when my twin girls were 1 and they are now 3. This toy is practical for an infant to bang on the keys to make noise. It is not practical for a toddler "learning" how to play the piano because it is A) off-key and B) too small. In my opinion there are many, many other less expensive noise-making toys for infants to bang on. Not quite worth fifty dollars.	-1
cute at first to play with, but flimsily made, the entire top slipped off, i returned it, i haven't had good experience with melissa and doug toys	-1
THis is poorly made.  It should be better given the price.  It fell apart not long after we got it...really fell apart.  Pieces of wood came loose and my child was able to get hold of the tiny screws that were used to make this.  there are better toy pianos on the market.	-1
best thing about it is the compact size. worst is that the music comes out very tinny. a matching mini chair would have also been nice, but main issue is the poor quality of the sound	-1
My 2 year old son really enjoys playing this piano and I enjoy that it comes with a songbook of simple songs I can play for him that he knows.  He is already trying to "play" the songs.  The downfall of this piano is the awful odor it is putting out.  It has been out of the box and open for 22 days and is still putting off a strong chemical smell.  (Smells like lacquer or paint or something.)  I don't like having my son around strong chemical smells.  You can smell it up to around 4 feet away as the air circulates.  The other lesser imperfections on this piano are that the strip of paper that identifies the keys fell off almost immediately.  It appears that it was only glued at either end of the strip.  Also the D key sounds off every time you play it.  I wouldn't return it just for these relatively minor issues.  I contacted customer service and the representative said that she'd never heard the smell complaint (I didn't even mention the lesser issues), although from reading the amazon reviews, there appears to be a number of people complaining about bad smells.  Perhaps it was a bad batch.  Customer service is planning to send a new piano... hopefully it will be better.  I would not recommend purchasing this piano if it is like the one we received.	-1
Out of the box one of the keys gets stuck every time it's pressed. Cheaply made.  The keys are hard to press.	-1
i'm only glad i got it on sale at amazon for 35$ otherwise i would not be happy. its just small, looks like a toy, not kids piano. so unfortunately she doesnt pay that much attention too it as i wish and prefers a real size piano. don't waste your money on this one unless a good sale is going on. in fact what i've learned is all "melissa and doug" toys are small. i mean small for even 1 year old baby. the blocks? have you seen those? puzzles seem to be the only toy they make wright. check out the piano at walmart.com. look a lot more like real, its high (your child can actually sit on the chair and play) and i don't remember but the cost is about the same (or even less)!	-1
I expect great things with Melissa & Doug toys.  That is not the case with this piano.  When we opened the box, we were almost overcome from the fumes (smelled like gas?).  The piano is now sitting in the garage where it has been for the past week to see if the odor will finally get out of it.  I'm thinking it may be the paint.  It is beginning to lose some of the odor.  Perhaps by Christmas??  The little strip with the notes on it is only attached on one end.  I give that 5 minutes before its ripped off.  To pay to send it back is just not worth it.  The notes do sound tinny, however, I expected it to sound like a toy and that's exactly what it sounds like.  I wouldn't order it again and I would just say buyer beware!	-1
I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do.  For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.  It is very pretty though.	-1
Sound quality isn't great.  The colored scale just above the key's is just a piece of paper glued on at both ends. That came off pretty quick.  We've had it for a year and one of the keys is already dead.  My son (now 2) likes it okay, he will go over and bang on it for a few minutes now and then but overall it takes up space.  Only reason it's still around is Nana got it for him.	-1
The piano is very cute but it fell apart as my daughter was taking it out of the box to give to my grandson.	-1
The item was damaged. There is a tear in the material by the hind hoof. Also it is poorly constructed. The wood slats are not even and there are gaps large enough for a child to put their toes through. The slats are also very sharp because they were never sanded on the ends where they were saw cut. In addition they are rough. I got a splinter when running my finger over them. Not a safe toy for children. I am returning it.	-1
Disappointing as screws  template in the base did not match the horses legs. Never were able to assemble it on the rocker properly. But could not stop my two daughter 2 and 3 years old from using it....and that is the problem because assembly is not right and I am afraid that they hurt themselves while using it	-1
Hard to pose in a realistic manner.  Not really cuddly. Looks like it does in the picture, but has hard wires running through it to keep it standing.	-1
horribly disappointed.  I had been searching for one of these for a long time and finally picked this one only to have it break before the day was over.  sent back for full refund and refused to buy again	-1
I've got several of the "Tangle Juniors". THIS one is best used as additions to OTHER colors as this one seems to be more brittle than the other ones I fidget with. The [primary]colored ones seem to last the longest. Something about those metal- ic ones that just make YOU --- and the Tangle --- SNAP! _________________________________________________________ Get a red, yellow and blue one instead.	-1
Dreadful product. Badly made with cheap plastic parts that don't move very well. Even when it is working in the best possible situation, the rings are barely visible. Most of the time, the fog leaks out and doesn't form a ring. If there is even the slightest air movement around, or if you move your hand at all, the fog is dissipated and cannot work. Has to be held very still and horizontal. Operation is frustrating for an adult and takes quite a while to even get it to the stage it can produce enough to make a ring, then, even if that works, takes quite a while for it to get back to that state. Would drive kids crazy waiting and being constantly disappointed.	-1
This desk while cute, has proven to not be very durable.  The screws that hold it together have rounded out all the holes in the composite material its made of.  It has become quite unstable after about 18 months of use and will be heading to the trash.  I had high hopes,but they were not met.  It was used by 2 kids age 4 and 2.  If it were solid wood it would be sturdier.	-1
My 9 year old granddaughter liked this ok, but it was extremely unimpressive. She is a gifted and very bright creative thinker who loves to play gags. Most of the items were basic household stuff, ie; to make the fake vomit you pour elmers glue (provided) onto a piece of plastic wrap and scoop (with a very small & hard to use measuring "spoon") what appears to be catfood (provided) onto the glue--then leave it to dry. It took almost 3 days to dry! She had fun with it for a few hours, and hasn't really used it since. She did ask for help to research (online) on how to make more gags & practical jokes though. Smart girl!  There really isn't much of any scientific educational merit either.  Don't buy this.	-1
Kit is pretty good, but the bell broke the first day.  Also the map has several pictures representing famous things about each state, except for 4-5 of the Southern states, which have no representation at all. Pretty lame that they could not think of any picture-facts for those states, but thought of six or seven for California alone.	-1
Fell apart almost immediately.  With a little more care, this could be a great product.	-1
The age for this is 3+ so I thought my 4 year old granddaughter would like it.  I believe the child needs to be able to READ first to enjoy this.  It calls for lots of letter and number recognition to "play school."  A real disappointment.	-1
The white board doesn't erase well and there really is not much learning, my kid likes the pointer hand and that is about the highlight of it, if I had it to do again I would just buy a white board and pointer hand separately	-1
Not at all what I was expecting. The worksheets for the kids are the same on the whole pad, so the kids answer the same "questions" / problems every time. In fairness my kids really like it but I am not thrilled with it.	-1
not such a good deal not real enticing to child	-1
Cute but in newer dresses and with different names. Unfortunately I already had the version received.	-1
I bought this toy for my 8-month old to encourage him to start crawling. I looked at many and choose this one because of its dual features - I figured that once my son started to crawl he would have an interest in pressing the shapes and animal figures. Well, to start with the motion of the ball sucks! The first time I started it up, it rolled away from him then promptly back towards him and repeatedy smacked him in the head. This caused him to shy away from it for the longest time. Now that he can crawl, the added features are a waste of time. The voice proclaiming things like "it's a duck" goes off randomly without baby having to press the said animal so it teaches nothing about the animals or cause and effect. I should have returned this toy but waited too long - now it will just sit on the shelf gathering dust.	-1
My 8-month-old daughter loved this ball, and we thought it was a great toy for her, until she cut two of her fingers on it pretty badly.  She was playing with this ball one day (with me in the room) when I suddenly noticed that the ball had blood on it.  I quickly took it from her, looked her over, and saw that she had bleeding lacerations on her third and fourth fingers of her left hand near the fingernails.  I held pressure on her fingers with a tissue, and although one finger stopped bleeding after ten minutes, her other finger continued to bleed slowly for over an hour despite my holding pressure on it.  By this time we had called our pediatrician and were preparing to take her to an urgent care center if necessary.  Fortunately the finger finally did stop bleeding, after which we had to do our best to keep her from re-opening the cut somehow.  I examined the ball closely and in the area where the blood was most concentrated I noticed a sharp corner next to one of the buttons where the larger pieces of the plastic sphere come together.  The plastic doesn't line up evenly here, creating a very sharp corner (see photo, which shows the sharp corner and some blood).  In fact, there are several spots on the ball that feel similar.  I am confident that this is where she cut her fingers because 1) that is where the blood was most concentrated, and 2) I had just put her down on the floor (a large soft rubber play mat) with the ball two minutes earlier, right after changing her diaper, and the ball was the only thing she had played with during those two minutes.  I even checked the floor around her to make sure there was nothing else she could have cut her finger on, and I found nothing.  When you run your fingers over the sharp spots it's easy to see how a child could get injured by them.  Obviously I was extremely disappointed by this event because we have purchased several other VTech toys for our daughter and our nephew and we have generally been quite happy with them.	-1
Never ordered	-1
This item barely rolls around... My son has no incentive to crawl or move around because it just wobbles. We do love the music, which is why we gave it an extra star. We almost kept it for the music, but figured we have other options in that dept.	-1
I tried both versions of this and neither works on carpet.  I even tried it just on a rug, thinking our carpet might be too thick, but still nothing.  It worked fine on tile, but whose baby learns to crawl on tile?	-1
This terrified my baby! Something about the way it creepily moves all by itself. It was kind of funny at first, but now she cries every time she sees it!	-1
I thought when it said MOVE, it would move. It wiggles back and forth only. My son is seven months. He would be playing with it, and it would say, bye bye, and shut off. I returned it. Wasn't worth the money to do nothing.	-1
I got beyond the rude comments because my girls both loved the other noises & all the buttons.  Not many toys capture the interest of both my 11-month-old AND my 2 1/2 year old.  But then after 3 days it died.  We replaced the batteries & it still didn't work.  It was pretty normal use, so no reason for malfunction.  Not worth it.	-1
I bought it when my daughter was 7 months old, she a little scared of this toy, didn't play much	-1
Little disappointed thought my grand son would have more interest doesn't keep him engaged	-1
I thought this would roll but it sort of just sways around.  Not really all that fun.....	-1
This product never worked even after putting new batteries in it.  I emailed company to return it but never heard back from them.  Ugh	-1
The questions are a little elementary, and even though it is supposed to be about the 90's, it should say AMERICAN 90's addition.  Very little international appeal on this one.  Also, this is the first Trivial Pursuit game I've ever played that only gives you 4 game tokens	-1
We bought this for our son last Christmas and it was broken within 3 weeks!!! This is unacceptable for any toy, much less one I paid $20 for!! The page in the middle that switches modes just stopped working for no reason whatsoever. My son has NEVER broken a toy and we own many Fisher Price and LeapFrog toys. I tried to exchange it many many times and the store never got it back in stock. I tried to contact Vtech via email and had my email returned as undeliverable. It was a cute idea, especially how the song "voice" changes when you touch a different animal, but with the safety issue with the pig and how hard it is for little ones to move the sheep, it's just not worth it. We bought another Vtech toy last Christmas as well (Sing & Discover Piano) and it broke within 2 months. I will never buy another Vtech toy!! There are much better toys out there. Don't waste your money!!	-1
Only holds baby's attention for maybe 15 seconds.  It does not move much, I would not say it encourages crawling at all.  The Roomba, that encourages crawling AND it cleans the floor!  The monkey song is amazingly annoying to boot.  If you're looking for a lights and buttons toy, my baby likes the V Tech cube much better.	-1
I like VTech, but not this toy.  He plays with it very little, and I find the voice and sayings a bit creepy.	-1
Doesn't wobble very far. As in not far enough to get baby to chase it. Does grab some attention, but not like it states it does. Found it to be more frustrating for my 6 month old's attention.	-1
I have had this toy for a long time. It has worked pretty well, but I have some major issues with the product. Most of them have been addressed several times here in the reviews, but I want to bring up another issue I have had since I got the toy.    This may sound picky and if it does, my apologies. The toy sings some songs. Which is fine, but the notes are extremely flat. Here is my guess. Someone in the company thinks their kid is so cute, that they have to record them for the new toy the company is making, the problem is that the kid can't sing. So that may seem like no big deal, but I want my kids to learn to play instruments when they get a bit older and I don't want them exposed constantly in their formative years to music that is off key and flat. I think that will worm it's way into their minds and mess them up when they are learning to play correctly.    So that made me want to write this review. I know some audiophiles and I am not one of them, but it is really annoying to hear this bad version of "Dinah won't you blow" and a kid singing "ABCDEFG".    So overall I didn't have an issue with the product as a product, I have an issue with the bad production of the software.    Thank you for your time.	-1
Within just a week of owning this toy it started having problems. The sounds stopped working (the lights would work) and then the problems quickly escalated. I believe that when the on switch is turned to the on position it is not making a complete connection. I called customer service and was disappointed that they couldn't do anything except tell me to replace the batteries (which I had). I lost the registration card so unfortunately this toy is just going in the trash. After several bad experiences with low quality vtech toys I will NEVER buy a Vtech toy ever again.	-1
I usually like V-Tech, but this one missed the mark! My 1 year old liked it--for about 10 minutes. he'd play with it sporadically over the next few weeks, but I found myself hoping he wouldn't. The voice is a demanding little kid, screaming, "Outta the Way!" and "Fill 'er up!" I relegated the thing to the car, hoping maybe he'd like to turn the steering wheel when I drive, but the "on" switch is hyper-sensitive, and every time we'd go over a bump in the road, the !@#$ thing would turn on! And the worst part is, it doesn't have an auto-shut off feature. It just keeps making noise! Oh, and the volume is LOUD, too! Save your money!	-1
I purchased this toy for my son's first birthday and have regretted it ever since. I agree with the other reviews as far as loudness (very loud) and rudeness of the 'narrator' of the toy. I would never want my children saying "get outta the way" to anyone and I am in shock that the manufacturer would include this in a toy- especially for children who are beginning to aquire language skills (according to age recommendation for this toy). The most irritating aspect, for me as the parent, is when the ABC song comes on not only is it cut short but the voice singing it is so off-key it makes me cringe. I don't believe the spinning ABC/123s/Animals at the top of the toy are easy to follow for a young child either. I'm giving this toy two stars because my son (and his toddler sister) seem to like it but I'm tempted to throw it away because of all the negatives.	-1
This gift was given to my son as a gift. He doesn't yet play with it, but my 19 month old daughter does. It is loud and obnoxious. It says rude things. It is, in my opinion, sexist. It turn on too easily. It was in the floor and my dog kept making the thing talk when he would brush against it. If it were not a gift, I would have taken it back. Don't waste your money. It doesn't teach anything but bad manners.	-1
This toys at it's best "meh". Looks cool but I thought it would move around more. The batteries died the next day and my daughter who already crawls is not interested in it enough that I care to replace them. We love Vtech toys in this house so pretty disappointed.	-1
My 1 year old was given this for his birthday.  Some of the phrases are rude.  The songs are sung off key.  The rollers don't always play the special song when there are 3 of a kind lined up.  The car sounds are enough to make me batty.  I don't see where it is teaching the child anything since it might say any one of three things for each picture.  Is it the number?  Is it the shape?  Maybe this time it's going to be the animal.  The low volume setting is still too loud.  The only reason I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my son likes this toy despite the fact that the loses interest after a few minutes..	-1
At first glance it seemed to be the perfect gift for a baby with a thing for all things wheels and musical.  AND normally I really trust the Vtech name - so I didn't look at the item too closely prior to buying it.  But it didn't take long for me to realize what a mistake I made.  Yes, he likes it very much and uses it well, and it performs well etc.  However, I will agree that there is NOTHING nice about how the voices speak or what they say - and I would never think that I would have such a 'prudish' view on a baby toy!  But it is rude, it is obnoxious and I don't like the message - if you can say that there is one - I mean - they could have had much more endearing snippets.  There is little education in it really - and the songs are short the lyrics to the ABC song is half cut out?!?!?  I could do without having education in a toy - but that coupled with the bad attitude - I have one thing to say "Outta' my house"  The older version of this toy is MUCH better with friendlier voices and helpful 'neighbors'.  Vtech should go back to the old version.	-1
After having this toy for only a few months, it stopped working properly. It started getting stuck on a certain noise and staying on that indefinitely until the toy was turned off. I even tried to contact VTech and I was very dissatisfied with their assistance. They did help me attempt to troubleshoot it to no avail. Then advised me they could not repair nor replace the item as it was out of warranty at a few months old. I try now never to buy anything of this brand. I much prefer Leap Frog - they seem to have comparable toys at a much better quality.	-1
Didn't roll as expected, more wobbled. Seemed to play the same thing over and over regardless of what button was pressed. My kids were interested. Stopped working after about 6 months, even when the batteries were changed.	-1
This was a pretty boring toy. It sat I played with for a long time, then went down to the basement.  No one missed this one.	-1
Listen to the negative reviews for this toy! It is simply a loud, mindless, noise maker. There is nothing educational about it. If you leave it alone for more than a second it starts playing music on its own, and then doesn't stop when my baby presses a button, so or does nothing to teach cause and effect.  The most obnoxious toy, couldn't wait to get rid of it. Buy leapfrog instead.	-1
Purchased this last year for Christmas for my 5 month old. What a waste of money. It doesn't move around and the sound is not loud at all. When I purchased this toy, I thought it would move around, make noise and light up, but it doesn't. When it is on, it lasts for a very short time. I wouldn't waste money on this at all. I am sure there are better crawl ball's out there that will not disappoint. My son had more fun rolling a plastic ball around and crawling after it.	-1
This is the worst toy on earth!! Both my kids hate it. It scares them!! I hate it. Everything about it. The voice is creepy, loud, and annoying. The songs and cheers are random. The movement is erratic. The "ball" is hard plastic, does not bounce, and does not actually roll because it is weighted. It only jerks back and forth.	-1
We can't stand the voice of the ball. No more VTech products that speak. Our daughter was uninterested in the ball, so this toy just wasn't a winner for us.	-1
It just shakes once....doesnt crawl or roll. Not a fun with this toy. Useless.	-1
Annoying and creepy. This thing repeats itself, starts and stops randomly etc. No thanks	-1
My son hates this thing.  It starts up all by itself and scares him.  It is loud and rolls around without the child interacting with it (interaction is suppose to be the point of this toy).  If it gets near my son he pushes it away or runs away from it crying - terrible toy!	-1
did not work well not fun for baby	-1
Was not much fun for my daughter. She was completely uninterested and it was honestly just really annoying. The sounds were very staticy sounding as well and it was difficult to understand.	-1
This toy makes lots of noise even without the baby touching it. Also a lot of lights. My son was interested in it for a few minutes. He crawled after it and then it bonked him in the head. He didn't care that much but besides the toy being a bit loud and annoying...it's hurtful.	-1
I bought this for my grandson when he was just starting to crawl.  I thought this ball would encourage him to crawl after it.  The ball was fine until I turned it on and then my grandson started to shake and started to cry really hard until I turned it off.  He's absolutely terrified of it.  It's too late to return it so I may pass it on to a child that won't be afraid of it.  It was really sad to see him so afraid of it. It may just be the tones coming from it since he's got several electronic toys and he's not afraid of them.	-1
We got this for my son when he was 6 months old, and he had no interest in it except for the ladybug on top, which bummed me out because of the cost of the thing. We reintroduced the toy to him at 8 months. He now plays with the buttons more, but when it starts rolling on its own he loses interest. He just gets a concerned look on his face and won't play with it. The songs are brutally annoying also. I would not recommend this toy to anyone.	-1
My girls both had no interest in this one.  The adults in the house played more with this (trying to get them to play) than the actual children.	-1
Bought this for my son who was 10 months at the time after playing with a friend's ball. He loved it, lots of giggles and then it randomly stopped working. It would only make an annoying blipping sound and a then a creepy slowed-down voice sound. I called VTech and they couldn't have been less helpful and they don't stand by their products. I was given a very hard time by the call center person from INDIA who spoke very poor english. I was told I had to ship the toy back to them at my cost, then wait 8-10 weeks for them to receive it and log it in that they got it, then I'd have to wait another 6-8 weeks beyond that for a replacement. Are you kidding me?? We threw it out, along w/ our money.	-1
the concept of a self-rolling ball that asks to be played with is awesome (especially if it could follow you), but this one just wiggles a little bit.  the voice should be less repetitive and annoying too.  you can find this very discounted at walmart, etc ($5).	-1
I can't stand this toy. My daughter is eleven months old and she plays with it a little bit.  Pros: 1. My daughter finds it mildly amusing. 2. It shuts off on its own in order to preserve battery life.  Cons: 1. The voice of this toy is so incredibly annoying. I feel myself gritting my teeth when my daughter plays with it. I hate to say this but it sounds like a child-molesting clown, especially when it says, "Rollllll me!" My husband agrees with me and my sister said it sounds like a pedophile dinosaur when she was here. 2. This ball rolls in circles on its own but I don't consider that a good thing. It seems to confuse my daughter instead of making her chase after it, because it rolls erratically in small circles. 3. It tells you to select things but it rolls before you get a chance. 4. There is no way to turn off the sound without turning off the entire toy. 5. The features on it do not hold my daughter's attention for very long. She is eleven months old, but she's had this for a few months and she's never been interested in it very much. 6. It says the same few things over and over again. When my daughter stops playing with it, it won't shut its infernal yacking for what seems like forever until it finally turns itself off. Even then, it has gone on for so long that I hear its pedo echoes in my mind for eternity. "Rolllll me" haunts me even in my sleep.  I would seriously get pleasure out of throwing this toy against the wall until it's in one hundred pieces. I want to kick it over and over again just to make the pedo-clown voice shut up.	-1
I had this on our Amazon wish list for a long time. Finally I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. It never gets played with. IT doesn't move that far when it circles around. It's pretty loud when it does the inner gear thing to make it roll. The lights/music are okay on it when that side is up but in general it doesn't work at all like you 'd think a crawling-encouraging toy should work. FAIL.	-1
My 10-month-old is terrified of this toy and has been since we got it when he was 7 months. I don't know if it's the voice or the jerky, erratic movement or what, but as soon as it goes on he freaks out. Not a fan.	-1
I got this for my son at about 5 months. He loves music and sounds and I thought the colors were bright and fun. Soon I found out, my son didn't feel the same. You get the sad crumple face before the crying of sheer TERROR! We hid the ball for months, and recently brought it back out since my son is 8 months and crawling we thought maybe it was scary because he wasn't able to move after it. WRONG again. He hates it, not just enough to ignore it, but enough to literally TRY avoiding it all together. When it sings he cries, when it wiggles at him he cries. This thing is worthless.	-1
This toy had great potential, but just never worked out. The ball's movement was weak and as other reviewers have pointed out, it usually rolls away and then right back to hit your kid in the head. Also, the music plays too often. My son was learning that the buttons make noises, but the dang song was playing so much that a good half the time he hit the buttons nothing would happen, so I think it confused him. Like I said, it has potential, but it just isn't there yet. I couldn't recommend this to anyone.  To V-Tech - How to make the toy better: 1) Have a switch that allows the ball go into activity mode. This way when the kid is holding the thing, it doesn't just keep playing the "come play with me" song. Then when he hits a button it will always have the corresponding activity. 2) Change the movement pattern. Whether that is just in one direction or not doesn't matter, but it should not end up where it started. It also should probably stay still a little bit longer.	-1
Thank goodness we received this as a gift. My daughter is super un-impressed and never plays with this ball.  Mommy hates it too -it makes this obnoxious giggle sound that makes me want to crawl out of my skin. And it plays forever after baby stops touching it - I don't like that it's not a good feedback toy. Its really awful if you forget to turn it off before baby goes to sleep. Next thing you know, you walk by it, the flor squeaks or shakes a second and this toy starts shrieking. I will never buy this for anyone else nor recommend it	-1
There is allot going on with this toy. Loud noises, movement, different lights and textures. Almost TO much. My daughter bats it around sometimes for a few minuets then gets fussy and leaves it. I tried giving it to my girlfriend and her baby had the same reaction. Wish I didn't purchase it. We have had it for a few months and she still doesn't like it.	-1
This is the most annoying toy my daughter owns. There are six buttons for children to press. Three that alternate between making animal noises /naming the corresponding animal and  playing a song made up of electronic barking etc. The other 3 buttons count 1-3 and name shapes. These features would be tolerable if you weren't constantly bombarded with several phrases: "flashing lights and music too it's fun playing games with you" "roll roll roll the ball gently as can be watch it spin round and round it's fun to play you'll see" "so much here to learn and see why don't you come and play with me." These play when you turn on the toy and when it thinks you haven't touched the toy recently enough and before it shuts off. It is the most obnoxious toy. By daughter will occasionally play with it, otherwise I'd throw it away. Not recommended.	-1
This toy sounded creepy from the beginning, but now after just a few months of light use, it doesn't even work anymore. The toy "skips" like a scratched record in the same part of the same song every time it's turned on. And it never sounded realistic, soothing, or good in any way. The monkey sounds like rusty bed springs, and it takes a magic trick to get the bug to work. BAD TOY.	-1
I bought this toy to encourage my baby to crawl and it was pretty much a flop for that purpose because it won't roll on our carpet.  It can move around on our wood floors, but it so clunky and heavy that it leaves scratches.  The animal noises (especially the monkey) are pretty pathetic and the "educational" parts are weak at best.  My daughter (who is now 2) has never played with it for more than 5 minutes at a time.  It just isn't that exciting.  The only good thing I have to say about it is that she's dropped & kicked it a number of times and it has held up without a hitch.	-1
I had 2 of these things dumped on me, one was brand new and one was pre-used. At first, 7mo old thought it was fun and he would wriggle after it, but the thing is so ADD that it just kept going on without him touching anything, it would roll away from him as soon as he reached out to grab it, and once he gave up, it would roll back and hit him in the face. It would die down for a bit once he started playing with something else, and then go back to attacking him. He could never even touch the buttons. Both of them got stuck on one loop and I had two of these things rattling around in the toybox giggling, 20 minutes after my son got done playing with them - creepy!! These things are 100% annoying, pretty much bullied my baby, and stopped working after a few weeks of incredibly light play, because they never shut off.	-1
Within about a month of owning this toy the toy started having problems. I thought it was just a low battery but after I put new batteries in it still had issues. After having similar problems with other Vtech toys I will NEVER be buying a Vtech toy ever again.	-1
After viewing several similar toys, I picked this one because I liked the different features and textures which I thought would grab my daughters attention.  I might have bought it too late as she was already starting to crawl, but now when I turn it on, she'll look at it then crawl the other way.  She has no interest in the blinking lights, the music or the motion.	-1
I bought this for the same reason as a lot of the reviewers did- learning to crawl. Not so much. I bought this when my daughter was 6 months, she had no interest in this ball. When she did learn to crawl- this still didn't catch her eye. It does not roll on carpet very well so it just wears the motor out.  My daughter does play with this a little now at 10 months but she gets bored after 3 mins of it. I wish I spent my money on something else.	-1
I introduced this toy to my son when he was 4 months old.  He immediately started crying when the lights flashed and the voices started.  He's now 8 months old and still won't go near the thing.  He's especially scared when the ball starts to roll by itself.  I initially thought it was a cute toy - but clearly I was wrong.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I purchased this ball when my daughter was four months old because it says that it promotes crawling.  She looks at the ball, but doesn't have much interest in it at all.  It rolls/wobbles in a circle and plays annoying sing-songy phrases.  You can't decipher what it is saying when you press the number/animal buttons.  As other reviewers have pointed out there is no promotion of cause and effect if the stimulus does not result in anything immediate.  The only educational value (cause and effect) is that if she pushes it it makes noise and rolls around.  However, it also does this on its own when some time has elapsed.	-1
I'm surprised, but this toy was a bust with my son.  We got it for him when he was 9 mo old.  He'd rather play with other balls that aren't making noise.  I'll try it again soon, but so far, not so good.	-1
This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY!  My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it.  After all, it IS a ball!  We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors!  We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time.  So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time.  I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work.  It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use.  She never played with this toy as a crawling infant.  She only plays with it now, and she only throws it.  Please don't waste your money on this toy.  It's not worth it!	-1
I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 months old. She didn't like it because it made to much noise and whether she touched it or not it was singing, lighting up,and moving. I thought she might like it when she got older, but she still doesn't. I don't blame her. I don't know how this could be educational, when you press a button it doesn't consistently give a response, which is confusing for children in the age group it targets. The only thing I liked about it was the two level volume control, although it was still too loud for little ears.	-1
Looke really neat, but our 10 month old twin boys are not interested in it at all and it doesn't roll very well (yes, we're using it on hard floors).  It even gets stuck in one place all the time.  Your money would be better spent on something else.	-1
I got this toy when my daughter was 6 months and since then she couldn't be less interested, she is currently 11 months and hasn't played with it once, i wish I wouldn't have wasted my money  1. It's too heavy to pic up  2. It's spontanious, it moves around and will hit the baby, which scares her  3. How is a 6 month old supposed to find the letter/number/ animal in time, it only gives you 30seconds maybe  It's just not what I expected	-1
This works ok. The disc is metal and very heavy. But the plastic base for the mirror is far too flimsy and lightweight to accommodate the disc without a lot of flexing and popping and clapping noise. All of this means lost energy which reduces spin time. The product just doesn't implement well the design the patent describes.  I wanted to better stabilize the base, so under running hot water I very carefully removed the mirror from the base. Perhaps not something I would recommend. As I was doing so, the smell of whatever adhesive was used literally made me light-headed. I've used a lot of epoxies and adhesives, but none that smelled as strong as this, like really strong gasoline. The adhesive was soft and spongy, not fully cured. I carefully removed all of whatever it was and filled the gap between the base and the bottom of the mirror with air-dry clay to fill the gaps and to increase the weight of the base overall. It did help to increase spin time somewhat and got rid of the annoying galloping-horse-playing-steel-drum sounds.	-1
Am going to send this to grandson's maybe they can figure out how to work it and have fun with it.	-1
Very disappointed in this!! The disk is very heavy metal and the prism is a magnetic disk that magnetizes to the disk so to even spin the disk the magnet slides making it hard to spin the disk... if you can get it to spin it makes a very distinct sound that causes my child to run away... the base that the disk spins on is not very solid and scratches very easily... over all im disappointed in this product...	-1
Fascinating! ..for a few hours- maybe a day. After that your kid will be bored to tears. Seriously, you will hate this thing if you manage to have it out for even a week. "Walwalawalawalawalawalawala...". They even try to give you different patterns to magnetically attach to the disc to add more fun. It doesn't work. If they left a demo of this out in the store, they'd never sell any. First spin: "Wow, that was cool!" Second Spin: "Meh.", Third Spin: "Okay, that's enough of that."	-1
Pretty disappointed in this. It spins beautifully, but the magnets included to make it colorful don't adhere to the sphere at all. My 10 year old grandson loved this at first, but when the magnetic spheres (and other magnets included), would fly off immediately, he was so disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this product because of this failed feature.	-1
wanna say it's cool but ehh it's ok,  it spins for a long time, making a cool noise, but after 2 or 3 turns, I kinda put it away.	-1
I bought this because my husband specifically asked for it for Christmas. It is a a huge piece of junk. He seemed pleased with it. Though I'm honestly not sure why. It's basically cardboard parts you have to put together with a shiny edge. And then the "spinning" it's supposed to do pretty much doesn't happen. I though the spinney part would be weighted or something so it would keep going for a minute once started. But it's really just a puck-like disk that only spins as long as anything else you start spinning by hand - which is only a few seconds. So that cool spinning thing you bought it to do...that won't happen.	-1
Eh, just ok. Mask doesn't fit great. Voice changer has a delay and sounds like garbage. The two halves doesn't got together well and make it very difficult to wear.	-1
I won't add much to the very complete reviews on here. I will only add that my children were given this by Santa per their request. They are ages 4 & 5. They are very big for their age. They love all things Star Wars. They were very excited to see it initially. They wore it 1x, for 2 minutes, took it off & refuse to put it back on. I was lucky to snap a picture quickly because they won't even put it on for pictures. The complaints I have heard "It's too heavy" "It's too hot" "I can't see" I also bought the Captain Rex= same complaints.  Bottom line. While I guess an occasional child would enjoy this mask I don't understand why. It is VERY big (too big & heavy for me as a small female)You can't see through the lenses. It's very hot even with the small front vent. I was able to remove the dark eye shields easily with a screw driver, but it still makes my kids ball up in sweat in 2 minutes. I wish I hadn't spent $ on these. It's a great mask for adults. Very sturdy. Looks great. Just not for children.	-1

I put it on, and of course, like all the "1"s said, the head peace busted right off (that's what I get for being born with a big head) --- but it's not as bad as they say, you can put it back on if you know how to work it right...  But lets get real, this thing does not make you sound like Darth unless you have your ear right up to the little speaker that will sit on your chest.  It's really kind of weird that they put the speaker at the base of the control panel... if you were really short, and the person wearing it were really tall, maybe then it would make sense...  Anyway, long story short, but the TRANSFORMERS voice changing helmet... the Darth Vader one is kind of lame.	-1
I bought this Helmet not too long ago, and it was great looking in it's box. It took a while to get it out, and had to adjust it to my head to try it out. The pre-recorded voice came out nicely. It is the voice changer that I had trouble with. The voice changer has three level button on it, and I tried all of'em. None realy worked. I mean it, not a single one of them even came close. At times as I have read in other reviews I had to shout just to hear the outcome, which you could probably tell that it would have sounded bad. I tried to wisper my breathing and I got close to the original breathing voice of Vader. I am a big fan of Star Wars, but this is pretty disappointing.	-1
Cheap, light plastic makes this marble maze very wobbly. Older kids might have the patience and skill to build it, but my 5 year old got frustrated with it falling over so often. Oh, well...	-1
My four year old LOVES this marble set, however he can not put them together himself.  Like a lot of other people have mentioned, the pieces do not stick together well at all.  What I mean by that is that it is NOT a tight fit.  It's actually a really loose fit.  Easy to put together but nine times out of ten it won't stick together.	-1
I had a marble run set growing up which my kids still play with when they go to grandmas.  This is nothing like that.  This didn't come with directions which on the old style set wasn't a problem but if you don't get this one together in the perfect order it doesn't seem to work well at all.  Even then putting it together off the pictures its so flimsy nothing really fits together right or stays and it wobbles all over.  The open track areas are horrible and one of ours won't even keep the marbles running down it.  I will be searching for a better built marble run similar to what I grew up with or search rummage sales and ebay to see if I can find an old one.  I don't expect this one to last the week.	-1
We bought this for our children for Christmas. They love the toy when its put together but they complain constantly about how easy it falls apart. It falls apart at the slightest touch enough that they have already quit playing with it.	-1
The little plastic bits don't all fi together and stay together well, the directions were awful, and I would say what you get if definitely not worth the price they are charging.  My son WHO LOVES marble runs received this for Christmas and after putting it together and watching it tip, not be level, and not stay together has not played with it ONCE....Spend the extra money and buy a wooden one.	-1
ordered for xmas present and when santa was setting this up xmas eve I noticed hand written stickers placed out the outside of the re-shrink wrapped package staking that it was missing parts...REALLY - I was able to make it work but come on people - don't sell stuff thats knowingly not complete - especially  kids toys  your getting coal next xmas......booooo!	-1
There are a few issues with this set that make others more worthwhile (for reference, my kids are 6 and 7):  1. When you add a shoot/funnel/anything other than the one-piece cylinder building pieces, you have to add 2 more clear pieces. Other sets would have a single piece that can be built upon. This doesn't, and you have a lot more work building as a result. 2. The structure tends to be less than sturdy (not quite flimsy, but not as solid as other similar toys). 3. The yellow spirals have a poor design. You have to add in small support pieces that don't snap into place. I believe this is so the spirals would take less space when in a box (they flatten out), but there are extra pieces you have to keep track of as a result. Not a fan.  Overall, I'd suggest buying a different set.	-1
Bought it at Target for $16, money would've been better spent on the needed toilet paper instead. Instruction shows 3 or 4 designs, I chose the one using 4 legs, after wasting 30+ minutes to put it together, at first, marble will keep rolling thru, when it gets to the roller coaster like tracks section. Once I moved the whole thing to a different location, it now always gets stuck at the mid section of the roller coaster tracks. The tracks sits slightly tilted, where the marble does not have enough force to roll thru it, even the pictures within the instructions for that track looks slightly tilted. I test it by lifting it to make it level, then the marble rolls thru it without problems. But, how do I keep it permanently leveled? I used floss to tie it to pull it up slightly. Besides that really disappointing issue, it's really not that fun after 10 minutes of play, it now it's sits in the corner of the garage, waiting for the next garbage day.  [...].	-1
I thought this would be an entertaining toy for my daughter's first birthday and maybe her older sister (2 1/2 yrs) could enjoy it too. I was wrong.  The toy simply doesnt do that much.  Sure it has a "piano" option which lets you use three keys to make music (WOW) and the alphabet soup in the middle is cute but doesnt do much other than play the alphabet song.  It seems like alot of things to do when you are looking at the table but overall my kids seemed to push every button once or twice for a total of about 20 min of playtime and never really looked at it again.  Not alot of value and replay for a toy this expensive and of this size.  It is HUGE as a table should be - but its also easy to tip over.  The legs are not as sturdy as they seem.  It looks sturdy but those looks are decieving!  No one has sustained any injuries thus far but the table has toppled over more than once, usually because they grab it as they run past or throw ponies in the bowl.  Save your money, buy something not as sizeable and something that has more functions!	-1
I bought this table for my almost 8 month old who is starting to pull up on things.  I thought this would be safe for her to learn to stand with because it has hand grippers along the sides of the table (just for that purpose) and is recommended for ages 6 months+.  All of the fun shapes, colors, and sounds immediately caught her attention.  She cawled over to it and when she tried to pull herself up it fell over ontop of her.  She bumped her head and cried, but fortunately, wasn't hurt.  I put a rug under it thinking maybe that would help make it more stable, but as soon as she tried to pull up again (within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box) it fell over on her again.  The top of the table is very heavy, but the legs are not very sturdy, making it topheavy and easy to topple.  Needless to say, I took it back to the store.  I would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted to take the legs off and use it on the floor, or if you have a toddler who is very steady at standing on his own.  Personally, I think the recommended age should be changed for older children or this toy should be recalled and the legs redesigned.	-1
Another toy not worth the box. All three rockets fell apart within the very first day. Total disappointment.	-1
The footing is off poor material., waste of time.,	-1
These things broke the day we got them.  Cheaply made.  Would not buy again.	-1
The base on this is incredibly flimsy.  It tips easily and doesn't hold steady.  A really big disappointment for something that could have easily been made better.  I wouldn't buy it again.	-1
One of the pieces is warped and the rocket can't be assembled. Appears to be an assembly malfunction. Will have to return for another. Packaging was intact.	-1
I purchased this launcher for my 3 year old son June 17th.  I gave it to him as a gift June 24th.  Today is July 22 and it no longer works! So disappointed! Of course to get a full refund I had to return it 2 days ago! They have a VERY strict return policy.  I would suggest going to Toys R Us or through a company that will stand behind their products that they sell.	-1
This kit was a lot of fun, but the launch case cracked within an hour.  The design of the launch case is as follows: a half-ball (rubber?) sealed to a hard plastic flat base.  The base cracked, so the air now leaks out of the crack instead of pushing up the rocket.  Also, the advertisement that the rockets go "300 feet" is NOT 300 feet in height.  Perhaps 300 feet in total distance travelled - 140 up and 140 down and 20 across (which I still doubt).	-1
We bought this game for out 4 year daughter.  She is now 5 and this game is still collecting dust.  It is way to hard for her to play & she gets bored just watching.  I would recommend another game until your child is about 6+.	-1
Nice looking excavator but very expensive and not durable enough for young children. My friends two year old loved it out of the box but I knew it wouldn't be long before it was broken.  I think it took less than 24 hours before the arm was broken. Cool design but just not nearly durable enough. At least he can still run around with the arm and turn lights on and off!	-1
After having the toy for awhile I wanted to review it again. It is not made well. My son has toys that cost juch less that have held up better.	-1
nice, but tracks comes of to often, now almost 2 months and the bucket can't sit in place because the holes becomes big. maybe not for outdoor use. disappointed in the quality.	-1
I bought this toy for my son's fourth birthday and was very disappointed. After a week of play, it is broken in several places. The arm stopped working after the first day. The plastic is flimsy and light weight, and nothing like one would expect after paying almost $70. Thankfully the return was  fairly painless.	-1
Item was returned a long time ago.  Was not what we wanted.	-1
I really thought for this price my son would be getting a MEDAL excavator.  My son absolutely loved the toy but I don't see this lasting very long.  Everything about it is cheaply made plastic.  I have been looking for toys that he can play with in the dirt and this one, we were so excited to get and disappointed when it arrived to see it was plastic.	-1
I bought this for my son as a gift a while ago thinking he would actually be able to play with it in the sand or dirt.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that it looks nice out of the box, but looks can be deceiving so don't be fooled by the pictures or appearance of this toy excavator.  Everything is made of thin cheap plastic that breaks very easily.  Within a day one of the tracks came off and broke.  At first I was able to snap it back together, but after two days the plastic broke completely.  Then the base of the tracks and the top of the excavator separated and could not be fixed.  My son ended up just playing with the top part of the toy and then the bucket teeth broke and the plastic hydraulic bars broke off.  IT LASTED LESS THAN A WEEK AND WENT INTO THE TRASH!!!  JUNK!!!  This toy is not meant to be played with by any child.	-1
I returned this item.  It's made out of plastic, and it will never last being tossed around in the sandbox.  It would be a waste of money to buy this.	-1
First and foremost, the User Experience video that Bruder uses to promote this toy will set false expectations for the consumer. For example, Bruder USA shows this Excavator going down hill in the sand. Its actually a wooden ramp hidden by sand and a cleaver low camera angle.  Bottom line, this is not a sand toy by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, at the Bruder USA website, they correctly position this as an "indoor toy". So why they promote this way is beyond me.  The Tractor Belts are difficult to turn and if they get sand in them, the hard plastic belts lockup and then slides when pushing it across the sand making for a poor user experience. It's a shame Bruder did not use the rubber belts similar to the ones used on the Bruder Caterpillar Buldozer where the belts actually work in the sand. The engineer who designed this plastic belt, the product manager and video marketing manager should loose their jobs because this lame design and false expectation.  The Excavator also comes with 20 or so individual little rubber inserts to aid the hard plastic tractor belts to stick to slick indoor surfaces. These inserts do not stay in the belts, get loose, get lost, and could become a hazard to smaller children; more reason to switch the design to a rubber belt.  The video also shows the product rotating with ease.  This is somewhat misleading as well. It does swivel nicely when its not in the locked forward position and if the toy has never been exposed to sand.  However, the forward position locks into  a rut.  To push it out takes three hands.  Because the product is so light due to the plastic materials, the excavator would rather slide sideways in the sand than to swivel out of the rut and turn as it should. If any sand gets into this swivel area, it becomes real gritty, further impeding the ability to rotate the excavator.  As for the Shovel, we used it once in dry, loose, white sand at our local park's sand box.  Because of the product's poor design, the Shovel arm has practically no leverage nor sufficient weight behind it. So it is incapable of easily scooping up sand without putting your hand directly on the shovel. Again the Bruder Video demonstrating this capability used crafty video editing by only showing an already fully loaded shovel full of sand starting the video at the tale end of the scooping process. Again, deceptive marketing to misleading the consumer user experience with false expectations. This is critical when considering this is the primary function of the toy. Bruder does not show the product actually scooping up sand because the product is pretty much incapable of doing it with ease.  The handle on the arm does a good job managing the scoop once dirt is in it, but its incapable of scooping up dirt as easily as the expectation they attempted to demonstrate. In a real user experience, one hand will be on the handle, another directly the other on the shovel to help it dig, and a third hand to help manage the excavator rotation if its locked in the forward position.  The last negative is just a small gripe.  The engine hood has a very small clip lock to keep it shut. Its too small and will not keep the hood closed.  MY RECOMMENDATION TO THE CONSUMER is to buy the Bruder Liebherr Articulated Road Loader L574.  This has large wheels instead of a belt. It is the only Bruder Loader that turns and turns very well. The shovel leavers are designed and perform exceptionally well. Its size ratio matches the Bruder Dump Truck perfectly at 1:16 ratio. So the Articulated Road Loader is perfectly matched to scoop up and dispense sand into the Bruder Dump Truck for a most excellent creative play user experience.  I have a 5 year old son who loves to play with construction sand toys.  Essentially, he claims the Excavator is worthless.  So much so, he asked me to return this birthday present; that's how really bad his experience was with the Excavator.  But my son absolutely loves the Bruder Articulated Road Loader to get the same job done right. So go to that page and get the BRUDER ARTICULATED ROAD LOADER L574 & the BRUDER DUMP TRUCK 1:16 ratio.  Again, this is the only one of three Bruder Loader that turns; the others just go straight for a less than exceptional user experience.  Now if your child has no intentions using this Excavator in the sand and play exclusively indoors with it, then this Excavator is an OK product for the price, but you still have the rotation and potential safety issues.  MY FEEDBACK TO BRUDER & BRUDER USA is most of all be honest with your product capabilities in these videos and try not to set false expectations with the user experience; your integrity is seriously damaged with me.  Redesign the Plastic Tractor Belts and inserts using RUBBER Belts, put a double leaver directly on the shovel to aid in the scooping/digging process (remember this is the primary function of the toy regardless of cost), eliminate or greatly minimize the swivel lock and get a more functional lock on the hood. Wish you still sold metal sand toys too, but I understand the multiple reasons why this is no longer practical.	-1
my 2 yr old loves it.  It is very small compared to the other toys, making it seem out of proportion.  It needs weights in the rollers to make it feel like it is compressing dirt	-1
My 3 yr. old LOVES construction vehicles, but this drum compactor isn't loved like a Rolly from Bob The Builder. It hardly ever gets played with. I don't understand why the high reviews, there isn't much to this over-priced toy. The front/back roller drums spin, the fake steering wheel turns, and it has a pivot point in the middle. No sounds, no compartments to store things, zippo. If it is so realistic, why not allow the engine compartment to be seen!?! I'd be less annoyed if this was a $5 dollar item, but it is more than 3x that. Do your-self a favor and go to a garage sale and get 10+ toys for the price of this boring item.	-1
The quality sucks!!!! Its very clastic	-1
Not good detail as in the picture	-1
My son loved his gift but I was under the impression that this car did something, but it does nothing. It is cheap looking on the inside, no fancy stickers nothing. It did not come with the wire that sticks up at the top like in the picture, so to me that is false advertisement. I am disappointed, but my son loves it so oh well. Not worth the money though.	-1
Smaller than thought it would be.	-1
No overly pleased.  The concept is good but we have yet to actually grow anything after two tries.  At least time we had something sprout.  Bummer.	-1
We ordered this last minute for our daughter for Easter. It arrived on time but the plastic container that holds the dirt was cracked in multiple places. And the the plastic was scratched which makes it more difficult to see the plants grow.	-1
The seeds provided with this produced only a few very sad sprigs of greenery at the top. There were no roots even visible after a month of sunshine, a lot of hope, and daily watering. You could do more far more justice to this project with a larger glass vase and some real seeds that work.  These three clear containers are tiny, so what you can grow in these is VERY limited. Overall, not worth the money and not educational given the seed issue.	-1
Didn't have too much success growing the vegetables	-1
Not really ideal for young ones. One of our seeds never sprouted. A tad too much water and mold will grow and kill the seedling. The sprouts never turned into any type of vegetable. Once the seeds spout its difficult to remove the others and leave only one behind. My son was a little disappointed.	-1
Cheaply made. Lettuce was the only plant that grew. We still could not see the roots. Do not waste your money.	-1
Not easy to grow anything in these small tubes.  The plant didn't show roots and ended up rotting out and not really growing.  Would not recommend.	-1
Although a great idea, this has turned out to be another plant growing toy that just doesn't do much.  Each of the three plastic tubes are not larger enought to grow a plant of any significant size.  You do see a reasonable amount of small roots thru the tubes, and get green plant growth above the tube, but's that about it.  After MANY months, the carrot(s) and radish(es) never got larget than about 1/8" wide and the onions never sprouted after repeated tries.  Followed all directions exactly as described.	-1
The onion seeds never sprouted, the carrots and radishes did sprout but after months of being in the little tubes, they never did grow any carrots or radishes under the soil. My 4 yr. old was disappointed and so was I. I did everything right. I finally gave up and dumped them out. Maybe the tubes are too skinny...I did give it two stars because he did get to see the tops grow, he loves to garden.	-1
These might be fine for a baby at the beach, but the tools bend if you try to use them in the ground.  Paint peeled off and bag is fabric and stains easy.  I purchased this for my son and a different brand (so it would be a different color) for my daughter, and the tools are much more substantial and the bag is nicer.	-1
My child played with it once and then got bored	-1
Paper peeling off thin wood pieces	-1
These are TINY puzzles and to be honest that is my bad. When purchasing i thought these would be full to at least medium size and good for a 1 1/2 year old.  Will end up donating this item.	-1
doesn't fit well	-1
I'm so disappointed. This is a brand that I trust, so I was suprised by the (lack of) quality of this item. I have attached a photo of the part that gave me a splinter.	-1
The puzzle looked a lot bigger.  The box is small and the pieces are pretty small.  I wouldn't recommend this for a toddler.	-1
Two of the 4 puzzles are exactly the same!!! Bought it in November and just barely got it out to put the puzzles together. I was super disappointed when I discovered that two of the 4 puzzles were the fire truck puzzle and the school bus was missing. I usually like Melissa and Doug toys and we have frequently bought from this brand but I wonder if quality is going downhill after this. Not pleased!	-1
1 .poor quality 2. Not for children because of the wood particles 3. don't waste your money	-1
The puzzle pieces are cut so similarly that any piece fits into the other, making it much harder for a child to put together.	-1
Kind of expected the size of puzzles to be a little bigger	-1
My son just turned two and has outgrown his peg puzzles, he still likes them but they no longer challenge him.  So I decided to by these for him as he would have 8 different puzzles that should challenge him.  I was right, they do give him a challenge, but he also can do them in a few minutes if I talk him thru it.  For example, I will always tell him when starting out to find all of the wheels and put them together first.  From a playing point of view this product should get 5 stars.  Why only 2 stars:  I've only had this set for about two weeks, already my son has broken two puzzle pieces and one of the boxes.  When he broke the box it resulted in a very sharp piece of wood, as well as a really sharp edge on the box.  I've fixed everything with wood glue, but its only been two weeks!  Furthermore, every time we do the puzzles, even if nothing breaks, I see a handful of little wood chips on the floor.  I must say that I'm very disappointed with the quality of this product, certainly not what I would expect from Melissa and Doug.  Next problem is the difficulty of putting these pieces together.  The pieces have a very tight fit, there is no room for error.  As a result the toughest part for my son is not figuring out where each piece goes, but getting the pieces to stay together.  The box tops also slide off very easily making it difficult for them to stay in place as my son puts the puzzle together.  Then of course there is the more practical issue of having 4 puzzles in one box.  My son turns the box over and I have four mixed up puzzles on the floor.  I know it says ages 3 and up, and I suppose that recommendation should be followed, but by the age of 3 my son will be bored with these 12 piece puzzles.	-1
Very cheap puzzle and NOT WOODEN (the box they come in is wooden)  The puzzles are made of very thin cardboard that bend and warp so the pieces don't fit together anymore.  Very unlike most Melissa & Doug toys.	-1
Pieces too small for my 3 year old grandson.  Not what I expected.	-1
smaller than I thought.. its really small do not purchase	-1
My son loves it but the pieces break very easily. The paper also tears. Quality not meant for toddlers.	-1
Not good, very thin wood pieces, very easy for kids to get splinters	-1
These puzzles are very small - much smaller than I expected.  I sent them back.  They are really not what I have come to expect from Melissa and Doug products.	-1
This stroller when you go to make it what I call an "umbrella " stroller it has square metal clips that hang and move back and forth when pushing.  I called company right away before my child played with it and was reassured this was a new feature and it was perfectly safe.  Well second time my daughter played with it she got two fingers caught in these and cut her finds really deep	-1
We've had this cute stroller combo for 5 days & its already broken. Easy to put together but altogether very cheaply made, the metal is very skinny/flimsy, the bottom of the bassinet is thun cardboard, the clips that hold the bassinet on the frame unclip constantly causing the bassinet to fall off the frame. Today the bassinet came unclipped again so the bassinet fell off breaking the metal pieces connected to the bottom that hold it onto the stroller frame. I want to return it but the box was damaged :( my daughter has been more frustrated with this dang thing & now she's in tears that it's broken. I'm going to try to Jimmy rig it with zip ties & hot glue!!!	-1
I really was hoping to love this. It isn't really practical. It is very challenging for a small child (regular sized three year old) to use since the handle is so high and the front wheels don't turn on function I give it ZERO stars- but it is very cute so it balances out to two stars.  I'm going to try to return but it was already expensive, I hate to pay more to ship it back.	-1
Flimsy	-1
My Foster child got one from me for Christmas. She weighed 34lbs and was 3 years old.  She was not looking where she was going and fell over it. It buckled under her weight and when we tried to put it back together the frame was bent...sad cause it looked so sturdy and she felt so bad cause she broke it! Now she just plays with the basket ( was not attached at the time just the stroller part). Have thought about contacting Company in case it was just a defective frame...stuff happens!	-1
I was excited to get this for my 4-year-old son.  He loves Blues Clues, and he love drawing and art.  This game is VERY boring.  You can put stamps of the Blue's Room Characters in a picture of a room, you can paint pictures of Blues Room Characters, You can Guess what Doodle is drawing . . . none of which is very exciting or engaging.  The graphics are pretty bad also.  Not very crisp or clear.  I would pass this one buy and try something else.	-1
There is no excuse for such poor picture quality in a game.  Between the blurry picture quality and a badly handling joystick that just sort of floats and is hard to control, this is not something I would recommend.	-1
We have had this stroller for a year now, and it has been loved. The pink color, European styling, and versatility of the options are all appreciated. However, this doll stroller is very cheaply made and does not hold up to even gentle indoor play with our 5 year old. The clips that hold the bassinet broke early on, forcing us to balance the baby bed on instead of securing it. It constantly falls and frustrates my daughter. The material does not perfectly fit over the frame, thus contributing to an overall cheap appearance. Given the price, this simply isn't worth it. Very disappointed.	-1
The box contains only four colors.  A disappointment	-1
I was very disappointed. I needed varied colors. The only colors that came were red, white, blue, and yellow. I needed green, brown, and black, besides these colors.	-1
Very hot and one of the poles broke making it useless. I looked online to try to replace the poles, but they were out of stock and even then, the price of the replacement pole is pretty much the price of the tent. We just bought another tent, this time a bigger one that all of us can fit into comfortably with bigger windows to let air through, and about the same price. Do not recommend.	-1
bought it for the beach for my 1 year old to sleep in. runs very small. our son hated it. so we adults tried to use it as a changing room, but the netting slips around this tent made this not very likely. returned first thing after we got back from the beach	-1
We purchased this tent five years ago with the intent of using it on occasional beach trips. Like most other reviewers, the first thing I noticed was the poor airflow. While it does keep most of the sun out, it also keeps out most of the air. It gets very warm and stuffy which really worried me with my 6 month old daughter. We continued to use it a handful of times over the years and while we appreciated the ease of setting it up, the portability, and the overall purpose, the whole airflow issue prevented me from loving it.  We moved to the beach a couple of months ago and after using it 4-5 times overall we have been using it on a weekly basis. Since it's been in the 60s and low 70s the airflow thing hasn't been an issue and we were basically using it until we came up with a better solution, however last week we set it up and as soon as I put my almost 2 year old in there the tent completely collapsed on her. One of the plastic poles had completely cracked, rendering one of the poles entirely useless. There wasn't a breeze and the tent had been stored properly so I'm not sure what caused the sudden break. The actual tent is in perfectly good condition, but the poles clearly weren't made to put up with moderate use. I hate to get rid of a perfectly functioning tent but since it doesnt circulate air well and the quality isn't amazing, I just can't keep it around. If you're looking for shade and decent airflow I would recommend going with an umbrella, despite it's bulkiness.	-1
I bought this so my child could be shaded at the beach and have a place to relax.  It is easy to set up but doesn't block much sun no matter which direction I turn it.  We don't use it now but maybe when he is older he can play in it in the backyard.	-1
Cute packaging doesn't make up for a lack of color contrast in the marbles. I was hoping, at this price, for some real beauties for my granddaughter who has asked for marbles. Dull, dull, dull.	-1
Very small and poorly made. Nothing special for the money.	-1
I was given this toy from a friend and my kids loved to play with it but it was obnoxiously loud so I got rid of it! I didn't think to try the tape on the speaker trick but we don't love toys that make lots of annoying noises around here. Plus, I didn't know how to turn it off so if it got knocked accidentally it would go off again.	-1
My daughter really enjoys this game (3 years old) unfortunately we don't get to spend long playing it because no matter how we spread and eventually disperse the weight we are unable to get more than about 5 monkeys on the tree. The magnet does not seem very strong and its disappointing to us who purchased the game.	-1
falls too easily.would be fine for a toddlers attention span but would probably be too flimsy for their lack of coordination	-1
This game looks really adorable and a fun twist on the traditional barrel of monkeys game.  However, it turned out to be a big disappointment.  The palm tree top where you hang the monkeys is attached to the stem with a magnet.  The way the game works is that you spin the attached spinner, add monkeys to the tree and eventually the palm tree top falls, resulting in the end of the game.  The magnet is pretty weak, so it seems to detach very easily.  Plus, when it falls it just feels like a total mess is made--it doesn't feel like there is any sort of completion.  We tried playing a couple of times and it was just frustrating.  Even as an adult with steady hands I couldn't get that many monkeys on the tree before it tumbled.  It has the feel of falling apart, rather than the natural conclusion of the game.  We returned the game since it was a big disappointment.  We will probably buy a barrel of monkeys, though, since my daughter enjoyed attaching them to each other and I think that's the only aspect of this game that she's going to miss.	-1
At 2 yr old my son could work the DVD player, he could put his own movie in and get the remote and Know which buttons to push to skip the previews and get right to the movie. Now at 3 years old he has his own Play station 1; that he can play all by himself!! He puts in Winnie the pooh pre-school game and can play the Whole game without any help from me. When I saw the interactv DVD I thought this will be great, since it combines DVD and video game together he'll love this.  I setup it up in less then 5 minutes and hand him the controller, he only played for 10 minutes then turn it off and hasn't touch it for Months. I ask him if he'd like to play it again with me and he said "no it's boring you only match shapes" so I sat down and played it by myself and I agree it is boring. First you have to watch the character do there little talk (same talk every time you put the DVD in) then you have to Match the shape on the pad, to the shape on the TV that is IT!!! Not very challenging to someone who already knows all his letters, numbers and shapes. I also bought him sponge bob, Dora and Elmo plus the DVD that came with it and it's All the Same; Matching Shapes, except Sponge bob you do have to find the patty missing the pickle which of course is Not very hard, I see why my son finds it boring.  He learns a lot more from his play station Winnie the pooh, like finding missing letters, counting numbers, painting, spelling, and Matching that is very challenging. If your child is already playing video games then the interactv is not for them. I agree with the other reviews if your child still doesn't know their shapes or how to match then they'll love interactv, that is until they learn their shapes.	-1
Did not come with base piece so kids were not able to play game.	-1
On Friday night, it was cold & snowy, I said to my 2 1/2 year old daughter, let's go get that Interac TV at Target, that way we will have something fun to do for the weekend.  Well...later, we got the toy home, I put the dvd in my DVD player, and the DVD player gave an error message:"the disk you have inserted is damaged." How could this be?, I tried cleaning the "brand new" dvd, cleaning my dvd player, this couldn't be happening.  Two hours later, I was fed up. Saturday morning we exchanged the toy @ Target for another one.  We got the toy home & put the disk in the DVD player, it worked! ... until we went to program the controller... the top left quadrant of the controller, did not work, at all!  I entered all 23 codes for my RCA Brand dvd player & none of them would make the top left part of the controller work.  Two hours later, I accepted this toy is a dud! So my disappointed 2 yr old & I returned the item to Target & got a refund.  I spent 4 hours this weekend on this toy, when I could've just read my daughter a book!	-1
What a disappointment.  Took the game out of the box to play with kids and I basically had to hold the lime green "canopy" on to the branch with my hand.  Once a few monkeys were hanging the canopy became detached and the monkeys fell to the ground - total play time two minutes???  The magnet is not strong enough for any weight to be put on it.  A big waste of my money in my mind - don't buy it.	-1
Please know that this system does not work with all DVD players.  I have a DVD VCR combo system and IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!  I thought that this would be something that my 4 year old would like as he likes to play the games that come on his DVD's.  However, I was not able to get it to work with our system.  I called Mattel's hotline number in the user guide and was told that due to high call volume that I could not get help and to call back.  The call was the terminated by Mattel.  I went to the web site for help and went through the many steps (the same that are in the book) and still had no luck.  Mattel will send you a voucher for another Mattel toy (like I want one now) once you send them the very horrible toy back.  I also had bought other DVD game for this as well and wonder how I am to return it.  There is no information on what to do with those and as it is open what to do.  DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!MATTEL HAS NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THIS GAME!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!! IF YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR MONEY AWAY SEND IT TO ASIA AND HELP PEOPLE.	-1
Just okay. Magnetic canopy of tree is meant to fall after enough weight has been place. Do not play on nice furniture! The manual spin thing does not really spin so it kind of makes it pointless to play. I would not suggest this game for advanced toddlers.	-1
As soon as you place 5 monkeys, the whole thing collapses! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. You will end up returning it. : (	-1
We bought this toy for our daughter for Christmas and we were disappointed to discover that it isn't compatible with either of our dvd players.  Our daughter was so disappointed because she wanted to watch and play the dora dvd!  I highly recommend you make sure your dvd player is compatible before purchasing this toy - even though I'm not sure if it will do any good.  We have a Marantz dvd player, and it is apparently compatible with this, yet we couldn't get it to work.  I've read several reviews where children were disappointed because they couldn't play with this toy; I recommend setting this up to ensure it works before letting the kids see it!	-1
This is a horrible toy! We bought it for our 4 year year old for Christmas. It will not work on our Apex DVD player. We tried all the codes and only 1 worked. Well sort of, 1 button will work. My daughter was in tears my husband was frustrated. Wish I'd never bought this because now I'm going to face a 3 hour long return line trying to get a new present from Santa! I can guarantee it won't be made by Fisher Price!	-1
Very disappointing.  Like everyone else, we too had problems programming the controller.  Most of the codes listed for our Philips DVD player semi-worked.  I could not get any of the codes to recognize the A space, which I have figured out to be the number 1 on the remote and now sit with them and push the number 1 on the dvd remote when needed.  But the game play is still sporadic at best.  While in the middle of a question it will all of a sudden change programs.  And not just start a new program it will jump to the middle of another program.  It asked an Elmo question, before my son could answer it started asking a spongebob question.  And while playing dora, serveral questions in, it just all of a sudden started over.  My 2 and 4 year old have yet be able to finish one of the programs.  Very disappointing, I was torn between this and the V-smile and got this due to having so many other FP toys that my kids love but, this was obviously the wrong choice.  I plan on taking it back and getting the V-smile	-1
The spinner that is attached to the base is a very poor idea.  First, it works poorly as a spinner, second and most important, is that it is very important to not move the tree base when the game is about delicate balancing of hanging monkeys.  Slight movements, like trying to turn a poorly designed spinner, will many times cause the tree hanger, and all of the monkeys, to drop down.	-1
First I will say that this is not compatible if your TV has a DVD built into it as many new ones do. We had to hook this up in our bedroom so my son could play it. He played it for about 20 minutes, (despite my encouragement to keep playing) I even played to try and get him into it, but its just slow and pretty boring if you ask me. There wasn't enough action to keep him interested too long and it didn't always recognize the right discs. I think it may have been rushed to market. I put it away after he finished and figured I would suggest playing again the next day, but he didn't want to play. I kept it for another week or so, and he never mentioned it again, so I returned it and bought VSMILE.	-1
My son got this for his birthday from his aunt and everyone had a hard time pressing the keypad and getting the correct things to light up on screen and sometimes when I would put the Dora disk in,I would get Spongebob and when I restarted the dvd it got stuck on a loop and would play the beginning of the Spongebob song over and over. Technology is great but I think they have to keep working on this one if they want it to be as easy as the commercial presents it.	-1
I don't know if I had a defective product, but you have to hit the top of the drum quite hard and with a large surface area (i.e. your whole palm) to get a sound.  Even as an adult I couldn't make the drum respond every time.  It would be nearly impossible for my 6 month old baby to play with it in a satisfactory manner.  Returned.	-1
Looks nice in concept, but my 10 months old baby didn't like it that much and it didn't help her learning to crawl!	-1
Print wore off the blocks! WHAT good is it if the print has worn off!? Minimally used!	-1
The set had no storage box nor stand. Loose to keep but seems alright still.	-1
These are really hard to pull apart and the plastic feels flimsy.  My daughter gets frustrated when she plays with this.	-1
Be careful, this comes without the base, so it is useless on it's own as the fraction bricks have nothing to stand on.	-1
Junk, very cheaply made. Dont bother unless your kids are like mine & break things in under 10 seconds and cant have anything nice.	-1
While the product is adorable and not too large, the toaster doesn't work.	-1
I am very unhappy with these the kettle doesn't work, the toaster cannot be used by a child it takes too much strength to make it work and they are sized wrong for AG dolls.	-1
Toaster broke on Christmas day.  Very disappointed.  Poorly made, cheap plastic. Pop up toaster action breaks.  Returning for refund.	-1
Very cute, my son loved it, perfect size and look but very poor quality. Toaster arrived broken. Lightweight plastic construction. No difficulties returning item but feel bad taking it back from my son.	-1
They are cute but smell SO incredibly strong of chemicals. I even tried to rinse one in hot water but that did nothing to the smell. My child refuses to even pick it up. I have bought lots of other learning resources products (jumbo animals) and did not have any problems.	-1
I purchased these for my two boys 10 years ago as a replacement for conventional video games. Given the choice my boys would have preferred to play the Gameboy but I didn't give them that choice so the enjoyed the LeapFrog.  We did have several versions of the actual LeapFrog as they would fail often, I think I ultimately purchased like five of them between my two boys and two of them work as of today.  I donated all my games and Leapsters to my sister as she has a 3 year old..  I don't know that they really helped with my children's education but it had to have been better than the alternative Gameboy. At this time the games and system are dated and will have difficulty capturing the attention of a young kid.  My sister's kid is hooked on the Ipad and never actually plays the Leapster.	-1
Ugly, got it for my grown daughter after she had surgery because she loves sloths. When I gave it to her she said "What is it?"	-1
I passed over this toy when I saw it in person in the store.  The pots are maybe 2" or 3" in diameter max!  I instead found a set at Walgreens that are more like 4" or 5" in diameter (not to mention only $4).  I wanted my daughter to be able to actually fit some play food in her pots and pans to "cook".	-1
Not worth the price for just one.  Rather small.  And my ferret ripped it to pieces in less than a day, lol.	-1
This easel is advertized as easy to close up and store.  That is simply not the case.  In the picture you can see each wooden screw that is needed to hold the easel open, and attach the trays.  It does fold in half but the trays, marker, chalk, screws, etc. need to be stored elsewhere. Also, my children have used the easel 3 times, for about 15 each, and already the white board is peeling and cannot be fully cleaned. The marker marks are there to stay.  This is the only chalkboard that I have encountered that cannot be washed clean with a wet cloth. Both sides of the easel are magnetic, and it came with 4 magnets.  I guess it's going to be mostly for painting on paper. Usually the name "Melissa & Doug" is synonymous with quality, however, I am disappointed with this purchase.	-1
So pissed right now that this crap is not working	-1
The car does not have a lot of safety features. There is no button to turn it off or no seat belts. It also accelerates very fast. I would recommend it for a child that is 5-7 years old, no younger.	-1
Pedal stopped working after 2 months of period use. Took 2 hours to assemble because the parts don't align well. Do not recommend.	-1
I wanted to love this truck. I don't. The first one we bought came with a cracked windshield. Fisher-Price would NOT replace the windshield. So we ordered a second one as I did not want my child getting hurt or cut on it.the second one came with so much body damage that we ended us using the first one without the windshield and the second one for parts. I'll never buy this again.	-1
do not purchase this if you live in the city. the car is big.  you need plenty of room for your child to drive this around and it goes faster than you might think and it makes plenty of noise.  i bought this for my 3 year old grandson; steering the car is not that easy, putting his foot on the pedal and just foward is easy enough but he has to bend down to the floor of the car to hit the button to go in reverse and then hit it again to go foward.  but, beware, it does go!!  and if there isn't open space it will go into anything in the way.  I think a foot pedal car is a much better idea for a child.	-1
I am so upset!!! Look to the top of the page. Where does it say you have color options? I ordered the beautiful, vibrant-colored tent seen in the description and got some truly awful version. Within a moment, I went from the exhilaration of thanking the postman to clicking on Amazon for a return request. I was so delighted to receive it so quickly and was ready to prep it for my children. They get back from camp in an hour. How amazing would it have been to have all of this set up as a surprise?!! Now? It's sitting back in the box it came in. Honestly, if there are options, let buyers know! This has been such a waste of time and energy. What am I supposed to do now? Buy it again and hope that I get the tent in the color listed? Ridiculous.	-1
I bought this for my grandchildren and it did not last a day. Don't waste your money. Highly overpriced. Fabric tears easily	-1
This was for my adult daughter, who wanted something to do as she would be alone on Christmas. She was totally disappointed, and returned it. She said it was flimsy, and not as described, and didn't have all the parts listed.	-1
This is the worst toy cart I have ever seen!  First, the toys that are included are NOT as pictured here or on the box!  The veggies ended up being these weird little green and orange circle things.  They remind me of upside down Trivial Pursuit pieces!  And I have yet to figure out why they even include the cardboard boxes of food in these sets...they are the first thing that our 16 month old destroys!  But she does LOVE the "pouring milk" and "peeling banana"!  And I have to admit those are really cool.  My next complaint is the baby doll.  It is NOT included and I wish we hadn't bought it.  It's a great doll on it own and our daughter loves her.  But add the cart to the mix and she hates her.  The doll is darn near impossible to get in and out of the seat.  We have to help her every time.  She finally traded her out for a cheaper and smaller one that she can get in and out herself.  Our final complaint is the cart itself.  It is very cheaply constructed.  The basket comes off all the time. It just doe not hook on right.  I thought it was a really cute idea until I realized it wouldn't stay on.  Plus the handle falls down often and it is the perfect size for our daughter to get her hand stuck under.  The next flaw in the cart is the baby seat.  Not only does the doll not fit properly but the seat itself also falls off.  It's just like the basket.  So most times our daughter is just pushing around the frame of this thing.  I would not suggest this cart.  Go with a good old Little Tikes or Step 2 cart instead.  You won't get all extra stuff but you'll get a far better cart.	-1
My 19 month old received the Little Mommy Shopping cart and the Little Mommy baby doll for Christmas this year. I have always loved Fisher Price products; I grew up with them even. I have always known them to be fun and well built. This toy ,on the other hand, I found to be the worst toy they could have put together. I was really looking forward to giving my little one a shopping cart and introducing her to baby dolls. This toy combination seemed a perfect fit since the child is supposed to be able to drive their baby doll around while they "shop" and then convert the toy into a high chair, etc...  Here's a list of negatives:  1. The shopping cart wheels barely move. They should have spent more money on designing something that little girls could actually move around. That is ,afterall, the whole point of  pretend shopping.  2. The baby doll is very hard to remove from it's seat. They designed the baby doll with a soft body and plastic legs that get caught in the narrow space of the high chair. You also cannot remove the seat tray to make it easier for your toddler because then the doll does not stay in a sitting position.  3. The shopping cart basket is not much of a basket a tall. It is very shallow barely fitting any food items. It also falls out easily if not placed on correctly. This should not be marketed for toddlers.  4. The food seems haphazardly designed with no uniformity of style. Some pieces are hard plastic, some pieces are flimsy cardboard that do not last, and then there is the odd softer plastic muffin and banana. The rest of the plastic containers are rather useless with bad illustrations barely explaining what they are. One such piece is cylinder plastic with no text just a picture of a baby. Is this supposed to be a container of baby formula (with no top)? Your guess is as good as mine.  5. The  shopping cart does not convert to a high chair. The  basket and the doll chair are not interchangeable and so what they are calling a high chair is just where the doll sits as your child shops. It is an awkward place to try to feed the doll since the bar is in exactly th best place is could be to block your child from having access to the doll. They have to go over and around it or underneath in order to feed the doll.  What a horrible toy!!!!! I am getting my money back and purchasing something in the Graco line or the Chou Chou and Baby Anabelles lines!!!! Please don't waste your money especially if you are considering this toy for a toddler. I suspect that older children would find it too dull.	-1
We gave this to my 18 month old daughter as a Christmas gift and thought it was really cute on the box.  It really lacks sturdiness but she finds it enjoyable to push around the house.  The cardboard boxes are so flimsy I'm not even sure they lasted a whole day.  The banana, muffin and milk carton are fun to play with.  Our twin 3 1/2 year old boys love this cart as well.  They run through the house and it winds up crashing and coming completely apart.  That's a boy thing!  The seat for the baby is too small for a standard size doll to fit into and be taken out without this seat coming off the cart.  The idea of this cart is cute but overall I'd look for something with more guts to it -- something that's made better and will not fall apart when you look at it.	-1
Everything worked fine for about 5 minutes after I made it. I turned it on again a week later and a capacitor exploded. I replaced the capacitor, thinking it had been faulty, but the new one started smoking after 10 seconds of use. I got an electronics professor to look the circuit over, though the problem persisted after replacing two diodes, two resistors, and the capacitor again so I gave up on it.	-1
The plow always falls off. The plow always falls off and the salt spreader leaks the salt every where its just a mess.	-1
We love Bruder but this truck is awful. The plow won't stay on. We even tried gluing it because our son was so disappointed. You can't actually plow anything let alone snow. Don't waste your money on this one. Will a toy company please produce a working snow plow toy????	-1
I purchased this for my 5 year old nephew as a back to school gift, with some hesitation because it looked a bit fragile. It is very detailed and looks authentic, especially the working sander on the back end. He was so excited to get this in the sand box and patiently strained the sand so the sander would not get clogged. After about the first 10 minutes he had tears in his eyes and would not play with the truck. I thought that something broke, but it was the plow that popped off and refused to stay on during play. Nothing was broken. He wasn't even plowing anything. It was just the design of the plow attachment that caused it to fall off when pushing the truck. We returned it.	-1
I've purchased many Bruner trucks and have been very satisfied but this one is cheaply made and the plow just sits on the front and falls off. Something may be missing or broken but there was no instructions to know how it should be assembled, but there was no way to attach the plow.	-1
Fell apart.  Plow doesn't stay on,  I even tried to super glue it	-1
We own several of the Bruder trucks. This one is the poorest quality of the bunch. The red hatches on the back broke off within the first hour. The plow has now broken off too. Overall, the plastic is much more flimsy than the other Bruder trucks. My son loved it, but I was really disappointed with the quality.	-1
This toy was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old son who is very gentle on his toys. It never got much play -maybe because the front shovel falls off all the time or the skinny plastic "pins" that hold the doors in place on top of the back broke so they just sit on top and no longer open and close as they should. It looks like a really cool toy, but do you think they could make it more sturdy so kids can actually PLAY with it???	-1
Maybe I got a bad batch, but I'm using the Black Bubble Machine like the other reviewer, but in my case, this product doesn't work at all. Odd too, since the bubble machine seems very forgiving of all sorts of juice I use; every other bubble juice I've used, including many varieties of my own home-made have always produced tons of bubbles. Sometimes a little more or less, some lasting longer than others, but I've never had a case where it didn't make any bubbles.  This stuff is like foamy water. At least if it was a little too rich, I could thin it out, but the problem is that it is too watery already.  I wasted my $20 on this. Take your chances, maybe you'll get lucky like the other 3 reviewers, but it's a roll of the dice with this product.  I'd be interested to hear from other users.  UPDATE: I called the supplier and they were kind enough to send me another gallon without having to return the first one. Unfortunately, the second jug is just as bad as the first. Just to be sure, I did a thorough cleaning of my bubble machine, but it made no difference. My machine still produces tons of bubbles with all other "juice" I use. Only this product fails.  Not sure why it works for others and not for me, or maybe they've just started watering it down. I would highly recommend not buying this.	-1
In effort to get my two year old to stop using pan lids as cymbals, I decided to get her real cymbals.  But unfortunately they sound a lot like the pan lids, as there's not much ring and clash sound.  It still gets two stars, for including the mallets, which are cool, and because my two year old likes the set.	-1
If these were priced at $4.00 - it would be worth the investment. These produce a tinny sound - irritating to adult and child alike. Investigate zils (finger cymbals) instead for a clear ringing sound.	-1
It really doesn't attach well to the car seat or stroller. I have a Graco Quattro Tour and the straps aren't long enough for either. My daughter does like the music but it doesn't play long enough and it is irritating to have to continue to activate (she isn't able to).  I still get some use out of it though.  She likes to pick it up, shake it and then toss it on the floor.  *Update* I had to update this posting because this toy has become a big hit in the last few months.  Around my daughter's first birthday she began to play with this.  Now in the car she hits the button and plays the music over and over again.  It is her favorite car toy.  I'm actually glad I purchased it.  Of course it still doesn't attach well to the car seat, but boy does it keep my daugher occupie. My opinion on this toy has totally changed.	-1
I am changing my review, but am unable to change the star rating.  I give it a '3' star rating now.  Be aware if you don't know already:  You're not supposed to have any toys attached to the car seat in case of an accident, they become a projectile or at minimum hit the baby's head in an impact.  A fireman inspecting the car seat told us this.  -You run a serious risk of hitting the baby's head when you put the baby in the car seat, or when you're taking them out of the car seat.  -I originally said the batteries were too expensive.  In some stores they are - up to $9 for a set of 4.  I found 4 replacement 'LR44' batteries for $1 at a craft store, of all places.  So that is affordable.  -It's quite difficult to put these button-cell batteries back in.  It took a few tries.  -I never used this toy in the car.  I attached it to a horizontal bar in my house and my son played with it there.  Not a perfect toy - but I 'made it work' elsewhere, other than the car. I definitely wouldn't buy it again if it broke, nor would I recommend it.	-1
I bought this to use it in my baby's carrier. But it was a very bad choice. It is hard for the baby to look at it. I guess it would be better in the crib. But I haven't tried it yet.	-1
We have one of the other drums and love it, and first discovered this brand at Gym bored Play & Learn music classes, so I thought some hand drums would be great. I was wrong. These are really hard to make much sound with, even for an adult. I have returned them and wouldn't recommend them. Get one of the large ones instead!	-1
I read all the reviews before buying this. But, I honestly thought with all the rave reviews that the people that posted 1 star were in the minority and my 2 year old would love this. Thankfully, I pulled it out of the box prior to Christmas. No sound comes from these bongos. It doesn't matter if you hold them between your legs or on the floor, there was nothing. I assume the others that wrote wonderful reviews had bongos that worked. These were a bust and am sending them back. Thankfully, that so far has been easy. UPS is coming and picking them up at no cost. I will try the Floor Tom Drum before giving up on Remo. The only thing good I can say is the appeared sturdy, it was just as if you were hitting your hand on a table, there was no drum sound at all. We just played in a drum circle and so I thought he would appreciate something like this.	-1
There are two bolts joining the two drums, that are easily accessible by flipping over the drums. My kid constantly wants to flip the drums over and reach in. They're sharp enough bolts to cut a kid easily. Why didn't they at least cap these?  The drums otherwise sound fine and my kid likes them. It's just troublesome because you have to be constantly vigilant to avoid your child's injury.	-1
They don't sound as good as i thought they would.	-1
I didn't care for the sound of this, for the money I would recommend the $33 small floor tom	-1
There isn't a difference in sound between the two sized bongo drums. My 6 month old was not interested. She loved banging our dog dishes so we thought she would love these but they just don't seem to have a good enough sound to keep her interested.	-1
A CAN OF COFFEE HAS BETTER SOUND; WASTE OF MONEY	-1
Very small and for little hands. If your child is above age three, I would look for one more professional. Sound isn't so great either.	-1
We bought this for my 3 year old on his birthday.  He has a small wooden drum set that he likes a lot, so I thought this would go over just as well.  Wrong.  He's totally bored with it.  The noise is not distinctive -- he might as well be beating on an oatmeal canister.  Take a pass.	-1
the banana broke open after just a few sessions of playing with them and made a huge mess. Would like to see about returning it. Doesn't seem right.	-1
Cap to keep led beads in shaker fell off. Not safe for children.	-1
Omg! We used to love these shakers until my son accidentally dropped one on the kitchen floor and it broke open and a billion tiny metal beads came out! My 14 month old grabbed some but thankfully we were right there. Terrifying! This is a hazard.	-1
I could hear what sounded like an unexpected rattle before opening the shipping box.  I expected to find "rattles" all through the box, which I did not.  They were all contained in the sealed bag with the fruits.  They were exactly what I was hoping for...but could not tell which fruit was "leaking" and could not take the chance that one of my grandchildren would accidentally end up with a mouthful of the little b b's.  I could have asked for a new shipment, but opted instead to return and move on.	-1
The end of the banana broke. It punched in and you can see what looks like a small stem inside. Whether this could come out or the hundreds of tiny beads, I assume either could cause significant problems for an infant or toddler.	-1
one day into use and the balls inside fell out, all over our living room! not what we wanted to happen.	-1
These were made in China, contrary to the information on the Nino website.  We are keeping them because they appear to be a low risk for heavy metals, and are not played with the mouth.	-1
If you use these to teach children about music, you will be teaching a bunch of kids to be tone deaf. They have no qualities of a musical instrument. Big disappointment. However as a bat where the kids can just whack it against the wall or other items, they aren't too bad if you allow such behavior.  I guess that's why they are called boomwhackers. They are primarily whacking tools that make some sort of sound.	-1
