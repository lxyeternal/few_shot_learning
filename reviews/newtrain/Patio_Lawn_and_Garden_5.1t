I don't spend a lot on my flags because they really get beat up.  So I but the lesser quality figuring that they'll have to be replaced a couple of times a year anyways.  The fact that this very inexpensive flag is still flying 8 months later pleases me well.  It's up about 20 feet, 7/24, and sees winds averaging 5 to 10 mph on a 'normal' day with the occasional storm friont gusts reaching as high as 60+ mph.  So far (8 months later) it's just now starting to show a little fraying on the ends.  I'll be buying another shortly to have ready when this one finally gives in.	1
Super fast processing and shipping, if you are looking for flags look no more good quality product and a great company to do business with.	1
Great product.  I would recommend this product.  I would recommend this product.	1
GREAT PRICE I LOVE MY STATE AND COUNTRY	1
Great display flag for the den.	1
Not much to say about the flag.  It is a cheap (price wise) polyester flag that serves its purpose in our school cafeteria.  The color is vibrant and the size is a true 3' x 5'.	1
Serves the purpose and seems to be holding up well.  I'm a little concerned about fading of the colors, but we'll see how that goes.  For the price, I think it is a good buy.	1
very good	1
I love that the back has a flap to make it look like hes selling ice cream. My boys love chugging on trains. So much cheaper than Thomas. And the show is more fun.	1
A very dear friend of mine is slowly losing her sight.  These pens make it possible for her to continue to take notes and communicate with others because the felt tip is much thicker than most, does not smear, dries fast, and is easy to read.  Thanks for delivering a great product in a timely manner.	1
My kids are all about the emojis and these were an affordable way to please them. Better made than some I've seen.	1
Awesome emoticon balls i collect these so when i found these i grabbed them fast as i could.. but great product for the price..	1
Was not available locally but was greatly enjoyed by my 4 year old granddaughter.	1
So pretty!  I love that she's holding a cat, my cat in heaven!!!	1
This is absolutely exquisite! It's made of cardboard, like in the description, but honestly I woudln't have known if it hadn't said so, it is so sturdy and so highly shellacked (or whatever the term is) that I actually forget it *is* cardboard, it totally looks and feels like ceramic. And it is absolutely LOVELY, better even than the picture!!! I bought one for my daughter for Christmas, then had to buy another one for me!	1
I just received this angel as a gift.  It is so very beautiful!  The figurine is much lovelier than the picture depicts.  The detail is remarkable.  This is a beautiful way to express comfort in the loss of a beloved cat.	1
Beautiful tissue cover. Colors are great with a variety of shades of blue/purple/green, could complement to almost any color scheme.	1
I've used it for edc and like it. It is a slip joint. A very well made knife for the price.	1
Really please with this.  The details are sharp, clear and fine.  I'm not sure how it would hold up outside even with a weather proof spray (recommended), but it's so nice that I.m keeping it inside on my fireplace mantle.	1
Does what it states...effectively halves the recycle time for my 360 ws pack...perfect...	1
This is really nice to use, however, just not for me.  The color Saddle Shimmer does give fair warning, but even though it really is only a shimmer, it's still more then I like to wear (just a personal preference)  That being said, it does apply very smoothly and stays put.  I just wish this company would make a product that has no shimmer or glitter.	1
This Angel  is  beautiful.  I as so glad I chose this one because it is even more beautiful than it looks online. The detail is exquisite.  I recently  lost our 14 yr. old girl (cat) to bladder cancer and this will go on her grave along with some other memento's.	1
These so cute! My grand daughter loves them!	1
Cute as could be. We really do like these on our girl's fly-away hair. They look nice and help to keep her hair out of her face. She likes to look at the Peppa pig hair clips and select the ones for her hair each time. I think she is very proud of them and we are pleased with them.	1
For the Franklin lover. My Godson takes this thing everywhere. I may need to buy a few more as he is already in the process of destroying this one with his love.	1
Performs as described.  Allows both sides of the ProPac PB960 battery to be tied together for faster recharging of a connected speedlite/flashgun.  Recycle time for my Neewer AD-360 dropped in half, as measured using the completely scientific "one mississippi, two mississippi" timing method.	1
my son loves it	1
nice shimmer, stays on.  too expensive	1
Bought it in memory of a beloved fur friend. I agree with the other reviewer who said they wish there was  a choice in the color of the cat the angel is holding. But ultimately, it's the sentiment behind the statute that really matters--not whether the cat is an accurate depiction of the one we're mourning.  It's a beautiful statue and doesn't look or feel like cheap plastic the way so many resin pieces do. Well worth the price, IMO.	1
Great breaker bar. It worked great on on the job that I bought it for.	1
Like them	1
As with the other Chugginton trains from this line, Frostini is larger than standard trains and will not fit into any small tunnels or buildings if you have a train set. It still works on the wooden tracks and of course can be played with anywhere else. It has held up well so far.	1
Works just like the other two units that I already have. Love the trickle charge feature and ease of connection.	1
I am so hooked on these Critters! My 3 yr old granddaughter asked for a house and families for Christmas and we bought a ton of them at Toy-R-Us with coupons. These prices are the same; some items are less! I'll be happy to play with her!	1
After losing our almost 15 year old cat,I was looking for a little statue for my rose bed,to mark her burial place. This little memorial statue was just the perfect thing. It's not so large that it looks tacky,but just the perfect size to remember my lost furbaby. The only con at all was that I wish there were more color options for the cat.	1
Good quality toy.  These seem to get little scratches on them easier than Thomas trains, but I believe that is more due to the boxy shape.	1
Bought this for my grandson for Christmas!  He loves it and it holds up really well.  Looks exactly like the Chuggington characters on TV	1
I have one of these i purchased through a hobby shop works great needed another for my sons battery for his birthday.	1
How many times have you had to unscrew a nasty bolt and not had the leverage to get the bolt out or the nut off? This bar is the one that you need. 15 inches long, with a 3/8" socket mount gives you lots of leverage to beat that bolt into submission. If you are a shade-tree mechanic this is the product you need.	1
I am so HAPPY to have found these! They work great and are wonderful for the environment! I just gently rinse them off, then gently brush with a tiny bit of soap if really dirty and set out to dry.  I have washed each filter several times and they still work like new!! Very happy with them!	1
Back and knee saver when taking up vynal tile in the basement	1
This tool not only worked well and was used to remove the tile, the vinyl, partial board, and old hardwood flooring. It also works very nicely as a driveway ice and frozen snow chipper and remover once the flooring task was completed. The fiberglass handle and its ability to bend actually assisted in the removal process over a unbendable metal handle. Yes, if I ever need an additional one I would buy it.	1
gave it a sharp edge and viola! strong item...	1
Used to remove old linoleum tiles, made the job a lot easier.	1
Bit big for a girl, but I did use it and it worked really well.  Got up very old vinyl and was a great help in removing carpet pad that was stuck to the floor.	1
Heavy and heavy duty! Good tool to have on hand .	1
good	1
This tool saved me so much time. I purchased a house that had horrible linoleum floors that were too far gone to lay new flooring on top of. I purchased an random oscillating scraper, with much back pain and being on my hands and knees it worked very slowly and chipped the old flooring away rather than scraping up huge pieces. I went ahead and bought this bully scraper and everything started to move along at a fast pace. It is made very well, the blade is thick high quality steel and the handle does not bend even under strenuous scraping. Any equipment will start to dull while rubbing it against cement, but this did so at a much slower rate. I did run into two or three spots where the linoleum was heavily glued and would not scrape off, just a word of advice if you have access to hot water and have cement flooring it helps to mop on some hot water and let it sit for a couple minutes and it will scrape off like butter.	1
If you own a large walk in chicken coop with a floor this is a must. Cuts cleaning time to a third.	1
Have not received yet but looks like it will work well to help me cut paths through ice and snow that falls off the roof. I have great hopes.	1
worked great	1
Wished the handle was a little longer but seems very well made. Actually got this for taking care of unwanted reptiles in the yard, and should do the job well.	1
Heavy duty but not heavy.  It's a good ice cutter.  If you have snow, you need this. A shovel alone will never get you down to black top.	1
Good product though a bit overall for my uses. I will keep it and use it from time to time.	1
When I purchased this tool, I was in the process of installing ceramic tile floors in my utility/sewing room, and was prepping my kitchen floors for porcelain tile. This tool lives up to its name, and performance; not to mention it saved my back from much pain. Also, I love the fact that it is made in the USA.	1
This floor scraper was delivered quickly,and was exactly as described. Very well-made heavy-duty tool,and I really appreciate the non-wooden handle with the rubber cap on the end. No more worries about splinters as it gets older.  I also like the fact the handle is so long. So does my bad back that doesn't like to bend.	1
This worked great for fixing a leaky hose.  I just cut the hose at the leak and slid this on and tightened it.  It was that easy.	1
Repaired the end of my old hose after a sprayer got corroded to the metal end.  Just cut it off and replace it with this, works great.	1
I was setting up some 55 gal plastic drums for rain barrell's and foulnd that I could drill a 3/4 inch hole and screw the coupling into the drum near the bottom of 2 (or more) drums and connect them with short pices of an old garden hose.	1
it's a great quick fix-it item, but one has to be carefull and do not overtightnen the screws. They snap off the threads and then the coupling is unusable. In higher quality couplers all parts are made of metal (brass). Of course, metal is much more durable and reliable.	-1
Glad to provide a positive review to this simple solution to a failed thread.  Just cut-off the hose, and use this new hose coupling. Will save you lots of money.  No need to throw-away an old hose with broken threads.  This is cost-effective for older hoses.	1
Great fix for my hose	1
An inexpensive way to fix a burst hose.  I had another one of these on my hose, but it was metal.  When the hose burst further down, I couldn't get the metal hose mender off to move it because the screws had fused to the metal body.  I have had to move this one several times, since my super long hose tends to burst during the hot summer.  It comes apart and screws back together quickly.  It's a cheap fix until the hose gets too short and needs to be replaced.	1
Works exactly as expected.	1
Replaced a hose end that was leaking at the seem...cut it off and replaced with this.  Now I can use my hose nozel and not get soaked from water running down my arm.  Very happy with it and I didn't even have to make a trip to the store.  Amazon prime rocks.	1
Works as expected.	1
Well made and easy to install. This product is so much better than the brass fitting with metal radiator type hose clamp which constantly cuts my hands when I'm use and always needs to be tightened. I liked this so much I bought another one the next day!!	1
This worked perfect for me I was not gonna buy another hose. Easy to put on and no drip or leak. The price is great so I will buy more in case it snaps during the summer from the hose being dropped on the floor sometimes. How can anyone complain about this quick fix? and so cheap at least it works so you can save up for a darn whole new hose.  lol  Works for me......thank you	1
As described.  Screws turn a little hard	1
I generally buy metal fittings and couplers when I can but this was for a yard hose which I use and move around less frequently.  I had some concerns the plastic would strip when screwing it tight to compress the hose, but I was pleasantly surprised. Been using these now for a few months and I really can't complain. Metal is best but these cost less than half the price and have held up very well so far.	1
needed to make short hoses and these work well	1
Good.	1
This is working fine and was just what I needed.	1
Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.	1
I've used these for years.  A little pricey on Amazon, but there's no way I'm going to HD for one of these by itself! Just assume that you'll need some lubricant to slip the insert into the hose.  Don't waste your time just trying to force it on. I've been surprised that I've never stripped one of these before.  They seem to be a quality product that lasts forever, and is very easy to install.  They even have the combo screw heads so you can go flat or Phillips.  MUCH better than going out and buying a new hose.	1
Awesome! Thank you!	1
I use these regularly to repair my hose. Works great!	1
Cheaply made, it broke when I tightened the screw.	-1
Great deal.	1
Reasonably priced and easy to install. No leaks after installation. Knowing that the item was polymer, I was careful not to over tighten the screws.	1
The plastic piece broke on mine in a few months,,,,,,suppossed to be  HEAVY DUTY.....?? Why can't someone in the US design somthing good.	-1
I bought two of these from Lowes.  On one the rubber seal on the hose bib connection failed after a couple months.  On the other water leaked from the left dial control.	-1
Piece of crap plastic sprayer. Pay the extra money and buy a metal one! This one sucks!	-1
I have only used it once but it did what the manufacturer claimed it would do.	1
They work great..price was great..	1
I ordered this product and the part that sprays out the water is not working and I had to contact Gilmour to be able to get a replacement part. Plus Gilmour is going out of business and will not be Bosch company I think. They said they will send me the replacement part. It was so disappointing to have a new sprayer and it would not spray the fine spray mist but it sprayed water.	-1
Thanks	1
I have to admit I gave all mine away that I purchased. I like to mix up my own lawn food from some of Jerry Bakers recipes, stuff that requires soap, lawn food, ammonia, mouth wash etc... Well this is supposed to be a 20 gallon sprayer, meaning when 20 gallons passes thru the sprayer the container should be empty.. I could spray this forever and nothing would ever seem to empty from the sprayer. I would disconnect the bottle and see the material drawing up the straw, so I know it was sucking, but the bottle never emptied or more like a 100 gallon sprayer as it would take forever which dilutes the mixture. I think for what I was using it for it wasn't strong enough to draw the solution out of the container and actually spray it.. Maybe it has enough to draw up the straw but never enough to mix with the water. Otherwise I can't explain how I could water my lawn about 2500 Sq Ft for say 25 min and the bottle remained full.. I had 3 of these and all of them were the same.. I tried all bottles and had the same issues, nothing was being drawn from the cup. With the soap mixture I could spray this right up against a tree and I SHOULD see some soapy solution, but I don't see anything resembles what I put in the cup... Now maybe these were not designed for what I am spraying, but there are the same Jerry Baker sells, or looks the same.. I finally got a Chameleon brand sprayer and it empties in basically 15 min, so there is a difference... Don't waste your money unless what you are spraying is VERY thin..	-1
This is a review for the Gilmour 20 Gallon Lawn Sprayer 390 Teal/White. It was received  with 2 parts missing (the interior tube and the black sprayer that fits on the tip). I also ordered the  Gilmour No Pre-Mix Sprayer 486 at the same time, and it too came lacking some parts. Thats  2 out of two Gilmour products that were lacking parts. Obviously, there is a lack of quality control. Unit was exchanged, but why waste my time exchanging it?  update: The replacement came with all the parts, but the on/off valve doesn't work. Whats wrong with this company?	-1
Did not work properly when it came to mixing solution this product for what it cost was a waste of money	-1
Holding up well.  I really like the readability from my house to the mount.	1
Perfect. I can see the water level without going outside.	1
Worked great! Easy to read from inside	1
Excellent	1
Good product.	1
Nice big gauge	1
I have had several of these.  I just have to remember to dump out the water before a freeze.  It is easy to see the amount of rain we got from the kitchen window. In North Texas there is rarely enough rain to make me happy but at least I can rejoice when there is some in the rain gauge.	1
Great product. I used this same product 20 yrs ago. I was pleased to see it still being made.	1
Best rain gauge I've used..	1
Very E-Z to read. Love the jumbo size	1
This is a replacement for an much older E-Z READ JUMBO YOU'LL  LOVE This for Sure Thanks John	1
You can easily see how much rain you received from quite a distance.  I've placed only about 50 feet from the back door yet you could read this at twice the distance.  Using a couple of screws, I was able to attach this to our wood fence.	1
Love it!! Easily seen from a distance	1
As described and works great and very easy to read	1
Love these rain gauges.  Easy to read from a distance and seem to be accurate enough for our purposes.  This is probably our third of this brand over 10+ years.  Really not an issue as the sun and critters like raccoons do a number on anything plastic here.	1
You will like this rain gauge, great design for rain, you can put it anywhere, package was very safe, just need rain	1
This is a great rain gauge. Keep it in during the winter if you have cold temps and it will last a really long time. I will buy another one when this one finally wears out.	1
I bought this one to replace a previous one I had owned for years.  This rain gauge is easy to read from a distance.  However you don't want to leave it out all winter.  A light freeze will not hurt it,unless it is full of water, but all winter will hurt the seal on the bottom.	1
This rain gauge was exactly as described. Love the large numbers on the rain gauge so you can see the inches of rain from a distance. Seems to be made well.	1
I had to return this hose after using it one time.  It developed a hole in it immediately.  I had to order a different type of hose.	-1
The plastic gets a little foggy after a couple years, but I love it and just reordered more for the future	1
Easy to see on deck railing.  Seems accurate.	1
works great	1
Great product fast shipping	1
Tested accurate and easy to read from a distance.	1
easy to see, great design for measuring small amounts,  great price.  The delivery got interupted by Hurricane Mathew, so we missed a great chance to measure lots of rain here in SC, but we are looking forwrd to using it.	1
Works well	1
Easy to read and nice looking	1
I have had this style gauge for over 30 years.  Glad to still find replacements on amazon.  Best rain gauge every.	1
Perfect.	1
It works great and it's big enough to see a long way off.  This is a direct replacement of one I've had for 11 years that finally wore out.	1
Works great. Easy to read and mount.	1
good value	1
Just like the one I am replacing that is about 10 yrs old. The sun has finally faded it and yellowed the plastic. Overall a great rain gage. You get a lot for the price.	1
exactly what I needed	1
Works great!! easy to read!	1
Love the size.	1
Easy to Read from a distance. Perfect	1
PRETTY ACCURATE	1
I've had a half dozen of these over the last 15 years. These are great and given some to friends as gifts. Last fall I took mine down for the winter. You think I could find it this spring? NOT. it is probably stored within 10' of where I thought I put it away. So after an hour of searching, fuming and cussing... I decided to just replace it to save myself a brain hemorrhage. If these are out of production? BUMMER.	1
No hose is perfect, but this one is strong enough to at least resist kinking and is not easily damaged by UV sunlight.	1
Good lightweight hose for around the home.	1
I've used Apex hoses for 15yrs plus, but after having been so disappointed with the Never Kink (always kinks) series. I went with a rubber / vinyl from ACE that I really liked - except until if failed after only 2 seasons by internally leaking between the exterior rubber jacket and the vinyl liner and then morphing into a python before developing several pin hole leaks all on its own within a week. I enjoy landscaping and gardening, so I need good garden hose function of yore (10yrs+ ago before ,more corporation mergers and lesser quality outsourced imports).  So I went back to Apex for this 8509  - which is far from heavy duty in my experience. Hose is surprisingly lightweight and although 5/8" has never overcome it's shipping slightly collapsed oval shape after hours in the sun and under 80lbs + city water pressure. As other reviews have pointed out - the bib end is nice heavy machined brass, but the service end is lightweight thin brass.  Pros - Lifetime Warranty and good telephone support from Apex.   Doesn't hang or catch on things as easily as a rubber exterior hose.   Might be better suited as a reel hose or for someone who would appreciate the lighter weight for maneuvering.  Cons -1) Kinks by just looking at it (or seems to) when pulling it to a new location. I must be very careful to unwind as I pull after being carefully coiled in 4' diameter.  2) Doesn't flow as much water as my previous 5/8" 100' rubber vinyl hose.	-1
I bought this to replace one that I bought about ten years ago. I like these type of rain gauges.	1
I had one of these for 20+ years, finally a small crack formed when the water froze and expanded at the bottom, needed another, glad they still make them. Excellent for mounting on a deck railing. I'm very nearsighted and it's easy for me to read from the house, maybe 15' away.	1
Great gauge - can read at a distance.	1
This Earthway spreader is replacing a very old Republic spreader (~25 years old with hard plastic wheels).  This 2150 spreader, as well as Earthway's customer service, is awesome!  I contacted Earthway for a small issue and they promptly sent out the replacement part needed.  Customer service is courteous and responsive.  Quick shipping for Amazon's partner and Earthway's extraordinary support make this one of the best purchases I have ever made.  As for performance, this spreader is easy and a joy to use (not my general response to yard work).  I actually look forward to the opportunity to use this spreader in the future.  If you are looking for a spreader, this is could be the best purchase you can make.  This spreader is an incredible tool.  It is well made and feature rich.  I absolutely "love" the large pneumatic tires for ease of use, and the accuracy of the spreading dry fertilizer.  The Side-Spread-Control is a very useful feature to avoid spreading fertilizer on hard-scape (patio, driveway, sidewalks, etc.).	1
Very visual. from my home. Good tool.	1
With these large numbers you can see from a distance and works good for us.	1
Very  Pleased!!!  Well made.  Follow the assembly directions.	1
This Earthway 2150 Commercial Spreader is GREAT! Very sturdy and the large tires roll over roots, twigs and bumps very easy. Also easy to roll on inclines. I put 20-30 lbs at a time. When the material gets towards the end you have to shake it a bit as you walk to keep it flowing but that's not a problem. I noticed that the setting that the weed and feed bag gave for Earthway was 11.5, was not enough, it barely came out. I pushed the handle and closed the opening then reset it at 13 which was better, but I had to walk the area again to use the amount figured for the 10,000 sqft. Next time I'll set it at 14 (trial and error). I washed it really good and sprayed it with Fluid Film. I plan on using it 2-4 times a year. Hope it lasts for years. :) It took my husband about an hour to put together. He said something about a part number was not marked correctly, that was the only difficult thing.	1
I ordered this for my dad to replace one that he had previously that broke. He hangs it on his chainlink fence and this one was easy to hang and it really is jumbo. It was a little bigger than I expected, but it still looks nice and is very easy to read. My dad likes it. If it would only rain here then I could tell you how it works.	1
I bought this as a gift because I've enjoyed mine for years. The large and hi-viz numbers make it so easy to see from a distance. It's important to note these 2 things: 1. In the summer months, if you don't empty the water for a few days after it rains, plan on having a mosquito nursery spring up, and 2. If it freezes and water's still in there... it's likely to split (I learned that the hard way!)	1
awesome very smooth.	1
Does the job! Sturdy!	1
Well built and worth the money. I was short one locking washer and nut and the company next day aired the the ten cent items to me. I was shocked that they would spend $10.00 to ship ten cents worth of product. Super job on customer service... Great quality but may take a few hours to put together...	1
Easy to read from the house!!	1
love it	1
Great unit and it is just like the 2170 which has a bigger hopper.  Even though the 2170 has a higher msrp it is on sale now for $30 cheaper. See my review frmthe 2150.	1
The spreader on its overall merit is very good. I did ~3,000 square feet of my yard in under 20 minutes with 2 bags of milorganite. You gotta haul tail on the medium setting (3.5mph). I knocked one star off for exactly what the other reviewers have already stated...the instructions are terrible. It took me 2 hours to go back and forth between YouTube videos and these instructions to figure out how to get it together. At least three times, I had to undo several bolts because I'd put them in the wrong place or installed in the wrong order. For example, the arm that connects the lever to the hopper hole opener was very difficult to determine the exact orientation for install. I spent 20 minutes just trying to understand the order of the parts that need to go on before you put the wheels on and put the pins in place to hold them in. There are only two videos on YouTube and both apply to slightly different models of Earthway spreaders, but it helps to give you the general idea. The included instructions have no dotted lines to help you follow what connects to what in which order. The videos also show that different models of Earthway will apparently come with more parts too. Like washers. I guess the 2150 requires no washers because I didn't get any.	1
great easy to read even for old folks	1
Very accurate	1
Just received my Earthway Commercial 50-pound Broadcast Tow Spreader yesterday.  The assembly took 2+ hours.  Have just finished spreading fertilizer on my 32,000 sq.ft. lawn.  The spreader worked well and spread the fertilizer evenly using my John Deere tractor.  So much faster and easier than using a walk behind spreader.	1
Replaced an older spreader with this same model again. Hard to believe how much easier the new one is to push!	1
Have owned this since 2010 and STILL operates as good as the first time I used it.  I owned the piece of shxt Scott's models prior and they ALWAYS fell apart, spring in tension cable would break, difficult to use due to the very small wheels and bucket.  I got SO tired of that brand breaking, I splurged on this.  Lasted 5 years, using approx. 5 times per year, full capacity/  EASY to roll (I have .40 acre lot with hills, slopes and flat areas), easy to fill and adjust, etc.  LARGE bucket = less refills means less work with a very large yard. Not one regret with the buy!  Will probably last another 5+ years.	1
What a waste of MONEY a $60 one a Wal-Mart will do the same thing. the only thing its got going for it is the tries.the barrel won't let the fertilizer completely drain the butter fly adjustment screw is plastic witch is cheap and all ready broke the 5th time I used it and boy boy it will spill the fertilizer out in a heart beat if you are not careful I can go on and on but I won't but I did try to warn you	-1
Outstanding	1
Bought this to replace an identical one that had lasted over 15 years.  Love this model because it can easily be read at a distance.	1
Heavy duty with a nice calibration.  We used it for salt applications but you must wash the unit off to keep it flowing.	1
Just got tired of replacing my cheap $40 box store Scott's spreader every year cause the cheap plastic wheels or axle would break. Bought this Earthway 2150 and have now had it a full year. Still performs like new with Zero signs of damage or quality drop off. The large rubber wheels and wide track make using this Earthway on hills or an uneven yards simple. The cheap Scott's would tip over when half full of fertilizer on uneven lawns because of the cheap small plastic wheels and terrible center of gravity. Go ahead and spend the extra money now and have a product that will last a lifetime instead of some cheap garbage that costs more in the long run and has to be replaced every season.	1
This is very easy to read. Works great.	1
WORKS GREAT	1
Works well and easy to see.	1
Great gauge.  I've had one for ten years or so and had to replace it.	1
I purchased this item September 2, and we finally got some rain here in (Dallas) Texas over a month later - a whopping 3/4"! So I finally got to see this rain gauge in action and am able to write this review. It works great. It's simple with no moving parts. I've tried other gauges (the wireless kind) with zero luck, and I finally decided: simple is best in this case. This gauge measures up to 5" of total rainfall, and the large, yellow numbers can easily be read from a distance of 30 feet or more. It has a red, plastic float disc that rises as rainwater collects in the gauge. The scale is graduated in 1/4" increments such that 1" of rainfall corresponds to about 3" on the gauge, so it's also easy to read rainfall in 1/4" increments. All in all, I'm very happy with it. It's a great value for the money, and like they say, "It just works."	1
awesome spreader	1
Well built.  I have rented one of these (same model) from my local garden supply store for several years.  It is a great spreader.  Packaging the item came in was poorly taped and the bow was just about to come open.  Inside the Amazon box was the manufactures box.  There was no padding inside either box so parts had jostled around a bit, some parts got scuffed up, but everything was there.  Assembly instructions were adequate but could have been better.  Tools needed to assemble include a Phillips screwdriver, 7/16 wrench and socket w/wratchet, and a pair of pliers.  Assembly time was about 45 minutes.	1
Works Great, However there was no assembly instructions included.  How to go to the web site to download. Easy assembly after getting the instructions.	1
Nothing not to love.  I'm tall and most spreaders have a short handle.  Not this one.  Adjustable and plenty long.  ** Update ** After two summers of use, I really love using this spreader.  As a tall person, the handle is wonderful.  I like this product so much, I ordered a second one for our weekend place.  Google before you purchase.  Unlike my first purchase, I had to buy some place else because Amazon was not even close to being the low price leader I am used to them being.  Great spreader!	1
I bought this last year to replace my old Scott's spreader after a wheel fell off of it. This one is so much better than my old one. The big tires make it much easier to push than my old one, especially on my sloping back yard. The handle is also long enough that I don't have to bend over as much as I did with the Scott's (I'm 6'3"). I've owned a number of spreaders and this is easily the best one I've owned. It's expensive, but it was worth it to me and with it's sound construction, it will probably be the last one I'll need to buy.	1
Well made. Easy to mount. Easy to read at a distance. The float doesn't fall out when the water is dumped out. Highly recommended.	1
This is the third raib gauge like this one we have had.  Easy to read and works extra good for us	1
This was on my wish list due to positive reviews on it.  It was sent as a gift and my friend spent almost 20 dollars and shipping on it. But the mounting brackets were missing and the plastic tube was bent so it could not be mointed.  The company had me return the one with the missing parts and sent a replacement. Update:  It has held up well for a couple of years.  I store it over the winter since it is designed for rain and not snow :)  and it gives accurate measurements from spring through fall.	1
Our neighbor's gauge always seems to be within .1" of the majority of readings in our neighborhood.  Our old gauge read WAY too high compared to hers, and now this gauge is 25% less than her readings. I might be skeptical if not for a recent rain when our backyard flooded, and we were sure the gauge would be full...it wasn't, not even close.	-1
This is an easy to read from a distance rain gauge with nice large numbers.  I like the two screw mounting bracket and the easy removal for dumping after a rain event!  And the large funnel at the top comes off easily for cleaning.  This is my 2nd purchase of this item.  Do remember to take it inside during freezing weather!  Otherwise it can crack if partially filled with water!	1
I have now used this on 4 applications and find that it is everything that is depicted.  Have not noticed any missed spots using this spreader although I make sure that it does not run too low on material.  The adjustment on the handle is a real boon as it can be adjusted for tall people.  I highly recommend this spreader.	1
Well, this hose will be the last one you buy unless the guy who hooked it up to a power washer claims that a tile from your roof fell and snapped it in two! (It can handle 500 PSI, so who knows what those guys were doing! I know they power washed our roof and also destroyed half my plants...I was not happy let me tell you!)  Well, I had just purchased it a few months ago and it didn't get tied in knots. That is pretty normal with those fifteen dollar hoses you can find just about anywhere. Well, they are just annoying! So, after buying a cheap one and knowing better, I ordered this one again.  I am again a happy gardener. Yes, even in winter you need a garden hose. It has a nice all weather construction, special foamed inner layers and a glossy sealed cover. What I really like about this hose is the Flow Guard Plus collar. When the hose is fully extended, normal hoses will kink at the faucet as you yank on them to get over to that last flower bed. Well, this one will not kink since it has a nice collar on it.  Definately a good investment. Just don't let anyone borrow it!  ~The Rebecca Review	1
Despite the product description of being accurate, the scale is graduated in half-inch increments which is not very precise.  The package did not include mounting screws, but that was only a minor irritant. Given its large size and lack of precision, I regret having purchased this rain gauge.  I will probably buy a replacement of a different model.	-1
Rain gauge looks good and is easy to read from our bedroom window. Unfortunately  it appears to have a slow leaks. I did not notice until after I had sent the box to the dump so now it will also go to the dump. One possibility for the leak might be our cold weather but is not oblivious where it is leaking except from somewhere on the bottom of the gauge.	-1
This is a large rain gauge with the large numbers. It is easy to read at a distance. The only thing I would improve is to color the back of the tube black so that the yellow numbers are easier to read.	1
Love the big size! It's so easy to have it hanging on the fence in the yard and still see & read the gauge.	1
I bought this because I have a large yard that the cheaper brands were not handling well, based on all the high ratings, and largely to see if it was really as hard to put together as a lot of reviews said. I have to say I had it put together in under an hour, and my seven year old son was helping me. I will agree the instructions aren't the greatest, but just thinking about what a spreader should look like and looking at their diagrams, I felt it wasn't anything to detract from a high rating.  I'll admit I didn't read any of it. I just looked at the drawings to get the bolt length and to see what holes to use. Maybe the written instructions are tripping people up.  I immediately loaded it with fertilizer and off I went. It is very smooth and broadcasts beautifully. I was worried about the lever and 'door' not being smooth to close once it was loaded, but mine shut effortlessly.  The only minor negative experience I had is what they all do when they are almost empty. Since the drop holes are on the left side. It started only spreading to the left when I was down to the very bottom since the fertilizer was dropping enough. Like I said, this is common to all of them in one way or another trying to use up all of the fertilizer versus dumping it back in the bag.  I love the round hopper versus the square ones on most others. The wheels glide over uneven land. I like that the handle length is adjustable. I went with the middle length. I will probably keep it there.  I would have liked to have seen a metal bearing in the shaft versus a plastic collar at this price point. Time will tell if that is a longevity issue.  I have a feeling it will be fine.  I am very impressed with it, and I'm glad the assembly horror stories didn't steer me away. I should start a business of assembling them for people for $20. I'd be rich. ;-)	1
During assembly I noticed one of the wheels did not slide on the axle all the way to the end but left a good 1" gap short.  I called customer support and was told that a sales rep would respond to my concern. I asked to speak with a technician and not a sales person.  The sales rep responded that this is how it is designed without answering my question.  I have assembled many garden implements and have never seen this.  What will happen is the axle end will round out the inside of the wheel over time.  Poor design and even a poorer response from the manufacturer.  Do not recommend.	-1
Took my time putting the spreader together.  If I had to do it a second time, it would have been a snap.  Knowledge is power.  But compared to my old Ortho broadcast spreader, this Earthway is well built and I expect it to travel much better over my sun-baked south Texas lawn and back forty.  The wheels are a dream.	1
After all the reviews about assembly, I was a little apprehensive. It seemed like the quality was good once assembled, but the assembly process itself was a nightmare. Well, as another reviewer stated, the instructions have been updated and are VERY easy to follow. I had mine done in 50 minutes. Once it was done I gave her a test drive. Very nice unit. Scotts garbage be gone...	1
I got this for spreading salt and it functioned perfectly all through a New York State winter. The spreader is very reasonably priced and strongly constructed. It does take some effort to assemble the 2150, but it's not rocket science and just requires time. The hopper holds plenty of salt and the plastic mesh strainer top ensures that you don't dump in salt clunkers by mistake. Even if you do accidentally load a few clunkers, the design of the sliding door salt port at the bottom of the bucket is easy to access and clear out. My last spreader didn't stand up too well as most of the metal parts corroded away from salt exposure. This unit looks like it will last a long time.	1
FINALLY!  My old Scotts EdgeGaurd spreader broke this spring so now I can justify buying a new spreader!  I hated that old spreader.  It was hard to push because of the plastic wheels, the handle was too low and it didn't spread very far.  But man have things changed now that I've got me a good spreader!!  This new Earthway spreader is friggin awesome!  The pneumatic tires make pushing this over the lawn a dream.  And no more hunching over to push that old Scotts P.O.S. spreader.  The extended handle in this spreader makes it a breeze to push while walking in the upright position.  And because this spreader has a much wider throw than the old Scotts one did, you can cover your entire yard in fewer passes and/or get better overlap.  Now a lot of people complain that this spreader took them two or three hours to assemble.  Really?  REALLY????  Just relax, settle down and look at the pretty pictures.  Took me about 40 minutes and I didn't have any issues during assembly.  And in the end I got the best spreader in the neighborhood.  Seriously!  The first time I was out spreading I had two neighbors come over to check out my new wheels!!	1
Easy to install and read from a distance. Hold up to 5 inches of rain. Has a red float to measure rainfall.	1
This brand rain gauge has been my favorite for the past 20+ years.  This is only the third on in all that time.  It's easy to read at a distance which allows for real flexibility in where it's located. The price is up from the first one I bought(no big news there), but it's still my first choice.	1
I ordered two, one for my daughter, since they are so visible from a distance. After ordering them, I finally found them locally for the same price.	1
Easy assembly. I was able to cut down the time it took me to fertilize the lawn by half. It's a little larger than my old drop spreader, but it still moves easily with a load. It's been several weeks, now, since I fertilized and the lawn looks uniformly green and healthy.	1
Some assembly required but boy does this make fertilizer application easy. I used to have a drop spreader and endured using it until we bought more property. This thing lays down some fertilizer. Takes longer to clean it than do my acre. I don't see why it won't last a lifetime. I you are up against edges all of the time you might want to get the directional plates offered. Oh yea, I just double checked, made in USA. Finally something that has some quality left in it.	1
So far so good. Not too heavy and does seem kink resistant. Will see how sun resistant it is as it sits in full sun year round in the NM desert. Though wish it was a green/teal color instead of grey.	1
good hose hope it passes the test of time	1
Two words - simply awesome! I have about 1/2 acre of lawn with the back yard sloping downhill away from the house.  I am one of those wierd guy that actually enjoys yard work.  Having a beautiful lawn for my family to enjoy gives me a lot of satifaction.  I also do all my lawn maintenance - no service here.  Long story short, for the past 11 years, I have been using a P.O.S Scotts spreader from Home Depot.  The Scotts spreader is a complete P.O.S - crappy plastic wheels that are narrowly spaced and wobbles.  It also has a tendency to tip over to the side and spill everything out.  The cheap plastic wheel was also hard to push uphill.  I finally had enough and got the Earthway 2150 commerical spreader.  Wow, what a difference.  Huge pnumatic tires that are wide apart.  All metal frame.  This thing is tough and works like a champ.  If you are still using one of those junk big box store spreader, get rid of it and get this instead.  Highly recommended.  Take your time when putting this together.  It will take about 1 hour.  Aftewards, spray some lithium grease on the moving parts.  Everything should be smooth as butter.	1
I bought this jumbo rain gauge in a local big box hardware store about 10 years ago, and it had served us well until it split at the bottom after a freeze.  This was my fault, in that I usually would bring it in during the colder months. I was glad to find a replacement on Amazon, and bought 2 of them.  The new one is exactly the same as the one I bought 10 years ago - same receiver/holder, so I simply slid the new tube into the old mount.  We have the rain gauge attached to one slat of our wood fence, with the funnel protruding about 3 inches above the top of the fence. We can read the gauge from inside the house - probably about 50 feet away.  You can easily drain it after a rain, and periodically clean it if needed.  This rain gauge is the best I've seen.  I am highly recommending it.	1
This is probably our fourth or fifth Jumbo Rain-Gauge.  We feel that it fits our requirements perfectly.  We're happy that you still offer it.	1
I have tried several different type of rain gauges and find this one the be the old reliable. It is large enough to be seen at t distance, easy to keep clean and accurate. Recommended.	1
Spent way too many years doing way too many acres - yes - acres with a plastic wheeled piece of junk.  I love this spreader!  UPDATE July 25, 2013  The plastic plate which controls the flow of fertilizer on the bottom of the hopper decided to become very stubborn this spring.  I took the hopper assembly apart and smeared some vaseline around on all the contact areas of the plate.  It seems to have fixed the issue.	1
This is a very nice spreader.  It feels very solid and the pneumatic tires give it great maneuverability and handling over bumps.  The control arm is solid metal, not a cable, which gives you precise control and will last a long time.  The settings take some experimentation with your various products to get it right, but that is true of any spreader.  It has good distribution... probably flings material a little farther on the right side than the left, but it is far more even than my crappy Edgeguard ever was.	1
This is the second Earthway Spreader I have purchased. The first I got at Sam's Club and was very pleased for many years. I did not take care of it properly so I need to replace it. I was very supprized and happy with the new spreader. The handle bars were heaver and longer, tires are larger and spreader control better. Great spreader I would highly recommend to anyone.	1
good hose for the money	1
After only 4 months -- using it perhaps twice a week, at most -- something inside must have burst, and water is spraying all over.  I've had the Orbit version, only a few dollars more, for a full year, with much more usage weekly, and it's in okay shape.  I would steer clear of the Gilmour products based on my experience.	-1
So far - fantastic! Can produce virtually any spray pattern required to do the job.	1
Adequate because it holds up to 5 inches, and here in the Sierra Nevada foothills we can get that much in 24 hours. It's on a post about 30 feet from a window and I can read it clearly when my glasses are clean. I had a 4" version of this very model but lost part of it when we moved here but that one was at least 10 years old and looked as good as new. Well; almost. Close enough anyway. So I assume this one will last at least another generation.	1
Assembly was a pain since the instructions are awful. As I recall, at least one of the split pins holding the tires on is almost impossible to "spread" effectively, and the long threaded adjustment bar for the flow control was too long, causing it to foul the mechanism, making it impossible to fully close, until I fixed it with judicious use of a hacksaw. Took me about 2 hours to get it together.  However, in operation, the device performs well (I've not had any experience with cheapo spreaders, so have nothing to compare it to). Not sure why the rotating spreading disk is not an inch or two higher though - it seems as though a lot of the stuff gets thrown against the top of the tire, especially with lower flow rates. Also, as the hopper empties out, the flow tapers off and you have to wobble the thing to keep it spreading, resulting in slightly inconsistent rates, unless of course, you keep it topped off. So, in general, I guess the thing is OK, it does the job, but nothing exceptional.	1
Assembly of the Earthway was an unexpected chore. I'm mechanically inclined and literate, and eventually got it all together and working after a couple of false starts. Took about 2 1/2 hours though, thanks to the ambiguous instructions.  No big deal, since you only have to do this once. And, the assembly gave me a chance to examine all the parts carefully. The materials are all sturdy and fit together well.  Filled the hopper with a 40# bag of fertilizer and took off. This thing rolls really smooth. The big grippy tires traversed my rough land like it was a golf green. I'm 5'10", and the middle handle position is a great fit. You can easily cover a full acre without arm fatique or sore knees.  The broadcast pattern was good, it threw out the granules at least 6 feet on both sides. I set the rate lever in the middle (15), and that appears to work well for fert granules. I'll experiment with this setting a bit later, since it doesn't look like it's prone to accidental overfertilizing. 3 weeks after application, my grass had greened up nice and evenly - no streaks or burnouts to speak of.  Solid, well-engineered, and easy to operate. Nearly perfect in all respects. Only question remaining is how well it performs after several seasons.  UPDATE:1/5/13 Found one of the tires flat prior to fall spreading. No punctures, it just lost air. Pumped it up and finished the job. Next day it was flat again, so I shot some FlatFix into it and it's holding air now. Seems that the plastic rims do not seat the tires as well as metal, but this is the only problem I've had so far.	1
Good buy. Very sturdy works great	1
Works good	1
Good solid hose - hard to kink.	1
Nice hose, good quality.	1
I have purchased Flexogen hoses in the past and they have always been a good choice.  They have a wonderful warranty -- save your paperwork in case you need to have them honor the warranty.  They want you to cut off the 2 ends and return to them and they replace the hose free of charge.  I have had a couple of these hoses for over 10 years.	1
This is a quality spreader but its a 2 hour process to put this thing together. Two bandaids plus some aggravation and it was done. This product would have gotten 5 stars from me if they had just partially assembled it and put it into a slightly larger box.	1
A great hose for the money.  I live in the country and use hoses a lot.  This one is well made, rugged, and does not kink like some others.	1
too much	1
Seems like Gilmour has been slowly diminishing the quality of their Flexogen line; they're not as kink-proof as they used to be.  Still better than all the others in the category (can't speak to the things that cost double and triple the price, as I don't feel like shucking out close to $100 to see if it makes a difference).  I'll be buying more of these, since I have a lot of yard to get around, and this continues to be my first choice of hose.  It will kink, but it is, as its name suggests, very flexible, and never feels like I'm trying to wrestle a python when it's time to coil it back up.  I also like the neutral grey color; it doesn't stand out on the crushed gravel and flagstone walks surrounding planted areas and the driveway.	1
Great hoses made in USA	1
I was in need of a quality spreader and researched many. Got tired of the other kinds that you would normally buy at your local store only to get a piece of junk and find it at the curb for trash pick-up. I decided on this unit. Earthway makes a quality product. Opened it up and assembled it in about 45 minutes. Not too bad. Instructions were clear and picture illustrations a bit schetchy at times but none-the-less it worked out. Very satisfied! I would definitely recommend this spreader. Just be handy with tools and patience with the instructions and you should have it together without complications. Only wish that it came with a hopper cover. This is an option to purchase should you need it.	1
We have had spreaders in the past and they are weak and don't last.  This one is strong and very easy to use.  Even our friend who is a landscaper wanted to know where we purchased so he could order some.	1
This is an outstanding product.  It has heft, wheels don't slip EVER, well built and easy to assemble if you carefully read and follow the directions.  If you have at it without following the instructions you will pull your hair out.  I recommend this spreader very highly.	1
With so many reviewers giving this product 5 stars, I didn't want to spoil the good run by giving less than 5 stars.  However, there are some reservations that you should consider.  Since these detractors may apply to many brands of fertilizer applicators, it wouldn't be fair to assign blame only to this one model.  At mentioned in previous reviews, assembly requires diligence.  I am very mechanically inclined and did read and note all the prior assembly tips given by other reviewers.  I recommend you do the same.  I very carefully read and studied the assembly papers before putting this item together.  I thought that surely it would not take me 2 hours to assemble this given my experience, but it did take 2 hours 10 minutes.  As careful as I was, about 10 minutes into the assembly, I discovered that I had bolted the main frame to the plastic hopper upside down.  The assembly directions do have drawings but they are not nearly as good as photographs would have been.  If you don't feel you are good at following detailed instructions, either have a friend help you or find another brand that has better assembly directions or is already assembled.  That said, now for comments on the completed unit.  In past 14 years I have purchased several models of drop spreaders and rotary spreaders in my attempt to apply fertilizer uniformly and without having to have an ambulance standing by for resuscitation due to difficulty in pushing the spreaders.  I have around 1/2 acre of grass.  Front yard is about 60% of that total and is on a grade of around 7%.  Doesn't sound like much of a hill but when you are trying to push 40 pounds of fertilizer and spreader up hill, believe me, it is a lot.  My last spreaders were Scott's best drop spreader and rotary spreader.  The drop spreader theoretically could apply fertilizer more uniformly but suffers from 2 drawbacks: 1) the bottom holes and adjustable closer are plastic and subject to slight warping. With the very small holes, only a slight warping will cause fertilizer to fall faster out of some holes and slower out of others.  The result is banding (or striping) in the lawn.  Being careful to follow the wheel markings in the grass doesn't stop this banding since it occurs due to the adjustable closer misalignment. 2) the holes are rather close to the ground and any blade of grass that touches the undercarriage will deposit its dew onto the holes which will eventually cause the fertilizer to stick to the hole and not drop out.  This essentially disables the drop spreader until it is thoroughly dried out.  Applying the fertilizer in the afternoon when the dew is gone would seem like a good idea if you like heat stroke.  The Scott's rotary spreader is very difficult to push uphill.  I think this is likely because of the plastic wheels just do not roll smoothly.  Inherent disadvantage of a rotary spreader is that it will send the fertilizer out further when you are going down hill than uphill because you are traveling slower uphill and the impeller is rotating more slowly and throwing less of the fertilizer.  Now for the Earthway 2150.  Once assembled, the first thing I noticed was that it had 3 holes, not just 1, in the bottom of the hopper so that fertilizer dropped into the impeller more uniformly.  The impeller seemed to rotate faster for the same forward speed.  This would mean that when I am going slower uphill, it is still throwing fertilizer quite a distance (compared to the Scott's).  The pneumatic tires are tremendously easier to push up hill and even allowed me to travel faster than I could with the Scott's with the possible result that uniform application of the fertilizer will have improved.  It has been 8 days since I have applied the Spring fertilizer with Crabgrass preventer.  Usually, by 8 days in past years, I can already see the striping (with Scott's spreaders).  We have had rain the day I applied the fertilizer, so, it did get activated.  I am not seeing striping. I must admit, I expected to see it even with the Earthway 2150 but I am not.  I'll have to wait to end of July to see if Crabgrass is present.  If I didn't get the fertilizer on uniformly, I will have lots of Crabgrass.  We'll have to wait for that.  One comment on the adjuster used to determine how much fertilizer is going to fall to the impeller and be applied to your lawn.  The setting is based upon the weight of your fertilizer package and the square footage it is supposed to cover according to the bag claim.  I found that the adjuster is really more of a wild guess than anything scientific.  Although I calculated the setting in accordance to the Earthway manual, the first 3 passes I made in the front lawn used 1/2 bag of 15,000 square feet of fertilizer.  Obviously, this was grossly too much.  I made successive reductions in the setting as I made successive passes in the lawn.  I ended up with the adjuster set to its minimum.  I feel confident that after a couple more times of fertilizer applications this year, I will have settled into what setting is going to work for my lawn.  Since there are so many particle sizes within different brands of fertilizers, it is virtually impossible to tell ahead of time what is going to work for the adjuster setting.  However, I would caution you that likely it may apply your fertilizer much more heavily than the manufacturer had recommended.  Better have plenty of extra bags of fertilizer handy if you dial in the calculated adjuster setting.  I may have to cut that part of my lawn where the 1/2 bag of fertilizer was applied so heavily twice a week!  It isn't a perfect world for fertilizer spreaders.  If your lawn is flat, this rotary spreader will likely work better than other brands once you have the application adjuster figured out for your fertilizer product and have insured that you didn't bolt the mainframe to the hopper upside down.  If you have a hill as I do, this rotary spreader may be superior to other products also.	1
took too long to get, but was what I expected	1
This is a nice flexible and light-weight hose.  It does kink when it is uncoiled after storage, as do all hoses I have owned, but the kinks don't remain once the hose is straightened out based on the flexible construction.  The end connections are of good quality and should be durable.  Good hose, overall.	1
I bought this for spreadin sand and ice melt in the winter, and fertilizer in the summer. This thing is well built and solid. It spreads nics and doesn't clog easily. The large rubber tires work well for using in the winter (the Scott's spreader I was using would just slide accrosss the ice and not spread).	1

good hose so far. early days but optimistic.	1
Great hose so far. Flexible enough but does not kink.	1
Perfect hose for use with the 'pressure stick' attachment.  Got the 20' length, suits my needs just fine!	1
My husband is enjoying this hose! I gave it to him for Father's Day. It reaches the perfect distance for watering his vegetable garden. It is a high quality hose but it will still kink at times. Not as much as the hose he was using though. He is happy with it!	1
Flexogen hoses are well built with heavy duty brass fittings.	1
It plants seeds in the ground. It did fine for spinach and kale and arugula this spring. Is a bit difficult to use in thick soil but now I have fresh greens to eat.	1
Well made	1
Fantastic for a home garden.  The only issue is that seed hopper doesn't taper down to the seed plate pickup but is square across the bottom.  What this means is that you'll have a lot of seed left in the hopper and the seed plate can't pick it up.  I find myself shaking it from side to side or tilting at an angle as it's pushed (which screws up the exact planting depth).  If you buy your garden seed in the little packets, it'll be expensive.  However, guess the target users for this have bigger gardens and buy in bulk at garden/farm supply places.	1
works great, saves time	1
Best hose I've bought in decades.	1
I bought several sections of 50' and 100' sections of this hose due to Gilmour's reputation. Sadly, reputation and reality are two different things. All six bundles of hose were kinked where the male end is hidden by the cardboard packaging.   I waited for the kink to ease out - after use in warm weather  - but it's still there and the kink still impede's the flow.   I liked the product for it's ruggedness but this manufacturing/packaging flaw is fatal to customer loyalty.  Additionally, their guarantee is worthless as they never bother writing or calling back.	-1
Item arrived quickly and was of the quality expected.	1
This is made by Flexgen (Flexogen?), which is the worst hose I've had the misfortune to use.  Don't buy this unless you need to brush up on your curse words.  no stars  This is the most prone-to-kinks hose (I was going to say 'kinkiest hose') I've ever worked with, and I'm 70 years old and seen a lot o' hoses, honey!  Weather 50*, slight breeze, in the shade.  Perfect conditions for strenuous yard work.  I worked an hour trying to get this wound around one of those "roller" things mounted on the wall.  Sweat was pouring down me.  I knew I would never get it straightened out enough to get it on the roller.  I quit trying.  I got this at Lowe's, but I wanted to warn you not to buy it.  I got a Flexilla, and it's far better!  Does not kink; honest!  Mine's *100 ft long*, too!  Flexilla is more expensive, granted, but you won't learn any new curse words with it.  mb	-1
Time saving and cost effective. Works well, planted spinach, kale and arugula.  If the seeds are small it does drop multiple seeds, and can grind them up a bit. For the value I was impressed with this machine.  Likes loose soil with minimal clumps for optimal operation.	1
love this little planter will be buying the optional planter disks	1
Fits the spicket, but haven't used it yet. Raining a lot, and still cold. Western P.A.	1
Never disappointed with Gilmour flexogen hoses.!!	1
Works great!!	1
this really works good	1
got this to use for my gray water drain on my RV. Works well and seems to be pretty heavy duty.	1
Super nice hose!  Very flexible, not stiff even in cold weather.  I would say this is the best quality hose I have owned so far and that includes a bunch.  Worth every penny, cheap hoses just are not worth the trouble.  Just buy it, you'll be glad.	1
Heavy Duty Hose with a good abount of flexibility	1
I love this hose. barely kinks and feels super durable. I actually bought a second recently for the back of the house.	1
Decent hoses, will kink if they don't have water pressure.	1
Flexogen is good.	1
Huge time saver. Not as precise as a Jang but for 15% of the cost of a Jang it serves my needs just fine. Beets and radishes will need thinning.	1
Got mine second hand (but I bought the optional seed plates new for it).  Works fine but the prepped ground needs to be smooth and free of lumps (finely tilled and raked smooth).  I find the handle to be a bit short for me, I'm 6'1" so I have to bend over to use it (must have been built for a midget).  You need to keep the hopper clean and free of dirt and clean the seed plates before and after use (especially with coated seed like sweet corn).  I don't use the row marker at all, I run alongside my row string (every one of my rows are staked at the ends and strung with bailer twine.  Made in Indiana and should last forever.  I suggest applying a couple drops of oil to the wheel hubs every year.  Maintenance wise, other than keeping the hopper and seed plates clean, thats about it.  Nice planting tool for a larger garden saves your back and knees.  Things like onion sets still need to be planted by hand however.	1
A very good seeder. It is best to have the soil well rototilled, dry and free of clumps. If the dirt sticks to the ground opener, it's too wet.	1
A very good investment. I have been gardening and working construction since1960. This is the best hose I have used. It does kink if you mishandle it. The simple way to avoid that is to correctly handle it. Do not leave it out where it can be stolen.	1
used this hose so to add another outside  faucet great price for hose	1
Hose works great and seems like it will hold up for a long time!	1
Very good hoses. This is one of those get what you pay for times. Buy cheap hoses you throw away after a year or 2 or just get these and be happy for long time.	1
good	1
Good product, low price, shipped quickly.	1
Good quality. No kinking, and good flow.	1
I have used Gilmour Flexogen for some time and have never had a bad experience.  Cold weather we don't have in South Texas.  Multiple days of 100+ weather we do have.  I am looking forward to using this 75' in the garden, where the lawn irrigation does reach, and any other remote locations.  The others have been left out all year, since hear we use them all year.	1
Great product. Great price .fast shipping.  Exactly what it says .and I love this seeder planter !!! Will be purchacing more plates	1
plants corn great.  I have the 4 hole sweet corn plate and several others.  Use to plant beans and corn for a few years with it.  Highly reccomend it!	1
Works great behind a tiller... Found that slowing my walk improved the consistency..	1
This will kink but not as badly as most hoses.	1
Leak.  These hose leak.  No matter how you tighten them or anything else they still leak.	-1
Good quality hose	1
very strong it looks like it will last a life time !!!!	1
My expert garden shop sells these but they didn't have the shorter length. Excellent product, no leakage. Wish all of my hoses came from this company. Costly but well worth the money.	1
this is a heavy duty hose that works great	1
Wow mind blowing back saving item I love it , gets the job done real quick as long ure in loose soil. The best way too use this planter is to make  dry runs down the rows first & then go back and plant ure seeds!!	1
So far it's been working fine. You can tell it's quality and it will last a long time.	1
Works fine.	1
What can you say about a hose. Looks good and has brass ends.	1
great hose pipe ..that's it	1
Flexogen hoses are the best.  This is a nice long length. It does kink occasionally.  This one seems lighter than the ones I've used in the past.  My wife loves the gray color.  It looks better than the light green we have bought before.	1
nice	1
Got this for my dad as a Christmas present since he wanted a new hose. This is a nice strong hose that is very durable. He has forgotten about it and rode over it with his lawnmower and wheelbarrow and it still works perfectly. It is a little cumbersome due to thei weight but otherwise highly recommend for a durable hose	1
If you have ever planted a garden the other way you will absolutely appreciate this seeder.  I couldn't do without it.	1
Not an easy size to find. Thank goodness for Gilnour products. This is a well made hose. Will definitely stand the test of time. Have purchased many Gilmour products and all have been durable.	1
Just what I needed.  It is difficult to find a high quality 25 foot hose, but not on Amazon.  Perfect	1
I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and bought two shorter hoses instead of one very long one.  This hose really is very good quality and it is nice to wash my car without the leaky hose spraying almost as much water on me as the car. It does not kink! aleviating another problem with the old hose. I disliked wrestling with the old hose every time I wanted to wash the car.  It was shipped promptly and arrived on time.	1
Sturdy hose, and a great value. Nice textured black color.	1
The write-up says it will not kink.  I find that not to be true.  I really like the hose, but every time I use it, it kinks until I un-wind the kink.  Otherwise, I would have given it a "5" star rating.	1
works great	1
No complaints built attachment to pull behind John Deere 2320	1
I bought this because I needed another hose out by the garden area and/or to extend the 50 foot one I have at the house.  I don't know a lot about garden hoses, but I know that I wasted money buying really inexpensive ones that were nothing but a pain to  use with kinking and leaking issues.  I bought one very good quality hose a month or so go.. but realized that I had only solved half the problem so I decided to try Gilmour  to resolve the  extra footage that I needed,after reading the reviews on it  It is hard to say anything more than all the other  783 customers have said.. so I will simply say... its a good hose, it works perfect for me with no leaks, and I would not hesitate to buy it again.  I do think it is a bit heavy compared to my old cheap hoses, but the quality may come with the weight and I love the ease in rolling it up without having to stop and unkink it.  All in all.. thumbs up from me.	1
Excellent,  highly recommend.	1
Terrible hose. Twists up when ANY water pressure is applied. RETURNED!	-1
This seeder works great. If you have rocky or clumpy soil, it will be hard to use though. It seems to drop seed accurately. The product is built strong and light.	1
good delivery. easy assembly. well see how well it works this spring.	1
This is a wonderful tool for a medium size garden	1
Gilmour makes the best products.  perfect weight and strength for a serious gardener.	1
This is solid hose for garden use.  It is more rugged than others I have had and the fittings are excellent.  Despite claims, it is not kink proof, but that is a small thing, as I don't think any hose really is kink proof.  And the quality here is clearly above ordinary garden hose.	1
Never thought I would give a bad rating to an expensive garden hose, but the warranty seems worthless.  I say that, as there is no one manning the Call Center at Gilmour.  Sure, they have a lifetime warranty, but our hose failed due to a problem with the metal in the female connector.  It literally corroded away.  Sure, we've owned it for many years, but that's not the point.  The point is that if you call their 866 Support line (just try it), it will say "12th caller in the queue, we are busy, please use our website... blah,blah, blah".  Use the website to file a claim and you get no reply.  Call back later and it will say "12th caller in the queue..."  Coincidence?  I waited 35 minutes on hold and filnally got to "You are Caller Zero".  Which at 4:20 EST on a Tuesday, should mean you get your turn right?  Wrong.  I stayed at Caller Zero for another 10 minutes.  No one answered.  Emailed the company via their website...  still waiting on an answer.  So, if YOU are buying this hose for the Lifetime Warranty.  Dont.  And, if you think it will last a long time.  It didnt.  Don't believe me.  Check the picture.  Since there is no way to contact anyone in Customer Service at GILMOUR and they have no Facebook page, this One Star Review and picture will have to suffice.	-1
This hose is a bargain. I have shopped hoses at Home Depot, Ebay, Walmart, and here on Amazon. I was looking for a stout and reasonably kink-proof hose for the sprinkler in my front yard. For the price, this one cannot be beat. This is a very good quality hose that has been a pleasure to use and I've ended the problem I had with the last hose kinking when dragging it into place. No kinking with this one so far.	1
...horse poopoo!  Advertised as 600PSI test, 8-ply build, this hose leaked at BOTH ends after overnight 60PSI test.  Attached for your enjoyment is a cross-section of the hose I probably can't send back for a refund.  Now I ain't no rocket scientist but even on close up I can't see more than two layers separated by a flimsy nylon mesh...	-1
There is a competing seeder by the brand of Jang (nearly $400), that may be of interest to those reviewers who are critical of this Earthway.  For more on the comparison by a farmer who used both, as well as some useful tips on easy modifications, and more, try Googling  "  Jang or Earthway? A small farm vegetable seeder comparison  ".  The aforementioned article is found at the  rethinkingagriculture dot com  website.  As for me, I will be trying this Earthway come next spring (if the oil bust in North Dakota doesn't force me to relocate), and will update with my experience at that time.	1
It has really made a lot of my seed planting a lot easier. I was amazed how fast I was able to sow a 30'X30" patch of corn and similar patch of beans and peas.  It also cur down on waste by precisely spacing the seeds and distributing them properly	1
A OK	1
worked well	1
Great gadget. A real back saver. Plants multiple types of seed at the correct depth and covers the seeds too.	1
Strong and flexible.  Still can kink if you don't watch it; otherwise I would've given it 5 star rating.	1
For the high price and glowing reviews, thought for sure I'd get several years of use from this "quality" hose but nope...I bought this last year and have used it about 5 months and now it leaks! I have never had a hose leak where this one does - about an inch up from the crimp on male brass fitting(see pic). Btw, the hose was drained and stored indoors last fall/winter and this is not a simple washer issue...It is leaking in the middle of the brass...Very strange and disappointing - especially for this price! Save your money...  Update: Glimour is replacing the hose at no charge per their warranty. I filled out a form on their website and included this pic - nothing to mail in - they are taking my word. [...]  I will update when I receive it and then again after a similar amount of use. Hopefully they have the (known?) problem fixed as I really am needing additional quality hoses to purchase in the near future but I am now very hesitant...  This still doesn't change my one star rating for the hose; however, they do have 5 star customer service...	-1
As pictured, described and expected and it arrived on time.	1
It worked well the first season. This spring it sprung a leak just beneath the nut, so it cannot be repaired. A hose should last more than one season.	-1
great hose	1
great	1
Ordered the Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeded with 6 plates after I realized that with advancing age, ours, not the seeder, the ground was just a little too far down to have our old back chasing seeds. Great product.	1
Fantastic!  Durable.  Exactly what you need !  A +	1
I do like this hose.  No kinks, and easy to put back on the hose hanger after use.  Good strong connectors.  Good buy!	1
I love this tough, durable hose. The length is perfect for a large backyard & kinking is a minimum even in cold weather. It is easy to attach to the faucet & the water flow is great. An extra is the metal spiral at the faucet end to keep it from crimping where it hangs down. Much better than the plastic sleeves on other brands. The 8-ply construction is tough enough to withstand the elements be they hot or cold. I've had this hose for about 8-10 months & it is as good as the day I bought it. So Gilmour is my hose of choice for the future.	1
Heavy duty is correct. No hyperbole here. This is a rugged heavy duty hose that gets the job done with no leaks, no holes, and added durability.	1
Just as all the others say, this unit does the job. My only question is why I waited for so long.	1
done pretty good skipped some corn seed but over all good did the bean seeds good	1
love it i don't need to connect to other water hose.this what i need.good product so far.thank you,sofia	1
Good sturdy quality.	1
Very good planter for the small gardener.  I only have so many bend overs left in my back and this product has sure saved a few.	1
My wife won't stop smiling, this thing allows her to do in ONE minute what used to take 20 minutes of back-aching bent-over work. She loves using it. Excellent quality, versatile, great buy you won't regret.	1
For a serious gardener, this is a great choice.  I bought 2- 75 ft lengths  my hose reel holds 150 feet. The hose is well made and has excellent, water tight couplings with good spring protection for all the abuse and dragging around I will put it through.  It feels durable without being deadly heavy.  I water a green house and large vegetable garden daily and have gone through a lot of hoses over the years.  This hose was advertised as non-kink, but I've already had a couple of episodes when kinks happened.  However, I would describe this hose as very highly kink resistant, quickly unkinks once the hose is adjusted, and much more trouble free to haul around and operate than any other hose I've ever owned.  Careful storage, by winding your hose onto a  good quality hose reel is one of the best ways to prevent kinks and prolong the life of any hose.  This hose has been in use daily since March (located in Central VA)  and has gone through at least two times when night temperatures went down to 26 degrees  just fine.  I'm looking forward to seeing how well this hose will do through from October until mid December with use in grow tunnels.  I think it will work fine, but will report again later.  Highly recommend, especially if you water a lot.	1
Mediocre at best, kinks and the hose has 'memory', bends and tends to stays that way, won't buy again. Should have made a trip to the local hardware store.	-1
Works good and no kinks so far.	1
Great hose and obviously does what it is meant to.  I use it around the hose regularly but this hose kinks a lot which is super annoying because you have to constantly go find the kink.	-1
.if you want to make your own seed plates for a seed that is not included in their sets,e.g, quoina, you'll have to order their BLANK SEED PLATE, part # 18106, from Earthway DIRECT.  You get the blank seed plates from Earthway. BUT THEY DON'T COME WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS. You'll have to contact Customer Service to have them e-mail you the instructions.  I've counseled them to start including the instructions with the plates.	1
Just great!  I had one many years ago and this is even better built.	1
You will never have to buy another hose as long as your wife doesn't run over it with a lawnmower. I bought another one just like it but I also bought a splice kit so I'm still using the fourteen year old hose and waiting with a back up for the next time she mows. It is better than a good product.	1
Great hose, can't say more!	1
Good hose for what it cost. It does leak from the attaching part no matter which faucet we attach it to and even replacing the O-ring did not help. We don't use hoses too often so that is not an issue for us. For a small town home where we just need to hose down a porch or sidewalk once in a while, this hose has been perfectly fine. We store it indoors so it should have a good lifespan.	1
Love and ordering 2 more!	1
Good hose, great warranty. One of the hoses developed bulges. Contacted Gilmour, was told to cut off ends and mail to them. Less than a week, I received a brand new hose. Renewed my faith in warranties	1
Used to plant my garden works wonderful..	1
Exactly what i wanted. well built and good brass connectors, not cheap plastic.	1
nice and flexible	1
Good hose. I have had many Felxogen hoses over the years. BUT, the grey color is better suited for an industrial setting. PLEASE bring back the green garden hose for home use.	1
I plant everything with mine and have so for many years it plants the seeds to close but  everyone I know comes dig plant when they are big enough for their garden the I just clear them out	1
Best garden hose you can buy.  Very flexible yet resists kinking.	1
Works well but still kinks on rare occasions. Good strong end fittings.	1
leaks after less than one year	-1
These guys make a good durable hose.	1
great machine for the money	1
Several reviews on here complain about the light weight construction of this seeder but I have no problems with it.  It is built of light weight aluminum and plastis but I am sure it will last me a lifetime.  If your soil is freshly tilled and raked smooth you will have no problems.  I planted 4 30 foot rows of corn, 2 30 foot rows of carrots, and 1 30 foot row of bush beans in about 15 minutes. I played around with the seed wheels to drop seed where I wanted it.  I put masking tape over some of the holes to space the seeds farther apart.  I am already looking forward to planting next years garden.	1
This is the only Amazon product I bought in 2004. I just now realized that it is eleven years old and it still works fine. Sometimes it kinks, but it has been used thousands of times under high pressure, my house has over 100 psi and couplings used to explode if you had a spray nozzle and didn't run to turn the hose bib off as soon as you were done spraying. Good, expensive hoses too. This one was different and still is.	1
I am completely finished with this company.  let me tell you why.  I bought two new 100' hoses from this manufacturer.  they both went the same way, developing a hissing leak between the brass female end (the end that attaches to the hose bib) and the brass compression fitting that attaches to the hose, in  less than a year.  I ALWAYS leave my hose nozzles open to prevent any bursting, and in any case, you would expect the rubber part of the hose to fail.  When the first one went, Gilmour was good to their warranty and offered to replace it, providing that I cut off both ends of the hose and send them back.  So in order to have a functional hose while I was waiting, I would need to buy not one, but two hose repair ends (male and female), as well as spending the time to buy them and make the repair, as well as the cost of sending them back.  OK, I did it for the first hose (about $12 out of my pocket, plus the time), and they sent me another.  A few months later, the second one developed exactly the same problem at exactly the same spot.  And yes, they will replace it, with the same conditions.  I'd rather be able to buy a hose and have it work.  The warranty doesn't help when I need to use a hose.  Never again with this company.	-1
I have had this hose for 9 years.  It has withstood freezing temperatures, including the coldest winters we've had in 100 years.  It has been stretched, coiled, pulled around corners, stepped on, and generally abused as a garden hose can be.  It hasn't leaked.  It doesn't kink like other hoses I've had, and it outlasted the outdoor faucet it was attached to.  It is so good, I'm buying one for my relatives who just bought a house. Excellent, excellent hose.	1
This is my second hose of this type. While it is flexible and seems hearty, it cracked after two summers here in sunny California..it was close to the neck end. It was not used but maybe twice a week but I guess the hot sun got to it. I like the length and the non tangling aspect of this hose.  Oh and I forgot, it is pretty color...lol!	1
Works great.	1
Works very well.  No real kinks, stands up to abuse and rolls up nicely.	1
I've used these Gilmour shears through two summers with light-moderate use.  They are sturdy, handle easily and are still sharp.  And, no problem with loose blades. I recommend them highly.	1
Simple Hedge trimmer that is easy to use and a great value. I recommend this product as it has served good use at my house!	1
The gilmour hedge shears are comfortable to use due to the nonslip handles, bumpers and the sharpness of the blades. The blades are large and for adult use only.  The quality of the products should last for many seasons of use. One thing missing is a branch notch (used to cut hold)on the blade this would make the product complete. Overall I do recommend this shear to others to buy.  Have fun cutting.	1
So far so good. I didn't thread the connector on properly and it was spraying out like crazy. Once I tightened the connector so that the o-ring is pressed against the tap, voila - excellent! Good, solid hose. I may get another one to add to it, if needed, but this is a good buy. You cannot go wrong with gilmour brand. So far I have had only good experience with these. Knock on wood ;)	1
Hasn't kinked yet and threaded ends are well made.  If you need a shorter length hose; this is a good buy	1
Does the job	1
I bought this for an animal rescue shelter and they absolutely love it!	1
Great product!	1
I'm farming about an acre and a 1/2 and this worked out perfect for the different types of rows I put in.. The only downside is the spacer bar doesn't stay attached to the mounting hook when upright and had to fab up a velcro wrap for it.. but other then that no issues, an awesome tool.	1
Solid construction and comfortable to hold.	1
A good, strudy house that is not easy to kink or crush.	1
It was OK at first, relatively lightweight and OK for handling, but nothing special.  After a few years though the nice shiny green hose turned black with mold.  The outer casing seems to have little tolerance for being outdoors.  D'oh!	-1
I purchased  this 50 foot hose mainly to wash my car (and save myself money on car washes). The hose is well made, came at a good price, and the shipping was very fast. No complaints	1
This hose is a kink monster.  It must have 4 or 5 pressure killing kinks in line right now, the polyurethane seems especially prone to kinking.  Funny, it's connected to my 12-year old Sears Premium black rubber hose that I purchased for half the price and it's holding up without any issues and I've even left it out during winter snows.  I will try to post a picture, but the hose that was shipped to me is not the same hose pictured.  Mine is light green and may be 8-ply, but it's the flimsiest 8-ply I've seen.  I think you can find better hoses for less money, look elsewhere.	-1
Ordered 5 pounds of sunflower seeds.  Do you k now how many sunflower seeds are in a 5-pound bag?  Arghhhhhh!  This seeder made planting 20 rows easy.	1
We have a small market garden. This seeder is our most valued and best tool we use. It has changed the way we garden and we have grown since owning this seeder. Get way more in,, in a small amount of time. Love it!!	1
These work fine on green wood up to 1/2" in diameter, but anything larger needs more leverage.  The lock is easy to use and very accessable, making one hand operations a breeze.  The best thing about these is that  they'll fit in your back pocket and stay locked.  I also have a ratcheting,  anvil style clipper that works much better on slightly larger twigs with  much less effort.	1
Great	1
Not a ton of leverage like others have mentioned, but it does the job for trimming grass and plants. Heavy duty.	1
makes fall cleanup so much easier	1
First one leaked...the replacement one works great. Good heavy spray for cleaning and light spray for watering. Way sturdier than all the other ones we've had that were plastic and broke.	1
Works well. Great for the price.	1
Thanks.........	1
Great hose!	1
The soft grip handle are comfortable in your hands. Very good cutting blades. I will recommend this product to family and friends. The "Gilmour Hedge 8 inch" is light weight making trimming very easy and you spend less time trimming. A very great product.	1
Great clippers for a low cost. I have a small yard and these clippers make it simple to keep up on yard work!	1
WORKED  WELL  FOR  A  SHORT  TIME	1
Good quality - teamed it up with the Conti rubber hose.	1
There is no nozzle that I have not bought. And I truly mean none. We have extremely low water pressure probably because our house is like 100 years old and the pipes are old. Anyway found this nozzle and hey I never tried this one. It is by far the best one yet. It has increased my water pressure and is easy for me to turn right and left because I am always changing the speed of my nozzles. I just hope these ones don't break in under a year like every single other one that I purchased here on Amazon. These appear to be very good quality but like I said if they last longer then a year I will be pleasantly surprised to find a well made product.	1
I have a very high pressure on my outside hydrant, so high that all other hoses I have used have eventually ruptured under use.  Heat also contributed in that they ruptured during the summer while laying in the sun.  I have purchased two of these, the first in July 2012 and the second a year later.  So far there has been absolutely no problem with either hose.	1
This hose so far works great.  It does kink a little bit, but only if you are pulling it at an angle.  The hose also coils up really nice and doesn't kink while it coils.  I'll order another one for the front yard.	1
It Is a great product . I bought 2 and I will buy it again.	1
ok	1
It's not often that something so simple can be so impressive.  After years and years of so-so nozzles I could almost hear music in the background when I first used this nozzle.  It turns on and off with precision.  When it's off there is no dripping and when it's on the spray pattern is consistent and repeatable.  I have ordered a couple more to replace my other nozzles.	1
Nice nozzle...Best I've used of this type...DD	1
Works well, no problems, works as advertised with no real negative.  I like the coating on it, compared with the cheaper version- helps make it easier to turn + less hot if in sun.	1
Durable,  easy to work with and sharp enough to attend to some shrubs that appeared to be neglected for years.  The shrubs have met their match. Do recommend	1
Love these!  They are lightweight, and maintain an edge reasonably well.  The 5 stars are given for the lightweightedness and price per quality.  Naturally, there are better Hedge shears out there, but you pay much much more money.  These are good for the homeowner, but I wouldn't recommend them for a landscaping business..	1
Not recommended	-1
item sent to someone else	1
2015 - Great price & great quality.  Works for me.  2018 - Ok... updating my review.  Awesome product.  Purchase a 100 ft hose with a lot of use and still going strong.  I now need to replace a 15 year hose and will buy this same product again.	1
works great so far	1
I would highly recommend this nozzle. It is sturdy and rust proof, and the water stream works great for washing cars. Very high quality.	1
Great price. Love the rubber bumper stops when closing. Very comfortable handles. Light weight.	1
Great tool, wouldn't garden without it. I've been using one of these for about 7-8 years and it makes gardening easy. I have a large garden and raise a lot of sweet corn. It's especially good with corn and beans. I have two different size corn plates, one plants close and the other plants farther apart. The one plate takes garger grain than the other. The larger grain using the smaller plate is the reason why seed gets stuck in the holes and pops out or jams the seeder. It's also great for beans. I used it for the first time this year for cucumbers and it plants them very or too close but all you have to do is walk through and thin them out. It's kinda hard to use in sod ground because the shoe keeps picking up the sod. Ground needs to be well tilled. I love mine ,in fact I have two of them.  I don't care for the marker that comes with it , I like to string off my rows and make them a little wider and straighter. Alan Bane	1
I have a 10 row, 100' long garden and needed a better way to plant seeds.  What I found is that the seeds are not dropped uniformly and tend to pop out of the bin like a pop corn machine.  I put plastic over the bin to hold them in but then you can't see if the seeds are being picked up by the plate.  I have tried it for two years and I'll have three seeds drop in one place and then none for eight feet or so.  The plate becomes loose and seeds get lodged behind the plate.  Your soil has to be perfectly tilled with no lumps, debris or rocks.  In a perfect world it might work, but I don't live in a perfect world. If you get this device you'd better have a lot of patience and determination to make it work properly.  Mine is for sale on Craig's list if you still want to buy one.	-1
This nozzle works great.  It can range from no water, to a wide fine mist to a tight stream and back easily.  I purchased it for cleaning my cartridge filers for my pool.  I needed something that provided a tight hard water stream.  This suits that purpose nicely.	1
This nozzle is very good. No leaking and it adjusts easily. It is constructed of two solid pieces of brass. The outer piece screws over the inner piece to adjust the spray. The black material over the brass is to enhance gripping the nozzle. It is much better than plastic nozzles and I like it better than other brass nozzles I have owned.	1
Good nozzle. Has a uniformly round spray pattern and shuts of completely.	1
High quality nozzle. Works perfect with no leaks.	1
Love this - not too large or heavy in the hand. Will buy again	1
I pick this particular blade because it was the cheapest option with highest rating/reviews. So far, I concur.	1
Excellent product!  Cuts well.  Bought it for overgrown rose bushes.	1
Wonderful hose bought many of these.	1
heavy and well made hose love it	1
Great hose bought 5.  Home Depot is suppose to have them in stores cheaper.	1
This may be the best garden hose made. If not it is very close.	1
This is well made but not very flexible, so it's difficult to keep it pointed in the direction you want.	-1
4 stars because this hose is really heavy.  Wish I had got the light weight one.	1
comfortable to use and turns off completely.	1
It's a generic hose nozzle.  Gets the job done.  The rubber coating is nice.	1
Easy to use. Doest leak. Jet stream is solid. The cone spray is great for the car.	1
Well made. The rubberized feature makes for comfortable handling without usage. Can close a door/lid on it (I use it for a fish well in my boat) without damaging a surface/edge. Would buy again.  ps. Been through a million plastic nozzles...no more.	1
You cannot beat this nozzle for quality or price, works great for hosing off the porch or sidewalk....or just watering flowers. Very Happy!!	1
Perfect size and they work great.	1
A well made hose as the price would indicate.  I have it placed under mulch and time will tell how long it lasts in that application.	1
Kinks and is heavy	-1
It's a long hose. It transports water from the spigot to the place you want it to go. Isn't effective for whipping people or otherwise. Too heavy to swing it that way. Will kink but not often. No holes found in it except for the ones on either end. Water arrives at desired location as expected.	1
If it breaks I'll buy it again. And again. Does all smaller hedge jobs without hesitation. Blades stay sharp and cut clean. May not be good for anything more substantial like old vine. Great for boxwood, raspberries, blackberries, junipers, arborvitae, probably all other softer bushes.	1
Built well, looks good, not precision enough, good value	1
Purchased this back in 2014 and I have had two issues with it. First of all, it recently broke where the female coupling that attaches to the hose attaches to the nozzle body, for some reason it just separated. There are some threads on the piece right there where it somehow joins the two parts together and they just came apart. Impossible to put this back together correctly so it is junk at this point. Secondly, the spray pattern is weird when you turn it on. Rather than going from a nice spray to a more forceful one, it first goes into a pinpoint, hard spray pattern first, then to a nice open spray, and then to the full spray. I've never had a nozzle that did that and I really never liked that. Giving it one start since it lasted all of 2 years. Not sure what their warranty is but I am checking that out now.	-1
The durable solid brass construction speaks for itself. Forget silly plastic nozzles with no pressure and parts that can break. More than worth the price.	1
Well made!  Just like the nozzle's Dad had when I was a kid.  Took a few minutes to figure out how to get distance, but wow, I could stand on my porch and water most of the yard!  Great for washing the car too, will get the grime out of the tightest crevice.	1
I like it for the most part.  The only down-side is you have to turn the nozzle through every adjustment to shut it off.  In other words, there is no immediate way to turn it off until you go through numerous streams depending on where you were.	1
These are very good cutters	1
We are clipping away with our Gilmour Hedge Clipper.	1
This is the second Earthway seeder that I have owned and it IS my experience that it is one of the best on the market.  I will concede that the seeder is very light and made of aluminum and plastic, but do you really want a portable seeder that is heavy and cumbersome to balance?  If that is what you want, then buy a pull behind planter and use a tractor to pull it.  This seeder is very well balanced and believe it or not--well made.  I use it mostly for sweet corn and bush beans.  I've tried it for spinach, cucumber, and squash and really didn't like the results, but since they are hilled beds and easy to plant by hand it really wasn't a deal breaker.  Really, I bought this primarily for planting green beans and sweet corn, because I'd rather take a bullet to the head than bend over to plant long rows of said seeds.  One other thing:  Make sure that your garden is well-tilled before using the seeder.  It will not plant through hard pan.  Happy planting!  Update 5-16-13:  This year I decided to plant peas.  They sowed as easily as corn and beans.  But, my garden was very well-tilled with a Troybuilt Horse before planting.  The finer your soil is the better this seeder works.  The drag chain will actually work to cover your seeds if the garden is very finely tilled.	1
Not as good as the hose they sold 7 or 8 years ago, but it does stay flexible more than other hoses I've owned, except the Gilmour hose I purchased about 7 or 8 years ago, which is still holding up as strong and flexible as ever!	1

Strong!	1
My parents had the same hedge cutters for years.....made in America......I have been through,  I don't know how many makes and models of hedge trimmers during just the past fifteen years.  THIS cutter puts them all to shame!  I cannot only see the blades cutting, but also HEAR steel against steel.  Very comfortable to use.....just the right handle length.  Forget about those extendable-handle units...all for show.  This trimmer delivers.  Would highly recommend.	1
These small hedge clippers worked well for trimming the shrubs in my yard. They are comfortable in my hands, and lightweight enough that they did not make my arms and back ache when using them.  I do have one complaint, though: they come with a heavy plastic piece that is used to fasten onto the clippers the cardboard product label (see photo). I had to use a saw to get it off. Scissors did not work because it was really thick, heavy plastic. It was a real hassle.	1
great	1
Thanks	1
Simple and effective.  Much nicer than modern cheap pistol grips.  High quality solid brass.	1
Best nozzle ever!!  Don't hesitate.	1
Worked great for one season. After attempting to cut a thicker branch the shears bent out instead of cutting through the wood. they were nice band new. After some wear they stop cutting and began to tear through.	-1
great	1

Nice quality hose	1
This is a good quality machine, but it does take some time to get used to using it.  My garden soils are quite heavy, clayish, and it does not work very well in that type of soil.  The sandy or loam soils work much better.  It is just going to take some time to get the hang of it.  It does a nice job, fast, accurate in the lighter soils.	1
They have not failed us a single time and being disabled, I toss them down onto concrete daily as I am unable to bend to place them back onto the ground gently.  Never any leak, never any problem. Just ordered our third so now EVERY hose we have, has its own nozzle and no more hassle to switch when I change hoses. LOVE these. I can gently spray a fine mist onto my wife's delicate plants, or knock a squirrel off the top of our fence when it is eyeballing the wife's garden:-)    I can honestly use this for ANY application and again, have had zero problems.....	1
Easy to shut off with rubber and rubber cushions it when dropped.  I like this unit as it has a nice powerful stream.	1
Super...cuts like butter...highly recomment	1
I did note in the reviews the problems with it rusting, mine did as well after just one use.  I used a wire brush to brush it off then put a protective coat of oil on it.  While that is a major drawback, I can't complain about anything else.  The price was good, and the craftsmanship is very good.  They're sturdy and work fantastically well on the honeysuckle hedge I'm taking down.  I just wish the metal was of higher quality.	1
Good product for the price.	1
Nice sharp blades that does the job	1
Worked well, no issues.	1
Work well.	1
After going through several plastic nozzles, I decided to buy one of the older style brass ones. This one has performed well since I purchased it 10 months ago in Feb 2012. I like the rubber coating on the exterior for grip and paint protection. It gives a fairly even spray at all settings and is easy to adjust on the fly.	1
As others have noted, it leaks (actually sprays!) where the pieces are press fit together.  Really wanted to like this as the rubber coating keeps it from damaging the hose pot we keep it in.  Just ordered the Dramm nozzle for about the same price.	-1
This is the second nozzel of this type I've purchased. The best water nozzel I have ever used. You will be impressed by it's performance. My first one is 4 years old and performs just as good as the new one.	1
Does not last.	-1
Works well, does not kink partly because of heavy wall, so you don't really want a long one of these, would weigh a ton.	1
Sorry I bought this.  Can't really adjust to my liking.  Should have returned this.	-1
I really rate this product a Zero. Here's why:  It Broke as a result of a poor mfg. technique. Well, 'It Leaks' (...is technically more accurate but what's the difference?)...where the shaft of the inner core mates with the larger ruberized part that screws onto the hose. They are two separate parts apparently press-fit together! And when presurized it leaks alot...not just drip, 2 seconds, drip..it has become a small trickle. Worse, the core (and ruberized adjusting jacket) now spin at the faulty juncture effectively preventing the adjustability of the spray. To try and make this clearer, I can no longer grasp the long ruberized jacket and twist to adjust the spray, because it spins at the faulty juncture. So yeah, It Broke. Haven't even had it 4 months.  PLEASE do Not buy this product. I am still looking for the perfect..Inexpensive, nozzle. When I find it, I'll post it her, (see UPDATE below). I actually have found 'a' perfect nozzle at Griots Garage but it isn't inexpensive.  [** UPDATE May have found a better nozzle, and it costs $10 just like this Gilmour. Look up the Dramm brass hose nozzle: Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle;&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dramm-12380-Heavy-Duty-Brass-Adjustable-Hose-Nozzle/dp/B001DGII5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle</a>. This heavy brass nozzle has no press fittings to fail. Instead of two pieces press fit together as described above, Dramm has machined the inner core and the part that screws onto the hose out of one solid piece of brass. It'll still crack if you leave it outside and presurized during a freeze, but at least it won't break as a result of a poor manufacturing technique.**]	-1
Love this nozzle. It's very high quality and delivers the amount of water you need with a simple twist. We're gradually tossing all our poor quality nozzles and hose connectors with quality items that we aren't cursing every time we turn the water on.	1
was pleased	1
We've used these to trim hedges this fall; will update the review next year if they're wearing badly, but so far, so good. We got what we paid for, and are happy with them.	1
Excellent	1
Useless! not sharp enough to cut branches, totally overpriced!!!	-1
Does the job I bought it to do. Well made. No problems.	1
Not too heavy but sharp and easy to work with.	1
Nice heavy duty hose.	1
Good hose- Good price	1
good price	1
Excellent hose overall.  The 100 ft. length kept me from having to buy short ones and couple them together. Pros: Good price, great quality.  Brass fittings are substantially machined and not just cheap formed brass sheet. Cons:  Very few.  It tends to flatten out when wound on a garden hose reel. No stripe to tell when it is twisting. Recommendation: Flexibility and resistance to crushing on a hose reel tend to be contrary qualities.  I down-rated it one star for the flattening issue when used on a hose reel.  I recommend that during the summer season, leaving the pressure on the hose while winding on the reel, and then turning water off and releasing the pressure.  it will keep it loose and prevent crushing.	1
cuts stuff good	1
Excellent for the price!	1
Just the right size and shape for me and my two small hedges.	1
basic hedge clippers says it all. cuts up to 1/4 inch, but that's pushing it, better to use small pruner at that point. nice and sharp, easy to use	1
$13 and a lifetime warranty for this strong and sharp product.  Very nice	1
Nice and sharp and easy to handle.	1
They are not as sharp as I would like. I will have to sharpen them. Disappointed for the price!	-1
Comfortable, sharp shears.  I've used these for my rose bushes and fruit trees without breaking a sweat.	1
I love the seeder. Makes planting so easy. Mark out the first row and go. No bending or stooping anymore. Garden is coming up real nice!	1
I've used one of these since the 1970's, when I borrowed it from my friend and neighbor.  I bought one of my own last year.  They haven't really changed the design much at all. It is a fantastic seeder for the money. You'll love it.  For those who worry over the light weight: You'll learn to appreciate how light and strong it really is.  You can pick the whole thing up and pour out the extra seeds back into the seed pack easily. If seeds get behind the plate, you might want to check and make sure you have the plate on right! I pour some baby talc in with my seeds, and I never have much trouble. If you need to get the last seed planted, just lean the planter over to the side some, and the seeds - every one - can get caught by the plate and planted.  If you have cover crop trash to plough through, here's what I do.  This will kill your warranty, and I don't recommend you do this unless you're handy with tools.... Open one chain link where it attaches to the frame, so it makes a hook.  Then, in trashy soil, you can just unhook the drag chain and let it go. Set the seeder a little deeper, and you're good to plant. With the drag chain in place like they've designed it, the drag chain will gather trash and make a problem if you don't have nicely tilled seed beds. Being able to unhook the drag chain and let it loose is the answer. I don't know why the company doesn't do this, but they didn't call me and ask for advise. It works for me, though.  A $500 seeder will save a little more seed. I'd rather have plants to thin out than bare spots to try to reseed and play catch-up.  You can't beat this little rig for the money.	1
Very nice sturdy and flexible hose.	1
Very nice hose !!!  Very flexible !!	1
Solid hose with good/solid brass fittings.	1
Works well	1
Received good quality clippers at great price!	1
Works great on small branches and hedges.	1
I am relatively new to outdoor work, recently divorced and a 57 year old woman. I have always done the inside cleaning, NOT the outdoor work that always seemed so terrible. So, here I am, on my own, and I am definitely doing a lot of research before I buy an item. These hedgers are very sharp, so working with them is easy. Believe me I am not strong, so the length and sharpness of the blade is very important to me.  I am in Alabama and the heat has been very bad lately, but my work goes quickly because of the ease of the use of these hedge cutters. I had been using a pair I borrowed from a friend, they looked all shiny and new, but I could hardly cut through small branches, so I knew those were not for me.  I would definitely recommend these to everyone!	1
Nice.  They seem to keep their sharpness, easy to fit in my hands.  The little button that holds it open or closed is sort of small, but I won't ding them for that.	1
Fiskars brand is always a good quality.  This product arrived in secure packaging and I am very happy with the weight and size of the product.  Can't wait to try them out.	1
The coating seems to come off fairly easily.	-1
Love them. Just right for my vegetable garden and flowers.  Ninnies who want to cut down trees -- DON'T -- not made for that.  Whining about rust? See photo. Clean them and lubricate them. See "2000 Uses For WD-40."  Dull blades? Hard to believe, but some folks know how to SHARPEN them!  Good luck. Lovely tool. And God Bless You.	1
These shears are great so far, but I've only used them a couple times this spring. They are incredibly capable of trimming even thicker (~1/4 inch) green branches on the larger shrubs which I thought they might choke on a bit. The grips are comfortable and the length of the blades allows you to shear large swaths of whatever it is that you are trimming. The hole on the end of the blade is a mystery to me; when this item arrived there was a tag secured using that hole, but surely it's not there just for that reason? If it has any real purpose I'd love to know, but it certainly has not hindered its functionality either.	1
Time will tell, but it looks like an awesome hose.  The end where you hook up the sprayer was bent, but maybe it was just from where it was wound.  It has a lifetime guarantee and that is good enough for me.  I also bought A Gilmore Spray Nozzle.  Update 6/25/15  Does leak all over the place, it could be the end from where you put the sprayer on, but not what I expected.  It is also very heavy.  You need a special long nozzle to prevent your wrists from giving out or creating carpel tunnel.  I wish I had of gotten something else now.  I never did like the idea that the end was bent a little.  It is still awfully heavy.  Don't like it.	-1
Good quality hose. should last a long time.	1
Great hose. Beats anything I've bought before.	1
Well made comfortable to use and work great.	1
Super sharp.  Don't know why they put a hole in one of the blades just to package it - but that doesn't affect the cutting ability. I use them for light duty work and I'm very happy.	1
Great hose, just buy those little add on red rubber washers in the buy these together section. They made a bad choice with a small oval washer is all.	1
Long lasting, reliable.  Gilmour is a good brand.	1
Very strong hose.  Packaging says it's all recycled material.  Would be nice if it came in different colors! ---	1
Fast Shipping. Great Product	1
I will never buy another hose.  This one is amazing.  I can;t express how much I love this hose compared to the others I have owned.  It has not kinked on me ONCE.	1
Excellent	1
HOLDING UP GOOD!!	1
Wonderful	1
Blades bit into each other on the first snip. Has done it numerous times and had to file out tge gouges. Blades also separate easily leaving tge branch stuck between the two. Managed to get 4 fruit trees and 5 berry vines pruned and they are junk.	-1
Christmas gift	1
Initially, these clippers look and feel sturdy.  But within an hour of clipping long grass around my yard the bolt came loose and blades became dull and could only bend the grass.	-1
Good Basic hedge shears for everyday use.  Sharp blades.  Eight inch blade is just the right size for about all your pruning projects.  I use it to shape my hedges and shrubs.  More precise that electric hedge clippers.  These shears are not intended to be used on branches.  Make sure you wipe the blades clean after each use and they will last a very long time.	1
This was ordered in hopes of finally seeing some warmer weather, so it is still rolled up.  My last hose sprung a leak where it kept twisting into a pinch..  I believe this one will work out fine.	1
Very disappointed with this hose. Kinks very easily not of the best value	-1
Works well for me. Needed to trim the Rosemary Bush. Thanks.	1
These shears are very light and sturdy and they cut well.  Considering they are one of the cheaper choices out there, they are really a great deal.  The little hole near the point for hanging on a hook is a nice design afterthought.	1
A good product but not for heavy "stuff", small hedges calls for these trimmers.	1
Bought in March, used for spring clean up, worked well, now is July, I took Them out to trim bushes and they don't cut any longer... Garbage ! Useless in long run, now I have to buy another pair...	-1
Easy to use gripper handles -- EXTREMELY durable blades! GREAT price on a top quality product!!!	1
Sturdy.	1
Very happy and is great as an add on to my 100' hose.	1
This is a really nice hose. Heavy to drag around, but I expect it will last a very long time.	1
Great hose.	1
A very solid hose overall. The 500PSI limit and all weather rating has me hopeful that occasional freezing weather will not rupture this thing as it has other cheaper hoses in the past. Come spring I'll update this review with how it performs.	1
I am a senior citizen and use these clippers to cut back tall, thick decorative/fountain grasses. These plants are too thick to use electric trimmers; however, when I cut about an inch width at a time, I am able to do a nice job with these clippers.	1
Works perfectly and looks great!	1
Amazing tool. top quality!	1
Have remained very sharp and no signs of rust even after trimming right after a heavy rain.  Grips are comfortable, and cutting action is easy and smooth.  Will cut branches up to about a half inch with ease, but after that point you may want to look for a tool with more power.	1
Good quality but the price is too high. updated: AFTER ONE USED THE BLADE(BOTH OF THEM) ARE RUSTED. ITS NO A GOOD QUALITY AS I THOUGHT. ITS A POOR QUALITY. MADE IN CHINA.	-1
I have no clue what the blades are "coated" with, but it won't keep them from rusting. The blades are very sharp and the tool works as expected. Keep the blades oiled and the tool will last a long time. Leave it as you got it, and kiss it goodbye in a few months.	1
Very affordable and really works for the weekend gardner.	1
So far they are fine. Time will tell.	1
great hose - strong but pliable - doesn't kink	1
super strong, premium hose.  is very heavy, but that's to be expected.	1
doesn't kink,thats all that's good about it.  the fitting leaked first time I used it. its so stiff,it won't rap up neatly. if you leave it stretched out,good hose.  a little disappointed.  price was right.	-1
Bought this for one purpose only. Use it only with my "Dirt Devil ND40015 Pressure Flex 2,000 Plus 1.6 GPM Electric Pressure Washer". Mines in fantastic shape yet.	1
work well and stable	1
Amazing for gardener's	1
Perfect. light weight. does the job. Love the price.	1
Seems to hold up a lot better than other hoses.	1
Best hose I've ever owned. DOES NOT KINK. Not too heavy. Love it.	1
works like a charm! It's pretty durable	1
Use to trim sidewalk weeds. Excellent.	1
In conjunction with a lopper I'm cutting everything in sight down	1
Exceptional steel quality for the price.	1
Fiskars, THE cutting tool for distinguished tree cutters	1
very good	1
Great snips work well easy to cut branches etc.	1
Works great already trimmed the roses!!	1
Quite a few things wrong with this unit, so here's a list...  Soil needs to be perfectly smooth - Rocks, weeds, compost will all collect in front of the seed chute and stop it dead. It's not enough to disc your plot.  You need screened topsoil... or sand.  Does not cover seeds - the chain device is useless.  You have to go back over each row or the birds will get your seed.  You have to push down HARD to make the front wheel roll, and it still slips - It really should be made with a big heavy front wheel for momentum.  Think of a bicycle wheel.  Seeds pop out of the hopper - The motion of the disk in the hopper makes seeds pop out of the top.  When this happens, the hopper looks like a pop corn popper.  It's so ridiculous that I was SURE I lost the hopper cover somewhere.  Surely they would have thought of a hopper cover, right?  They didn't.  No cover.  The row marker is useless. Trying to use it just adds more drag to your already difficult forward momentum.  Forget this feature.  Sometimes it gets the spacing right, sometimes it doesn't get any seeds, sometimes it gets 3.  The only way I can see this working is in a DEEP, well defined furrow and then cover over it manually.  That will reduce this thing to just dropping seeds and poorly spaced at that, which I'm sure I can match with a little aim.	-1
Being a miserable , hardnosed mechanic type , i can say too ; you will like it !!   NOW 2 small problems need be noted . first ; the soil has to be garden quality . it won't work in trash and clumps well (no planter can). good soil prep , near effortless planting.   second ; for some reason certain types of PEAS have nasty tendency to grab, roll and POP out of planter . i polished the hopper surface and walk slower to good results.   As for PLACING seeds , it works excellent !! depth easy to adjust , mechanism smooth , marker works , lite weight and strong enough .  there are other planters bragging "ALL STEEL" .... now carry it back and forth thru a large garden and brag about your "ALL STEEL" ; no thanx .   2 seazuns now and i am thinking of purchasing a SECOND unit and mounting both on toolbar behind my cub cadet ....   OK , other seeds planted ; turnips , lettuce , beans , beets and all planted well . the "Bayou Gardener" has other tips on youtube very helpful.   planter does over-plant, HOWEVER , it is GOOD as birds and germination problems are overcome .   visibility of planter workings is FANTASTIC . you can watch each and every seed ; no guessing .   well worth them $$ ;  "buy it , you'll like it !!"	1
pretty cool, this hose came with an extra outlet, a hole about half way in the hose... so back it went, junk.	-1
Very Good.	1
I use these almost daily.  They are sharp and cut cleanly.	1
Not heavy but substantial enough for pruning shrubs and small tree limbs.	1
well made, keep indoors so they don't rust, work great	1
I have been using this for general pruning and am completely satisfied. It will cut bunches of twigs with one or two snips and seems like it is made to last.	1
Really nice heavy duty hose, this hose will last years and years even in the Arizona sun and heat. I would have giving a 5 star on this hose, but I was spoiled after using those flex hoses, pocket hoses etc. but those hoses are worthless and do not recommend these types of hoses to anybody. I am hoping Gilmour will perfect that type of hose and make a light weight flex hose that will last, I know Gilmour could do this and this company or any other company that could perfect that design would make these types of hoses obsolete. Don't get me wrong here this hose is great it is heavy duty, strong, sturdy, tough and will take abuse without failing, it is heavy tho. Again this is a great hose and would recommend highly, ***** five stars.	1
These seem to be good hoses....heavy as heck.  LOL	1
Have had this hose for over a year. It has been outside the whole time and shows little fading. No kinks and no problems.	1
Very, very disappointed.  Kinks like crazy.  Not worth the money.	-1
Yikes! These are just awful. How in the world can you design cutters like this, that work so poorly? The handles flex so much when cutting that you end up bumping your fingers/hands together with each stroke. They cut okay, on thin branches, but unless you have tiny, thin fingers, and only do very light garden trimming, I would not recommend these. Perfect example of "you get what you pay for...".	-1
Hose did not last past 4 uses!  I used it with a regular hand held nozzle and the hose quickly developed an aneurysm! Too bad because I really  liked the softness and feel of the hose and it worked great in the Suncast Aquawinder I bought.	-1
I was so happy to see a metal body sprayer as I was sure this would last.  Two weeks use and it was spraying out all around the green dial.  Wow, that is worse than any sprayers I have bought before.  I got mine at Lowe's and will return it but I am very disappointed.  Update: I contacted Gilmour via email.  They said I could return it at my expense, and told me a $5 fee for warranty replacement may apply. It would cost as much to get a WARRANTY replacement as it would to buy a new sprayer.  Even then according to the reviews here the sprayer would still be a waste of money.  I will still return to Lowe's but was hoping they would have an explanation of why it failed.  So, Gilmour -- warranty worthless, product worthless.	-1
The nozzle leaks like crazy.  I want to use the mist feature to water my new seedlings and ended up buying a watering can from Home depot.	-1
Not the best purchase.	-1
This is a very difficult product to manage in the yard without tearing it up when walking around with it to water. I returned it and bought the coiled hose and a skinnier hose.	-1
I really researched this product before I bought it unfortunately I am disappointed It kinks every time I use it. Thankfully my 3 year loves to get the kinks out as I'm watering the bushes	-1
When I use a garden hose, one thing bothers most is hose kinking. This one is no exception, it kinks. I found another brand "Water Right" which is  very light weight and made of high quality material. The best part is it doesn't kinks!	-1
This hose was a real disappointment.  It's described as flexible; it's about as flexible as a lead pipe.  No way can I curl it up or, for that matter, really uncurl it.  Beware!	-1
Never could get this thing to "travel." And the huge distance that it throws the water (no matter how much you futz with adjusting the arms) makes it useless if you're trying to water a limited area.	-1
How can these be a number 1 Best Seller? I am extremely disappointed in this item. Since they are a Fiskars product sold by Fiskars I am also very disappointed in the company. I was using them for the first time and found that I couldn't cut a branch of 1/4" without the cutters getting hung up. I even had a few such incidents cutting a 1/8" twig. The cutting blade would bypass the branch being cut and leave a gap on the tool that you could see through. OK what should I have expected for $10.00? I was hoping for something that would last, at least, for the rest of this year and it's now September 25th. No such luck. I'll be replacing them tomorrow.	-1
Didn't work and I sent it back. Arms wouldn't rotate and wheels wouldn't move. It was certainly heavy enough that it gave the initial impression that it would be a good little workhorse. But unless there is something really tricky in getting it going (yes, I found the button on the bottom) there was nothing I could do to make any of it work. Just sat their and directed water to one spot.	-1
I took my time. I have all of the necessary tools. I think the expansion slot was too big. I drilled the hole for the rivet pin . During the process of setting the pin the handle cracked and then broke the first time I tried to use it . A total loss of $ 17.19 and my time.	-1
I own two and neither is satisfactory. Both have a design flaw that all of these have. Nelson uses plastic gears for the propulsion and are prone to wearing out very quickly and are inherently weak and not able to pull much hose. Really no more than 20 feet without starting to strip, which causes the unit to stop moving forward. Nelson will gladly sell you new gears every couple of years for $35 and basically that's how they make their money. The first person who builds a replacement motor gear made of metal will crush Nelson. Paying attention competitors?	-1
Grips came loose first time I used them. Cuts well so far . Guess I'll gorilla glue the rubber grips.	-1
This hose is supposed to be flexible.  Its hard, heavy and unwieldy.  I don't know if it kinks or not, because I could tell, as soon as I removed it from the box, that I would have to return it.  If you want a lightweight, soft hose (and I know they exist because I have one), do not buy this thing.	-1
UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no "waves" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.  The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.  When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.  Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.  The Amazon description calls this a "lightweight" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).  This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)  I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a "no-kink" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.	-1
This is one where I should have listened to the other reviewers.  I liked the idea of a premium hose made in the USA.  Unfortunately, after sitting out less than a month it started developing bubbles with pinhole leaks.  Due to the nature of the material, you can not just tape them up as with a rubber hose.  The black rubber Craftsman this replaced lasted me a good 10 years.  I should have sent this one back.	-1
Well,it was nice while it lasted, but this turned out to be a pretty cheap hose also.  As soon as the weather here in South Florida started the warm days/cool nights, this Gilmour started getting kinks all over.  I am not sure there really is a hose that won't kink; this one sure does.	-1
The hose is good when using in warm weather. However, when outside temperature drops to the low 50s and below, the hose is very stiff and hard to roll up or untangle. That's the only gripe I have.	-1
After a few weeks of household use, the outer layer looks like a python that's eaten several chickens. Now it's leaking! Past return to Amazon so back to Gilmour it goes. I need the hose to water my plants so I need to buy another and when this one is replaced I guess I'll put it on Craiglist for whatever I can get. Don't waste you time and money.	-1
Have another new one of these and one about 10 years old, they work better than this one, neither one of them turns themselves off, repeatedly, in the middle of watering. I complained to the seller, who referred me to Amazon, who, unlike their usual great customer service, disappointed us when they failed to respond. Husband thinks there is a defect in the shut off switch & it constantly cuts off as it rolls along it's path down the hose. I think we got a bad apple, we love the other 2 that we have.	-1
It does NOT spray water far enough or wide enough, very disappointed. Also it's too pricey.	-1
I bought the Gilmour last year. Used it once. Went to use it this morning and found a third of the lettering and indicators gone. All the sprayer has been used for is 1 dose of Malathion. Stored on a shelf in the garage.  Unless you have the ability to memorize all the markings and directions on the bottle, take a pass.	-1
First one was defective and the second one isn't much better. It leaks really bad and seems to stop up often.	-1
eeh.	-1
Doesn't mix well, I used it with soap to wash car but did not like it	-1
If you want a good hose, made in the usa, and very tough, get this one: Made in Oregon (waterrightinc dot com) best hose I have ever used. Small diameter but it still seems to flow very well.	-1
Cheaply made....junk. Spring let go after first cut. I had to open them up and repair them, and don't have time to do this every time I use them, which appears will be the case. I will use them til I tire of fixing them, and they will be tossed in the dumpster. What a waste of material. Not happy. Definitely would not recommend.	-1
This is the worst hose I have ever had.  It continually kinks. I will get a kink and I walk back and get the kink out.  I'll move to another area a few feet away to water  and it kinks again in another spot on the hose.  I have noticed that where it kinks, the hose is now showing abrasions.  It will  only be a matter of time that it will start to leak.  The hose isn't even a year old.  There is a life time warranty saying the manufacturer will replace the hose free of charge.  I do not know why I would want another one just like this one.  I would rather spend the extra money and get another hose that does not kink, if they even exist.	-1
I purchased (4) 50' sections of this hose last year based on it's ratings. My experience with it is that it is by no means kink free. Although better than the "contractor grade" rubber hoses previously purchased, kinking is a serious issue with this alleged kink-free product. Meanwhile, Craftsman hoses purchased over 35 years ago as are Swan hoses purchased at BJ's about 15 years ago are far superior and still in use. Without water pressure in the hose it will kink at every loop. With water pressure it fares better, but it doesn't match my 35 year old Craftsman hose.	-1
You can't set it down without it leaking your herbicide all over itself. It turns and twists so you can't really control it as much as you'd like. It doesn't really disperse well, it sprays water to the sides and the middle of the spray seems to contain most of the herbicide, so it doesn't really mix it into the stream well. Pain in the butt to get the hose off and on, it should contain a swivel at the base of the connection.	-1
The hose appears to be strong but will it stand the test of time.  Not sure how it handles hot water from lying in the sun - but I will soon find out  since I live in the south and the sun bakes these hoses until they melt.  With or without water in the hose I have not found one that will take the heat of the sun for over just a few years.  It is too soon to say - but this hose appears to be well made.  I am amending the above review.  The hose broke and the company does not honor the lifetime warranty.  It lasted less than a year.  The end swelled up and leaked a steady stream only to get worse every day.  The company appears to be in some sort of transition or something since they do not answer to anyone that I can tell.  I think Amazon should remove this product since the warranty claim is outrageous and they have no intentions of honoring any claims.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.	-1
Used them once and the lower handle cover kept slipping off.  Tried to glue it back on but with no success.  Useless junk so I just threw them away.	-1
These pruning shears are supposed to be one of the top five rated models out on the market. I purchased a pair after a smaller pair was lost. I purchased from a big box store about a year ago. At first they seemed to work fine and cut well. I have many trees of various types on my property that I must keep pruned to avoid being raked while cutting the lawn. I have oaks, maples, ornamental pears, and white pines. We also prune various shrubs on the property. This spring is the second season we have pruned with these shears and the first one with heavy use. I had trouble with the branches twisting and getting jammed between the blade and anvil. A majority of the cuts were fine, but eventually I noticed the cuts became more of a tear as opposed to a clean cut as expected. This makes it harder to do the job as it requires me to wrestle with the tool to complete the cut. Eventually the handle covers came off. On examination of the shears I noticed that the edge of the blade was chipped and curled over making it dull.	-1
The cheap plastic gears in this break almost every time the sprinkler goes off the hose track and ends up grinding itself up against an object until it breaks the gears. Nelson is very unhelpful in fixing it or telling you how to, and they obviously make a lot of of after sales money selling very expensive motor/gears kits to people who are dumb enough to invest more money into this cheaply made sprinkler	-1
I am only giving this hose two stars because it is HEAVY and simply not easy to use.  Not only that but getting it stretched out to its full length is difficult due to its weight and the tightness of the coil that it was in in its packaging.  I do believe that the hose will last me a long time and maybe the fact that it is so heavy proves it is well-made, but, if you are a woman without much upperbody strength and you do not want to struggle to move a hose from place to place in your lawn or garden, then, this is not the hose for you.	-1
Well I waited to use this hose til the summer, and shame on me as the return window closed April 4th the brass fitting, where the threaded end of the hose attaches to the rubber sprays water like a fountain, poorly made, poorly fitted piece of expensive JUNK!!! Shame on you Amazon- re-thinking my Prime membership over this one,I bought two, both leak and it's a pressure fitting so there is no repair POS!!!!!!	-1
In my opinion, this product is way overpriced. There are other sprayers in the market costing a small fraction of the price of this one. I bought Ortho 0841010 Dial N Spray Multi-Use Hose-End Sprayer for $11 and have used it about a dozen times already with a great performance and no sign of deterioration.	-1
Purchased in July 2013. Worked OK for a while when used five times a year. It reaches 15-20 ft. It started leaking between the gun/handle and bottle. The black plastic part that connects the handle to the bottle gets lose if the handle is not perpendicular because the weight of the liquid in the bottle makes it unscrew from the handle. No matter how many times I tightened it, It kept getting lose. Today while spraying dormant oil and copper fungicide the handle stopped working and the tank fell off and the spray never stopped. The threads no longer work as weak plastic always losses to metal threads. I assume the handle needs to connection to work (on and off) so the only issue may be using the wrong material to connect to the handle. I always washed it clean. Followed direction etc. This is not a professional tool.	-1
Bought this from a local hardware store.  Leaks from the end connector. Tried to exchange it but all they had on hand  was the next model down.  That one worked but after four years it cracked wear it bends to fit my Ames hose reel.  Next time I'm trying a different brand.	-1
Leaks water the whole time you use it.	-1
I hate using this sprayer.  It's difficult to fill - because of the very small opening, you need to use a funnel.  It's awkward attaching it to a hose - you need to spin the entire apparatus around and around until it's secure enough so it doesn't leak.  The bottle is too small to hold chemicals that require a higher dilution rate.	-1
I bought this for carrying with me while fishing back wood pools and hunting.  I run into thorny vines aka saw brier and the like often often.  Safe to say I didn't use this tool heavily at all.  First impressions were poor to begin with.  Most of the metal was pot metal to begin with.  But I didn't return it thinking Fiskars may have cut some corners but maybe not every single one.  After a few days of light use it seemed to cut okay.  Then after a few days I really had to clamp down to get it to cut small branches. I looked at the edge and noticed it has started curling.  I couldn't believe that they didn't even bother to harden the blade edge.  DON'T bother with this tool unless you're pruning onions.  Sadly this is not the quality that the Fiskars brand once offered.	-1
I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee. After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - "Flexogen". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have. Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.  Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.  On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say "This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.	-1
Cheap made. Horrible product. Won't cut but half the time. Buy a different brand - this one is no good.	-1
The hose connection did not have threads and was not usable.  Had to go through annoying return policy.  What a pia.  And waste of my time.	-1
These came bent and don't really work. To close and lock them I really had to bend them back in place.	-1
I've used this model Gilmour hose-end sprayer and I've also used the model with the teal-colored handle.  This one costs a bit more, but it's worth the extra cash as both its construction and design is superior to its cheaper cousin.  For example, I found that the point of connection on the cheaper unit was a veritable Achille's heel ie as I walked, the hose tended work loose fairly easily and, of course, as soon as the seal was broken, I'd get an unwanted 'shower'.  That mishap didn't happen once when I sprayed my 1/2 acre lawn with the 362 Pro.  UPDATE: 2.17.17:  I paid $19 for this item 2.5 years ago & now it's going for $50??  If you want this type hose-end sprayer, check out the Chapin G362 model.  As far as I can tell, it's virtually identical to the Gilmour unit and is available for $20!!	-1
The opening is too small.	-1
DOes not evenly distribute nematodes. I bought it so mix things but everything I have tried to distribute on my lawn so far, anti-grub spores and nematodes, and other things all didn't work. It almost feels like it got more of all the stuff I am spraying on my hands and on me than on my lawn. I followed the directions carefully and tried it out many times, perhaps I"m not that good at this but it didn't work out for me.	-1
This will only meter 1 tsp. or 1 tablespoon to a gallon... the concentrate to be used is 2 tablespoons to 100 gallons. I do not know how to calculate the dilution I need to put in the container to meter out at 1 tsp. to a gallon. 1-800 number was no help...	-1
The unit leaked from the first time it was used .. does the job, but trickles all over the person spraying.	-1
I bought this unit because it looked better constructed than some of the cheaper ones.  It clogs (even if one strains the material to be sprayed before filling it) and is therefore pretty useless.	-1
The most frustrating to use its  blade refuses to stay tight having a inlay nod to keep tightening by a bolt  having no concept in its technology  what so ever.  You never will need to change the blade it never will get worn enough to worry about it	-1
hate this thing more than anything. I skimped on spending money for a real sprayer so i bought this, what a waste. It took forever to mess with to get it to work, then, screwing around dragging a hose behind me dealt the final blow. The hose dragging may not seem like much but, do that for an period of time and it gets old quick. That hose weighs a lot filled with water lol. Got a backpack sprayer and never looked back since. imo, just spend the money and get a real sprayer	-1
This sprinkler was supposed to the the only one of it's design to buy but it worked for only a few weeks before the internal gear system failed.  I was told the gear kit is replaceable but after finding that it's all made of plastic I tossed the whole thing in the trash and went back to my old style metal sprinkler.  You'd think, considering the price of these things, that they'd make them better.	-1
The plastic gears will break in a heart beat if you let the grass get too high. Need to find a better build one soon.	-1
I bought the Gilmour because it was recommended to use with the Spray & Forget House & Deck product. When it came, we could not figure out how to convert the measurements to use the product in this sprayer. When I called Customer Service at Spray & Forget I was told that I CANNOT USE THIS SPRAYER with their product!! They don't know who linked it here on Amazon and they have been trying to get it unlinked to no avail. So, if you are buying SPRAY & FORGET products, DO NOT BUY THIS Gilmour Sprayer!!	-1
I bought myself and my sons each one, they aren't made like they used to be,they sold to a different company and the new company put plastic parts instead ,all 3 of them were junk within a year, my neighbor still had his he bought 15 yrs ago when they were made with steel parts.	-1
used it right out of the package,  More water came out of the base of the sprayer then the nozzle the little gold piece on the top fell off.  had to look in the grass for that for 20 minutes... RETURNED!	-1
Every time you need to lay the nozzle down for whatever reason it WILL land on the spray lever and send a stream of water right at you leaving you soaking wet, especially in the winter months. This is Murphy's Law with any rear trigger garden sprayer and believe me, there is nothing you can do to prevent it. It will get really old really fast too, unless of course you actually like being unexpectedly soaked to the bone every time you need to use your hose. Get one that has a FRONT trigger and this won't happen,  You're very welcome!	-1
sprayer has rusted in less than a year and leaks.....	-1
I bought two and both have issues with the hand lever getting stuck in a spray position.  Frequently need to manually pull back the lever to stop the water flow.	-1
gears are already broken, it won't move forward	-1
It does a basic job.  The teaspoon conversion adapter is okay, but there should be some kind of marking on the dial to tell you what the what the default measuring units are (tablespoon or teaspoon).  This can be important if you need to reacquaint yourself after a season without use or if you let your family member borrow it.  Also the arrow could standout more, so the user can rest assure its on the right setting.  Maybe it should have been painted "black."  The above is just improvements that could have been done.  If you compare other sprayers, the dials are much bigger and easy to read and have no need to use an "adapter" for teaspoon conversions.  My biggest gripe, is the little red snap cap (on top of the squeeze handle) fell off.  Its just a pressed on piece of plastic and its a pain to put back on.  It broke off only after 4 uses.  They should have used a metal nut or something more durable.  Now I am not sure I can depend on it staying on for my next spray.	-1
These are horrible.  They are so tight that I have to pry them open every time I make just one cut with them.  Very frustrating and time consuming with these pruning shears.  I tried loosening the shears, but then they wouldn't cut at all.	-1
Cheap coated mystery "metal" (MIM with a stamped handle) construction with some brass and plastic bits. Unless you remove it from your hose and bring it inside after every use, eventually that coating is going to chip off and the nozzle will start rusting as it's exposed to the elements. From a value perspective, do note that you're spending about 1/3 the cost of a high quality machined brass nozzle.	-1
Just like the last pair, rubber handles slip off metal when using them. Makes it hard to hang onto. Will buy a different brand next time.	-1
I have a large yard that had no sprinklers installed.  I thought this would make my life a lot easier by doing my watering duties for me.  I tried to set this up with and I couldn't get it to move.  It just sat there shooting water.  I opened it up and found the gears were frozen.  They must have been damaged in shipping since the body of this thing is really heavy.	-1
It seems like a quality product made from good materials, but the design did not work for me. I was interested in spraying liquid fertilizer and a milk solution recommended to combat lawn mildew. For these uses, it took over an hour of spraying to empty the container even on the highest setting. This rate may be OK for spraying potent chemicals, but not for fertilizer. My water pressure is a bit low, so that could have contributed to the problem. I had to return it.	-1
Not a good product as it leaks everywhere. Not much more to say it was not usuable as it would leak water and chemical from the top spout.	-1
Had many reviews most of them good. When I got mine I tried to cut a small soft branch and it just bent instead of cutting. I can see the blade is not lined up with the metal part causing a gap instead of slicing through. I now see other reviewers having the same issue, either the blade overlaps the metal or its too far apart. I was really hoping these would be decent despite the cheap price but they are just cheap. I'm sure they are not all made with these flaws so you'll have to decide on taking that chance. The metal on mine had a lot of nicks and scratches too.	-1
If you buy any Solo sprayer, you should also stock up on pump rebuild kits and be ready to spend an hour or so installing one every year from now through eternity. We bought one a few years ago, it lasted one season, then a different model (piston) and that lasted one season. The rebuild kits run $15-22 each. Seriously, either have one on hand or be ready to have your pump not work when you need it. They are fairly easy to take apart if you are handy with a hex driver & screwdriver... but they really need to use better quality rubber or silicone so they will last longer. But then they won't make so much profit on the rebuild kits!	-1
Cheap	-1
I ordered this sprinkler with high hopes because I have a huge lawn, no sprinkler system, and it just isn't possible to water with conventional "move-around" hose-end sprinklers.  I got it to work (make sure you get the sprinkler arms in exactly the right position!). The sprinkler itself is quite heavy, metal, but - the cheap plastic end-ramp (that the sprinkler is supposed to climb onto & shut itself off) is absolutely useless.  Why Nelson thought a light-weight plastic fixture with an inadequate short rod to anchor it into the ground would be acceptable and work is beyond me! I've tried a number of times to make this work, with only one success... I have a LARGE rural lawn - it's not a golf course! - but it should be acceptable for this to negotiate.  (I recently bought a new hose - a Tuff-Guard Extra Flexible, Kink Proof Garden Hose - and the traveling sprinkler can't follow it at all, but gets hung up on the hose ridges.) - This thing will probably live in the garage until I donate it, sell it, or give it away... I'm going to check out other brands...	-1
4/18 - revised to one star. It ended up leaking so bad i gave it away. Its garbage. **********  I really wanted to like this sprayer a lot more than I ended up liking it. I have a yard that is good sized for Silicon Valley (I'm sure folks in other parts of the country would laugh at that). It's about 13k square feet. Normally, to go around spraying pesticide or weed killer, I have to re-load my 1.5 gallon hand pump sprayer a couple of times. Not only that, I have to carry that sprayer in one hand while the other holds the spray wand, all while occasionally pausing to set the sprayer down and pump the sprayer up and then pick it up again. So, I thought that with a "professional" sprayer of 4 gallon capacity, I could load up the sprayer a little over half way, walk around while spraying continuously and be done much faster and easier. As it turns out, this is all true, except for that the sprayer leaks somewhere near the piston assembly on the bottom. It's hard for me to tell exactly where the leak is coming from. I tried tightening a couple of likely screws. I also looked for damage on the cylinder housing and adjacent areas. Nothing. I just get the occasional drip of weed killer on my calf and on the lower part my shirt. Ew.  So, I looked around where the leak might be coming from. I also tightened the screw that holds the pump cylinder housing. I have not been able to find the source of the leak just yet. Fortunately,  was spraying some fairly mild weed killer, so I was able to press on and finish spraying the weeded areas as well as applying the rest of the ~3 gallons I mixed up. What I found is that the sprayer is surprisingly comfortable to carry, the pump works well other than the fact that it leaks, and that I do actually get the yard sprayed more efficiently with this backpack than with my old hand sprayer. That said, my old sprayer is 20 years old, and does not leak.  I haven't called the manufacturer for assistance yet. I think I'll t take another shot at stopping the leak and then call them. In the meantime, I am taking two stars off for leaking. If this big plastic wonder is meant for pros, then it is miscast because the pump housing area leaks and is likely too fragile. In fact, I'd rate it a two, except that it does actually spray really well while it is dripping poison on my shirt and leg.	-1
Top of sprayer where lid screws on is warped. Lid will screw down but if not careful it will be cross threaded and leak out top with full tank, Works great but for the price you shouldn't have them ship you something that obviously wasn't checked by QC before packing.	-1
The straps are the cheapest and most ineffective straps I have ever had on a backpack sprayer--and I have had several good ones. The sprayer mechanism itself is fine, but if you have three gallons of herbicide on your shoulders and the straps let go, well, you know how much profanity can result.  Solo used to be a sound product years ago, but the plastic "clamp on" strap fixtures at the bottom and the astoundingly cheap plastic pins at the top are something Solo should be ashamed of. I cannot believe the crap that sells for $80. If you want to buy a good sprayer, perhaps Google search RelaxPack. Costs lots more, but at least the reservoir will remain attached to you and even be semi-comfortable. I have sprayed hundreds of gallons with other backpack sprayers and I NEVER had a strap detach before.  Nobody wants to dump 3 gallons of Glyphosate and 2,4-D to the ground because the straps are so poor and readily come undone. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this Solo sprayer.	-1
As others have pointed out, the straps are a joke. You'll never be able to keep them untangled or consistently connected to the sprayer.  After about a year the wand connections leaked.  I replaced the wand but the wand depressurizing mechanism would not engage--misaligned plastic.  Shortly after that, the bottom of the tank leaked.  In any case I've moved on to a no-leak Smith sprayer.	-1
So frustrating to pay this kind of money for such a hunk of junk. I only blame myself for being stupid enough to not read other stripped gear box reviews. Whats worse is its 30 bucks to replace the gear box... with another plastic gear box. Whats the point in that. Mine stripped within 4 weeks of use now its in the trash off to the landfill. After doing some research National Brand Walking Sprinkler has made in the USA all metal geared sprinklers for not much more. I guess you get what you pay for. Thanks China and Cooperate Capitalism for filling up our landfills with plastic crap. What a waste, these used to be made with metal gears... FOR A REASON!	-1
broken in 3 months	-1
Poor quality, the plastic clip that connects to the diaphragm pump snapped after only being used 10 times.  This is the achilles heel of this backpack sprayer, once this clip snaps the sprayer is no longer usable.  Solo need to rethink their design here.  I can't recommend this backpack sprayer after my experience, look elsewhere if you want something that is durable and going to last.	-1
This sprinkler is poorly made. The only thing made of metal is the main body, the rest is cheep plastic. Even if the cheep plastic parts don't break, it does not do a very good job and will not pull much hose before the wheels dig in. My comments apply to the Orbit, Craftsman and what ever other brands this sprinkler is sold under. Yes they are all the same, and just look different. To the best of my knowledge the only company still making a good traveling sprinkler is national. [...] They are kind of expensive but well worth the investment if you plan to use it. The only other option is to find an old used Thompson or Kees at a yard sale. Remember you get what you pay for!	-1
Have been using this now only two weeks and its broken. The spray wand is made of the most cheapest plastic available I am sure. Talk aboiut cutting corners. In particular the trigger mechanism has a cheap plastic squeeze that has an even cheaper plastic insert that initiates spray. This broke on mine after about 4 or 5 tanks being sprayed. Real nice product here lol. I was ready to return this poorly made product and really should have but than saw I had a quality wand from another sprayer from a different company that lasted a few years till it finaaly broke but the sprayer still worked so I put on this sprayer. So the other spray wand from a different company lasted years and now is still working on this sprayer,yet the one the solo came woith broke in a couplke of weeks. Unreal ! Keep in mind too that the Solo sprayer is not cheap either. The fact that Solo puts the most cheapest parts possible in building this sprayer yet charges and arm and a leg for it is sickening.  If the rest of the sprayer( most noteably the pump) have these same cheap products that the wand and trigger have than they will no doubt break as well.  I would avoid this product as it will break if used even a few times it is only a question of when.	-1
I sent an inquiry a few days ago to the company, and have not received a response. I bought a Raintrain from Do It Best in Champaign. It worked for a week, then ran over the stop block and stopped at a rock and kept running. Now it will barely move, and there is a clicking sound when it attempts to move. I assume a nylon gear was stripped when the stop ramp did not work. I want a replacement. I'm waiting for their response after a second inquiry today.	-1
Yes, it's all metal but it's not as sturdy as I had hoped. It's made in China and feels kind of cheap. It works but I'm looking to replace it after just a few uses.	-1
I got tired of how many times this jumped the track. I believe the gears are plastic, as well, it stopped progressing along the hose.  I never abused my tractor sprinkler, always putting it away (fearing theft).  I ultimately bought a national walking sprinkler and added the brass arms so i would be done replacing this expensive item for once and for all. [...]  That item is expensive and heavy but is all metal and does a great job.	-1
Poor quality.  Made in China nowdays.  Years ago Fiscars brand name use to mean Quality!  No longer true.  Like too many american companies,  its all about saving money to pay the stockholders,  otherwise,  they too will be out of work. This is yet another example of a good quality company "Fiscars Corp."  Has cheapened their products in order to compete globally with China.  As soon as China has smothered out the few remaining, american owned stores in the U. S. Then the rest of their plan will be easily placed in position to finish putting the swueeze on remaining Mom and Pop stores.  How sad for us!	-1
used these to prune small branches from shrubs around house, had not completed task when jaws loosened up to the point where cutting jaw would roll over the intended stalk of branch making me reposition the shears again, VERY FRUSTRATING, SAVE YOUR MONEY, BUY A BETTER PAIR. THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!	-1
It broke after 5 uses. Waste of money	-1
I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.	-1
I have owned the Nelson Raintrain for two seasons. With just a little experimentation I was able to get the tractor to navigate nearly all the turns in my lawn. I learned that I could attach an unlimited amount of hose to reach the ends of our property as long as I periodically pulled hose to prevent the trailing length from becoming too heavy. No constant moving a sprinkler from one spot to another and it had the good sense to shut off automatically when it was finished. It's now in the landfill.  It partially broke just when I had it mastered and was fully enjoying the benefits of a traveling sprinkler. The first thing to go was the auto shutoff. The tractor would run up the ramp and not shut off but would normally stall or topple over. This created a pond and if the wheels were still turning, torn sod.  Eventually the gear stripped and it would no longer turn the wheels. I'm sure this was hastened by the times it didn't shut off and stalled out while digging in the sod.  The principal is great as are the promised benefits. Fortunately, there are better made alternatives. For about a hundred dollars more you can get a National Walking Sprinkler model that has steel gears and has been around since the thirties - made in Nebraska I believe. Amazon sells their model B3 or they have a web site. You won't regret the additional investment. As it does not have auto shutoff, you may want to add a timer.	-1
A traveling sprinkler made in the USA (National Walking Sprinkler, Omaha, NE) costs more, but is 10-times better. We've owned two of these Nelson  devices.  They work pretty well when new, but the plastic gears  soon deteriorate and then these 18-pound beauties are absolutely useless. Don't know if they can go in the recycle bin. There are a lot of reviews complaining about the gear problem. Take them seriously. The manufacturer could easily remedy this problem, but they have not. It's an expensive contraption, but, as another reviewer said, its best use may be as a boat anchor. Caveat emptor.	-1
I bought this sprinkler to deal with a newly seeded lawn that I needed to water daily.  I liked the idea that this sprinkler can move through a relatively large area unattended.  I dislike this sprinkler because it "jumps" the hose regularly (even though it is laid straight, nothing in the way), it's gears on high-gear stripped after half a season and finally it's just slow to cover the area it is trying to cover - my old sprinkler (back and forth fan style) put just as much water down in less time so even though I would have had to move it a few times - at least I could water the lawn in an evening.  I haven't dumped it (yet)- but it's not worth the money...	-1
The nozzle did not function as I expected.  I found it hard to change and maintain a flow pattern.	-1
We received the pruners today in the mail and they are clearly NOT Fiskars brand!! The brand is Gardners.	-1
Not the Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle your grandpa used. This hunk of pot metal is painted a glossy battleship grey. It works. I didn't have time to send it back or I would have.	-1
I thought this would be great for my yard but I set it out and it would move only about one foot per hour. I contacted Nelson and they sent a new motor which I installed. Now the sprinkler doesn't move at all. I suspect my water flow is not sufficient to drive this thing, as my house is about 55 years old with iron pipe that is somewhat occluded.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM unless you have a newer house with no flow or pressure problems. And don't buy from Amazon unless you are sure it will work because Amazon has a poor return policy.  UPDATE September 23, 2009: After replacing the motor under warranty I still didn't get sufficient water through the arms to move the sprinkler. So I took it apart, again, and discovered a manufacturing defect in the "T" that the arms come out of. The hole had not been drilled through all the way. I called customer service and they are sending a new one out. In the meantime I drilled it out myself and am happy to say it is working as it should. The rating system won't let me change my rating from a one star but I would now rate the sprinkler as a 5 star. Of course, the season is over now so I'm somewhat less than thrilled, but looking forward to spring.	-1
THe thing worked only a short time per attempt before it went off the track or the sprinkler arms blew off from the water pressure.  Can't turn up the water pressure above half on without a "blow out" occuring.  Got tired of fooling with the darn thing and sold it on e-bay.  I lost a little money but at least the old-fashined oscillating sprinker worked and worked very well.  I would not recommend this sprinkler to anyone.	-1
I have a 1/2 acre lawn, and most is on a gentle slope. If I try to go sideways, it fell over EASILY (top heavy/too narrow)!  Even when I go up/down, it falls over at the slightest bare spot! It also commonly does not shutoff when it gets to the ramp- goes a ways & falls over. The stuck sprinkler arms often dig a large hole, when it falls over! ~~~  I finally gave up & had a Rainbird buried system professionally installed- I have to replace 3/4 broken Rainbird heads a year (usually discovered after I see large dead spots!)! The Rainbird heads "supposedly" have a 5-year warranty, but the "only" local authorized dealer balks at replacing them (I show him the installation receipt too!). Catch22!- If I TRY & complain to Rainbird, the refer me back flaky dealer!  It is now a mix of Rainbird/Hunter heads. I have only had the new Hunter heads section a year, and I hope they last longer/more dependable!? The Rainbird heads cover MUCH better though, and hope their new model replacement heads last better (no new ones bad in 2-years?)?  I wish I could offer you a more viable solution!?	-1
It worked great at the beginning, but now, just 2 1/2 months later the blades are already very dull...That's disappointing!!!	-1
i'd have given it 0 stars if i could.  the gears are made out of plastic, and are prone to stripping if the tractor is not used in optimal conditions.  i broke mine 3 times (returned each time) when it would get stuck in the mud, against a small rock or something similar.  when used in optimal conditions, this item works, but i'd recommend getting a rittenhouse instead	-1
The delivery and packaging was right on time, and the product was as promised - a pair of Fiskars pruning shears.  But the utility of the product was another story.  I bought these Fiskars pruning shears and a pair of Fiskars loppers, because the brand is well-known, which I (wrongly) assumed counted for quality.  I mean, how do you get to be well-known if your product doesn't work?  Neither of them were sharp, and the blades of these little pruners ... I'm not sure how to explain this... preferred to spread sideways - path of least resistance - instead of straight through the small bush branches I was trying to prune.  I'm going to try to send both back.	-1
I just don't see how pieces of junk made with poor quality parts can get high reviews. TWO of these worthless tools taught me all I need to know about Fiskers LOW  quality items that break and don't stay sharp at all. The better grade one I also bought had the spring break in less than a week too.	-1
Does not look like what is pictured. Doesn't appear to be that shiny "zinc" I was expecting, rather some sort of coated metal. Doesn't say Gilmour on it, but does have big "MADE IN CHINA" stamped on it. Returning.	-1
I noticed that, right out of the package, the shears felt a bit stiff. After light use, the blades would no longer come together at the tip and, because of this, could no longer be locked. While the blades were definitely sharp and continued to cut branches near the pruner's hinge, they were not properly adjusted and would not cut anywhere near the tip.  I've contacted Fiskars (warranty@fiskars.com) and hope they'll honor their lifetime warranty at no expense to me. Maybe the next pair will be better.	-1
Crap. Lasted less than four months. Split at base. See photo. Made in China. Go figure.	-1
Only a small area (about an inch close to the handle side of the blades) cuts.  The rest just bends the branches and takes way too much effort to figure out why only half the blade surface actually cuts.  I bought these to replace Fiskars pruners that are way past their prime. Since the part that actually cuts is so close to the handle, they have limited use.  I replaced these with Felco.	-1
This unit nips branches just fine, but my problem is the overall craftmanship.  After about 3 uses, I noticed that one of the handles started coming loose from the metal shank underneath.  I had to take it upon myself to go to the store to buy epoxy to fix it.	-1
I thought I reviewed sprayers thoroughly and knew what I wanted...I was wrong! This simple sprayer is nothing but a 70's throwback and no longer belongs in our current society of ingenuity and convenience! First and foremost...it hurts your hand after using it for just a few minutes! Second...the crappy little "hold-open" clip that allows you to continuously spray...just broke off after a few months! Overall...the design is just a fail as it's antiquated and severely lacking in performance. So...I'm not thrilled with my purchase of three of these items! If you don't want to acquire hand-fatigue...and if I had to do it all over again...I would spring for a Bon-Aire fire hose type nozzle (also here on Amazon).  **UPDATE - I purchased the Bon-Aire,,,I don't like that one either...its too large and the pressure is not as good as people say and I have excellent water pressure here (90 PSI). I haven't looked...but if I were...Id be looking for one similar to the old-style thin brass fire nozzles...but with a rubber coating for better grip. Im sure there is something out there...but these two are not it! Good luck in your search!	-1
These did not last but a few weeks before becoming hard to operate. I do use my tools heavily for my job.	-1
Just not like they used to be.  They used to last for years. The past 10 years now... every one I buy doesn't last 6 months and the thingy starts sticking and squirting water all over me. That has nothing to do with needs a new washer, for all you smartalexs that think a new washer fixes everything.	-1
UPDATE: This sat around my garage for one winter and is now basically unusable. The little adjustable screw on the back got a little rusty and now sticks, making it difficult to turn the nozzle on and off. I've started using a "Fireman style" nozzle and like it WAY (WAY) better. Get one of those instead.  OLD REVIEW: This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!  My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly e.g., it's not an even "circle" of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.	-1
Blades made of soft metal, got notch and now get stuck all the time. In my book these are junk	-1
metal too soft, its all wore out after light use, the thread on front already smooth out. lots rust on the back puller/handle part, need something with better material, rather buy once and be done with it for many year.	-1
cheaply made	-1
I was swayed by the reviews.  I am really disappointed with this product.  It is not made of hardened steel.  The cutting blade bends easily and the other blade was easily notched.  I have used this product with great anticipation that it was a strong and quality tough tool.  It is not. I can not recommend this product to anyone.  I was expecting it to be hardened sword quality steel.  Foolish me.	-1
There are much better choices at a lower cost. The padded handle covers slide off easily making the product much more difficult to use, and the although the cutting blades are sharp, they won't cut cut through larger branches without bending them out of shape. Nice try Fiskars, but it should be back to the drawing boards!	-1
In my case, "light" duty meant they bent within the first 20 minutes.  I used them on a green tree branch of approximately max width (4-5/8") and the blades separated sideways causing the pruner to twist in my hand.  This force caused the back bar (ie: not the sharp blade but the piece it cuts against) to bend outward.  I used a rock to press against and bend it back to continue cutting more branches but this happened a couple times and I gave up.  If your 'light' duty means you'll only ever cut fairly soft and small things, these may work for you.  But I doubt it.  Eventually, your're going to attempt something stiff and they're going to bend.	-1
Cutting blade bent after 10 minutes of use, and will not close. Cheap steel. Get what you pay for. Go with a higher end pair.	-1
We are used to excellent products from Fiskars, but this one is not well-designed. In its first use, cutting off small pencil-sized suckers from a fruit tree, the blade and guard did not line up, and the blade caught on and was nicked by the lower guard, ruining the sharp edge. From time to time they seem to misalign themselves (even just opening and closing them without anything between), which causes the blade to catch on the guard and malfunction. The only positive is that the handles are easy to grip and not hard to close. We definitely won't be buying these again, they just aren't well-designed or well-made.	-1
This thing bent while cutting a 0.5 inch branch from an apple tree and never recovered-into the trash.	-1
These are absolute rubbish. I long since replaced them with another brand, but when I saw these on Amazon I had to share my experience. First and foremost, I am a Fiskars fan, and have been for a while. I adore their genuine Finnish made products, especially their famous orange handled scissors for crafts/sewing/indoor stuff (which, once upon a time, were made in Finland with steel brought in from Sweden), but also their garden related products. Unfortunately, many years back, Fiskars became a global importer and ceased all manufacturing in Finland. Typically you can only find old stock from the made-in-Finland days, otherwise it's just new, made-in-China junk.  These bypass pruning shears, a newer product offering that was only ever made in China, is a case in point. Their quality is pitiful, especially given the relatively high price point compared to other China junk. The blade is garbage and cuts like you'd expect from poorly made-in-China pruners, i.e. not very well if at all. They jam up constantly, even on light duty jobs, because they are neither polished nor coated to prevent plant material from sticking to them and gumming up the hinge. Furthermore, the button mechanism to lock/unlock also constantly locks itself in the middle of being used, resulting in complete work stoppage to unlock it again. If you're wearing gloves appropriate to doing most yard work, this can be a real pain, because you need to remove them to wrestle with this stupid thing over and over when it locks itself for the umpteenth time.  It pains me as a Fiskars brand enthusiast to give a 1-star rating, but honestly, these are probably some of the worst pruners I have ever used. They're not sharp, they're not well made, they're not well engineered, they're not durable, the locking mechanism is poorly designed and executed, the ergonomics are nonexistent and the tool simply does not work for its intended purpose. This incredibly typical of made-in-China garbage riding on what used to be a high quality brand name. It's a shame that Fiskars sold out. I would not recommend this product at all, and certainly not at this price point. You're paying for a name that no longer has any connection the level of quality in the product. It's just import junk like everything else now.	-1
Purchased two pairs of these little pruners to replace Fiskars that I had bought years ago.  The old ones were my favorites, lasted for ever.  Only opened one pair, and the quality I had always enjoyed from this brand was missing.  Either the springs were too weak to open the blades, or something else caused them to seize.  They would not function.  I chose to return them, and my money was refunded.	-1
Fiskars products used to be higher quality but not so much today.  I bought these at HD and they are really bad.  The foam gribs come off nearly right away.  I know they are cheaply priced but are not even worth this amount.  Might be fine if doing very light pruning.	-1
These could not trim the smaller twigs on bushes and the end of the trees.	-1
Decent sprinkler, kind of cheap feeling but for the price that is to be ecpected. It leaked pretty bad when I first got it so I had to use some teflon tape to help it seal. also the product came extremely dusty. The sprinkle pattern is pretty weak too.	-1
I was quite disappointed when these shears locked in a partially closed position after being used for trimming shrubs for less than 5 minutes.  I have had good luck with prior Fiskar products.  I would not buy this product again.  I may be able to get them to work by disassembling them and then putting them back together.  Quite a hassle for a simple tool.	-1
This is for someone with very large hands. The blade sticks after each cut and is awkward to handle. I am disappointed in the function and would not recommend.	-1
Per the included Prop 65 warning label, this product causes cancer due to the use of toxic materials.  I returned it immediately for a refund.	-1
The pair I got were poorly made. The blades didn't line up. Tried to tighten the nut and no go. Mine lasted a couple years and fell apart. They never worked right in the first place. Had to buy another pair. I should have returned them right at first, that's my fault, but Fiskars is a brand I avoid now.	-1
Look good but pure junk as the hingle is plastic and mine broke the second time I used it	-1
Junk, like everybody says, BUT it had a lifetime guarantee (this hose was guaranteed for its life, not my life), I wisely saved the paperwork and the new owners of the company (Fiskars) sent me a new hose (failed hose lasted a few years). New hose is nice. Completely different technology. Heavy and solid. Tough reinforcing cord. Not carcinogenic. Nice hardware. So, purchase this garbage on the cheap and when it fails they will send you a nice new $80.00 hose for free. Just make sure you can live with this hose's horrible kinking behavior. It's as limp as a noodle. Needs Viagra AND Cialis!	-1
When I first started using this hose  I thought it was great. Heavy duty, etc etc... Now 2 years later it is no longer flexible. Impossible to move around. weighs a ton. its like the material morphed into something else, I couldn't send  this back if i wanted to. awful hose don't buy!	-1
I bought this to use on our hobby farm for watering livestock.  The hose itself is robust and relatively kink free - in fact all I would expect.  However we are returning it because of a worsening and persistent leak at the rotating connection between the female end on the faucet end of the hose and the hose itself. It started the first time we used the hose with just a few drops of leakage but now half fills a 5 gallon pail every day while we fill stock tanks. I am disappointed because I thought I was finally going to find a reliable 3/4 inch hose and while I think I am just unfortunate to have got one with a faulty fitting, I am going to try a different hose next time.	-1
I thought this inflatable would work for my garden but it would not stay inflated and looks more like a toy. Gave it away.	-1
I've had one of these before and really liked it. It kept the birds away from the garden ! This one did not hold air. The plug would pop out as soon as it was inflated. Even after I used a clamp to keep the plug in, it would lose all air in 5 minutes, so the seams must not have been sealed properly either. Works great ... if it holds air !	-1
Today this pump stopped working for me. I am not happy. I just bought it in Aug. 2012 - I use it for my goldfish and he needs this fountain // water flow, especially now. Of course it's the new year eve and yadda yadda so I'm SOL.........  If it were not needed for my 17 year  old gold fish I would not care. FISH NEED AIR. Of course it's late in the day too. : ((( I am so upset.	-1
You may want to check with the vendor about what exactly you're getting before ordering this gauge:  I purchased two because of the metric AND english gradations and the price was right - what I got was an inches-only gauge that did not have nearly the precision advertised.  Heck, it wasn't even the same shape or color as pictured!	-1
I would not buy this type pump again.  I have had a lot of pumps over the years and never have had one that continually tripped the breaker.  I had an electrician replace the ground fault plug and that did no good.	-1
I ordered two of these Gilmore sprayers via Amazon and received promptly.  Both units had air pressure leaks where the handle part of the unit screws onto the liquid holding portion; One sprayer air leaked moderately, the other unit air pressure leaked severely;  I was barely able to use the moderately leaking unit to do a "rush job" by very frequent pumping.  The severely leaking unit was not usable because it lost pressure so fast.  I called Gilmore customer service and requested a new unit and was told I would be sent a new replacement sprayer if I would prove recent purchase by sending them a copy of the concerned invoice via email -- I did this and quickly received a new identical replacement sprayer.  I immediately added pure water to the reservoir, operated the hand pump to pressurize, and immediately noted this new replacement sprayer also had a severe air pressure leak making it virtually unusable.	-1
Good quality, but did not produce pin point pressure I expected. Definitely falls short of the one I lost, but I don't remember who made that one. Works well, but stream is not as powerful.	-1
This product is very attractive to birds and fun to watch. However the water drain holes are too few and too small. Enlarging them would not help as you read on. After it rains, the seeds stick together and because you cannot disassemble the feeder walls, you cannot clean out the coagulated, clumped seed! Very poor design. Do not buy this product unless it never,ever rains where you live!	-1
Understand before you order this nozzle cannot be spun and shutoff at nozzle.  You have to shut the water off at the hose bib (faucet).  I bought this to wash my cars.  I generally spray car to get it wet and than turn nozzle to shut off water while I soap up vehicle with wash mitt.  This nozzle requires you to go back and shut off faucet at the house, soap the car, and return to faucet to turn on for rinse. Repeat as many times as necessary.  I returned nozzle to Amazon with no problems.  I bought instead "Hose Nozzle High Pressure for Car of Garden"  solid brass, made in USA, which you can shut off/turn back on at the nozzle.  This nozzle is outstanding and includes 2 nozzles with extra washers.	-1
Gilmour Solid Brass Water Jet Nozzle #06BJ  Jet [sweeper] nozzles produce a powerful narrow stream that use less water than conventional hose nozzles. We use them to clean the driveway & sidewalks, wash vehicles, and similar tasks. Our hoses have a valve installed at their ends to control water flow.  We own several brands of jet nozzles.  The Gilmour is the worst and the Nelson is the best.  The brass Gilmour Jet works fine when new, but after a few gentle drops onto the driveway, the brass nozzle bent over slightly and partially separated from the base.  It then leaked profusely, making it useless.  The brass on the nozzle part of a Nelson brand sweeper is thicker and larger (stronger) than on the Gilmour nozzle.  The Nelson can easily stand such "abuse".  See Customer Images. I've dropped the Nelson nozzle on the driveway a hundred times and it's full of scratches, scratched, but it doesn't bend.  Both jet sweeper nozzles work great, but my advice is to get the better quality Nelson model, especially since the Nelson jet typically costs less.  Search on Google Shopping or Amazon, for "Nelson brass sweeper Nozzle".	-1
the hanging part of the was not very good (wires) I would not buy another  one	-1
Looks nice but cheap plastic material. Does not hang properly with wire provided	-1
This is cheaply made and is not easy to fill.  It a great idea, but...........  After using it once I gave it to my son in-law.	-1
My spreader just broke when I went to use it for the 5th time. The lever that controls the flow rate broke.  I am very disappointed in this product.	-1
i bought this same spool when i got my weed eater and it was easy to replace,i recently ordered another replacment spool of the same kind but this one dosnt fit!	-1
Photo is of OLD well made USA unit NOT now sold China one  I farm and usually had 5 or more out in SW Kansas for years. When they were made in USA of the butal and units were marked black they were excellent and lasted years. Now they are junk made in China leak not durable plastic, no colored marks just another US company that sold out to China with no Quality control Chinese made junk. Ordered 4 2 years ago and all are damaged and bad now. For a gauge this expensive ought to not have these problems!!!  WAS excellent accurate NOAA certified .05" rain gauge.	-1
I equipped my entire, three-zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers. They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.  Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.	-1

I hate these! Cheap garbage, leak and break too easily.  I install and repair sprinkler systems and these are always leaking too much around the pop up shaft and are often broken. You'll know the cheap sprinkler heads easily by the white slots around the outside edge of the top of the heads (see picture). For a tiny bit more money the Rainbird 1800 Professional heads are 20 times better.	-1
Came to my door with a damaged edge and a shredded box that was twice the size it needed to be with virtually no packing material, the horrible packing job caused another item to be lost from the box. The grinding on the corners of the steel handle and the outside profiles of the axe head were very roughly done, not the nice smooth polished corners I am used to from Estwing. I own several hammers and an old hatchet that were made so much better than this thing was. What's happened to Estwing?	-1
I had been looking for a purple Martin house and found this one. It was even marked down. I now know why. It was bent when we opened the box and it looks more like a jigsaw puzzle than a bird house. The instructions are terrible and don't address how to connect the two floors. The metal is also flimsy. And don't even think of getting this if you have big hands. Small, tight spaces need small hands to put nuts on. Too much work was put into it to send it back.	-1
I finally got time to open the box and attempt to assemble. Instructions are a mess.  There are many many pieces to try to figure out how to put together.  I was amazed at how many parts there were Spent two nights outting it together, then had to take part of it apart due to incomplete instructions. Add to this the fact that I got the useless pole with parts missing and no instruction, I will never even consider Heath Outdoor Products again.	-1
I just received my Martin House, unpacked it, laid all the parts out and started reading the instructions. I am not dim, these instructions are the least possible amount of effort a company could put into this. Bad schematics, 72+ parts and likely many more nuts and bolts. Re-assign the person that wrote the instructions and hand someone of average intelligence the unopened box and film it. Repeat that process while re-writing the instructions until it is simple. After reading how poor the pole is and that the house isn't Starling resistant I realized I got what I paid for, not much. I just watched a YouTube video on how to cut out the interior walls to really accommodate Purple Martins. In short, a lot of assembly required, no helpful YouTube videos and not really properly engineered for the bird, it just looks good. I am returning mine and spending more  after more research.	-1
Not as bad as the pole they sell for this bird house, but I would also avoid the bird house.  Its not hard to put together, but the directions are really poor which causes extra time and delay.  The plastic little sticks they provide for the birds to perch are not designed well to work with the aluminum floor - you end up bending the aluminum to get them to go in, and then the perch won't stay in place.  The plastic connector for the pole is also a poor design..  Metal screw going through plastic to hook too a metal pipe....the screw strips out the plastic	-1
The valve was working ok for a year, and this week a crack happened in the written part of the connection PVC pipe and sent water everywhere. I have it installed to control the water of the jacuzzi in an apartment building, and my neighbors got their apartment flooded big time. I'm still working on the damage cost, but I already have over $5000 in bill to pay because of the damage. Next time I will buy a honeywell metal valve.	-1
This item comes completely disassembled.  There are 60 or so parts and maybe 100 or more screws and bolts. The edges of the parts are very sharp - I cut my hands more than once. The directions are poor and hard to follow. The time required to get it assembled is excessive. If I had known I would not have gotten the thing. In the end it looked O.K. but the light material makes me think that it may not last very long. If I had known I would not have bought it. The Ad doesn't mention assembly,	-1
You get what you pay for.  I was trying to do a martin house as inexpensively as possible when I should have been more concerned about quality.  It took hours to put together!  This bird house is made of cheap, thin metal that has very sharp edges.  Fingers get sliced very easily trying to put it together with the overwhelming amount of parts.  On top of that, it's so lightweight that a strong wind blew the top section off the bottom section, and the plugs blew out of it.  Had anyone been outside in the vicinity when it happened, they'd have been seriously injured.  It's a good thing there weren't martins nesting in it!  Obviously it's too late for me to return it since I've had it for several months.  Instead, it's going into the trash.  Don't waste your money!	-1
I bought one of these houses five years ago. I have built and bought martin house for over forty years and this one is the worst one I have ever tried to use. First the perches keep falling off. I had to tap the plastic and put a washer and screw on each post before they would stay on. The clean out bottoms will fall open for no reason. I installed the pole head pipe in concrete and the pole worked pretty good for a couple of years. I removed it every season and made a cover for the head pipe opening. The third year it was all I could do to to get the first pole into the ground mount. At the end of the season, I had to use a pipe wrench and a piece of pipe to try to get the lower pipe out of the ground by pulling up as I walked around in circles. It would not come out. So now I have the first section of pole sticking up in my yard all year. I had to rivet the bottom clean out section just to keep it together. The plastic piece that holds each section up in place broke and now the house is unusable without those 2 special pieces. There was always gaps between the sections when it was on the pole. I think that is enough to change your mind.	-1
To me this is a mediocre axe.  Not very heavy, not very sharp, not very balanced, not all that easy to use.  A sort of weak compromise among various qualities you want in an axe.  It may be good for camping, but for general purposes, I can't recommend it.	-1
For me, it didn't do much.  I have very rocky clay that I call "soil" and the auger didn't make a dent in it.  Could be there's some trick to it that I didn't try, but I twisted, pushed, pulled, and swore prolifically so I don't know what else I could have done.  If it had dug in, I'm not sure how I would have gotten the dirt out.  It looks like the dirt would fall out of the sides and bottom.	-1
Craped out after a year the tank is strong but the plastics pump is very dangerous I put a gallon of demon pesticide in it and started to pump it up to gain pressure all the poison came fusing out of the top the spray tip is not to be used for pesticides or indoor use only for outdoor use it leaks it has a metal Handel and wand but no fine mist this was a bad mistake.	-1
Does not work indoors.  Hanging for two weeks one fly.	-1
Been hanging up almost 3 weeks and it hasn't caught one darn fly. If I could  give it a zero, thats what I would rate it..	-1
Not worth the paper its stuck too. didn't catch on fly.	-1
I'm laughing so hard. Why would Amazon.com even list this item since no one likes it.	-1
Total waste of money even hanging it Directly over a fly rea	-1
Please do not waste your money. This Fly trap is absolutely useless. I bought two of  this product for the kitchen, we always BBQ and go in and out by the Pool and fly's get in the House. We have started to make jokes about his product not ONE Fly so far has gone on both of them since i hang it up 2 weeks ago :) Terrible Product!	-1
I have 2 full size Chapin pump sprayers that perform very well.  Bought the little hand pump, it performed well, so I bought 3 more to have one for each type of product I use.  None of the 3 worked - the first one still does.  The defective ones hold pressure and spray effectively for about 30 seconds and then just dribble.  No adjustment I made was effective.	-1
I wish I'd read the reviews before making this purchase. It's basically a cardsotck box that is sticky all over the OUTSIDE. Those pink-ish things that look like entrances "into" the trap? They're just pictures. There *is no* inside of the trap. All the flies will be stuck to the OUTSIDE. It's basically fly paper, just horribly, horribly HORRIBLY overpriced.  Do yourself a favor and just get fly paper or fly strips. Same yuck factor, but much cheaper.	-1
Worst product I have gotten in long time. Would rate it as no star if I could.  Simply did not catch a single fly or bug of any sort.  Went to the hardware store and bought the old-fashioned spiral fly paper which was very effective.  Had an unuasual influx of flys in the house this fall and needed to do something.	-1
Tiring	-1
This is nothing more than a cardboard box with a little dry adhesive on the outside. It does nothing to attract flies and the adhesive is not gluey enough to trap them if they do happen to land on it. Save your money.	-1
parts bag was open.. missing parts	-1
After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to receive and use the sprayer.  I took it out to my apple tree, pumped it 10-20 times and went to spray only to find it sprayed for less than 2 seconds-no pressure.  I kept going around the tree with the same results keeping the pumping going more and more.  I read where it might take a drop of oil in the plunger so I tried that with no better results.  I did not over fill the base-it just is not getting any pressure with the pumps.  If any of your have suggestions, I am open.	-1
Not for any chemical spraying.	-1
The Cherry Valley Coach Lamp Bird Feeder looks nice in the picture but in person its not as nice, and it has a really, really bad design in my opinion. The one I received was actually broken (the plastic top part of the hopper was broken, while this did not really affect the integrity or functionality of the feeder, it just proves its not very durable plastic and not likely to withstand our seasonal extremes of hot and cold here in NJ).  The Cherry Valley Coach Lamp Bird Feeder ships in multiple pieces. You have to assemble the hopper/ feeder with a long rod that screws the top and the bottom of the hopper to the feeder to keep it in place (I already trashed the feeder, so I do not know the length of the rod but I want to say it is about 10-12 inches long). I ordered a preowned one and the screw did not fit end to end, well, it did but it made the part that you twist open to put the seed in a little too snug, actually it was so snug that I could barely twist it to open it and fill it.  The stake attaches to the feeder once you are done with assembling the feeder itself. Overall it is about 6 feet in length, and the stake is not one solid stake like a Shepard hook is, its actually 4 hollow metal sections. You have to use a rubber mallet to connect each section from end to end and then place the feeder on the top of the stake. You have to sink it down into the ground at least 8" according to the instructions so the feeder stands a little over 5 feet above ground. The stake is single pronged and not double pronged for those who are wondering.  Overall it is a nice looking feeder and looks like it would hold A LOT of seed. I am glad I purchased a preowned one, although its been thrown away since Amazon was nice enough to issue a refund for the damaged feeder, after seeing what it looks like, and learning its assembly, I can't say I wish to reorder this particular feeder. Definitely not worth $30+ in my opinion. Considering it is cheap plastic that broke in transit, I don't think this feeder would last very long due to its clear lack of durability. Plus we get a lot of squirrels who love to invade feeders, I doubt this feeder would survive their daily invasions!	-1
Skims over grass and Weeds alike. Does not cut. Going to get a custom blade in the spring.	-1
I purchased this timer less than 2 years ago and I am already shopping for a replacement. I do not know what part of the mechanism broke. I do know however that the battery compartment constantly let water in, including when I tried to insulate it with additional layer of silicone. This would kill the 9v battery and the device would go out of commission. I would only notice when the plants started to look half-dead. Overall, it is a garbage product. If I could, I would replace it with another product.	-1
I have bought both the Raindrip dual-station and the single-station timers, and all have quickly failed.  Inside, a motor-driven gear assembly opens and closes the water valve, and the gear shafts break.  So, it becomes a throw-away!  My collection lies in a heap in my garden shed.  I'm going to send them all back to Raindrip!  And please do not confuse this RAINDRIP product name from another, called RAINBIRD, which is a completely different company.	-1
This is extremely hard to separate and is not very well constructed!  Don't waste your money. Had to purchase a different connector that would separate more easily.	-1
Not impressed at all. You can't unplug the end while the valve is open because there isn't enough clearance. Even when you close the valve it's SO hard to unplug because it's tight.  The mechanism just doesn't work.  Had purchased ones by Melnor before at the store and they were much better but I can't find the ones with the on/off valve built in.  Also, Amazon the seller wouldn't allow a return on this product.  No clue why.	-1
No i understand why the Gardena products are so expensive. They work. These do not. A lot of the Gilmore nozzles have a restricted handle too.	-1
Does not work smoothly.  Takes two men and a boy to connect and disconnect.	-1
I had to request a refund for these and the extra male connectors I had purchased.  I had problems with the male connector pulling out when I barely was moving the hose.  I also had some leakage problems. I must say, though, I received a refund with no problems.	-1
Defective manufacture. I bought 3 of these and none of the three would connect and hold the male adapter. I've never had much luck with Gilmour products, but this one might the worst yet.	-1
I took them out of the box and put the small part into the large quick connector and you CANNOT get them apart again.  I tried and tried and no way can I do it.  The part on the large piece that's supposed to slide down to allow you to remove the smaller part will not slide down.  And yes I did turn the shutoff sideways to give me more room and still no good.  This is not the first set of Gilmour connectors I have owned.  Several years ago I bought a bunch of these at Lowe's, the green and black ones though, same as these except the color is different.  And they worked fine, but as they got older they became very hard to disconnect.  So I figured maybe dirt or whatever got inside and was making it harder to undo them and why I thought buying new ones would work better.  Boy was I wrong, these new ones I got are worse then my old ones to disconnect.  I just did a return on these two and had to leave the ones I connected still together cause it was impossible to undo them.	-1
I've several sets of these that I purchased both on Amazon and at a local hardware store. This batch will not connect either to each other or to the older sets. So I went to the hardware store and bought the exact same product and these work reasonably well. Though it is obvious that Gilmour has gone to a lower quality supplier.	-1
Just ok. The black wrap arrived cracked. fittings started to leak	-1
Too stiff, nearly destroys any plant it falls on!	-1
Not "Industrial Duty" kinks very easily and not as stiff as one would expect.  Kinkguard sleeve broke after first use.  Started leaking after one year from the hose end.  Only Pro is it works well with hot water.	-1
Not a great quality. Stress reliever was broken. ends do not appear to be crimped correctly.	-1
I used this sprayer for weeds. It has only been used 10 times and I have to throw it away. The valve broke after 4 uses and was replaced by the manufacturer. Now, the pump is broken rendering the unit unusable. It is really a piece of junk - not well constructed. I had to purchase two hose clamps early in it's life to keep the hose on during use. The manufacturer did not even think of suppling these hose clamps. We have a Chapin sprayer used for many years. We will replace this one with another Chapin.	-1
Maybe I was hoping to just replace my broken flag, but the holes didn't match up to the one in my mail box, so I have to drill new holes and plugin other holes.  I was only looking to swap something really quick and the design wasn't as good as what was on my mailbox	-1
Pros: Hot water went through it ok Did not leak at spigot  Cons: Not very solid Kinks easily  I'd seriously like to send it back.	-1
I find it  extremely annoying that some guy thought it wise to slam a giant staple in the end of this otherwise beautiful shovel handle. This means the consumer  paying for the shovel handle must fight to remove the staple and then sand down the burs created by  prying the metal loose that was shot into the fiberglass.  The staple must be removed or it will surely interfere with the  intended use of this product. I have purchased many products from Amazon over the years and none of them arrived damaged in this way. If the  manufacturer or other handlers are intent on continuing this practice, then in all fairness, the handle should be displayed at the Amazon website with the giant staple stuck in the  top of it for accuracy as the staple becomes part of the handle and removing it renders the handle damaged goods.	-1
Used it twice and it doesn't work very well. We have matted grass/weeds and it didn't get more than 2-3" down with lots of pressure. Our post-hole digger works MUCH better than this! I'll probably give it another shot, but am not happy with it at this point.	-1
Worked excellent at first.  Than within a very short time (couple of weeks) the small fastener that holds the two ends together broke.  Became useless after that.  Been sitting in my garage ever since!	-1
Standard two-handled post hole diggers work much better and faster.	-1
Not very effective going through small roots.	-1
needs a motor.	-1
The one you show is brass, I got a galvanized one, not the same quality. Will not order again and you need to change your pic a false representation.	-1
returned	-1
Broken spring, returned the item.	-1
Useless and disappointing! The spring breaks after one week of use. On all 3 one I bought.	-1
I am very disappointed with this. The metal pin that is supposed to hit the bottom two clips to change direction often gets stuck. It hits the clips "too softly" I guess and it just sits there, if you force it with your finger it will switch again.  The result is that often the sprinkler gets stuck in a constant position. Essentially, not useful.	-1
I bought three of these and one of them has seized already after just 2 months of use.	-1
Very bad sprinkler head. Would not rotate no matter what.	-1
I thought this would be a great sprinkler based on the reviews and the Rain Bird reputation, but mine is a dud.  It gets stuck in one spot causing a flood and will not rotate the opposite way.  I read on another review that the position of the stops matters and I've tried switching them so that the top stop is on one side and the bottom the other, and vice-versa, but that did not resolve the problem. I might try some light grease on the stem but if that doesn't resolve then I'm out $15.  I'm using this sprinkler on the Orbit sprinkler base (#58030) and there is plenty of water pressure.  Similar Orbit impact heads I bought do not have the problem I'm having with the Rain Bird. I'm disappointed as I was hoping this would be a great product.	-1
I was disconnected four times today.  I bought this sprinkler head and worked for two hours trying to get it to work.  then I discovered it was missing a trip pin, part 105720, (a tiny cotter pin).  I cannot order it on Rainbirds website, nor will they pick up the phone.  I have spent 4 hours now on one product, trying to get it work, looking up the problem and trying to connect with Rainbird.  Pretty outrageious really.	-1
It just does not perform as good as older heads.  Too many places where water pools instead of being more finely broadcast.	-1
I run a bunch of Orbit's 1/2 & 3/4" sprinklers on a ditch pump. The 3/4 size is great but I've had nothing but headaches with the 1/2 size. They frequently hang up and won't turn, even with a clear nozzle and strong pressure. So far I haven't found a fix.	-1
Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers. I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years. Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately, any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs. I've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers.	-1

I equipped my entire, three-zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers. They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.  Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.	-1
Don't believe this product was made to last more than one season! I've had several of these and they don't seem to last for more than one summer.  The root feeder, or metal portion that gets inserted into the ground naturally rusts quickly, and begins to soften. So taking it out and moving it say around to the other side of the tree, and it will bend very easily.  At the end is 5 holes, 4 outward, (such as north, south, east, & west), and one straight downward. Once you get past the soft top layer of soil, chances are as you go deeper you will hit clay, or harder soil.  Not is it only hard to push into the soil, but most of the time the holes will clog with clay or mud. So what I've had to do was turn the water on full, then push it down a few inches at a time until you get it all the way in.  Then pull it back out and most of the time clean out the holes with a twig or something, then reinsert it, (trying to find the original hole, which is all mud now).  Pulling it out, is no easy task either! Best have a strong back...  The one I have now was purchased last summer, and it's not looking like I'm going to be able to use it this summer. Water is leaking through several holes in the cheap plastic handle.  I would not recommend it!	-1
I purchased this item to seal my stamped concrete. Half way through the job the plunger leaked. I checked the seal, cleaned the bottom of the plunger and can. I couldn't get it to not to leak air when pressurized. I thought buying this brand was the right choice it was not. The result was after trying to fix the unit now the material clogged the made the unit useless. It is now in the garbage can. Disappointed to say the least.	-1
Had the more expensive "HD" version for a few years until the plastic hose coupling wore and it leaked a lot. This economy model is a POS. No hose coupling so you have to turn the entire device to fasten the hose. There's a plastic on/off lever that stuck in the open position after a few uses. Very little water flow--tried to clean out the holes by tapping the end on the ground as I did with the other one, but still not working. Tried to do the right thing by contacting the company first because of their "one year limited warranty," but never heard back. Don't do it.	-1
Too restrictive of water pressure. I have an older one that works fine.	-1
If the handles were actually adjustable, I would be using it as a primary snath. Loosening the handles took so much pressure from the vise grips that the handles both have ugly dents and scrapes on them. Yes, I used padding to try and protect the wood from the tools. I adjusted the handles and tightened them, and the lower handle was set to go. But the upper handle just won't stay tight enough to stay put. I have the heavy brush blade on it now, and only use it for short periods - using the lower handle and an improvised grip of the upper snatch shaft. The upper handle just flops around out of the way.	-1
received it yesterday, used it for a few hours today and it is already broken - water leaking from the handles - no water flowing down the irrigation tubing, the holes are clear at the bottom. VERY annoyed.....	-1
very poor quality	-1
Difficult to get the food through the holes in the bottom of the feeder.  Plastic hose and handle cracked inside, cant fix.  We were very disappointed.  Trying to find a better way to feed our fruit trees.	-1
Very weak stacks. Will never buy again	-1
Most broke as I pushed them in, got a splinter too.	-1
I am probably among the last to applaud the benefits of this product. It flows water and/or fertilizer to the roots and is especially beneficial when I see a tree or shrub wilting from the heat. I have one that is probably 20 years old. The water flow is very strong. Since I now have a half acre lot, I thought I would order another. The current version pales by comparison. It is shorter length and the water flow is weak. Materials are poorer as well.	-1
These are very weak and broke while trying to hold up my plants. Also has green dye that comes of on your hands! Wont be using them.	-1
I first purchased a Ross Root feeder back in 2000 or so.  I still have my original purchase - and I am still using it.  Since I have a lot of trees in the yard, I purchased a second unit a few years ago and both my wife and I would take a set of trees and deep root feed them.  After the second unit broke, we purchased what we thought was an identical unit.  The name has changed with the new HD title, but the unit looked the same in the pictures.  Wrong.  This latest unit has very low water flow, so the fertilizer does not dissolve.  And I am always having to unclog the holes where the water comes out.  I just hate the changes that Ross has made to the design over the last 10 years.  I understand that materials change and costs must come down, but the usefulness of the end product should not be compromised and it has been compromised greatly.  Now, I am going to continue to use this one, but when it breaks, I will probably just buy another brand next time.	-1
the color bleeds in a day or two.	-1
These are thin and breakable, also the paint comes off on your hands and is hard to get off. You get what you pay for, spend a bit more.	-1
I looked for a root feeder for several weeks and this one that I bought on Amazon is the best!  Both in structure and price.  Easy to use and has saved my trees during the horrible drought we are having in Texas.  It is sturdy and well made and I believe it will last for a long time.  BUT I was wrong!  It soon developed leaks and now it spurts from just about everywhere when I use it.  Very disappointed with that it did NOT hold up well.	-1
I actually like this product and would have given it five stars but mine has broken after only a few times of use. It's also out of warranty as I bought it early last year. I have a possible solution that might prevent his from happening to others.  When this product worked for me it worked VERY well. It put fertilizer right where I needed it and this year my wife's roses look great.  The weakest part of this unit is where the garden hose connects. I am a stickler for making sure the connections are not cross threaded and I had this one on tight when all at once the hose just popped out of the connector. I put it back on making sure that it was tight but not overtightened. Again the hose popped out. When I attempted to reattach the hose the third time the connector would not accept the hose fittings. It cannot be used at all now.  I think part of what caused my problem was me carrying the unit around with the garden hose attached. Be sure and disconnect the hose after use.  If I were to purchase another I will attach a garden hose shut-off valve on it. That way I will not ruin the threads on the unit by constantly attaching and removing a garden hose from the unit itself I would be attaching it to the shut off valve instead.  If you are tempted to carry the unit around anyway with a garden hose attached I might have a solution for that too. I'd attach shut-off valve to the unit and reinforce it with duct tape. Maybe even wrap the tape around a couple of wooden dowels. It certainly will not look pretty but if it saves the unit from breaking it might be worth trying.	-1
As stated you only get one lure. The traps come with ONE DUAL lure for male and female beetles. This 'refill' gets you one single lure not a dual lure.	-1
I bought it for the narrow rectangle setting and the spray was very uneven. I have used a couple of others of this design and this is worse than one and no better than the other.	-1
Maybe I missed the memo but the range for this is very small.  If I only had a small garden - great.  But I have a good size lawn.  Lots of options for shape of water spouting but still a very small range.	-1
Had to get a refund because the larges pattern should spray 30' by 30' and mine sprayed less than 5' by 5'.  I noticed that other reviews that have a low star rating are saying the same thing.	-1
you'll need a lot of water pressure to get this to spray... ours is low and the pattern was about 4 ft wide... lol... really...	-1
Well made for a plastic spray but spray patterns too wide.  Gets the gardener wet no matter what.	-1
After installing the watering system, I turned-on the water, and it did not take more than two times to break. The replacement is still working fine. I was like to buy some extra pieces for something like that....!	-1
It did not fit the trimmer I bought it for.  I would like a more complete description of sizes you can use it for.	-1
Oh how I want to write a good review but I have owned like 5 of these already.  Forget year to year it's more like 2 per season.  The air chamber on top tends to either come with or quickly develop tiny holes.  SInce it is that which keeps the pool up, once the baloon thing goes the pool is useless.  Hours with soap trying to see where the bubbles are coming from, patching, starting over... then you have other issues.. if you aren't near it when it is filling it could fill lopsided, if that happens you may end up with the filtration portion not submersed at which point you have to start over.  Should you have to start over oy vey, the hole to remove the watter takes a whole day but worse than that it's a couple inches off the ground so when it's done draining you are still left with a bunch of water in there... do you spill it out? yeah if you are Hercules, I can't, so you grab a basin and dump until you can turn the whole thing over, by which time it stinks to high H and it's riffled with mosquitoes... oh and the water treatment is as bad as a real pool, cholorine check, algae treatment, who can be bothered, you just keep emptying the darned thing.  also, the thirty day warranty is an option, sure, but once you have filled that sucker with water how on earth are you EVER going to fold it back neatly enough to return it? You aren't.  If you bought local you can drag it to the store while the kids moan the whole way but on Amazon it's a whole new story which is why i just kept buying new ones twice a year. This year however  I was SUPER LUCKY that this last one came with the same issue and had to go back literally within a day or so of me using it and the CSR took pity on me and didn't make me return the old one, I just dragged it to the trash.  So... you may ask, why the heck do you keep buying them...? Because I always keep thinking I have mastered a new way of making it work and withing the pool context it is still very affordable...	-1
This did not come with the liner or blanket for under the pool. Amazon told me to box this back up and send it back (it was Prime) but how to fold this huge pool back up and cram into the small box? Impossible! Had to go buy tarps and blanket myself, cost me over $50! Amazon said they would credit me back $26 but I've yet to receive a confirmation or an email confirming this. When I contacted them online, Amazon said they would get back to me within 10 days, day 8 still no reply. Pool and pump seem to be okay, but take your time leveling your spot, it's not easy to get level at all.	-1
If you purchase an INTEX Easy Set pool, and you live in a region that requires you to take the pool down for the winter, you should understand that you are essentially purchasing a $100 disposable pool.  The pool will not make it through the winter stored in the garage without cracking.  We purchased an Easy Set pool in July, 2009, took it down in September, 2009, and then tried to set it up again in May, 2010.  The morning after we set up the pool, we discovered that the inflatable ring that keeps the pool from spilling out had gone completely flat because it was riddled with little pin-prick sized holes.  After spending two-weeks trying to indentify and patch all of the little holes (I stopped after patching 8 of them), I finally emptied the pool and threw it in the garbage in disgust.  The Easy Set pools only carry a 90-day warranty, which I learned only after calling INTEX customer service.  (Nowhere could I find warranty information in the materials that came with the pool.)  Not only was INTEX unwilling to send me a new pool, they wouldn't even send me a coupon for a discount on another pool.  Now I have to decide if I want to spend another $100 on a disposable pool, or if I should just take my daughter to the lake.  It seems like such a waste to have to throw these things in a landfill just because of a "few" little holes.	-1
I have less than a 1/3 acre lot, so I figured this should be adequate since the box says for up to 1/2 acre.  The goods:  well built, string feed seems to work well.  No need for power cord, gas.  No battery memory (claimed)  Quiet, no exhaust.  The bad:  I'm 6 feet tall and find the handling real ackward.  The battery last less than 15 min on a full charge.  I do light trimming and edging and I find that I can only do 1/3 of my 9000 square feet lawn with each charge.  A two hour recharge bought me another 5-7 minutes.  The narrow 12" cutting path exacerbates the problem since sometimes I have to make 2 passes to finish the job.  There is not enough power to cut tall (6" or more) grass.  I returned mine and bought a gas powered, which I'm much happier with.  If you live in an arid area where grass never gets real tall, and your lot is very small, this may be perfect.  The reason for 1 star is that it is not appropriate for lot size anywhere near 1/2 acre as stated right on the box.	-1
The yearly ritual around our house for the backyard garden is to trim and weed out the overgrowth that magically appears every springtime. We have had gardeners do the job, but this was not looking looking too good since it was costing quite a bit when we totalled the yearly maintainance fees. I wanted a weeder/trimmer that was non-gasoline powered and cordless too. I saw the B&D Grass Hog and bought one, in hopes that this would save us some money. The set-up of the unit is easy. A few screws, charge up the battery, (it will take overnight) and you are good to go. The first thing that you will notice is that it is pretty heavy for a trimmer/weed whacker. This is due to the heavy lead-acid battery that is perched at the top of the unit. The second thing that is noticed is it's power. I was able to whack and trim the heaviest grasses and weeds. The big problem is the extremely short usage time per charge. I was only able to use the Grass Hog continuously for only about 12 to 15 minutes before it ran down and stopped working. This is not acceptable. In fact, it is a down right failure for usefulness as far as a garden tool. I cannot perceive why Black and Decker would even market and sell this item because the effective run time is so low. I am returning this unit. In the meanwhile, I have discovered that other cordless trimmers last up to 40 minutes for about the same price as the Black and Decker. If this was a final exam for the cordless Grass Hog, it would receive a grade of D.	-1
Have sane problem as others...got for my son who lives next door.  He was using for the third time when it started smoking and just quit.  Of course I did not get the extended warranty and it is just less then 14 months old.	-1
I have never needed an edge before. The wife and I purchase a new home and I noticed another lawn down the street whose driveway and walkway was edged. I liked it. I have own this home for 11 months and in the south you cut your grass on Christmas.  I noticed the grass was really creeping on to my concrete and looked horrible. I tried cutting is back with the trimmer no luck. This lays the ground work. my concrete edges have not been touched in years. I purchased this and went to work really digging in a edging my whole property and the edger was powerful enough to chop thru the grass and dirt. ( no rocks) and made my property  look well maintained. Now once done should be no issues keep up the beauty. ********NEW UPDATE.... MOTOR HAS LOST LOTS OF POWER AND MAKES  NOISE AND SMELLS.... CONTACTING BLACK AND DECKER DUE TO OUT OF 30 DAYS.  OH BOY THIS SHOULD BE FUN.	-1
Ineffective. Have to go over the same areas 3-4 times to get it to look right. The handle, though secured as instructed, is not stable at all and turns about. Needs a power switch rather than a trigger to power it-- I have arthritis and carpal tunnel and was in severe pain for 3 days following use. It's better than nothing I guess.., but should just spend a little more and get something with better quality. Its handling is comparable to pushing a toy truck with a broom handle. Kind of a pain in the a**.  Will be returning this after just one use.	-1
Very disappointed in the low voltage and will not cut through heavy grass as my older 6 volt will. The 3.6 volt will stall out so i just use half the width of shear and then I'll switch to a pair just plain old scissors to get the job completed.	-1
OK for piddlers.  This would be hard to use for weak-handed people or those who want some production.  Not a good choice.	-1
This tool does not have the cutting power to do the job.  It is a good tool to trim the grass edges, or thin plant leaves.  But it absolutely will not cut dead flower stems.  I regret having invested in this product.  I will purchase a larger corded model.	-1
The bad news is that these shears are tremendously underpowered. If what you're trying to cut has any thickness (in terms of many blades of grass, not thick stems ... tho that would be bad too), you'll struggle and struggle with this gadget to make any progress at all.  The blades are not incredibly sharp, so you'll be going over each area in multiple passes to get everything.  The power button, a two stage affair if you are using the optional long handle, is difficult to engage, and the slightest slip and it is back off again.  The good news is that the charge doesn't last long on the battery, so you won't be suffering and cursing this thing for very long in each session.  Avoid this and just get a good string trimmer.	-1
not easy to use and very poor for trim edge	-1
Blade can't sink deep enough to make proper line	-1
I had one of these.  It is essentially a skill saw with a long handle.  If your grass is even or slightly below the sidewalk/driveway than this kinda works ok.  Grass cannot be damp!  dirt chunks up within the guard and you will need to clean it out repeatedly.  my grass was slightly higher to some places two inches higher than my sidewalk and this machine was overwhelmed.  rpm dropped off and it got hot from trying to cut.  i paid $20 for mine at a pawn shop.  it was in great condition when i bought it.  i supposed the previous owner had the same experience and tried to get a few bucks out of it and pawned it.  i gave mine away.  i definitely would not recommend this one.  if you know someone who has one or maybe you can rent one to give it a "test drive" before you take the plunge.  i was given a 3 hp briggs/stratton and it breezes through the job.  however, i would recommend a stihl or a troy edger because quality is good and its light weight and agile compared to my big edger and very capable of any job as well.  maintain it and it will last many years.	-1
Rest In Peace L3750 Edge Hog.  Ordered June 21, 2014, Died May 13, 2016 from burn out, smoked motor. Services/Autopsy held in back shed. This is the LAST P.O.S. Black and Decker equipment I buy.  Brand used to be good.  3rd defective tool.  Edited to add:  Home use only;  About 500 linear feet about 6 times	-1
never used an edger before and this one is fairly easy to work with after a few minutes but the cord as well as the balance were ALWAYS issues to deal with and will take some getting used to.  alignment is easy, it's light weight, quiet and price is OK.  would i buy it again = NO  would spend more $$$ for a gas powered unit...	-1
it was good	-1
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you a tale.  It is the tale of the green, Black and Decker 1.5HP electric edger, circa 1994.  I get a little misty-eyed just thinking about it.  Oh, the times we had, merrily edging our way through the glorious summers, manicuring our lawn with edging so sharp I feared someone would cut their tire on it.  Yes, you were under-powered, but I knew you were just right for me.  What a team we were.  So when you irreparably broke this summer after a triumphant life of service, I brushed back a tear and went seeking your replacement.  Certainly, through the power and wonder of Chinese manufacturing and modern engineering, I should be able to acquire a simple, better-powered electric edger in the neighborhood of $40.  Forward!  But imagine my shock and dismay when I discovered there really is no such thing as a simple "electric edger" anymore.  Nope.  They have to be combination edger/trenchers!  And heavy!  And expensive!  $100+!!!  But you will love it!  It will do everything for everyone!  And now? Now my simple wonderful edger has been replaced by this behemoth, over-priced, complex creation that is miserable to use when edging.  Oh, it will edge a straight line in a passable fashion.  But the minute you need to navigate curves and sloping curbs with this albatross...well.  You too may mourn the loss of your old comrade.  Is it a good trencher?  Who the hell knows?  I wanted an edger and I paid $100+ for one that is not half as good as the one I bought 20 years ago.	-1
With a corner lot and a lot of sidewalks I put this thing through some heavy duty edging.  I have also used the trenching feature to make a deep line for a new landscaping to then insert a spade and dig the trench.  Also used it to dig a trench to lay some wire for the electric fence on my garden.  It worked fine for that.  So I am a heavy user.  Unfortunately it stopped working after 20 months and so being the engineer I took it apart to try to fix (voiding warranty). Found the plugs/leads to the motor brushes were burned off.  Re-soldered them back on.  The contacts are probably burning off because when I jam it into a deep batch of grass (which is a lot of the time) it causes the motor to have to work harder and the amps on the motor to spike.  After fixing the unit it worked another couple of times and now burned out again. Contacted Black and Decker and they still replaced my edger under warranty which was super nice - because I really count on this product a lot in my yard care.  Edit Aug 2015 they sent a new one.  Edit April 2016 - new replacement burned up.  Electrical smell. Such a waste.  The motor contacts are the weak link and are simply unable to handle the full load amps and burn up.	-1
Not amazing, in the end, with overgrown edges, I resorted to a $6 buck bros. saw and just cut along the sidewalk edge.  The B&D Unit couldn't cut through, kicked up a cloud of dust & grit and you had to pass over the area to be cut multiple times just to perforate (and not even cut through).  Maybe around a well maintained edge, this would keep the edge maintained, but there is no way it will cut in a new edge on an overgrown surface.  Not sure if I'll be keeping it - I'll give it one more try on the newly hand sawn edge and see if it works for maintenance.  But if you have overgrown edges along sidewalk, path, the hand saw was quick, efficient, left a clean edge and didn't over me, the operator, in a cloud of dust and grit.	-1
First one broke on first use. Returned it.  I pay someone to edge my yard with a gas mower at the start of the year and then keep up with this one. Not very confident in it's power. Honestly, don't waste your money, buy something better.	-1
I could do better with a putty knofe, doesnt cut down far enough to be effective	-1
Machine does not cut trench as it should.  Buy a gas model instead for portability and the power to do the job correctly.	-1
Received the item, put it together and it didn't work.  Changed outlets, power cords and it still didn't work.  The package looked like someone tossed it off a 3 story building.  Attempting to return it no reply yet.	-1
Wish I had never purchased this as I usually love all of black and Decker products,doesnt edge my heavy St Augustine grass back to a gas edger	-1
I am very disappointing in what seems to be otherwise a nice product. I have not read any other reviews of others having the same problem, so perhaps my experience was an anomaly.  Well, I am off to talk to customer service.....  Update: Well, of course, Black & Decker customer service only operates Monday - Friday 9-5!  When do they think people use their products?  Anyway, I found a helpful internet article that told me how to tighten the loose blade (just in case any of my fellow amazoners have this same problem).  You need a 9/16 inch wrench, and a 1 inch wrench (very large, glad I had one!). You put the 1 inch wrench on the outside washer, and that allows you to tighten the nut with the 9/16 inch wrench.  You tighten it clockwise, the same direction that the blade turns.  Happy trimming!	-1
This edger probably works find for light work in sandy soils. It does not work if you have an edge that has never been edged before in clay soil with tough sod. Mine overheated and the motor burnt out. The handle is cheap molded plastic that is held on to the metal (amazing there is a metal part on this) shaft by a screw. Not a bolt, not a sturdier arrangement that can be tightened. The handle, powerhead, and shaft all wobble in relation to each other. The housing is cheap plastic. The blade is not sharp and showed considerable abrasion and wear after just a few  of minutes of use. This product is like everything else Black and Decker has made in the last decade or so...junk.	-1
I bought this to replace my older B&D edger that lasted me 14 years!  There is NO comparison of the new edger to my older edger in terms of build quality, ease of use, and ability to cut through grass and dirt when edging.  The new edger bogs down and runs out of power, and the quality of cut is worse than the old one.  In addition, ergonomics really suck on the new edger, given the cheap wheel and limited space between the blade guard and blade itself. My old edger would edge through thick, moist grass and dirt (such as would be expected a day after rain, for example).  The new one clogs up and strains to get the job done.  What a piece of garbage!  Unfortunately, this is endemic in most products sold in America these days.  Companies have greatly cheapened products, and manufacture them cheaply NOT to last long (planned obsolescence). Talk about 'the fleecing of America' when it comes to the consumer.  It's all around us now, and arguably getting worse!  I'll be returning this for a refund first thing tomorrow.	-1
Ryobi is cheap, so you get what you pay for.  Why doesn't somebody make one of these with a material that will last?	-1
These blades wear down with the slightest rubbing on concrete.  Very difficult to do much edging if there's any concrete involved, and when is there not?	-1
After receiving this product, which had chipped paint, I noticed something worse than the lack the proper mounting hole pattern (look carefully at the picture, it shows an OEM blade, not THIS blade, which only has a square hole).  So what's worse than a blade that isn't even what's pictured?  One that is completely dull.  For the $16 shipped cost, I would still have had to go get it sharpened for another $15.  Instead I spent $19 at Sears (yes, I had to go into the store) and get a real OEM blade.  Which, BTW, is sharp AND has the proper mounting pattern.  Seriously, if you're trying to save a buck, just take your blade off after your next mowing and go get it sharpened.	-1
Not wound correctly. Had to rewind it on one side.	-1
This has died a little over 1.5 months. I'm so disgusted. I spent hours trying to figure it out. I'm leaving on vacation and suppose to leave my pet sitter, not to mention my pets with all the fing bugs!!! The bulb I also bought to go in my other one doesn't work so both machines are bad. And the warranty. I suppose it will take them a month by the time I send this to them. More than likely they will want me to pay shipping. I noticed black and Deckers machine is cheaper and the bulb is 1/2 the price.	-1
it is very hard to bush and it dose not cut all the grass	-1
What I received is NOT what is pictured or described in the listing. Do not purchase this if you're expecting a genuine Ryobi blade like what is pictured.  I received a scratched up grey OEM blade that was not in any kind of retail packaging. It is stamped/embossed with "375 301" which per search on the internet is a STENS edger blade.  **Update 8/2015 - After this blade wore out, I ordered a 4 pack of edger blades instead at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UBG88S?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00  It turns out the 4 pack blades were the EXACT same blade that I paid 10 bucks for here.  So you can either order 1 blade for 10 bucks here, or go order the 4 pack and get 4 times the number of blades for the same price...  See attached photo, the worn out blade is what I ordered here "Ryobi Trimmer Plus Add-On Edger Replacement Blade 613223 (Discontinued by Manufacturer)" and the new blade is one of the ones that came with "4 Pack, Edger Blades Replace Ryobi 613223, Echo 720-237-001, Stihl 4133-713-4101, Maruyama 216062. Green Machine 237001"  Hope this saves someone from getting ripped off like I did with this item!!	-1
It doesn't fit Toro weed eaters.	-1
Does not work on my equipment	-1
This thing sucks. I have go over the same spot at least three times. Even when I first bought the mower it was not a one pass mower. I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants to mow their yard. Its good for exercise in that you'll be pushing it around much longer than you should. It also gets stuck on any little twig. Doesn't matter how small. If there is a twig in your yard somewhere you will know about it.	-1
Worked great for 9 months then it went to the black out mode.  The last one I had lasted for over 7 years.  Very dissatisfied.	-1
This string does not automatically spill out of the spool when the line is cut back, but they advertise it does.	-1
Damaged. Missing parts. I have no idea how well it does or doesn't work because the mower I received is unusable.	-1
Hole in center is not correct, cheap item...I would NOT Recomend....Item must be seconds quality from the dealer, as nothing was correct to the machine!	-1
In doing research after my purchase, I have learned these just kill beneficial flying insects, and do very little to attract the mosquito. I won't be using it.	-1
These are great except if you run it by ANYTHING sharp it will cut into the cheaply made material.  I love the Up-Spray but it is a very FRAGILE hose..... PLEASE make it into a more robust soaker so it lasts!!!	-1
I just use my edger for edging the lawn by the sidewalk and driveway. This blade does NOT edge straight. It CHOPS and MUTILATES the grass instead of leaving a smooth straight line. Having gone from a straight edge blade to this blade was a HUGE downgrade as far as the quality of the cut goes. Also, the blade is short, and I have to put the edger on the lowest setting in order to get into the dirt where some grass is below the surface. Granted maybe this works best for digging or trenching but the blade is horrible, IMO, for straight edges.  I since bought another straight (8" Rectangle) blade and even though its not made for the machine, it fits, and works 10X better. I went back and re cut the edges straight so now the lawn doesnt look like chopped salad along the edges. Do yourself a favor and get the straight blade.	-1
too heavy	-1
They work great until the hose swivel end comes off. Since there's no way to repair it, the hose is trash. Out of 6 we've bought, 2 have come apart so far. A 33% failure rate is unacceptable.	-1
This didn't fit my Echo trimmer. Seller would not refund postage so i guess i am stuck with it.	-1
This trimmer string would not fit my weed eater.	-1
Using this thing is weird, you have to try and hover the weed whipper at an unnatural angle.  The string does not last long at all and is time consuming to change frequently.  The last time I went to change the line, I noticed the Grass Gator housing had developed multiple deep cracks.  I was afraid of it flying apart and causing injury, so I threw it away.  I logged less than an hour with this item and regret that I bought it.	-1
won't bother to buy this thanks to it's HIGH number of ONE star reviews	-1
Would not push without manhandling it.....and I am not a man! My grass was already cut when I tried this, so it was not that high and should have been way easier to cut!	-1
We used it once and there's a split in the hose.  Replacement or refund is contingent on shipping it back.  C'mon, how much is THAT gonna cost us?  We'll just chalk it up to a lesson learned.	-1
Ordered just to get another spool for modification to .080" line. To modify, use a .080" screw to change one of the holes in the top of the spool.  Twist in the new .080" line.  Manually rewind the line unto the spool (not hard & it doesn't take long). Put the end of line in the slot after winding so it doesn't unwind. B&D must have had the razor blade concept so successul for Gillette in mind when they made their weed eater. As in, price the weed eater cheap, and then sell a lot of line spools. They could just as easily used .080" line to begin with, but then the line would last too long.	-1
Don't buy this! I bought three. One broke after two uses, and the second after two months. In both cases, the hose separated from the connection collar. I guess the only reason the third is still working is because I've only used it once so far. What a waste of money.	-1
Broke immediately on the first use.	-1
I would love this but I have to oil the place where the wheel and the blades connect every week or it siezes up.  Wish I would have picked another type of reel mower, not happy with this one at all.	-1
These pots are not like ones from previous years. I have a very bad back and have 240 of these pots to plant in as I can work sitting down. The pots from 2013 are much more brittle and the rims break break very easily.	-1
Bought two of these.  One broke immediately at the spot where the hose meets the fitting.  The second one I thought was ok. Did a short test. When I went to water the first time it too separated at the same spot. I am on well water and have a 2 hose divider, so the water pressure was not the issue.	-1
Bought 3 of these and one split near the connecter after second use.  Past date to return to Amazon....Best to get these at local hardware store and keep recpt.	-1
As I see with many other reviews, the hose connected to the female plug comes off rather frequently.  I only just hooked mine up today (the day after it arrived) and it blew right out.  There are two half circle metal pieces that fit into each tube and then,once folded into a full circle should fit snugly into the female hose end.  It does.  And I was able to repair it myself with no tools or glue (but time I could have used more productively elsewhere).  It still leaks a little, but it's serviceable.  Also, the brass hose connector is very shallow.  It would not fit on my male piece which was plastic.  I eventually found a different hose end that it did fit on.  I thought about contacting the company, but surely by now, with all the negative reviews surrounding this particular defect, if they were interested in either quality control or customer service, I believe I would have seen responses in the review section.  If I missed those responses, forgive me.  On the positive side:  It is truly flexible and it does a great job of sprinkling long narrow sections such as my terraced garden.	-1
Junk.  Blew a hole up by the hose end 31 days after I bought it.  It was one day past the return period.  Would not recommend.	-1
The female connector on the first one detached from the hose even before it was filled with water!  Apparently it was not glued.  Second hose just burst open and not excessive water pressure.  The third one is still working amazingly enough	-1
its working ok.......so I ordered another one.they never sent it 4 months later.......kept my money	-1
This tool makes it very easy to dig up the very deep tap roots of weeds, especially wild garlic.  This is making my spring weeding a much easier task. It seems to be very robust, and I expect it will last a long time. I love it!  Update:  I'm revising my review from 5 stars to one star.  The second time my wife used this, it snapped in two.  The "Lightweight, one-piece, polished aluminum alloy" is apparently too lightweight to hold up to the task for which this product was designed.  Steel would have been a better choice of material.  I do not recommend this product.  It didn't last long enough to even wear the label off.	-1
Fell apart after mowing three times	-1
I connected the hose, turned on the water, and the hose separated from the metal connector. Worthless.	-1
At first, I thought this hose was fantastic. It worked flawlessly. Today, I go out and hook it up and notice that the divider plastic piece, which directs the water into two separate sections of the hose, had broken. As of this time, it's is useless, and it's sad....I really did like the hose!	-1
This was awful. Did not cut the blades of grass. This contraption just bent the blades over.	-1
Wasn't worth the purchase. It was flimsy and got holes in it right away and didn't stay put the way I would have liked.	-1
Just like previous reviewers, within minutes of using this on my garden weeds, the tip broke off. The metal must not be forged very quickly. It says it's a lifetime warranty, so I assumed it would be more durable. Shucks. If the metal were stronger, this would be a perfect product.	-1
This was a gift and it has been used 2x on a lawn area that is 10x10, today when I was hooking up the bagger I notice that one of the 3 rollers was cracked, it is plastic.  I taped this up for now and I am supposed to have a 90 day warranty as I bought this a month ago but I do not know how to get the warranty. I do not want to return the reel mower I just need to replace a roller unless there is something better.	-1
Lasted two weeks and plastic split!	-1
So it is designed to hang, is fairly heavy. but the cord is like 8 inches long.  Stupid!!!!!!  You have to attach a 3 prong extension cord.  No catch tray, so bugs fall under it.  My husband bought this for mosquitos.	-1
I'm still getting a tons of nasty mosquito bites every single time I go to the yard after buying this. Finally i asked the local government mosquito and vector control people to come, he told us the zapper only worked for moths or beetles.	-1
Defective/Does not work properly Details: I used this for 45 minutes. I moved the hose 10 feet and the brass end pulled off of the hose. This hose does not rate 1 star. You should discontinue.  Amazon made it right!  Thank you!	-1
I really like the way this hose works.  It can be used as a sprinkler hose or soaker.  Having said that---they don't last long.  Hose expand rapidly and rendered unuse able.  Won't buy again.	-1
This hose worked fine initially, but I was skeptical because of its very light weight.  Sure enough, after about about two weeks of occasional use, it split in two places and was useless.  I don't recommend it, even for short term use. Its not cheap enough to through away, which I must do because Amazon will not replace it.  I will shop elsewhere and avoid the trade name "Andrews."	-1
used once and the second time it flickered and never cam on,was stored in between uses	-1
Hard to use and didn't do a great job cutting. I returned and bought Fiskars which is considerably more expensive but also more effective.	-1
Started using July 12, so far been just a expensive outside night light. I had to dig out my small stinger to kill any bugs	-1
Not  as good as an earlier model. Difficult to adjust the mow height.	-1
Bought the lamp hoping it was going to help with mosquitos on our back porch. I live in Arizona where there aren't too many flying bugs, but mosquitos breed in small damp areas of our neighbors planters -- caused by moisture drip lines running from their air conditioners.  Installed the lamp and bait as per the directions.  Tried it for over a month.  Killed more moths than mosquitos, which is not saying much.  I'm glad other customers are having luck with this unit -- as I think its pretty worthless.	-1
Does not kill any flys.	-1
quality not good for the price	-1
The only thing i ever saw it kill was moths at night. The mosquitoes and gnats were not bother by it.	-1
Did not last. metal is weak and bends. Poor quality	-1
....cuz I sure can't get this tool to "work" for ME.  I truly wasted my money on this piece of work.	-1
We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to "steer" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to "steer" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since.	-1
This is an OK pruner for about $12.  Its anvil design is sturdy but the blade was not sharpened at the factory...more like a butter knife at dinner.  Upon use, it cuts OK but not cleanly as expected.  Intended use is for dead wood pruning. This requires more hand strength as a result. I sharpened the blade with a small flat file, and it was improved.  But still a bit disappointing.  Suggest you look at more refined models in $20-30 range for a more efficient, smooth tool for real work, eg from Corona, Fiskars, Felco, etc.	-1
VERY upset that there is a tiny print sticker on this product that says: CAUSES CANCER IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT!?!?!?!? Really?? And why are they selling it to us if they KNOW it causes cancer .. I've been thru 2 types of cancer and feel like throwing these away ... why on earth sell something when you KNOW they cause cancer. I am dumbfounded. DISCONTINUE ... PLEASE	-1
If I could give less than one star I would. This company and their products are essentially rubbish. They used to be nice but recently they changed their OEM supplier and their products rust and fall apart easily. How bad? Think worse than Chinese 'Harbor Freight' quality- which is unthinkable! My Hedge Shears rusted up (with no use at all) in around a year and looks like it came out of some antique yard sale. Think about tools that appear in a 'Rust Removal' Youtube video. And it was stored in Southern California in a shed with hardly any humidity!  Their sales have gotten so bad recently that they were bought by a foreign corporation which is hastening the demise of this brand.  I asked for them to look at it (the one year rusting issue) and they not only told me to take a hike but dared me to put this up on Amazon. Some customer service - eh?  Just wait for all the paid shills to appear defending this brand.  Only thing is - why can't they upgrade their quality (and ergonomics) to look (and perform) like FISKARS? They won't do that but they will insult their paying customers just fine....  Avoid at all costs (unless you want to be stuck with a horridly rusted out tool and no support)!!!	-1
I'll take your word that it fits 99% of the brush cutters, but it DIDN'T fit my Homelite.	-1
I ordered two of these and they arrived yesterday. One was already cracked and had a big chunk of plastic missing in the center area of the saucer. I chose to return both of these. I have big heavy 14"-16" planters and these were not what I thought I would be getting in the way of 'rock hard' thick plastic saucers. Even had one not been damaged, I would have been disappointed. This is one of the items I will have to go to Lowe's or Home Depot to get so that I'll know what I'm getting. I based my purchase on the reviews and this time it didn't work out. I worked in the nursery industry all my life-most of that as a grower of bedding plants. I do know quality plastic. These may say that they are 5X thicker than others but they are still flimsy.	-1
I got this for my Shindaiwa at work.  I have some heavy brush to clear too, but that's what the chain saw is for.  I have lots of light cane and young roses coming up too, thought this would get the job done.  Nope.  If heavy .105 or .120 line won't cut it, this probably won't either.  And that's what you're trying to do, find a step up from the heavy line, isn't it?  Set the mower deck high or find an actual blade to go on the end of your trimmer, because this thing isn't up to the challenge.  If you don't want to ever replace trimmer line again, this might be what you need, but don't be lulled into thinking you've got something that's more capable than what you had.	-1
MODIFIED REVIEW EXPLAINING RETROFIT. Do not buy if you have a Homelite trimmer as it will not fit unless you can weld; the way to fit it to a homelite, is to go get a RH thread 5/16x1.25 bolt (about the size of the LH thread bolt you get with the package) and a 3/8 nut which you run up the 5/16 bolt to its head and weld the heads together. Take the bump knob off the existing bail and add a couple of space washers (a couple of lock washers work very well, as they are thicker) to the shaft, and install the GrassGator using your newly welded bolt.	-1
Couldm't cut my grass very well.  Misses some spots because it just didn't cut it.  if the grass is taller than 2 inches, this is not mower for you.  Need to spend the money and get something that works.	-1
this seems like a quality hose...last year, I bought one, and thought it was great...this year, the new ones simply don't work--it's as if they don't bother to test them: it's basically a regular hose. It doesn't work as a weeper.  Buy  Flexogen instead.	-1
The stakes are really thin so your application or use is limited	-1
Most of these stakes were very thin. Many broke as we worked with them. We're going back to the brand we used before.	-1
This item is absolute junk. Not as specified. Diameter listed as 0.75" and not a single stake is above 0.25" in diameter. Unusable for the intended purpose.	-1
I carefully tested two identical hoses, and they both failed miserably.  In the range of 15-20 PSI the flow rate is absurdly low, and parts of the hose that are in the sun warm up enough that the hose softens, expands, and lets lots of water out at that place.  At higher pressure (40 PSI) more water comes out of the soft spot(s) and most of the rest of the hose still barely lets any water out.	-1
These were so flimsy they couldn't hold even 1 flower. Horrible.	-1
Flimsy for garden stakes, but they are OK for staking up canna lillies, gladiolas and such for a couple of months with clips of course.  Too flimsy to use for pole beans or anything that needs sturdy stakes.  Gardener for 40+ years that's tried it all.  These are OK in a pinch if you don't have stronger wire stakes to use.  Best if you have soft ground to put them in or they will break easily.  The price isn't bad for 25 stakes if you can find a use for them.  They won't last more than a year or two at the most if used for temporary purposes.	-1
Wasn't very effective.... Eventually got tired of the thing & how much time I was wasting going over the same areas over and over and replaced it with an electric mower.  Wasn't worth the $$ nor the time in the end.	-1
I wish all the theories would be real. This is a product fall in that category. It doesn't attract anything, it might be killing fewm while others festive around you drinking your blood.  It sounds like great idea, but it fades in the backyard. No way, it can help curbing blood thirsty mosquitoes.  There was no change before and after using this con product.  Goes directly back to who makes it	-1
Sticks are weak.  They break and splinter easily, even when just putting the in the ground.  I had to bind mine together in groups of 2-3 to get one functional stake and that stake still wasn't very sturdy.  Guess you could use these for staking light-weight vines, flowers, etc.  Some of the stakes I've broken into 3 pieces to mark the ant beds so I can find the later.  Definitely not a purchase I would make again.	-1
Much to thin.	-1
They're too thin, broke when I pushed them into the ground and don't offer support for anything other than beginner plants.	-1
These are nowhere near as thick as stated in the original description. They went into the ground fine, but were not suitable for providing extra support for some of my gladioli, which were drooping. Would not purchase again, and am at a loss for what to do with the rest of the packet, to be honest.	-1
These are not nearly as strong as I would have assumed for bamboo, I tried to use them to hold up an indoor potted plant and the first one snapped immediately.	-1
I only received one roll of wire 48"x50'...not the 150' as advertised. I hope this is a shipping error. I would like my other 100'.	-1
I assumed this would work for flies. It did not kill one fly. I did see 2 small moths get zapped, but nothing other than that. I was looking for something that would get the flies buzzing around my backyard, but they were not interested.	-1
too weak to hold anything up -	-1
Did not see one bug caught.	-1
These stakes serve no purpose whatsoever.  They are so flimsy that they hardly go into dirt without breaking and they do not hold my tomato plants, hollyhock plants and other tall plants.  I had to use 4 of them to hold one plant up.  Waste of money.	-1
I had never seen such cheap chicken wire before, very dissappointed	-1
Fence started rusting the first day. Returned for a refund	-1
I should've read negative reviews before buying. The stakes are all different thickness and several of them came broken. The stakes are very thin and break easily, even when pushing them into soft dirt. The paint is awful - my hands were green by the time I finished installing, and now (only 2 months later), all paint has been washed off by rain. I do not recommend this product.	-1
This fencing has no rigidity....has to be tacked up on stakes and firmly secured....wouldn't keep out the smallest preditor, but it's keeping my chickens out of my garden...	-1
These flop over with *beans*. Tiny, thin, just a few leaves beans. Total waste of money.	-1
bad drocrken buy the wind	-1
I wanted a machine that doesn't make noise like the gas one does, and had my eyes on this. Unfortunately, it jams frequently and I had to return it. Returning process with amazon is easy as always.	-1
In my experience, the Corona Clipper GS 6750 Grass Shear is an over-rated, work making tool.  Tools should save work, not add work onto the job.  It seems to me that these clippers require more energy than they are worth.  As another reviewer said, they tend to get material stuck between the blades, perhaps requiring a strong spring to make the tool spring open, so that the jamming does not occur as often.  So, any grassy material that requires energy to cut is added to the energy-taking spring back pressure.  Also these shears open quite widely, making the [un-padded] handles difficult to grip around and impossible for smaller hands.to use.  I returned them and started looking for an alternative.  I found these shears, the Zenport Heavy Duty Landscaper's Grass Shear [Item # ZL119].  They work quite well so far.  They require less energy and will pivot to a variety of blade positions.  They are not yet on Amazon so I bought them from an alternate merchant, but since Amazon carries other models of Zenport clippers, they may begin to carry these.	-1
Who is willing to buy a new product that only has a 90 day warranty? That is the typical warranty on used product. If the manufacturer has little faith in their product, then neither do I.	-1
Poor quality stakes.  Some were so thin they could not be put in the ground without breaking.  Forget about using them to hold up a plant- too weak.  Some of the stakes were fine, but many were not useable.	-1
It's too flimsy for a chicken wire but I used it for my garden.	-1
There is a few things they don't tell you about these stakes.  Firstly - the die they use comes off in your hands.  By the time you are finished staking your plants your hands will be green and it does not come off easily.  Secondly the stakes are all different sizes and thickness.  They are not straight and brake easily.  If you are thinking of buying stakes - get ones without die, that are thick and true. These break easily even when putting into a potted plant with loose soil.	-1
The bamboo stakes bent easily when staking cosmos, four O'clock and gladiolus plants.	-1
BEWARE of any chicken wire made in China if you plan to use it in the garden or for compost bins or anything else that may end up in your body. Most of the cheap chicken wire sold at Lowes and HD (like this) contain lead. A dead giveaway is if it has a sticker on it saying that per California regulations, this is to inform you that this product contains a known carcinogen or something very close to that wording. However, if it doesn't have a sticker that does not mean it is lead free. Your best bet is to spend a couple more dollars and get chicken wire made in the USA and it is guaranteed lead free. Plus, keep that money in the USofA!	-1
Horrible, we did everything the instructions said to do, hung it away from the house, we heard little or no zapping of bugs at all, by hanging it outside for the purpose of helping get  rid of mosquitoes, our main problem, I think the mosquitoes read the lantern as come and get it, free meal by that I mean we were the meal, unbelievable,I went outside after dinner(i was the tester)and I saw a couple on me, but I must have not noticed more of them, there so fast, I was a mess,of welts, the inching was so intense, I had to take a shower, I finally got some relief, unbelievable so this product sucks, maybe it worked for someone else, not me.	-1
Hate it! They broke as I using one to hold up a rose stem in the ground.	-1
No the female end does not fit my spray handle, to small	-1
Really, really thin.  Green paint sticks to hour hands better than to the stakes.  HUGE difference in diameter stake to stake.  If I had paid more i would have returned them, but it's more bother than the return on my time.	-1
Received with torn wires, and got a full return.	-1
Returned and did use	-1
Yes, they're 4 feet long, but their diameter varies in the extreme.  Some are thin as match sticks while others are quite sturdy.  I will not buy them again because about half of them aren't strong enough to do the job I wanted them for.	-1
Wanted to install a mesh to stop small animal pests from living under our wood deck that is driving our Koren Jindo hunting dog, nuts! Did see that it was 2" but thought I could double it up. Wrong! This item is very hard to open and unwrap and really you just have to start cutting it, to unwind. Found the correct product .....Mat Midwest 308238B 36-Inch-by-50-Foot 1/4-Inch Mesh 23-Gauge Hardware Cloth that was easy to unwind and easy to install to solve this issue. Consider this mesh or as they call it Hardware Cloth?  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mat-Midwest-308238B-36-Inch-by-50-Foot-1-4-Inch-Mesh-23-Gauge-Hardware-Cloth/dp/B0009GVN4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mat Midwest 308238B 36-Inch-by-50-Foot 1/4-Inch Mesh 23-Gauge Hardware Cloth</a>	-1
I have used it very little, but enough to know I wish I did not buy this. I wish I could return it..... It feels weak, like it is going to break. Also the blade split apart like a set of Bypass clippers do.  Waste of money in MY opinion	-1
Too skinny and weak.  Paint make bamboo far too slick.  Ties do not work	-1
This made the trip because it's metal. Packing was horrible. Never again.	-1
Item arrived on time.  Several of the stakes broke too easily when pushed into my soft flower beds.  I strongly suggest using garden gloves and avoid touching this item to your clothing because the green coloring will rub off and stain whatever it touches.	-1
The paint on these wears off in like 10 seconds...onto your hands. there were also some very very thin ones that would snap trying to hold up some of my plants.  I wish they were unpainted, or better quality paint, but preferably just unpainted. its unnecessary.	-1
These stakes don't serve any purpose , spindly and weak they break if you apply pressure driving them in and the green paint on it washes off giving you brown bamboo!!. Best to spend more and get the uniform diameter stronger plastic stakes whose color does not wash off.	-1
A warning on the Bamboo stakes from China: they have some sort of green colored coating on them. The coating comes off in your hands and I would be concerned with adding them to a potted plant due to the unknown checmicals. It will rub off on your hands and is hard to remove at the very least.  Update: Addressing some of the comment flames here-- yeah, not anti-China per se, more so anti stupidity. More than once we have been lied to about what these cheap imports (from any country) have in them. See Dog Food scandal.  I did do some research before posting and there is NO WAY to definitively say what chemicals are being used here.  And yes, I have a lot of experience working with imports in China and elsewhere.  I've also reviewed a lot of Chinese products, some good, some not so good. I object to the go-to-pandering-insinuation that my review was some sort of hate speech inspired evaluation attempting to discredit me.  And no, it does not say what was added, so you can't say what it was. Also (Mr./ Mrs Akiko, the same peanut gallery commenter) your profile says you are stuck in the west -- happy to float you a few bucks or pass a hat for you to go back if you hate it so much here. Also, I noticed you seem to know a great deal about a product you haven't purchased or reviewed. Since you haven't actually purchased the product, pray tell why are you attacking my review? Wait, never mind the likelihood of me ever coming back to this review to see your comment is about 0%.  I stand by my review. There are lots of ways to stake a plant. I don't recommend this one.	-1
It says Two packaged Bamboo Stakes....I only got one!  Just go to a Lowes or Home Depot and save yourself the ridiculous shipping charges for sticks.	-1
Didn't fit over the ends of the reel. Since it was too late to return, I'm out the money. Don't buy it on Amazon, look at a local hardware store, at least if it doesn't fit, you can work it out with the store.	-1
While this mower trimmed small patches of clover and leafy plants, it simply squashed down my grass without cutting it.  It wouldn't cut anything taller than just a few inches, which I suppose is fine if you want to mow your lawn every other day.  Any little piece of debris will stop this mower in its tracks - even a patch of grass a bit thicker than usual.  My yard looks terrible and I am returning this mower immediately.  I do not recommend this mower.	-1
it leaks .  does not connect with other wands.	-1
I thought this was a good idea.  It was obviously a little flimsy, but i figured it would work with my small orchard.  While spraying  the upper branches the wand simply snapped off at the base and gave me a face full of chemical.  Fortunately I had glasses on. I like the idea, but way to flimsy.	-1
it quit after one season	-1
Does not work on a Sears Craftsman reel mower.  The pipe is too small to fit around the axle.	-1
The reel mower sharpening Kit is okay.  I had to call long distance regarding questions. The lady was very abrupt.  The instructions are not clear. The instructions have 3 different languages which makes it difficult to read.  The instructions were not clear on how to remove the wheel. The handle to turn the blades that came with the kit is really flimsy.  I hand turned and hand turned the wheel to sharpen the blades about 10 minutes and did not see any improvement.  Kinda disappointed in this product.	-1
You git nuthing!!!! Nuthing!!!! And they screan youer revews bad+!!!!!	-1
Works so good I didn't have a single gnat left... but only lasted less then a season	-1
I ordered this because the description said it would fit the reel mower I have. Had I not thrown out the packaging, I would have returned it.....it's not right.	-1
Came thrown in a paper mailer, loose with no padding. Plastic cracked (of course) and unusable. I have better things to do with my life than stand in line at the post office to return this junk.	-1
Flimsy. Not a tight enough weave. Strands easily come apart.	-1
Would not recommend. Part that the handle connects to broke off in 20 mins of use.	-1
Flimsy and fell apart after one season.	-1
I bought several of these rolls for craft projects..The 1st two rolls I ordered were fine.. Yes it shreads a lot but I could still work with it...I just received my 2nd order of 4 rolls.. These rolls are a lot poorer quality then my first order.. The weave is so loose and open you can barely work with it.. AWFUL QUALITY! Will never order again!	-1
DO NOT BUY !!!! BUYER BE AWARE!!	-1
WIll not fit a cs310 or a cs400	-1
Flimsy and didn't last an entire summer.	-1
Maybe you people just don't order out enough.  You can get the same functionality from chinese food carry-out lids or some deli containers.  They're sturdier and already paid for, and there's also no shipping fee or shipping trash to deal with. I'm willing to bet you're probably creative enough to come up with something to elevate your pot inside the re-purposed lid just a little, too, to facilitate drainage.	-1
These items are useless.  They are literally paper thin and utterly useless.  I cannot imaging any situation where this item would be useful. Place a planter on this "Saucer" and it will likely crack/split as mine did.  Got this as an add-on item at a cost of $3.08.  It would not have been worth the $.08.  Complete waste of time and money.  And in addition, ordered 3 of these, each shipped individually in a huge box.  WHAT A WASTE AMAZON.  1 star only since you can't go any lower.	-1
White light totally, not as pictured. Insects are not really attracted to it, not more then to a regular bulb. After 2 nights, barely any bugs zapped. I owned 2 before , that had purplish light and it was like bug magnet. This one is useless. Would not recommend.	-1
90% of the good reviews here are paid reviews foisted by the CORONA CLIPPERS company. Long story short - the blades (even if left alone in a shed) will rust horridly in around six months - yes that bad. Mine looked like it was from one of those shows where they teach you how to remove rust from antiques, and I live in Southern California where it's not humid at all. . Better off buying FELCO or FISKARS than this expensive junk - I have a pair of Fiskars bought earlier which looks brand new. I'll be posting pictures soon.  Most customers don't care - but I contacted the company about this unusual rust problem and they basically told me to take a hike, even dared me to put this up at Amazon!  Don't be sorry!	-1
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004R9VW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 It works.  It's sad that the light bulb less only two month.  I Have to think twice before I keep ordering replacement of light bulb.	-1
The clippers seem to work fine but after one day one of the insulate cover on the handle split right down the length of the grip.  I know sometimes I'm a little rough on hand tools but I certainly didn't treat them improperly within the first hour of use.	-1
This mower worked fine for a month or two for our back yard, then the handle (like, the whole top end, not just the grip) bent. The ground in our back yard is a little uneven, so I think all the bumping and jostling while pushing got to it. It cut the bluegrass in our back yard alright, but we have what I think is really beefy bermuda grass in our front yard, and this was reallllly hard to cut with the mower. We barely could get it done the first time through, then as the blade got more and more dull (we're talking like, after 3-4 mowings, not years here) it just wouldn't do it.  I really wanted to like it, and I like the idea of the reel mowers, but the blade on a normal mower is so much easier to sharpen... we ended up bringing it to goodwill and getting a corded lawn mower.	-1
Worked well for a while. I have it turning on at dusk off at sunrise during the summer. It lasted less than a year and now the light only works not the bug zapper around it.	-1
Didn't fit my 18 inch bar on my saw or step fathers although it claimed it was supposed to.	-1
I don't like to give bad reviews. And I was truly hoping this product would work out well for me. But my conscience tells me I must warn others about the dangers and pitfalls of this zapper (of most zappers). I'll start with a short list of pros and cons. You can read the details that follow, if you're interested.  PROS: > It does attract some bugs and kill them.  CONS: > Electrical cord's position causes the zapper to hang crooked. > It doesn't kill nearly as many bugs as I expected. I've watched, for many days (for hours each day), and I would say maybe 10% of the bugs that fly within 20-30 feet of it are attracted and zapped. It's supposed to cover 1 full acre. I don't see that happening at all. > I have recently read articles that explain why bug zappers don't kill as many biting insects as youd expect. If anyone wants this information please feel free to ask me in the comments section. > Can kill hummingbirds by electrocution, according to a wildlife biologist I consulted, and from a birds near death experience I've witnessed. > Can electrocute a bear or other animal that might be able to mess with it. > If a bear or other large animal knocks it off the hook, and there's dried leaves on the ground, it can start a fire.  Up until yesterday I was going to give this product a 3 or 4 star review because it does attract bugs and kill them. But for the amount of bugs in my yard, I was disappointed in how many were being zapped. I placed the zapper within 10 feet of two bushes where swarms of mosquitos are known to hide in my yard, and left the zapper on 24/7 for several weeks, but the mosquito swarms are still there. They are smaller, but they're still there. I find that odd since the zapper is supposed to attract them and at night around here there is no other light but the zapper to compete. I also don't like that the cord comes out of the top, so when it's plugged in to an extension cord it hangs crooked (the weight of the cord pulls it to one side) and this makes it look ugly.  But the generous 3 or 4 stars I was going to give was until yesterday. Last night, in the early evening, while it was still light, I watched in horror (from my kitchen window) as a hummingbird repeatedly made passes at and brushed up against the zapper, actually pushing his beak into the zappers protective cage. I know how long a hummingbird's reach is (with beak and tongue) and at that moment I realized if it tried to "lick" the light (or if it was trying to eat a bug* that was hovering close to the light) it could be electrocuted. As soon as I realized this I ran out, yelling and clapping to distract the humming bird, and thank God it flew away. But before I got out there I could see it was right up against the zapper, trying to find a way to get to the light. I immediately unplugged the zapper.  Later that night I consulted a wildlife biologist I know, who knows about the native animals in this area, and he said it would not surprise him if a hummingbird did stick its tongue in the zapper, and get killed. We also discussed the possibility of a bear mistaking the zapper for a bird feeder, tearing it down, and getting shocked, possibly causing a fire if there's dried leaves on the ground. Bears regularly come into yards and pull down bird feeders. We use to leave our empty feeders up, because they were decorative, but took them down after years of bears messing with them, even when empty.  For the reasons above (threat to hummingbirds, threat to bears with possible fire) I no longer feel comfortable using this product and I will go one step further - I would suggest no one else use this product or any other product like it until or unless it is proven safe for humming birds and all other animals. Ive already consulted a wildlife biologist, so for me proof of safety will have to come from the same or higher authority before I change my mind.  * Humming birds eat flying bugs as a regular part of their diet. A hummingbird's preferred insects include, but are not limited to: small beetles, true bugs, weevils, flies, gnats, mosquitoes, aphids, mites, leafhoppers, flying ants, and parasitic wasps.	-1
Just go buy CANE SUGAR.	-1
Oil inlet does not lineup with my saw Poulan Pro 5020av. It is NOT the same as the stock bar. Fine product other than that. Comes with the Vanguard Safety Chain.	-1
DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY FROM THE START	-1
The description says easy to clean. How is it easy to clean when the base does not come apart to clean it? Anybody who knows anything about hummingbird feeders knows that for the birds safety you must keep the feeder clean! Worse, because the base is a solid green you would not be able to see mold build up in it. I do not recommend this feeder.	-1
Been using a chain saw since I was 18, that was 1972. I can say this is the worst chain I have ever used. Had to purchase at lowes at last minute to get job done, made one cut and chain was as dull as the replacement, I have never seen such a poor performance.	-1
Put it on and it was not sharp--had to put the old one back on to cut a tree limb--must have missed quality check!	-1
Chain was wrong size	-1
Addendum: Do NOT buy this feeder!!! Birds won't come to it. The design is so bad that the "angles" of all three tubes reflect the sun and the birds are afraid of it. I moved it to 3 places at my clients property and it was never touched. I brought it to my house where it sits full, waiting for the birds that will never come!!! Do not buy this feeder!!! 1. very difficult to rotate top to fill tubes. 2. The instructions tell you that the top pole to the bottom of the feeder is tight. No amount of friendly persuasion would make this connection. Even tried dish soap to lube it up... now way! I ended up beating the bottom of the top pole into the feeder with a brick (of course I had already filled it!!) The instructions also say, when removing the feeder for filling, the top section of the pole will come out with it. Of course it will be stuck in there, it's been beaten with a brick!! Supposedly this pole can be pulled out of the feeder. Not a chance of that happening. The only way to get it out now would be to destroy this brand new feeder It becomes a 2 person ordeal just to fill it This is the worst design I have seen	-1
Doesn't cut much of anything. If you have a lovely manicured yard this baby is the ticket. If you got crabgrass and weeds this thing won't help you. So If my lawn was in the suburbs and looked like a golf green this reel mower is what i would use. In the time it took to finally mow down my rough grass and crabgrass I would cut the yard with scissors.	-1
horrible never fit the aw as advertixed	-1
This worked for two weeks, then burned out.  It's 'WAY too expensive to buy one of these so often!!  I'm so disappointed because Flowtron has always been my go-to for things like this.  Not anymore.	-1
Mine was a gift, I liked it OK except it was too heavy to hang and then take down to refull. I bought one for a daughter and saw it lying iin her garage floor in 10 pieces. It had come apart when she was cleaning it and with no instructions it was a hopless nightmare. Soon after this, mine fell apart after the rod holding it together unscrewed itself. I have worked for two days on it, again, no instructions, no  diagrahms, nothing to go by. I am a pretty handy with any task but this is impossible. It is on it's way to the dump. One more thing before I go, when it rained the sunflower seeds got soaked and ruined so they were all gummed up inside the tubes. HATE IT!	-1
Tips do not bypass don't buy	-1
mine broke already	-1
I have a craftsman which came with 2 chains of very good quality and tough.  But this replacement seemed too light, too thin....something was not right.  I did not trust it.  Maybe I got the wrong one?  Well, I returned it and hopefully I will find an OEM.	-1
Came with a broken handle. I do not think this thing  was built right. Save your money. Buy something else.	-1
these things never do a good job. rarely do they water close in and the center adjusting screw just doesn't work most of the time. on some the spray seems to go up in the air at least as much as it goes out. with this water emergency we are having you would hope Rain Bird and the like would come up with a design way more efficient than this. i am fed up with replacing NEW nozzles in an effort to find one that will stop my grass turning brown just 6 feet from the outlet.	-1
I have used other companies versions of this hand held spreader, so I know to be gentle and even when turning.  Still the crank handle fell off after 5 minutes of use with a fairly smooth grained fertilizer pellet.  Seems the internal gear assembly came apart.  Does not appear to be a very well made item.	-1
Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass, but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block.	-1
Product purchased new is very good and will buy it again and again.  However do not buy from Amazon used deals I did this and received two literally used chains.  The one had oil but was still sharp.  The other was oily and dirty and was dull.  More dull than a chain I would throw away.	-1
It cuts grass ... yeah .. like the other reviews say, if you have a dandelion that has a long stem, just go get your scissors cuz this baby isn't taking it down.  Have a broad leafed weed poking up ? Well, it's going to be there when you go over it.  I tried it at different heights from the highest to the lowest going over the offending weed again and again and again and again, and tried other weeds again and again and again and that remained true, as a matter of fact, they're still there right now.  Plus, it's pretty noisy not to have a motor, you won't be listening to the birds mowing, more like a loud clicking.  You will get a little exercise, if you have a small yard with no weeds this would be fantastic ... our yard is full of dandelions (we just rented and apparently I thought being cheaper and green was a good idea - I was wrong).	-1
I wanted the fat tip bar but got this skinny tip instead. Maybe next time I'll read product descriptions better. Now this bar is good, but it uses more horsepower from the saw to run around that tight radius so my saw cuts a bit slower.	-1
It was suggested when I purchase my manual mower, but it doesn't fit, so it's just sitting in my garage - I should have returned it, but now it's probably too late:(	-1
