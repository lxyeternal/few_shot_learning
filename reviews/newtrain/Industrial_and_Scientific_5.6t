Excellent, works as described.	1
when you need it, you really need it. this product gets the job done.	1
this does work	1
good to make thermal res. seal/washer.	1
Excellent product that impressed me with the way it bonds with the item your using this tape on. Easy to apply, easy to cut, great seal. Works. Buy it.	1
No one should be without Silicone fusing tape. This stuff sticks to itself so well that to remove it, you need a sharp knife. It will stop water leaks while pressure is still present. This is not meant as a replacement for gaffers tape or electrical tape. It can be used to hold "stuff" together.	1
good	1
This stuff is amazing.  It's not sticky.  It kinda' bonds to what you wrap it around.  Works great.	1
I like it so far.  Time will tell if it performs well.	1
Excellent Product!!!	1
How did I go so many years without this stuff in my shop, or in my car, or in my backpack? Every day I think of new ways to use this stuff.... for instance, today - I was filling a small spray bottle with bug repellent for my backpack, and I was concerned about the top coming unscrewed slightly causing a potential leak. Well, I pulled out my clear version of this same tape, and wrapped it around the top where it screws on, now I am confident it will hold.  Yesterday, my weedeaters foam grip was cracking splitting - out comes the black Silicone tape to the rescue to provide a new grip for the handle. The day before, my tent pole plastic end cap was not staying on the pole, again, Silicone tape to the rescue.  Then, when I was weed-eating my lawn, I noticed my trusty outdoor electrical cord took a hit with either the weedeater or hedger, and had a couple of chunks of the outer sheathing missing. I used my Xtreme tape (in the Red color to match the cord ;-)) and it has been holding for weeks and about 4 uses, I don't see why it won't hold for a very long time.  Then, my 20 year old wheelbarrow's wood handles have taken a beating from years in the weather, and they showed a lot of cracking and the wood was very rough.  I usually wore gloves when carrying heavy loads with the wheelbarrow, especially since the wood handles were so rough and I worried about getting splinters.  I painted the handles with some acrylic latex, and then gave them a wrap with some 1.5" of the black Xtreme tape, and it did wonders.  I overlapped the Extreme tape in close windings, so it created a thicker wrap since this was a heavier duty application.  I did this almost a year ago, and it has held up fine outside in the AZ heat.  I don't store the wheelbarrow in the direct, and I think the UV would wreak havoc.  Now I feel like I don't need gloves to use the wheelbarrow.  Next, both my backpacking and camping tent poles have vinyl or plastic ends on the poles - and after time these loosen up, want to come off and worse yet get lost! Well, not only does Xtreme tape fuse the tent pole ends to the pole, it also reinforces them and makes them stronger and more durable...  And then the big test - my garden hose had a pin-hole leak in it, and I applied this tape to it. The key is to make sure you extend the tape on either side of the hole by a few inches (I did three inches on each side of the hole) - and then make sure you stretch the tape very well and evenly around the hose. Also, make sure the hose is on a flat surface, and try to avoid flexing / bending the hose while taping, keep it as straight as possible. Also, give it at least two windings (not just one). It is working fine, if there are any issues I will update.  You get it. This stuff is amazing. Once you wind it on itself it sticks like white on rice. Its resiliency is quite good - it is very tough and it will not come unwound unless you intentionally start to pull on the seam. Then, it will rip instead of lose its contact... it is that sticky to itself.  I bought this yellow colored roll for a couple specific purposes - 1) for my set of old Stanley vice grips that have the thick yellow plastic handles - the handles are not seating properly, and this tape gets them to stay, and provides a nice friction surface to hold, which is important with a vice grip, and B) for the times I want certain tools to stand out - like when I am under a car, or have bunch of tools out - I wrap the tools I will be accessing most frequently, or want to find easily with a single wrap of the yellow tape.  It's quick, easy and gives me a lot of bang for the buck in saving me time finding a certain tool.  The list goes on.... like I said, I keep finding more uses for it daily.  I would say just get a roll, and keep it around. You will be amazed at the number of applications this stuff will satisfy.... an easy five star!!  Thanks for reading.	1
Tapes that stop leaks in areas not easily accessible without the use of tools.	1
This is an excellent product for sealing just about anything	1
great	1
This stuff sticks like glue. Made a permanent watertight seal. Great Product	1
good	1
I bought this to attempt to patch a leaking hose. It was not strong enough. Every time pressure was applied, it would expand and leak. So, don't use it for patching leaks.	-1
THIS STUFF OWNS , I use it for security cam wiring outside :D its amazing.	1
Works just like advertised. Worked perfectly on the first try. This is one good product, great idea. Make sure it is where you want it, no going back after a few hours.	1
Will use in the RV.	1
Very useful for odd jobs.  Self sealing and flexible.	1
Doesn't work	-1
buy	1
Works well on vacuum hoses but it did not fix my drain pipe.	1
Great alternative to the black silicone product that I seem to use almost every day.	1
I like it so far.  Time will tell if it performs well.	1
Love this stuff!! I seal all exposed car wiring fittings with different, appropriate colors.  You have to figure out the stretch, but it only sticks to itself.  NO adhesive ooze.  This is NOT an electrical tape!  I put it over e-tape or shrink tubing	1

Great stuff!	1
clean fingers or gloves and it lasts a very long time i tend to wrap a wide strip one direction then a thin strip in the opposite to lock it in place very strong i love this stuff i need more  i use it on my RC lots of heat and vibration and it holds up exceedingly well with no residue long term like black tape very nice	1
hello,   this product is a wonderful silicone self sealing tape.  it does a great job of wrapping onto itself and seals quite well. an overlap is necessary to insure a good seal.  every household should have this product in the tool drawer.  great product and delivery	1
Excellent Product!!!	1
Great stuff,	1
The perfect solution for a multitude of applications. This tape is not sticky but rather 'bonds' to itself in short order. 100% better for most applications than the old standby, 'electrical tape". This is a quality product at a great price.	1
It really does work!	1
Amazing stuff.	1
Cannot have any debris on the tape or it will not stick.  Otherwise, it seems to be pretty good.  I'm not sure it is worth the extra money over duct or foil tape.	1
I do not feel any home would be complete without this item and Gorilla Tape. This silicone tape has endless uses and since it wraps and locks on itself it is easy and simple to work with. This is among the better inventions of the past decade. It is just wonderful.	1
An excellent Silicone Rubber Self Fusing Tape - Unbelievably strong when used in several layers. Really bonds to itself.	1
Seals but is transparent, lots of uses.  Heat resistant so I can put it on my motorcycle in the hot spots.  I needed to seal and insulate some electronics (with indicator LEDs) and I can just wrap with this.  It doesn't have adhesive, but it sticks to itself (and will melt together).	1
X-Treme Tape TPE-XZLCLR Silicone Rubber Self Fusing Tape, 1" x 10', Triangular, Clear I ordered this to apply a water proof coating around a piece of a project I didn't want to be affected by moisture.  Sticky and secure after wrapping. Overlap just enough to allow you to bond and seal the wrap.  I like it.	1
It sticks to itself, if stretched in the process of securing pipes etc.  It does not stick to any other thing such as adhesive tape. It will not stay stuck to a flat surface.	1
Does not fuse. Rips like paper. Doesn't stretch. I used "rescue tape" and F4 and they actually worked. I used other colors from this company and none of them worked.	-1
Used on a low pressure 3" drain pvc pipe. The surface was first cleaned and then the tape was stretched wrapped (as per instructions) around the leaking joint.  This product did not work. The joint leaked.	-1
Great for all types of tape-able repairs!	1
Does what it says it does. We are thrilled.	1
Great silicone rubber tape. I use it for electrical insulation but also for protection of mini USB connector cables.	1
I used this to reinfoce the headphone cord where it turns into the adapter. It works great for this, no more cords pulling out at that joint. You can barely tell that it's there too.	1
I like it so far.  Time will tell if it performs well.	1

Excellent Product!!!	1
good packaging good magnets not for kids unless you don't like them.	1
Just got these.  They came with warnings about the strength.  I said "Sure, real killers".  Well, it took a lot to remove one from the stack and there is a nylon or plastic spacer holding them apart.  Pretty cool I thought.  When I started to put the (now) single one down about 6" from the stack it flew out of my hand to the stack and broke about 1/4 of itself.  I have to figure out how to remove it now.  These guys are absolutely correct with the warnings so please read and heed.  I love these but maybe they are too strong for my uses but with a non magnetic hunk of something I can tailor their pull to meet my needs.  I usually blow off warnings but not so with these.  If you need killer magnets these are the way to go.	1
crazy powerful - will cause finger damage and blistering	1
As advertised, works flawlessly	1
This thing is tiny, simple and functional. What more could I ask for? I can leave it hooked up to the BNC plug on my probe, and it becomes a 3.5mm plug instead. Perfect for use on the DSO Nano V3 oscilloscope.	1
As Described and on time	1
great	1
Works as it should and a great price	1
So far works great.	1
Small and works well. Just make sure you follow the arrows for the air direction. I did not initially and it would not allow for adjustment. It would simply read the incoming level and not work below that level. Very strange symptoms. Once corrected, very easy to adjust and nice to have at tool location instead of going back and forth to compressor.	1
Good threads, works perfectly fine on my milling machine coolant mister. I guess it's just the luck-of-the-draw whether you get a good one or a bad one.  Ed B.	1
For years I have been buying Fuel Transfer Pumps to transfer my off road diesel fuel from my 500 gal. storage tank to my tractors. Now I simply put 20 lbs. of air into my storage tank to force the fuel from the storage tank through the hose to my tractor. This little regulator works perfect for that and is not as nearly as expensive as transfer pumps. allisonfamilyfarm@gmail.com	1
works well	1
Search "Primefit air regulator" and you'll see something that looks more substantial, and costs a bit less.	-1
Attached between the air hose and an air-powered caulk gun, the gauge and regulator allow immediate adjustments to maintain the correct caulk bead. Without it, I'd have to plod back and forth between the compressor and the area I'm caulking. The amount of air pressure needed depends on the size of the hole cut in the tube tip, the thickness of the caulk, and the amount of caulk in the tube. The gauge and regulator would serve the same purpose with any air tool that requires frequent pressure adjustments. A word to the inexperienced: the gauge/regulator doesn't come with connectors. It has an empty, threaded hole at each end to accept either male or female quick-connectors. So if the tool end of the compressor hose is female, screw a male connector into the air-in end of the gauge/regulator. If the end of the tool is male, screw a female connector into the air-out (tool end) of the gauge/regulator. And vice versa.	1
Put this on the air gun, saves always having to drop oil in, works great.	1
just what u need	1
works great and steady at a good price.	1
Economical pressure regulator for using your compressor with air guns, etc	1
Works well gauge is nice and nothing leaks. We'll see how it holds up, but should be fine if it isn't abused	1
Quality made and a low cost replacement for my HVLP paint sprayer.	1
nice little regulator. used at the end of a compressed air run to make sure final air pressure was perfectly dialed in.	1
This is a wonderful idea, but the quality control is lacking.  I bought 4 of these lubricators and all 4 had hairline cracks in the plastic reservoir right out of the package.  Be sure to look for cracks before using.  I installed the first one, filled it with oil and as soon as I attached the airline, it blew oil everywhere.  I sure hope they get this issue taken care of because the idea is great and I would like to have automatic lubricators on my air tools.	-1
I took it off I think only if you are going to use something for a long time then it is ok if not just more weight. But like your sander for body work , a scale gun etc this is it.	1
Perfect fit and perfect size. This gauge and regulator are a great find for what I need.	1
Worked well to control the 150psi coming from my air compressor and converting it to 90psi. Although it does seem to go down, even if your compressor hasn't reached 90. But for $15, it protects my tolls and prolongs my air pressure	1
works well	1
Good Quality!	1
I really like this fitting.  Air tools require oil to make them last, this is a great solution for us DIYers.  The only cautionary note is if disconnected with pressure in the line you might get a little on your hand.  I strongly recommend this item.	1
great , very well built	1
Usable quality, appear well made, economical.  Great for "grab and hold" projects around the house or workshop.	1
good for price, not expecting precision	1
Much much larger than I wanted. Very heavy !  Hard to handle since they are so weighty.	-1
great product	1
I WAS VERY PLEASED	1
ALWAYS COMES IN HANDY	1
Only had hooks on one side	-1
as advertised	1
this velcro is actually a little weak, and inflexible for its size. I have no use for it.	-1
UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO USE IT	1
Very easy to use and very strong.	1
Happy	1
This is great!  just what I needed and a good price as well.	1
I use this stuff for everything ! I usually use the 1/2" wide roll but I thought the inch would be handy. The Velcro could be a little stronger but good value for money.	1
This is a great idea... It works great, on holding wires on my bike. The ideas are endless...	1
Works well, use it to secure large items from movement when needed. Reusable.	1
two sided role works great as a tie down	1
Purchased for a seamstress to fix the Carhart suspenders. Perfect rip stop, works great!	1
Perfect.  Use to strap battery to my Quadcopter.	1
note that the order is for the bottles and caps. there are no plastic dram dropper inserts or whatever you call them. i ordered these cuz i have extra plastic inserts, so these are perfect. for pictures, see my reviews for this type bottle with the inserts. they are the same quality and size.	1
I am getting started in aromatherapy and other uses for essential oils. I love these bottles because the included topper makes it easy to apply small amounts to the skin. and the small size fits well in my small purse. They are a good price and do not leak.	1
great vials	1
I intended to use these to travel my cologne and beard oil. Over half of them have leaked. Today I trashed the rest of them as well, just to be on the safe side.	-1
Works Great - Very Happy	1
Great little vials, perfect for making samlpers of various flavors.  The only minor downside is that the caps are plastic and not glass but that isn't really a big deal.  These also come with orifice reducers to make drop by drop dispensing easy,	1
thanks	1
Exactly as described. Received all 12 bottles wrapped in bubble-wrap. None were broken.	1
Used these to divide up massive "Frontline" large dog flea killer for my smaller dogs. Makes it super cheap. These are super quality, airtight.	1
Works great.	1
Good vacuum at good price. Reviews stated it was heavy...I mean, it's a vacuum so I don't know what they expect there. Pet Hair attachment works great.	1
I've own Hoover vacuums since I am teenaged, I bought my own after teens, for years been the best, saw the quality gone down, Hoover design wasn't great till couple years ago cleaning houses on side, used customers vacuums, some over $1,000 and some $500, came accross Hoover bagless, cheaper kind, liked it, cord wind-up, shorter than expected. Did great job on their house. I bought this one due reviews, longer cord, bagless, wind tunnel and whoa, more than I expected, made for pet owners, I own 3 dogs, 3 cats, sucked up more hair, dirt, dust than my Hoover platinum did. Big advantage, washable filter, bagless. Save $$$ on bags. I'm pleased with it design same quality as my first Hoover. This one heavier than other models in stores. I'm good at maintenance on vacuums, this like wash and wear. Lol. Belts, bands replacing always must in most vacuums, common something gets picks up and stop the rotor and burn belts off, clean it and replace is only way to go. This one a keeper for me, for basement. Easy put together less 3 mins. Recommended. I'm just lucky get this under $100, price gone up after my purchase. This vacuum met what I wanted.	1
We love this vacuum.  We have a dog who sheds quite a bit and it does a great job keeping up with the hair.  The upholstery tools power  is a little weak, but if you don't press too hard, it get does work.	1
Shipped out and arrived on time. We actually purchased a Dyson first, wife hated it. After taking it back we ordered this one. This thing works great, it sucks up so much more than the last one ever did. Love it, works great and got a great price. The only thing is you need extra washable filters. You need to wash it nearly every time you vacuum	1
I've had this several weeks. So far, so good. I have a short list why vacuum earns 5 stars. First, it is amazingly quiet compared to any other vacuum I've owned. I'm not saying it is whisper quiet, but still it is pretty remarkable. Second, the brush does not throw dirt backwards. I'm not sure how they managed this, but it really does a great job of not throwing bits of dirt around and frustrating the heck out of you. I wish it had better tools, such as a soft hand brush, but it is not a high-end model, so I'm making allowances fo that in my rating.	1
Great	1
Does the job	1
Ok, so it is just toothpaste.  I like it, ordering from Amazon makes it convenient, and my wife likes to kiss me when I use this flavor.  So...nothing to see here, move along...	1
as described--fast shipping	1
i'm no dentist	1
I've been using Crest Pro Health for years and I love it.  You can really feel it bubble up more than other brands.	1
I like the deal and they do clean your teeth. I just was not crazy about the taste. Otherwise, it is what it is, toothpaste	1
Crest is the way to go for healthy, clean and less cavities. I have been using Crest for as long as I can remember. Good products, good prices, thank you Amazon	1
Like the flavor, Crest is always a solid purchase option.  Purchased this to get to $25 for free shipping.  Would recommend.	1
The product and price are great and amazon prime saves me a trip to the store. Just two days latter it arrives, like having a personal assistance even for tooth paste!	1
I started making my own Ejuice and needed driller bottles for it. These worked perfect and I started selling to friends and family. Perfect size and they work better than the plastic bottles.	1
Exactly what they appear to be. I bought these to use with my Noodler's fountain pen inks. They are almost exactly the same bottles and eye droppers. Excellent value. I had a hard time shopping for these on Amazon there were many similar, but... not quite, or vaguely described...You know the nonsense. These are the bottles you are looking for.	1
I love these for my vapor oils. I can mix my own flavors. I like these because, you can wash them much better than you can plastic. I can also, use them for my herbs, and for mixing my oils for putting in the candle warmer. These are so, handy to have around.	1
Great item!	1
Great for keeping essential oils for aromatherapy	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
Perfect for my needs.	1
I used these to store some Brusho Crystal Colors (they are powdered watercolor paints) and while they aren't *perfect* for that particular use, they are great little jars. They are super thick and durable- you don't need to worry about banging them into each other or dropping them on a soft floor- but are crystal clear and it's easy to identify the contents. The droppers work well and fill easily.  Because they have a relatively narrow mouth, filling them was *not* easy, so I suggest purchasing a tiny funnel to use with these.  I like them so much, I'm considering using these to store some fluid watercolors and inks I have in plastic dropper bottles and jars- I like the way they look, how durable they feel, and the control that the vial dropper allows for (you can use it as either a dropper or sort of a "stir stick").  Totally recommended. Packed well and arrived perfectly.	1
Great bottles!	1
Use these for DIY e-liquids and they work great.  The dropper really helps with my RDA and is much easier to use than a standard squeeze type dropper bottle as I can reach all the way to the coil without having to remove the top cap on the RDA.  Does not alter the taste of anything I have put in them so far. Price is much better than anything available to me locally.	1
Love the bottles, watch out for who ships free. arrived quick..Everything turns out better when start with higher quality base products. Use the code for discount on the Magical Butter machine! The MB2e is ez magic in making all your herbal extractions, tinctures, butters, oils... http://magicalbutter.refr.cc/G88G4CL	1
These are not borosilicate as the description says.  They're nice little dropper bottles, and I think the internal tube is likely borosilicate, but the bottle itself is not.	-1
arrived in tack...non broken. Perfect!	1
as advertised	1
FAKE!!! The calipers I received were counterfeit, although the best counterfeit that I've seen. The first thing I noticed was the inspection report had a printed signature instead of a hand written one. Secondly, it has a battery stapled to the instructions where the packaging says "SR44" but the battery itself says "LR44." The calipers also had a battery already installed. Mitutoyo does not do that. One of the tabs on the battery cover is broken.which is a sure sign. The rest of the packaging seems to be dead on which is scary. The calipers are functional and overall pretty good. I suspect most would never notice that these were fake unless they knew what to look for.	-1
These are as accurate and repeatable as you can expect from dial calipers. Mitutoyo is our preferred brand for general use shop calipers. Easy on the budget too.	1
It's a Mitutoyo. If you are an Engineer don't waste your hard earned money on anything else. My son loves it.	1
Works well.	1
bottles are easy to fill and don't leak	1
Perfect. No different from the bottles I've used in labs since the 70s. Top quality bottles with top quality caps. Truly a lab grade product.	1
Purchased from Grenals through Amazon for $6.99 and free shipping for 12 pack! Could not be happier. Bottles are true Boston rounds, nice weight, caps with flat inner seal (I assume cardboard covered with a water-resistant material). I use these 30ml bottles for my DIY ejuice. They do not leak.  I also have the blue cobalt 30ml bottles with the glass eye dropper caps. Those are nice bottles too if you need an eye dropper. I prefer the brown Boston round with the standard caps b/c I use 100% VG which is very thick. I found it very messy using the eye dropper caps as whenever you pull the dropper from the bottle, it's coated with VG and it doesn't run off quickly, so there is no tidy way to transfer liquid with a dropper cap. If I need to use a dropper I prefer to use a separate one where I can just dip the tip in to extract the juice without the dropper being coated in it. But mostly I use a subtank mini and just pour juice from the bottle directly into the tank, so the dropper became inconvenient as I had to pull it out then set it down, making even more of a mess.  The other reason I prefer the brown Boston rounds to the Cobalt Blue Boston rounds is, I can see through these a little easier when adding VG to make new ejuice. I typically fill them to the shoulder and I can see to do that using the brown bottles if the light is right. The cobalt blue bottles are darker and harder to see where the juice line is, making them less convenient for how I use them. If you are someone who measures everything out then that wouldn't matter. But it's also easier to see how much juice is left in a brown bottle, than the blue ones.  So they are both great bottles and it's all in what you need them for.	1

Love these little bottles. Use mostly for my first aid kit but have other odd uses for them and I can just grab one.	1
I ordered 2 rolls. 1 roll was wound uneven on the roll and horrible to use the red cover came off and the clear tape was stuck to one another on the sides.the other roll not as bad but the same situation.	-1
But once installed correctly it will not come off, I guess that is the whole point. Better get it right the first time!	1
Excellent!	1
The bond seems to get stronger with time even though no drying takes place. Great for mounting things in areas with abusive levels of vibration. Wonderful for adhering smooth metal, glass, and or various plastic that repel all other forms of glue. With minor effort it can be %100 removed without damaging most surfaces. If you use too much you can easily cause a total structural failure when trying to peel things back apart when you make a mistake. This stuff is deceptively strong. Its crystal clear and has the texture of a very sticky gummy bear candy you can't pull apart.	1
Good product at a fair price!	1
Very sticky, but not as strong as I was expecting from the 3M web site.  It is the strongest I have tried yet though.	1
I am updating my review from a 3 to 5 star after using this a bit longer.  I have found a much better way to remove the protecting from the tape and I have to say it really holds well.  I use this on my MultiRotors ( Drones ) and it also helps with reducing Vibrations when mounted between the Frame and Components.  I would give it a 4.5 but there was not a half star :-)  Hope this helps anyone thinking of using this as I have.	1
If you need a VERY aggressive double-sided sticky tape, then this works fantastic!	1
Dont believe the hype.  yes it is super tacky but only on slick surfaces.  LIke a painted car.  The painted siding on your house or any textured surface, no not so much.	1
Great shield from adafruit.	1
Extremely easy to use, has made microcontroller+servo projects a breeze.  I would recommend purchasing separate headers, and using this board beside the controller, since it blocks many headers that aren't implemented.  Also remember to pick up an adequate capacitor for the number of servos you intend to drive!	1
Sent promptly; item is as advertised.	1
Item arrived a few days late due to a mispick.  Seller corrected problem immediately.  Item as described (some assembly required). Item functions as described.	1
It is not the easiest thing to apply, but it does improve temperature regulation of the extruder. If your extruder isn't insulated, you need this.	1
Perfect!	1
Fantastic product. I just finished a printer build of my own design and was running into an issue with the hot end loosing 10C when bed fan was turned on. I tried PID tunning, altering various values, I was able to get close, but the temperature line ended up being pretty wavy. I thought that maybe insulating my e3d volcano would help -- does it ever. After PID tunning, the effect of the fans is a momentary drop of .5C which quickly recovered. Now the line is basically flat, with the fans on or without it hotend maintains temperature. I wasted too many hours redesigning fan mounts and messing around with PID values and trying to figure out the PID math. Was very easy to apply, just wrap tight around the heater block and secure with kapton. I aso wrapped the bottom, it makes with the volcano since the cartridge goes in vertically. Couldn't be happier with this product.	1
Great Product! Got exactly what I paid for!	1
For years I have struggled with trying to position the fans on my 3D printer to where they would blow fiercely on the print but miss the nozzle.  I've downloaded and tried every crazy looking vent funnel to try to achieve the same aim.  I've tried low-flow fans, throttling back the flow on high flow fans.  I've tried large diameter fans, and fans placed on the table next to the printer.  All with unsatisfactory results.  Then it hit me.  Stop messing with the fans, and do something to insulate the hotend!  First I tried making a metal cage to block the air from the fans.  Then it occurred to me that there must be some sort of insulative material I could wrap around the hotend, so that the carriage-mounted fans could be operated at full speed and yet not affect the hotend temperature one whit.  Quick search on Amazon and I found this product.  I have to say it works most excellently.  I have two 40mm double-height sunon brand fans.  They put out prodigious quantities of CFM.  One fan alone, running over 37% of full speed would cool a hotend from 200C down to a temperature below which plastic would flow.  After wrapping my hotend with this material, I am able to run BOTH fans at 100%.  Switching from 0% to 100% does result in a momentary drop of 1 degree C, which is quickly recovered back to full temp.  I might add that I do not even have the entire hotend covered by this material, just the outward facing facets.  I have left the top and bottom of the hotend uncovered.  I would expect that covering these would give even better results, though the results I am getting now are more than satisfactory.  I highly recommend this product if you are running a 3D printer with an E3D V6 hotend.  I used strips of Kapton tape to cover the material and adhere it to the hotend.  Please note that the image shown is not what you receive.  The product is for a 12" strip of material, which is more than enough to cover several hotends, but it's nowhere near as much as is shown in the photo.	1
this is way too brittle falls apart even if you are gentle with it.	-1
Worked really well to help limit over/under temperature swings. I was rocking +/- 5 degrees C before adding this, now I'm +/- 2. This material got me down to the error of my thermistor on my Velleman K8200. Thank you!	1
High quality	1
Work excellent for what I purchased them for, good quality	1
I am very happy with the purchase of these bottles. They work well, and while I didn't need blue glass gor any reason, I just think it looks nice! I would recommend these. They are an excellent price!	1
I love the bottles but the dropper bulbs are small and don't pick up as much as I would like. The bottles are great; thick, dark glass and the perfect size for my purposes (CEF serum). You just have to take extra effort to squeeze ALL the air out of the bulb to pull much out and even then, kinda skimpy. For the price, I can't complain.	1
packaged well and none were broken. great product for price. will be buying again.	1
Get vials. Seals good and the glass is not cheap either. I use these for my e-juices.	1
Great for mixing e-juice.  Came covered in cardboard dust and needed to be cleaned extensively.	1
All bottles arrived in great shape	1
great for home made oils, lotions, potions, and colloidal silver. The glass is well made and the eye dropper is an awesome bonus.	1
Great for blending essential oils	1
I make my own herbal tonics and essential oils. These are the work well to store them in. Amber bottles are the best, imo. But these were a great deal, and I keep them in a dark cupboard. Sunlight can damage oils. I purchase quite a few times every year. The dropper works well and is easy to clean.	1
Not impressed with the bottles, but worse than that, the droppers leak.	-1
Great little bottles, works really nice for diy, e juice.	1
Nice little bottles, and the work very nice for making our own ejuice in.	1
Very bad dropper quality. The plastic has broke in all of the 20ish I have ordered.	-1
I love the bottles and are as discribed. Lost one star for being dusty and stuck on particles. They washed up nicely. Droppers are close to the bottom of the bottle. Easy to get the bottom liquid out. Thank you	1
Very pleasing color and the dropper works great.  Well definately be buying more.	1
Perfect for e juice including very high VG blends.	1
Perfect transaction and product as promised.	1
Superior Glass...nice drippers perfect for my use.	1
GREAT 2oz.cobalt bleu glass bottles. Just what i wanted.thank you. Well packed,Very good quality. I Will get some more later.	1
Exactly what I was looking for well packaged.	1
delivered fast. Good buy	1
Great item for a great price.	1
I was really worried that all these bottles were in pieces.  It really sounded like a box of broken glass. I'm happy to say - NONE of them were broken. They were packaged with little pieces of cardboard between them, but, they still clinker together some. They are also super dusty.  I'm not so happy with that, but, they wash.  Beautiful colors. Holds a little more than 2 Oz if you fill them to the brim. The dropper doesn't go all the way to the bottom - BUT, tilt it a bit and you can get it all.  I got this for essential oils, fragrance oils, blends, etc. I'm really glad to have come across these. Fantastic product,  fantastic price, and beautiful color. Did I  mention the beautiful blue color? I love it... ;-)	1
Great bottles!	1
Great	1
Cool bottles 60ml right at the neck	1
Bottles are consistent in size/shape, and arrived very clean, although I did sterilize them before use.  The droppers are not as consistent in length or tips, but are perfectly functional even though a few don't quite reach the bottom of the bottle.  I do wish these were also shipped with standard caps/lids so you have a choice of topper, but that's okay, as I've ordered another 1/2 dozen with standard caps :)	1
Glass bottles are nice but these things have one glaring issue. The dropper cannot even hold half of its volume in a single pull. If they had used more rubber on the dropper the problem could be fixed. In its current condition I will never order another because of how annoying it it to refill my tanks. Highly recommend staying away from these. The only reason I am not giving 1 star is because they are functional and I am trying to be objective here.	-1
These are generously sized bottles for the facial beauty serum I made using essential oils. Next time I would prob get 1 oz size. These are good qualtiy	1
Using these for e-cig E-Liquid. They work great. I have ordered the 1oz size a couple of times and I needed a few that were larger for my personal stash.	1
These are great bottles! I use them for Thieves Oil and I highly recommend them.	1
I've bought these twice now.  Good price, good product.  I love these little blue bottles!  2 ounces is a nice size for oil blends that will be applied in small areas, like on a scar or on acne spots.	1
I keep these for all sorts of uses.  Mostly homemade herbal extracts.  Good quality so far.	1
excellent product well priced good value	1
We purchased this magnetic wire for our grandson, who made an electromagnet for his 4th grade science project. The wire is just the right thickness for this project, and the red coating was easy to scrape off the ends with a teflon scrubby pad from our kitchen sink. He wrapped a 10" nail with wire 4 times, and then did another 10" nail wrapped 8 times, and we have a lot of wire left over. High quality wire and it's hard to find magnetic wire. Thanks, Amazon!	1
Used on several, small projects, good value	1
we used this to make simple DC motors in boyscouts and it worked perfect.	1
Nice addition to my stash of stuff for Arduino projects	1
You wrap it around stuff to make electromagnets, inductors, transformers, that sort of thing. The enamel seems pretty tough, but it's not too tough to scratch off.  What more do you want? It's magnet wire!	1
Nice wire for coiling	1
its a keeper haven't abused it yet but expect it to hold up like others ive had	1
works as intended	1
Strong as hell, but also very stiff. Definitely overkill for my purposes.	1
These slings are NOT as pictured. They have full-width eyes and NOT folded eyes as pictured, to make attachment easier in shackles and other connecting links.	-1
Nice strap and a steal at under $10. Can't go wrong here!	1
works good	1
ok	1
100%	1
Great sling.  Should have bought a set of 4 though for 4-corner load pick-up.	1
Have not used it yet. I did inspect the product. Looks durable and is weight rated. I would buy again	1
will work well	1
This sling works great around our shop. I should have paid more attention that it was only 1" wide. The picture is deceiving. That said, I kept it and used it to lift our cabinet that weighs around 600 lbs. It does just fine. The handles are very well built and have an extra "pad" instead of just the woven material.	1
The Sling work good . plan to order more.	1
Strong nice strap	1
Good quality	1
I'm using 2 of these, one looped over each end of a 15 gallon drum type fuel tank to lift it on and off the back of my pickup. Overkill for the capacity I needed but well made and great price.	1
with the protective ends, the safety string and the reasonable price, I only buy keeper slings. I use the 10' model to go down, under and up around a a stack of two 27 gallon bins. they have slots on the sides that lock in the sling so i can use a single sling and not worry about load shifting etc.	1
I have used it a couple times and like it.  As long as it holds up, it is a good product and I would buy it again.	1
Have not used it yet. Looks like a quality durable product for the price.	1
Used for pulling up sage brush, worked well.  Well made product, seams well sewn.	1
good size	1
works as intended	1
I use these as the connection point for safety lines. haven't had a fall yet, but they're definitely heavy duty.	1
with the protective ends, the safety string and the reasonable price, I only buy keeper slings. I use a pair of these to lift 30gal rectangular bins; they hook onto the top lip effortlessly.	1
so far ok good price	1
Superb safety strap, every bit as good and one tenth the price, as the Spud straps for squat safety. I use mine over the rack.  I have both six and ten footers, and each is great depending in your power rack setup, height, depth of your squat, etc. I can't tell you which to buy, you'll have to experiment with your set up.  Recommended.	1
Quality blew me away! Nice strap at a great price. (At least when I ordered, amazon prices fluctuate so much. Under $10 when I ordered and closer to $5.)	1
they call them keepers but oh hell no i will not use these slings	-1
I bought these to help during a recent move...had many heavy and bulky objects to move to my vacation home, and this was just the thing I needed. With this sort of lifting sling, many tasks that would normally need two people can be safely handled by one.  Most of the time, it's not that objects are too heavy to lift - it's that they are too awkward to get a good grip. This is where the sling comes in...wrapped around a heavy object, you can use your body to advantage, putting enough leverage where it's needed to move surprisingly big items. Armed with one of these, I was able to move a large (350 pound) outdoor grill and a 500 pound gun safe single handedly, and without hurting myself.  Definitely recommended for anyone that might need to move a heavy or bulky item at some point.	1
Excellent.	1
heavy duty!	1
nice	1
Good looking weight rated strap. Would buy again.	1
Works great	1
big enough	1
PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED	1
works well good quality	1
This product is made well - very strong - I use it as a tie down for my small portable greenhouse.	1
I used this for a totally different purpose. I needed a strap this length to use on an exercise weight lifting bench - so I could wrap the belt / sling around my chest and then "pull" down on a weight stack.  Works good - rough - but tough	1
wonderful	1
Extremely fragile, for a tow strap you'd think it would be more rugged, it really isn't	-1
Good product	1
Used to pull a 700 lb load worked great	1
Good quality	1
as depicted	1
I use a pair of these straps in conjunction with a come along to help direct the fall of trees I cut down on my property.  These are way overkill what I need, the winch I use is only 1 ton, but these are just about the right size and fit the bill price-wise.  I use one of these as an anchor for my come along, and another to connect to the tree I'm cutting down.  These seem well sewn, and I like how the loops are reinforced and stitched.  Can't ask for much more.	1
Very solid built, great for lifting loads	1
works great	1
These slings are NOT as pictured. They have full-width eyes and NOT folded eyes as pictured, to make attachment easier in shackles and other connecting links.	-1
GREAT QUALITY!!!!!	1
Good quality and priced right	1
As described, looks like it will get the job done	1
good	1
as described, seems strong but not huge	1
Good sling	1
helps protect mower from scratches when lifting	1
Never again will i get stuck in snow with noy of getting mpulled	1
Good straps - strong, and they seem to be wearing quite well.	1
Works as expected.	1
I used these to tumble brass ammo cartridges in my Franklin Arsenal Wet Tumbler. The stock pins were getting lodged in some cartridge cases. These will not jam sideways in primer pockets or lodge in the .223 bottleneck....kinda expensive and this is the minimum amount you can use. I'd like a little more for the money. The free detergent works good but still need lemi-shine.	1
Excellent. I recommend this stainless media for wet tumbling. Buy once and never replace the media again.	1
I use these for cleaning the interior of copper tubing. rotate a section of 2" copper tubing on sealed bearing ends, rotates with a mini-motor, turn for several hours and the result is a polished finish. So happy with the results.	1
I wish I had time to share more information about the quality and positive results from this product. You won't go wrong by purchasing this and other products from this company. Stan - West Columbia, Texas	1
media works very well for cleaning brass, however it does rust a bit for me, i don't know why, but it get get some rust on it.	1
Good stuff, but note that you may want several bags of this. 10 lbs of steel is not a very large volume.	1
what can you say agreat product a at great price	1
Excellent item.........luv this stuff..........an absolute must for my Airwheel Q6.  When it wears out just slap on some more.	1
they work but won't take much heat when soldering before they crap out. burnt up a couple and thats not good. but they are what they are low volt amp chip	1
This chip is great for amplifiers, but it can work in radio detector and oscillator. I recommend it to anyone who work or do hobbies in Electronic. Thanks!	1
Arrived on time.  Work well.	1
Bought several sets of these..Nice selection of IC audio amps for my middle school students to create circuits with... and inexpensive enough for broke little me !	1
IC chip purchased for Arduino work. No issues.	1
Works fine, shipped fast, good value. Packing could have been better.	1
Works fine, shipped fast, good value.	1
Used these as replacements in projects and for new projects I created.  The work great, no problems, and are nicely priced.	1
Great machine	1
One of the stepper motors was hit and broke(it was laying out inside the enclosure), FlashForge internal acrylic plate was shattered inside and some screws were missing. Also, two PLA rolls were included (instead of 1 ABS and 1 PLA).  I know reviews are supposed to reflect the product's performance and one might think this is just a "damaged in transit" issue. However, it seems to me this is more a production packaging issue (I saw a couple of unboxing videos where the acrylic Flashforge plaque arrived broken). They stuff the acrylic hood and all other items inside the printer enclosure so save space and when doing so, they put extra pressure on the internal components. That's definitely not the way stepper motors should be packed/treated. This is not a cheap device and it's supposed to be adequately packed.  In summary: Check, level and test your printer on arrival. If you see something odd or damaged, return it.	-1
Workhorse	1
I have a wood frame Flashforge Creater Dual that has been moving along for almost 5 years without any problems.  I bought this  as an upgrade because of the enclosed cabinet and sturdy frame.  I have had nothing but problems.  First, twice I have had to replace and extruded nozzle because of filament freezing up in the nozzle and being unable to unclog it. I finally installed Swiss hotness and they have never worked well.  I think that I have had this printing less that 30 hours.  I think that it is the extruder not heating up properly but it works well sometimes. When I have saved up the money I will replace them.  Of course they generally make an excellent product.  My go to machine is still the old Flashforge Creater Dual.  I use that when I don't need to spend an hour getting something to print.	1
My first 3D printer and it seems to work very well.  I was getting good prints right out of the box.  I've learned so much in the last couple of weeks.  I'm using blue painters tape and a thin coat of Elmers Purple glue stick on every print now.  I put the tape directly on the original blue sticker and get great adhesion.  It came with 2 rolls of ABS but I'm using Esun PLA+ for almost every print.  Got a roll of PETG coming so looking forward to that.	1
works great	1
I've had my Creator Pro for one year this month.  It was my first purchased printer, which has since been followed by a Prusa i3.  I tend to keep both of them busy.  The Creator Pro was a good printer out of the box, and an excellent one after some much-needed upgrades.  Even with the few deficiencies, the quality of the printing is very good.  Accuracy remains consistent even with prints running over 20 hours at high resolution.  I've printed molds for rocket fins, avionics and tracking bays for rockets, puzzles and gifts for the grandchildren, jigs for woodworking, replacements or improvements for various articles, and even faceplates and prototypes for enclosures of products under development.  After trying for some time to do 2 color prints, I finally gave up.  Alignment, calibration, ooze control and shielding are all just way too difficult to get a good print.  Forums indicate that most people just use one extruder anyway and after replacing nozzles, many of us just pull one off the sled to keep the print head mass lower.  The first improvement was to get repeatable adhesion using both ABS and PETG.  The blue removable panel was very finicky and inconsistent.  On some prints it would release just fine and on others it would hold on like a terrier with a frisbee.  I removed the blue material (be sure to heat the bed up first), cleared the plate of all adhesive and started using a borosilicate glass plate with ABS "juice".  This was MUCH better, giving both a very planar surface and consistent adhesion and release.  The only problem was that the "juice" got all over.  I eventually bought a sheet of PEI plastic and adhered it to the glass plate.  This is perfect and has served me well for several months.  The second upgrade was to get rid of the low quality nozzles and replace them with micro-Swiss all metal hot ends.  This has given very consistent results across several brands of filament and conditions.  Highly recommended to to this if you don't want to spend a lot of time clearing clogs and replacing PTFE tubes.  Plus, you can then run much higher temps for some other materials like nylon.  I've only ever pushed it to 245 for PETG, which worked great.  The most important upgrade was to not use the Flashforge slicer, but to buy Simplify3D.  Much more control and better slicing for cleaner results all around.  Miscellaneous improvements: a better filament feed bracket that won't wrap around the filament axle, printed filament holders to use other than Flashforge brand filament (I prefer Hatchbox), cable management on the top of the extruder bay to reduce wire flex, and bed clips reinforced with metal.	1
Worked out of the box. It took about an hour to set up but could be shorter as I took my time in leveling the bed. I purchased some hatchbox PLA and printed a test cube with the default settings. Found that I was printing too hot as I had warping. Dialed the extruder down to 200 and the bed to 50 which fixed the problem. Using Simply 3D and have created a few prints for my Mavic and a whistle that actually works.  Very impressed with this printer. it has been running almost non stop for the past 24 hours. One note, the Hatchbox spools do not fit this printer and will end up sliding off of the spool holder. You can print one that works from Thingiverse.  I have not tried ABS yet as I figured it was best to start off with PLA. I've never done 3D printing before so taking it slow.  I did reach out to the vendor to ask a question during set up. I received a response in 10 minutes. Very fast customer support. I would highly recommend this printer.	1
Great beginner printer for sure. I really like the lights and controls on the printer.	1
There is nothing spectacular about this printer other than the fact that it works on a turnkey basis.  The printer is very unimpressive compared to a Seemecnc Rostock or even a real Prusa i3.  Both the Seemecnc and the Prusia will require more tweaking than the Flashforge but either will provide you with much more latitude in printing.	-1
About 5 days ago I received my printer and I got the printer up and running in 45 minutes. Since then i've had this thing running about 16 hours per day. Its very easy to use, and I haven't had any issues so far. The support from Mr. Chang has been great, I asked him some questions about maintenance and ventilation and he got back to me within a day or so. I've been completely OBSESSED with 3D printing since buying this printer. I'm a working mechanical engineer, so for me its a way to mess around with designs at home for fun. Its nice to be able to download models online and print them immediately, or model some ideas of my own and prototype them quick.  This printer is easy enough for the average non-technical person to use. If you can handle Microsoft Word or Photoshop on a computer, you can handle this printer. The software they provide (FlashPrint) is very intuitive and the default settings tend to work great. The UI on the printer is also very simple. There are millions of models online that you can find to meet your application, so you don't need to learn 3D modeling (true for any printer, but just pointing it out).	1
Awesome 3d printer, excellent support, good quality in printed parts. the platform sticker works good, it is not a noisy machine, definitely flashforge is the better selection.	1
High quality and easy to operate. Many useful features. Fast support	1
perfect 3d printer good quality speed recommended	1
This printer is awesome and have the best quality. In order to get the whole potential out of it you have to buy the simplify3d software it may look expensive but it is worth the money	1
This is my third 3D printer and I love it. The only downside is that its not an auto-leveling bed, but other than that, the build quality is great and the prints come out very nice.  I was super-impressed with how well it handled ABS filament.  Almost no "ringing" and the accuracy is very good.	1
This is a great 3d printer, if you want the least amount of hassle and the shortest learning curve, this is the one. My only strong recommendation, is that you buy simplify 3d with it.  3d printing takes much trial and error. Different filaments, different temp settings, different slicing software, etc etc. FFCP takes a lot of that out of the equation.  My recomendendations:  1. Buy Simplify 3d 2. Start with PLA. ABS can be very difficult to master and the benefits are few over PLA 3. Use Hatchbox filaments. This is very important. Heat bed to 60 deg, and use 205 for filament. Buy it here from Amazon. Wait for Prime stocks so you don't over pay. 4. 3d prints of high quality take a long time to print. Avg 6 hrs.  However, once you see a HQ 3d print, you will never want to use anything else. Bottom line: patience. 5. Level the bed very well before you print. I cannot stress this enough. LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL  ! 6. Make sure the first things you print are a filament feeder and a bigger spool feeder. Go on Thingverse for STL plans. You will these before you do anything else. 7. You will almost never use the dual extruders. The only benefit is that you can use two filaments of different types ready to go. 8. Always unload the extruder if you are not going to use the printer for more than a week. 9. Keep the door and top cover on when printing. Heat retention is your friend. 10. Experiment with your slicing settings. Don't accept default values. They are typically the wrong ones for your printer. 11. Try to print things vertically. Vertical printing is always more accuarte. Even if some instruction states to print something flat, always flip it vertically. 12. After you get some time on the stock nozzles, upgrade to some micro swiss nozzles. Huge difference. Do not go full metal. It's not needed and it will screw up you temperatures. 13. The blue stock print surface works great. Don't listen to all the idiot's out there that recomend all kinds of other stuff, glass, PEI, Kapton, etc. The key is keeping your surface clean. Clean with denatured alcohol after each print. Let dry. Always use a raft. I don't care what they say about not using one. ALWAYS USE A RAFT !. When it's truly not sticking anymore replace with a new one. I get about 20 prints before I need to replace. 14. Always preheat. That is so important. Both bed and extruder.  OK so here are some cons:  1. Nozzles will need to be replaced at some point. 2. The two nozzles are more than likely NOT at the same height. What this means is that one may "knock" into the other "structures" when printing and ruin the print. The solution here is either remove extruders and rebalance the nozzles or remove the nozzle of the extruder you don't use. Either solution is simple, about 10 min total time. 3. Balancing the table takes several attempts. I use feeler guages. They are more accurate. 4. Loading and unloading the filament becomes a chore, but it's something that needs to be done. 5. The table is actually small, as your appetite for bigger projects grows. You will have to get creative wit layouts. 6. The cooling could be improved. Several mods are available online. 7. Do not use the provided spools. The quality is very low and it has led to numerous clogs. Use Hatchbox for both PLA and ABS.  Overall I love this printer. Yes, some things could be improved but the only 3d printer I would consider to be better than this one is the makergear m2. I also own that one. It's very good but also twice the price. I still find myself using the flashforge over the m2 more often than not. The m2 is great for bigger projects. I would recommend the Creator pro 2016 to anyone starting or wanting a more reliable 3d printer. Don't waste your money and time on anything else.  I love this machine.	1
Had this printer a while now and completely modified it.  Great for those looking to get into 3D Printing.	1
My first 3D Printer, and this one is a winner!  I studied the market a bit after being 'bitten' by 3D printer by a friend's MakerBot mini printer, which did a fine job but has some significant limitations which the FlashForge Creator Pro (new 2016 edition).  This printer includes some things which I think are important: - dual extruders; good not only for 2 colors but for a 'backup' if one should fail - you aren't down during ordering and getting a replacement. - heated bed: allows you to print with ABS as well as PLA and other materials - decent sized capacity; this one allows 225mm wide x 145mm deep x 150 mm high (that is 8.9" L x 5.7" W x 5.9" H) - company with support in USA; there are lots of knock off cheaper printers, but I wanted some support and read this one has good support - good build; this one seems very well built. In a week of solid use, I've had no issues from day 1. - supported by software and parts if needed; lots of places selling replacements parts and accessories if needed  The printer arrived 2 days after ordering, and the box is on the heavier side at around 50lbs or so.  It was very well packaged.  It came with 2 large spools of ABS, so I ordered some PLA to try that material as well.  I unpacked it, followed the instructions, and was printing within the hour.  I've had it over a week now, with a lot of completed prints in both ABS (built a 20 piece robot arm, flawless!) and PLA (less success with adhesion to the bed, but successful prints anyhow).  The one major print failure was due to my PLA breaking mid-reel, can't blame that exactly on the printer but could have been the poor feed on the FlashForge printer - I HIGHLY recommend going to ThingiVerse and printing out the "FlashForge Creator Pro filament feeder" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1725645  which works wonderfully and dramatically improves the feed from the reels in the back. (Make sure you get the one with the proper width as the older one won't fit the new Creator Pro).  I agree it is the "first thing you should print".  I did mine in PLA, but ABS would be fine also.  Pros: - Much quieter than I expected.  It does make noise of course, but not bad.  I worked on computer next to it with no issues. - Quality is great!  I have had few failures so far, and this thing seems to be very well built. - Based on open source machine, so lots of parts and supplies are available. - Print surface is very nice; good adhesion with ABS but less success with PLA  Cons: - Feed from the reels is not good, but printing out the ThingiVerse filament feeder fix that for good. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1725645 - Instructions aren't very good, but if you study them will get you started. - I wish the door could be removed easily.  For ABS you want the top on and door shut.  For PLA you want the top off and door open.  I'd rather just remove and store the door but that isn't an option.  I'm sure I will print out something to fix that ;-) - Reel holders on the back aren't very good - it only fit some reels.  Again, I printed up replacements and fixed that in short order.  (ThingiVerse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:714533)  TIPS: - Especially when printing ABS, be sure you have a well ventilated area.  I installed a 5" computer boxer fan and some duct to vent any fumes to the outside (I work in the basement).  The PLA is less of a problem, but even that should have good ventilation. - Read a lot about printing - there is a ton of info out there, some very helpful.  Don't expect 100% success all the time. - The filename for the SD card can only be so long, so if you don't see the file: shorten the name!  Also it says 'can't read SD card' when first inserted, try a few times until it recognizes it.	1
This is a good "workhorse" printer. It is a clone of the MakerBot Replicator. This was purchased by my team at work off of my recommendation maybe a year ago now? I've never had to fix anything on it. It continues to operate exactly as it did on day one. I give it +4 stars because it accomplishes almost exactly what it was intended to. -1 star because at the time of release for this printer there was some room for improvement feature-wise.  Pros: * Solid construction - ours has never broken / failed mechanically. * Common parts - easy to get new nozzles, etc. * Standalone - (Via Memory Card) You don't need to connect this to a computer ever. * Dual Extruder - You can print using disolvable supports or two colors. * Open Source - You can use exotic materials like Flex (rubber/flexible), Wood Infused, Iron Infused (magnetic), etc * Reads standard GCODE files - Compatible with standard slicing software. * Custom Software - This is a nice, recent addition * Heated build plate - for ABS printing * Decent build volume - As time passes the build volume for this printer is less competitive.  Cons: * No Auto-Level - this is not good for beginners. * Dual Extruder - While this extends functionality you now have to deal with new problems like oozing, etc. * No Quick-Release Build-Plate - This would have been a very welcome addition.	1
I think it's one of the best plug and play 3d printers on the market. That's why I own 4 of them. Yes there is a learning curve with any printer but the Flashforge Creator Pro keeps it simple. You can use the software included or buy simplify3d. I comes with a dual extruder and I print with pla.	1
There isn't much to say about this one.  - Instructions: 5/5 - Software installation: 5/5 - Actual 3D printing: 5/5  This was my first 3D printer. I had it assembled in about 15 mins and a couple of minutes later I was printing my first model. I've gone through almost 2 spools of filament since then with absolutely 0 issues.  5/5 stars and a no-brainer buy.	1
Update: After almost 3 years of use I had to send it in for service. Wow was I disappointed. Minimum $160 labor fee no matter what & you will be paying the shipping both ways $90 for me to ship. They only have an email run by Alex the employee who hates his job. Alex threatens customers and has a boss thats always on vacation. He likes to give vague answers and doesnt email back until he feels like it. Alexs boss apparently can reapond to me through Alex bug not able to call or email me directly. Forget Flashforge if you are a serious user.  3 knob bed leveling sucks balls. Wish it was 4 knob. Other than that you can orint anything with this thing. Realistically I would also buy a Maghold Model C print bed for it. Trying to remove prints off the print bed while still in the unit will mess up your bed level every time. You will also throw of your X, Y and Z rods. You won't belive how hard stuff glues down to that bed.  Probably the best printer on the market. Hands down.	-1
best printer I ever had it almost never fails for long prints there are a few problems but i use to own a robo r1 plus and his printer blew it out of the water	1
good	1
This is the 2nd printer I bought from Flashforge, this printer is a workhorse and it works well.  I own 3 3d printers, a Replicator 2, a Flashforge Dreamer and this one.  This is by far the best of the 3 despite the Flashforge dreamer being a newer printer with more updated electronics.  This creator pro just works much better.  I have to relevel the plate a lot more often than my other printers, but I'm so used to it now it only takes seconds to do between prints.  I recommend this printer.	1
This is my first 3D printer and it is the one to get. I researched a lot before I decided on this one.  Now with that said I have had some minor issues.  My MAIN issue, and one I am not happy about, is both nozzles were not level. This is MAJOR! The right one was sitting higher than the left. I had to unscrew the right one a bit to make them even. If I have any real complaints, this is it. Unsure if this is just mine or an issue in general.  I also tried putting a thin aluminum foil shim above the left one whet it sits on the rail. Helped a bit but then it was too much and that was one layer of foil. So I had to unscrew the right one as I said. I should not have to do this and that is why this printer gets 4 stars. I am unsure if this will be a viable long term solution or not.  EDIT: Unscrewing the right one slightly to match has worked perfect so far so back to 5 stars!  My very first print was the standard traffic cone in ABS. Printed prefect.  Then after a short while the blue surface on the hotbed formed a bubble in it. I had to basically cut into the Blue surface to get rid of it. Not good if you intend on using that. However you shouldn't anyway.  I was getting hit and miss prints and was not happy. Using rafts just to get a stick sometimes. I was thinking of sending this back.  Then I ordered a glass bed.  WOW~ NIGHT AND DAY!  Ordered this thermal glass https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NY8F172  I printed a shim. You have to add this behind the bed so when the bed raises the Z axis switch matches the extra thickness of the glass and stops in the right place. If you don't it won't work  I highly recommend the 0.25" thick glass so the arms can hold it and remain below where the nozzles could hit. I printed two solid L brackets for the back and two with "arms" to hold it from the front. Glass is thick enough to allow those to not be above the surface. The glass is also not as heavy as I originally thought either.  Sprayed a little aqua net unscented hairspray on the plate, put the glass on the bed and let it heat up like it normally does to print.  WOW! PERFECT prints. I don't even think I will need rafts much unless the part calls for it. I won't need one just to get parts to stick that is for sure.  The glass held perfect, printed perfect. Allowed to cool and the parts just slid right off. No prying at all. I could not have asked for better. Almost as easy as printing on paper. :)  I bought Simplify3D and that makes a huge difference, especially for the novice like myself. It really is the best slicer.  I printed several ABS parts, perfect each time so far. Just one fast coat of hair spray was all that was needed. You probably don't even need to do this every time. Seems you only need it in the spots that the previous parts occupied.  Printed some PLA and heated the bed to 60c, perfect!  This saved my printer. I was getting frustrated to the point of wanting to send it back. Now it just prints, perfect every time, at least so far. Time will tell and it is early days but so far so good.  I may get another piece of glass in the future so I can swap if doing multiple prints. Allow one to cool while the other is printing.	1
I love using this printer!  Leveling the bed takes a few tried to get just right.  However, once it's leveled, you can print several objects without having to readjust it.	1
I am happy I chose this for my first printer, so far I have learned quite a bit about 3d printing.  I haven't yet attempted printing PLA plastic, but I have used the ABS that came with it and matchbox has with good results.  I didn't like using the rafts so after playing around I have been printing ABS at 222-225 on the 110 bed.  Finding I get great prints using Elmers washable school glue on the blue textured platform cover.  I have some pictures of stuff I have made, but the kindle fire doesn't appear to have a while to upload pictures so I will do it at another time on a computer.  Also Flashprint, which should be on your SDcard included, works great for this and provides many more options for printing.  I recommend using this software in advanced and slowing down your first layer, this allows you to avoid using rafts, also you can make the first layer height different then the rest.  You can also set when the extra cooling fan turns on.  I also recommend getting an active cooling fan mod form thingiverse, you can remove the old extra cooling fan it comes with and install the new cooler and a 24VDC fan using the connector that is there.  You just need to connect to it with a 2 pin JST connector.	1
So this was my first go at 3d printing, and I knew, getting this printer, what to expect.   Quick note: My review is not labeled as a review by a confirmed purchaser. This is because I actually received the machine as a gift, so yeah. That's that.  Quick note 2: Be advised, this printer can be a bit frustrating at first, and 3d printing is half art, and half science. Once you are familiar with this machine, you'll remember why you bought it.  General Impressions: So the Creator Pro is an amazing machine. Seriously, I've had mine for a few months now, and it's probably the best use of 1000$ I've made in one go. It is a very well built machine, and it is very clear that it was designed with ease of part replacement in mind. Seriously, a monkey with a spanner could probably replace every component in this machine, basically all of which are sold directly from FlashForge, so if a part breaks, fear not, FlashForge has you covered. In more ways than one in fact. It's also precise, simple, and relatively easy to operate.  In the last 2 months I have had this printer, I have had problems, but at the end of the day, they tended to simply be down to user inexperience. I have had one part issue, however this was due to careless handling by the delivery company (UPS I think) which resulted in the threaded z-axis height control rod being misaligned. While this only took me a few seconds to correct, I do have keep a 3mm plastic plate attached to the back of the build plate assembly to ensure it's proper height likely due to this mishap. The only other issues I've had have been extremely minor, and the support department, headed by Mr. Tang was extremely helpful in correcting them, not only responding in a courteous and professional manner, but with clear and concise directions on how to correct issues, as well as labeled pictures. What's more is that FlashForge support responded within hours, sometimes within minutes, and never more than a day. If not for them, this review would have been a star or two lower.   Performance: Once it's properly calibrated, this machine runs like a dream. I've tested the layer height from 0.2 down to 0.1mm, and I have no doubts that it could get even more precise. The print head assembly is very well constructed, and the sturdy, metal guide rods and factory installed belt tensioner springs ensure that every movement this printer makes is precise and accurate. The entire print bed assembly is supported by metal framework and is not susceptible to the plate support warping issues experienced by some printers. Temperature control of the print heads and build platform is exceptional, and I have never seen it fluctuate by more than a degree while the printer was in operation. One of the things about this machine that enables it to run so well is that it is a simple machine inside of a sturdy casing and frame, constructed entirely of metal framework and strong plastic side panels. It's simplicity reduces the chance for something to fail, and makes replacement of parts a breeze. The sturdy vibrates only extremely minorly when the print head is moving rapidly, despite the abnormally heavy dual extruder assembly moving so quickly.   A word of warning: This is a precision machine, and to maintain precision and working order, it is up to you to keep the printer well calibrated and in good repair. If you are inexperienced, or if you are concerned about your abilities to perform maintenance on such a machine, you may want to buy a more entry level printer first, and then work your way up to more serious machines like the Creator Pro. It is very much a serious machine, that produces serious results when operated by serious people.   Pros: - Dual extruders! Got an extruder down for repair? That's fine, because you have two of them. You can load a different type or color of filament in either one, and eliminate the irritation of constantly changing filament, which, by the way, is a trivial task on this printer. - Price: it's basically a Makerbot Replicator with more features and a sturdier structure. Not to mention the exceptional support team. My point is, you're paying 1000$ for a superior version of a 2000$ machine. Do it. - Precision: Once you have all of the kinks worked out of this machine, it produces some of the finest prints you will ever see. - Construction: It's simple, yet sturdy. It doesn't take a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering to replace a part. - Easy to use: The actual operation of this machine is simple and straightforward. So long as you have it calibrated and well cared for, this machine will be the best 1000$ purchase you ever make. - Support: You're not just paying for the printer. You're paying for a printer that is covered by amazing support from Tang's team. - LED Strips: Ok, this isn't really a performance thing, but this thing looks awesome when you set up the LED strips to the right color. This can be done from the control panel in Replicator G while connected to the printer via USB. - Heated build plate: If you have owned a non-HBP printer, you will learn to love this machine very very quickly. - Material variety: This printer runs fine with ABS or PLA, and can run plenty of other filaments.  Cons: - Noise: Ok, it's actually not that bad, and there are worse printers out there about this. The default operation speed on ReplicatorG for Sailfish is 60mm/s, but I highly recommend operating it at it's designed speed of 30mm/s. This will greatly improve precision, and it's much quieter. - Provided Filament: When you order this printer, order yourself some filament from, I don't know, Hatchbox is a good one. Basically, the filament this thing came with was trash. There were major inconsistencies in the width of the two spools of ABS (red/white) that I received. Initially I was concerned that the printer was the issue, but a lovely spool of blue PLA and a drop to 30mm/s changed my mind very quickly.  Words of Wisdom: - Kapton tape is your friend. Use it. - I run mine at 30mm/s for best results, though this was with bad filament. It would probably run alright at higher speeds. - FlashForge support are your friends. If you have an issue, contact them, and don't give up on this printer. If there is an issue, it's probably something simple, like bad filament or, your fault, something like a misleveled build plate. Whether or not it is one of the above, Tang and his team will see to it that it is fixed very, very quickly.  Edit: T+2.5 years and still running better than ever. If there's one thing to be said for these machines, they're workhorses.  And that's it. Basically, if you need a well-built, reliable printer, look no further.	1
I am so glad I purchased this printer for my burgeoning business! This machine is beyond fantastic. I bought the simplify 3d software too just because it's so much easier to use and print files from that than the software that comes with the printer.	1
I did a lot of research before deciding to take the plunge into 3 printing with this Flashforge. Partly on the basis of support most people have said they got from Mr. Tang, but mostly on the number of reviews and how few are rated at 1 or 2 stars. I'm glad I did.  If you haven't been using computers that long, you might not remember the early days. You didn't really buy a computer, you built one from parts. So you needed some tools (mostly screw drivers), but you needed a lot of knowledge about the different components. Does this sound card work with this motherboard, what's the best video card for the price that will work best with this CPU, etc. You had to be willing to get your hands dirty. These days there's a lot less call for that, and a lot less change from month to month (video cards used to be released every month or two for a few years). As long as you understood that, you were good to go. Now, there's a lot less benefit to building your own computer from the ground up, though you can. You just don't tend to save very much due to economies of scale.  3D printing is still in the fairly early days, but it is making the transition into the second phase, where there's less benefit to building your own from parts. You can still save money, and you will learn a lot, and need to know a lot, but with nearly complete units like this, where you just have to assemble the acrylic covers, attach the extruder, and double check the bolts that may have come loose during shipping, you are nearly ready to get started with the fun part: actually printing things!  And that's where the difficulty starts. You have to learn about the different kinds of plastic, print bed surfaces, and temperatures, and options. There's so much advice out there about what temp you should print ABS with, how bad the smell is, why PLA is better, why you should use PETG, etc that your head may start to spin. But that's all very important to learn, and realize you might have a different experience than someone else had because your printer is enclosed and there's wasn't, or they had a different extruder setup, etc. So you will have to be willing to do the work to figure out the best settings for your specific use case, but in my experience so far, it hasn't been too bad.  And that's why I say being from Amazon is a good idea. Not only was the price marked down to $999 multiple times before I decided to buy it, making it a great deal, but you also get access to Mr. Tang. I started emailing him over the weekend with some issues I was having. Pictures, files, links to thingiverse.com models I was having trouble printing, and he was often very quick at responding, even on a Saturday.  My tips for those new to 3D printing. First, bed leveling is absolutely critical. Nothing else matters as much as this. The included instructions are a little lacking, and the video link included was in chinese, so do a search on youtube and you'll find a better video. Basically, the print head will travel to the first location, but you have to grab it and manually move it to the other locations, sliding the piece of paper between the extruders and the bed, trying to feel just a little friction as you slide it around. But the really important part that no one really tells you, is that you feel exactly the same friction under every point! Since this printer has two extruders, you need to make sure both have the same friction so that one doesn't hit the print laid down by the other, and the difference we are talking about is tenths of a millimeter, you can't see the differences with your eyes because it is so small. But once you know that, is gets a lot easier.	1
This is actually the second 3d printer I have owned.  The first was a printrbot simple kit.  I liked learning about how the printer worked, but I had to constantly fiddle with it.  Upgrades to make it fit larger prints as well as replace parts as they died cost me as much as the original printer did.  Building the printerbot took 4 hours, but I spent probably that each week on constant tweeks that it needed to keep it running well.  I had the Flashforge up and running within 15 minutes of plugging it in.  The special surface tape that comes on the bed works terrific with ABS.  The bed and the extruders heat up rather quickly and easily achieve high temperatures.  The precision and speed are both very good.  I initially had problems with the filament slipping off the spools and getting tangled, however a print of this part, downloaded free fixed that.  [...]  I understand that the printer even comes with this part now.  I have over 600 hours on the printer and apart from having to re level the bed from time to time I have had no downtime till this weekend.  My left extruder stopped feeding filament properly.  The assembly is easy to disassemble and there are many youtube videos showing you how.  It turns out that one of the teflon tubes in the nozzle had melted and even caused the nozzle tip to be unusable.  The printer came with two spare teflon tubes and a new nozzle only cost me 15 dollars.  A quick and inexpensive fix, far from my experience with my first printer.  I have printed ABS, PLA, even Dual-extrusion with this printer.  The only negative I have is that mine has no active cooling, though I can add this.  I understand that the current version comes with active cooling for the left extruder head.  When people ask me to recommend a 3d printer I recommend this one.  I say its not the biggest, or the fastest, but its features, simple use, and reliability far outshine any negatives.  It beats any printer in its price range, and even in double its range.  You are looking at 3000-5000 dollars to get slight advantages over this printer.  I did spend the 150 dollars for the slicing software simplify3d and I think that was a great buy.  It slices faster than any other I have ever seen and has excellent default settings for my FlashForge.	1
I've only had this printer for a week, so I may update this review later, but I've already gained a great appreciation for it. First, I've had no previous 3D printing experience, but I have built countless things previously (furniture, houses, drones, etc.). Putting the printer together was no problem, but the directions weren't great--there were a couple of steps (when mounting the extruders) that I had to do in a different order from what the directions indicated. Leveling the platform was a breeze, and the first three prints (the ones that come on the card) came out very nicely. Then I tried to print something that I designed in tinkercad, and it failed--it was my fault, though--I had to learn how and when to use a raft, and how much plastic has to be in contact with the platform to keep the piece stuck down during prints. I also had to clean the platform after every print, and level it every day or two. Now that I've put this thing together and watched it print, I can see why so many 3D printers have such horrible reviews--the process is quite mechanically complicated.  Regarding customer support, I've sent a couple of emails to FlashForge, and gotten very quick replies. One problem they didn't solve at all, but I solved it myself by downloading the programs from their respective web pages (I can never get zipped software to work on my computer). Another problem I solved myself before they got back to me, but again, they were very quick both times. In all, I would say they have excellent customer service.	1
Great value, and very consistent. I would recommend getting Simplify3d (software) for better quality prints.	1
I have a few of these printers now running my business. Really great printer for the price. The one thing that bothered me was un even extruder heads. But a couple pieces of paper under the extruder block on one side that's lower fixes that.	1
Works pretty well.  I found, as has been indicated by other reviewers, that the printer really needed some upgrades in order to create professional quality prints.  Now, it really does do great prints.  First on the list was a filament guide that was not right against the back wall of the printer, for both heat issues and for smooth spooling of the filament.  The upgraded filament guides, and other upgrades mentioned in this review, are all available on Thingiverse and can be printed using the ABS filament supplied by FlashForge.  It's actually pretty nice filament. The software is just adequate; to really do 3D printing properly I felt I needed to get Simplify3D, so I'd suggest budgeting an extra $150 for that.  Maybe not right away, but at some point.  Also I needed to create spool holders for other filament makers' spools -- this is not specifically a problem with the printer, it's due to a complete lack of standardization for filament spools.  Also figure on upgrading to a glass plate print bed at some point -- I used the 1/4" 9 by 6 glass plate that is available on Amazon for $32, but there are other options.  So, I printed glass plate clips and a Z-axis shim, and put the glass plate right on top of the blue Kapton surface that is already on the print bed.  Oh, and a cable clip to keep the filament tubes and cable harness from flopping around.  A door hold-open clip is almost mandatory -- it reduces cursing...  Once those upgrades were complete, I had a nice, capable 3D printer.  So IMNSHO, I think the manufacturer ought to address some or all of these issues.  By the time I had all these upgrades generated and installed, I had a little experience with the printer itself and with 3D printing in general, so on the plus side I guess I'm no longer a beginner.  Hair spray on glass, check.  Works great. Spray the glass plate OUTSIDE the printer, clip it in and pre-heat the bed.  Then level the bed.  Got a spool of crappy filament that Amazon replaced, check.  Oh, and that leveling card FlashForge gives you?  NOT heat-resistant.  Interesting; I found that leveling should be done with the bed at the temperature you will be printing, particularly with a glass bed.  I used a micrometer on that leveling card, and found that a piece of note paper folded to 3 layers came out to about the same width.  A digital micrometer is a very useful purchase if you don't have one.  I haven't bought a feeler gauge for leveling, probably should.  For any newbies out there (like I was), I think it's a huge advantage to have Amazon behind you as you work through these issues, just in case you really do get a substandard product and need it refunded/replaced.  Most of my issues were due to the learning curve, and in a couple cases I did rely on Amazon Customer Support.  And by the way, Amazon's Customer Support contact at FlashForge really is great, I've contacted him a couple times.  They've been very responsive and helpful.	1
I LOVE this printer. I upgraded from a DaVinci 1.0A which was my first 3D printer. It was time for something else so initially I tried a different design and went with a kit 3D printer of the delta design from Geeetech. It was a terrinle printer which required LOTS of tweaking to make a decent print. I gave up fiddling with it after I realized the bearings etc were all garbage so I decided to go to the Flashforge Creator Pro since it was recommended on many reviews.  I loved the "out of the box" printing this printer has given me. I unpacked the printer and all the stuff jammed inside it, loaded up the filament and I was printing. The first thing I printed was the traffic cone so I could see what a dual-extruder was all about. I am amazed at how nice it turned out.  The next thing I printed was a new filament feed assembly for the back of the printer since the design from Flashforge is completely useless and will cause the filament to come off the spool and wind up around the spool holder as it feeds into the tubes. I knew this was going to be a problem since I did my research and went with the one people seem to like the most :  [...]  The next thing I printed was a test part to see how good a 3D printer is and WOW! it came out amazing. So much better than my DaVinci 1.0a ever did, and way more better than the Geeetech delta "tried" to print.  I have attached a picture of the test print and here is the file: [...]  I plan on printing many things with this printer and it has already been running for the last 20 hours on many prints back-to-back.  One tip:  I still apply a thin layer of glue stick to the print surface otherwise the PLA does not want to stick very well. When the print cools, I need to pop it off with a little spatula.  Without the glue, the first layer was not sticking very well.	1
What can I say?  Nice printer, fast and accurate.  I have printed PLA, ABS (it came with two spools), Ninjaflex and Polyflex.  Pair it with Simplify3D and you'll have a nice little factory.	1
wanted to point out that this printer is sold by flashforge distributor from china - mr. Tang. For those who think it is a knock off, it is not. Same exact model, just shipped from China directly. Let me start from instructions for assembly and everything else - they are AWESOME. I have never seen anyone invest so much time and effort into providing such an instructions that a caveman will understand even :D I did run into several difficulties with this printer and had to unfortunately replace the first one, but the problem was the screw only, and I did not want to bother manual repairing when already paid $1000 for the product. If you expect a perfect model, get something else. This does require tweaking. I however managed to set it up to print ABS in perfect shape without any problems or warping. When buying this printer, you HAVE TO buy right away (for ABS mostly, I only do ABS):  1) Kapton tape 2) Acetone  When purchased, you have to add mods to it (thingiverse website), porint those mods and install.  1) top filement and wire guide 2) back filament guide plate. (you HAVE to install this to avoid problems and tangling) 3) LEVEL THE BED. LEVEL. LEVEL.... this printer requires several leveling until it breaks in. Not sure why but both printers that i had had will horribly unlevel after first several prints. Just be patient, with every next leveling procedure unlevel will decrease. After around 4-5 procedures it will not unlevel any longer. I do however check level before printing large objects once in a while.	1
We have been printing with this thing constantly since we unboxed it on 26th December.  Couldn't find the SD card at first, but gladly it was stuffed in the spool holder (!) and we found it later.  We use the SD for all prints so that our computer can just go to sleep and not impede printing.  Printer does exactly what it is told.  Hardware wise, the door hinge screws that attach the door to the body were a little short and we had to substitute longer screws from the garage junk pile.  Luckily we had a few spares that were the exact same thread.  The Replicator G software works robustly and works very well when it receives a good STL file.  It is slow, compared to using the MakerBot Desktop software which is totally compatible and exports x3g files onto the SD card no problem.  We use SketchUp to combine STLs for printing all at once and for making new parts to print, and it works just fine.  However, if you get a bad STL, use the Microsoft Model Repair Service to get better prints.  (https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/)  The manual is VERY sparse and accidentially leaves out when you should turn on the printer.  You can turn it on right before you plug in the USB cord.  It still works and gets up and running.  You don't actually ever have to connect it to the computer to get it to print things if you use the SD card.  On the included blue sheets adhered to the platform, we got a few prints before things wouldn't stick.  Using quality 3M brand blue tape with PLA or ABS and a raft works well, but things don't like to stick without the raft.  Be sure to re-level your platform.  The extruder head doesn't move around to multiple locations when platform leveling, so be sure to move it around gently on your own and just do your best to get resistance on the sheet at all locations.  Also the firmware says to press the M button when completed, it should say the OK button.  We never really figured out "filament unloading" but may have done it wrong.  Seems like filament is very difficult to yank out of the printer even when depressing the tabs on the extruder head.  So instead, we just "load filament" by cutting off the existing filament above the extruder about a half inch (be very careful of the control wires!) and then we push in the new filament behind the old, but only once the printer is ready for loading.  Works best and no being harsh on the extruder.  We are totally printing two colors with this printer and it works well.  We contacted the support person Mr. Tang and he responded within 15 or so hours due to the time difference with China.  He was very helpful and made recommendations for solving the problem which wasn't the printer or the software (it was a bad STL file).  Wanting to use the dissolvable PVA for support material and normal filament for prints?  The only way we've found is to use the Makerbot Desktop software when using dissolvable PVA for the support material.  Makerbot Desktop may actually work better for two color prints as well.  You have to use two separate STL files for two color prints and have had some success with the Replicator G software, although some dragging of the second extruder happened when printing color two over top of color 1.  Be very cautious of certain filaments - we've had great success with Hatchbox PLA including the wood version, but not the best success with others.  Our printer came with two spools of ABS - red and white.  We used the red successfully with supports and raft to print more versatile spoolholders we found on thingiverse for this printer.  The ones we printed have held up well but still weren't long enough for a spool of clear PET that we bought, needs to be about 10mm longer.  All in all a fantastic machine that kids and adults of all ages can enjoy.  Wish I had seen the lower priced MonoPrice printer (same printer no covers) and there was even 15% more off right after Christmas, but am still happy with this purchase.  And the FlashForge printer does come with the front cover and top cover although we only have used them for ABS.  With PLA you leave them off and open for the purpose of best airflow.  BTW I am a mechanical engineer and was familiar with CAD and Sketchup before making this purchase.  We have tinkered a lot with the prints, the settings, the printer and other items but I don't think you have to be an engineer to make it work.  We literally plugged in STL files and ran it with supports or no supports and used info from reviews on Amazon to optimize and improve.  Now, the kids give their friends a print of something off thingiverse whenever they come over.	1
I was shipped a dud with a bad motherboard (Dec 2015). UPDATE: I was promptly sent a new motherboard, which fixed the problem. The customer support guy, Tang, has been extremely helpful. He sent me the replacement parts I need with no questions asked, and has checked back with me many times just to make sure the machine is in perfect order. I have been running the printer for 24 hours a day for the past three weeks. I am printing high-temp carbon-fiber-reinforced filaments that are rough on a printer. Using these materials you need a new hardened steel nozzle after two rolls of filament. I'm happy to report that the machine is no worse for wear and has already paid for itself. I am buying three more printers because I'm confident Flash Forge will support their product. Whatever your application or skill level I highly recommend buying the simplify3D program. It's $150 and works much better than the free software available. Think of this 3d printer like you would a table saw; the novice can't walk up to it and make a perfect dovetail box, but as your experience and skills grow, you can find ways to make anything you want with a very high level of precision. It's not like an iPad that's going to give you instant gratification with the push of a button.	1
I received my printer a few weeks ago and so far it works pretty good.  The minimal assembly was fairly easy straightforward however I got most of my instructions from youtube.  Only two issues so far one of which was the the extruder nozzles were not exactly the same height and one was dragging a little but the extruder assembly is relatively easy to disassemble and I was able to get them aligned with the use of my dial calipers.  The other minor issue is the filament spool holders which work for the supplied filament but most of my other filament spools would not fit as their inner diameters were too small. Not a big issue as I can obviously just print myself some different spool holders. The supplied filament however did not work that well and clogged my extruders a couple of times.  Overall, the construction is decent, it produces good prints and I haven't had any major issues so far.	1
if your going to get into 3d printing don't bother with buying the wood frame one. This is wayyyy better For only a few hundred more.	1
A rock solid printer with very little setup, it comes nearly ready to print.	1
I upgraded to the Flashforge Creator Pro (2015 model, with the Z hook spool holder) from a Makerfarm I8V Reprap printer. With the enclosed design I can now print also ABS with virtually no curling which is great. It also has a very strong cooling fan for PLA which result in perfectly accurate PLA prints, even those with sharp tips. The cooling fan is so strong that I can sometimes hear from the other room whistling when the nozzle passes over an infill grid. Overall this printer works very well and I am very happy with it and the support by Mr. Tang is extremely responsive.  Things I would improve (in arbitrary order)  * The display is at the bottom of the printer and is vertical, this makes it difficult to red when standing near the printer. A slanted display will be much more user friendly.  * The dome is made of laser cut acrylic flat sheets attached with screws and is flimsy. A single piece dome similar to Makerbot will be an improvement.  * Filament Loading/unloading is much more complex than on my RepRap and takes a few minutes. With the RepRap I was just pressing the release lever, pulling the old filament, inserting the new one and release.  * The firmware uses Makerbot's binary variant of gcode. This makes it incompatible with popular slicers such as Cura and makes typing gcode more tedious. I am using it with Simplifiy3D.  Overall it's an excellent printer at a good price and I would recommend it for everybody that is in the market for this price range.	1
Works as expected... would buy again!	1
fast shipping and product was rapped well in package	1
Great seller, will buy again	1
I have been looking at 3d printers for a while but have always talked myself out of taking the leap and spending the money. But, I've been working with my daughter on our "Halloween project" which is us playing around with lights and sounds and making our own Halloween decorations. Part of this project involves making enclosures for things. With that in mind, I cleared it with the financial department that I could go out and spend a $1000 on a new toy (after a month of spending on electronics equipment) There are a ton of options out there for printers, so what made me pick this printer?  I looked at a few factors;   - Out of the box / assembly required  - Cost  - Reviews involving customer support  - Bed size  I had recently seen a lower cost printer that required a lot of assembly. I assisted with the build and let me tell you, it was satisfying. But, it took 6 hours and at the end there were a few problems that had to be ironed out. I never saw a print. If I had the patience and the will power to want to understand every single detail right off, this would have been a route I considered (still might be when I get better at this whole thing). But, the fact that the Flashforge comes pretty much assembled helped me a lot. You do have to assemble the "roof" (the hardest part is peeling the paper off the plastic sheets), attach the extruder assembly and put the door on, that's it. 40 minutes if you're taking your time and being thorough.  Cost. I managed to snag this printer when it was on sale for $959 last week. What a bargain! But, having used the printer. The $1200 it's normally at would be well worth the cost.  I always start with looking at the negative reviews first, and when buying something that I know I might require support on I read all those reviews very carefully (paying attention to the dates of the review, customer service can improve as easily as it can degrade). The reviews were generally complementary. The printer comes with a badge attached to it with the name an email of the person you contact, Tang.  The bed size is not the biggest in class, there are bigger. But at 9"x6"x6" (roughly) the bed size is pretty decent for most of the prints I'm going to want to do. There are printers that cost a lot more and have a smaller bed, there are printers that cost a little less but have a tiny bed in comparison so I wanted to give myself enough space.  On the support front, I did need to contact Tang as I didn't have a few of the parts. He was very polite and responded extremely quickly (over the weekend). We went back and forth to be sure I was following the correct guides and looking in the correct places, I can totally understand not wanting to ship me new parts if I've been an idiot and misplaced them or thrown them out. I was missing the screws that hold the extruder down (there were extras of a slightly larger size that I used and are holding just fine for now, prints are working)  I've had the printer for 3 days now, and I just love sitting watching the thing make things. I have designed a few of my cases for the project so far and printed a few designs off for my wife (had to prove the printer was worth the money) and my daughter. I can honestly say I do not regret this purchase in any single way. The printer is built extremely well, everything fits fine and everything is printing just great. Now I just have to get a little more imaginative. After looking at other printers like the Printrbot, Makerbot and the whole raft of DIY printers, no other option would give me a heated bed with a reasonable build platform and dual extruders for the money. Going down the line, I know there will be maintenance costs, I know I'll have to replace parts or I'll screw something up and spend time learning how to fix it. But, quite simply, the out of the box experience for me could not have been better.  Things I would recommend to new owners;   - Buy the 3d print removal tool, it's basically a thin piece of metal but will make your life much easier for $5!  - Makerbot's software works just fine, sometimes I have to restart the service on my mac for it to recognize the FlashForge but it works and is the quickest and simplest to print from so far although Simplify3d is definitely worth the money. Nothing in the Makerbot tool asks me about what type of plastic I'm using, so be careful as the default temperatures would be kind of high for PLA  - If you buy Hatchbox spools, they will not fit on the spool holder on the back of this printer. There is however a great design on thingiverse that you can have printed in 3 hours that gives you a spool holder that will hold them so you don't have to worry about that.  - Register on 3d forums and read up on some of the tips and tricks people have.  In summary, this is without a doubt the best gadgety thing I have ever owned, it's sturdy and I love how easy it is to get things printing. Now my imagination is running on what I can print next and my credit card loves me because I'm treating filament like it's a collectable!	1
We have been using this for about 5 months now and this printer works great!  The print quality is very good and strong. It came with two big rolls of ABS, one white and one red.  We save the sliced files on a  sd card from one computer then plug the sd card into the printer and print from that. It is kinda loud with the fans and the servo motors make noise when they are printing. We put the printer in a cabinet made for old huge television sets. We close the doors on the cabinet and this cuts down on the noise big time. Sometimes the prints stick to the platform. Heating up the platform makes it easier to remove. Overall we are very pleased with this printer.	1
It's a nice printer.  Setup is more intense than other things these days.  But I got mine going without an issue.  The first print was great.  I discovered the hard way though that the print area is 8.8" WIDE, 5.7"deep, and 5.9"high.  Not 8.8 high...	1
470 hrs of printing so far not a bit of trouble ! Best printer for the money! My first print was a  20 mm test cube it came out 19.98 x 20.00 x 19.97!!! Super easy to set up !!	1
Excellent printer, love it - top notch quality prints and easy to use. Highly recommended for the price!	1
This is a great printer for the price range, just be patient (for those who's struggling for adhesion) take a time and know your machine, don't expect to be printing right away out of the box... Once you setup everything correctly and got the best printing settings... You're good to go, take time to know and get the "sweet spot". After some tryings I start getting some really good printings comparable to my other makerbot rep2 machines. I'm thinking to add a fan to cool down the layer's and maybe a glass bed.  Great costumer service as well Mr. Tang is a great profesional guy, quick mailing response and answer me tons of questions, offers technical guidance too if you want it. Only need to ask, he will take your printer go the right way.	1
This is a great 3D printer at an affordable price point. Build quality is superb and customer service (Tang, the main rep for Amazon purchases) is extremely helpful. If you are thinking of dipping your feet into 3D printing, you cannot go wrong with the flashforge. I have not had any major issues and there is a lot of support out there in terms of troubleshooting/tweaking. First mod I would recommend is printing and installing an active cooling fan. The flashforge motherboard already has an aux. slot for a cooling fan so if you choose to run your active cooling fan's 24V power source from the motherboard you can control the fan through the front display and/or through the Gcode which is really handy! The cooling fan does wonders for bridges/small details in prints.  update 6/23/15 I have run into a few issues with my printer but I cannot say enough how helpful Tang and his team are in troubleshooting. Their ability to answer emails promptly and the amount of detail in their troubleshooting steps/tips (they include pictures and video!) helped me fix all the problems I was having. Great customer service is what bring loyalty and Tang is an excellent example of this. With this kind of support, I will be following the FlashForge team for a while.	1
I love this printer. I now own 4 3d printers (this one, 2 Da Vinci printers, and just recently a Prusa i3 kit) and so far, this is by far my favorite. It is, as others have mentioned, a Makerbot Replicator clone with enhancements. I've now printed over 600 hours, for a total of more than 5 kilometers of filament; about half ABS and half PLA. I didn't even have to unclog either nozzle until about 450 hours; I still have the original Kapton tape on the platform, although it's getting flaky and it's about time to replace it.  The machine is small and compact, just barely larger than the platform, unlike some other big machines with small platforms. I've been able to print both ABS and PLA. I haven't been able to print NinjaFlex, not surprisingly, but apparently there is a carriage upgrade that might work for that.  Customer service is helpful, although I haven't had to contact them much because for the most part, the machine just works or it's obvious how to fix it. The only thing I really wish was improved is the print volume. 150mm x 228mm x 150mm is pretty good, but it would be nice to have a larger print volume. The demo object (a traffic cone) is cute. Everyone likes it.  Miscellaneous tips:  In order to print at high speeds, you may need to tie down the machine to something heavy in order to distribute the vibrations over a larger weight. Removing one of the extruders would probably help also, if possible.  If you're only using one nozzle, try removing the other nozzle so that it doesn't bump up against your print. I am much happier after I figured this out.  Also if you're only using one nozzle, you should be able to print in a larger area (at least about 228 + 33 = 261mm in the x direction, since 33mm is the nozzle spacing) if you get a larger build plate. I purchased a borosilicate plate from MatterHackers here for this purpose, but I haven't installed it yet.  In order to avoid damaging and having to replace the Kapton tape, the most important piece of advice I can give you is: be patient with ABS. Do not try to remove it until the platform cools down. You can of course use an extra fan or a can of cold "air" (normally for dusting) for this purpose.  Eventually you'll need to unclog the nozzles or purchase replacements (which don't seem to be available on amazon -- they use M7 threads instead of the more commonly available M6 threads, at least in the newer models -- but I did swim out into the bay of E, and find them there). Some people like burning it out with a butane blowtorch. I had only an electric heat gun available, and I found that using a heat gun in combination with a 0.4mm drill bit works. (Either heat the nozzle and drill into it from behind, or put the nozzle itself on the drill, hold the bit steady, and insert the bit by hand or held by a pliers into the nozzle).	1
I've run about three full spools of filament through it so far and it has worked great. Not always flawless, but that is more my doing than the bot's. I am using it in a high school and it draws a tremendous amount of interest. Kids are designing their own prints.	1
I don't know what to say other than this machine exceeded my expectations very quickly.  I was expecting quite a bit of work to get this up and running due to setup and calibration that I expected to do.  I thought it was great that the seller sent the manual via email as the item shipped so that you can familiarize yourself with the setup before the unit arrives although this is part of what worried me.  The manual was somewhat difficult to read when it came to the screenshots of the recommended settings which I had to zoom in on to read, it would have been nice to actually print the recommended settings instead of just a screenshot.  There were also a couple of sections that didn't make a lot of sense or redirected you to a video of someone assembling pieces while speaking in what I am guessing is Chinese.  The video was not a huge issue as it still shows you how to assemble the pieces if you really need it, I found it straight forward even without the video but I must admit I watched part of it before the unit arrived.  I also found that there were a couple of differences from the manual such as how the filament spool holders mount to the unit, the new way appears much simpler than the manual shows and is easy to figure out so again this was not a big deal.  It took me about 15 minutes to unpack the very well packed box and get both filaments loaded.  After about another 15-20 minutes of doing the build plate leveling adjustment (which was actually a bit easier than I had expected based on the manual) I already had the machine connected via USB and printing a simple 20mm cube to test.  The final product took about 12 minutes and had a couple of blemishes but overall was a lot smoother than I had expected, I am sure with a little fine tuning those slight blemishes could be worked out.  All in all this 3D printer is fairly simple to setup as long as you are somewhat technically savvy which I would expect anyone buying one of these to be but with a little patience anyone can probably be up and running within a few hours.  I will update my review if anything changes but I expect that this machine will be worth every penny.  Update:  I ran into my first problem with the printer a few prints but I must say Tang from support was very responsive and knowledgeable.  The problem I had was one of the end-stop switches was broken (x axis switch, metal tab that activates switch broke off due to cracked plastic housing).  Tang knew what the issue was by me just describing the problem (made awful grinding noise when moving to home position to start a print) and had a replacement switch sent via priority mail immediately (shipped same day after confirming the issue).  I was told that the switch likely cracked during shipment and just took time for the metal tab to fall off and cause the issue.  I will update if this doesn't appear to be the case but so far the replacement switch has worked perfectly and none of the other switches (there are 2 others that are exactly the same for y and z axis) are still working perfectly fine as well.  I think it would be nice to provide an extra end-stop switch instead of the extra cable since I am not sure why a cable would go bad before a switch since they are all tied in place and never move or get touched for that matter but as long as support is as responsive as they have been I am happy.	1
My first 3D printer and I'm glad I went with FlashForge!  Great customer support and easy to use.  I use MakerBot instead of the ReplicatorG for actual printing.  I use the RelpicatorG for some of the modification of the item prior to printing.  So far I have printed with ABS, PLA, PETG, HIPS, and flex filaments.  This printer has done great with all of them.  Like many things there is a learning curve and experimentation is key.  For me that is part of the fun in 3D printing- playing with all of the parameters to see what works best.  There are many clones of this model that are less expensive but it's hard to put a price on quality customer support!	1
LOVE IT.  I have several printers and run them non stop.  This is my new favorite in the price range.  The metal frame is very sturdy for the price.  Every screw is super tight- and seemingly thread locked in-  so no rattling.  I opened the box- assembled a few things and both heads printed perfectly the first try.  The hood is silly laser cut acrylic with screws, but this is just to rush to market.. the new model has a better set up.  I liek to modify my machines and although it isn't open source it is easily modified, and has a nice open frame to work in.	1
It does a pretty good job at printing.  I'm quite impressed...  The instructions have a lot to be desired and are incredibly vague.  There is a video on YouTube that shows it being put together.  Forum support is wonderful.  If you get stuck, the forums are where you need to go for help.  Setup was easy and I was printing my first object within an hour or so of unpacking it.  Like most other 3D printers in this price range, there is a bit of tinkering you'll have to do from time to time.  Most importantly, it is essential that your build plate is nice and level, otherwise your objects will either be off or will get drug around by the extruder.  Also make sure your extruder is clean and free from goo from previous prints BEFORE they start warming up...otherwise you'll burn your fingers.  The only thing that I had to change was the awful LCD that you can't read from any other angle but straight on.  I replaced it with a Vacuum Fluorescent Display (Noritake) that I bought from DigiKey that ran about $85.  I tried an OLED display but had problems with character generation (may have been a defective display).  I have 10 spools of PLA in every color and they all extrude at different temperatures which you will have to set manually when generating the file for printing.  You'll eventually figure out what works best.  Filaments from different manufacturers are also quirky in this regard...and probably vary slightly depending on which lot they are from.  I have not really had any issues in the 20 or so objects I've printed other than the rare occurrence of the object not bonding well to the build plate and being pushed around by the extruder.  (pros) Fairly inexpensive compared to other dual extruder models. Decent build quality. Sounds cool when operating! It's a freakin' 3D printer!  (cons) Lousy looking LCD display. It's not a Connex Objet printer...but then again, I don't want to try to explain to my wife that I spent $120,000 for a toy.  I got in enough trouble for this one.	1
This is one of the best printers in the market for dual extruder and with such price. its come out of the box with easy install, and all the tools you need, the print quality is very good, and less problems with prints. mine had a bad extruder probably it got damaged from the shipping, however you get 5 star customer support, and the person from flashforge guide me through troubleshooting and adjusting the printer, he was very patient and very supportive, this makes me very comfortable with this printer my friend bought it too after my recommendation and he got great prints, and haven't had any problems. the slicer software that come with it is not the best though I recommend finding an alternative, there is many free ones in the market, I use Simplify 3d which is $150 but its little confusing at first, and its expensive compared to many free ones. leveling the bed is not easy but its the same with all 3d printers I wish this in the future be easier, I leveled my bed using the Simplify 3d software as I find leveling it through the printer it self not enough to get better prints. the build area is fairly enough, I wish it was bigger but as I been told by flashforge they not intend to make any bigger ones, I seen big build beds but the price rise up double for just 1 or 2 inchs. over all this is a very good printer, the price worth it and the support is amazing!	1
It is now 10/2017) and I purchased my printer in 2014.. Sooner or later you will want to try other types of filaments. For the most part, the printer has held up well and I have learned a lot about 3D printing. The machine is not perfect and I have had my share of jammed filaments and bad prints. Recently, I was getting constant filament jams and was baffled by the cause. I ended up replacing the heads and PTFT tubes and that did not eliminate the problem. I soon discovered the issue that contributed to the jams was related to the filament on the spool. I noticed the problem seems to happen frequently when the filament was nearing the end on the spool about 1/4 of material left on the spool. I noticed the filament was wound pretty tight as it got less and less and it was just enough so the feed mechanism could pull it. So, I started unwinding the filament on spool by hand to make it real loose.  Sure enough, this reduced the problem. All in all it is good. I am going to sell this printed and get a Raise3D later on.  I worked with many 3D printers (Cube, Makerbot Replicator and RepRap) and did weeks of research before deciding on this one. It was down to Flashforge Pro and Printrbot Metal Plus. I gave up the 10X10X10 bed size on the Printrbot for this smaller one due to the reviews I read from other people. Also, the new printrbot just came out and had no history or review and I am not sure if this a real company or a garage operations. Anyway, got the Flashforge and did a couple of prints that were way off. The edges lifted of like crazy. Finally, after some experimentation I was able to get the object to come out near perfect. There is no such thing as 100% perfections with 3D printers. My setting will vary from yours but this is what I used. I live is Florida and the unit is in my garage where the ambient temp is abut 70+ Rule #1:  Level, level, level and then level again PLA --  heat bed set at 70C Extruder temp set at 220 C Speed was adjusted to 45/55-60 Right as the temp reaches 190, I spray some super hold hair spray on a soft cloth and apply it to the bed outline the area of print. Be careful the bed is hot. I used the Kapton tape that came with the bed. I did try blue tape but took it out. I printed a object about 7 inches long by .25H x .25 D for test.  The edge tolerances were about .03 mm to .05 mm off. I believe this was probably due to the bed not being level. But the quality was really great. I just have to make some minor adjustment but it should be okay. Overall, I have to say that 3D printers are not plug and play like some people think. It does require a lot of it of patience. My FabLab is now complete. 3d printer, CNC machine and other cool equipment.	1
I got this printer because I was fed up with tinkering with my PrintrBot Metal. I could not have been happier with the result. The setup was very fast. In fact, the most difficult part was switching the power on the the bottom of the printer. The switch is kind of buried under there. Once it was up, I leveled it within a couple minutes, and was successfully printing test prints on the first try. Since then, I have a great success rate with all kinds of prints. I love having the dual extruder as well, although I'm still learning how to incorporate that into my designs. The only improvements I'd really like to see are a larger access door (it can be cramped when you have to work inside it) and a faster bed heater (it can take quite a while for that to come to temperature). I can't say for sure how this printer stacks up against the others, besides my Printrbot, but I don't see how it can be beat for the price. The quality of the prints seems very good.	1
Short version:  Not a beginners toy.  Requires some tinkering and TLC to get perfect prints after it arrives.  It can do amazing things once you get comfortable with it.  Long version: Pros: -Well-built -Good value -Great potential -Great support (email) -Great performance (once dialed-in)  Cons: -Requires tinkering (if thats not for you, look elsewhere) -Kapton tape (more below)  Details: Mine arrived on-time via Prime.  The box was beat up, but nothing was broken or even out of place inside (well done!).  Opened it up to do an inventory and inspection to find everything promised plus a few spare parts.  This, in my opinion, is a sign of a professional operation. Followed directions and completed the couple of steps to get it operational.  Kit came with two spools of ABS instead of one each of ABS and PLA, but Ive no issue with that.  Also, these were not starter spools, but full, 1kg, labeled products.  Very generous! Instructions stated that the bed was pre-leveled at the factory, but given the condition of the box, I performed the procedure anyway.  I found that my extruder nozzles were not mounted at the same height, which caused me to tear the pre-installed kapton tape during my first level.  Later this caused one nozzle to drag across a print.  (If you are experienced or know about kapton tape prior to purchasing, you can easily avoid this.) Except for a 9-day break that took me away from home, its been running non-stop.  The machine is based on open source origins, as is the software that comes on the included SD card.  Its compatible with many other software packages of the same type.  Overall, Id say this is a mid- to high-range machine, well above and beyond basic capabilities but just shy of some of the professional features (and price).  My rating would be 4.5 stars because of the nozzle and kapton tape, but I would DEFINITELY buy again, especially from this source.  Also, a big salute to Tang for his friendly and efficient support!	1
This is a great printer!  Solid and dependable so far.  Here are the things I would add or change...  1 - Put some guards over the cooling fans. 2 - Add a PLA cooling fan option. 3 - Move cutout notch by the door handle down a little bit, so it is flush with the floor of the printer.  This would make cleaning out the inside of the printer much easier... you could just sweep junk out the door.	1
I have had this printer for about a week now and I couldn't be more happier. Well actually I could.. I have had some issues with printing over the USB cable to the computer. Sometimes about half way through the print, it would just stop printing. I thought it could be power saving mode on the USB ports or maybe something to do with a screensaver. So I switched from my laptop to a desktop and the same thing happened. I have not tried a different cable, but I suppose that could be something that is causing issues. However when using the SD card to print via the printers on board SD slot I have had no such issues. Both of the print heads seem to have already been calibrated and leveled.  EDIT: It has been a few months since this review and to be honest I find that only using the SD isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Before I had to have a dedicated computer hooked up to the printer for however long the print would take. Sometimes that could be days. So being able to use the SD Card instead of the cable is awesome.  I have been able to print out Ninjaflex but the speed at which the extruder moves has to be slowed way down in order to print with NinjaFlex Mostly I use PLA with this printer. I would recommend buying a piece of borosilicate glass to add onto the heated print bed.  ATTN those who order this printer from Amazon. When I originally ordered mine there was a $150 rebate form that you could fill out to receive a rebate. So I filled it out and mailed it in within the time frame stated. Just recently I made contact with Flashforge and I was told I could not receive the rebate due to the fact that I bought the printer through Amazon. So just FYI to those who purchase thinking that they will have those rebates honored.	1
Short Story:  I purchased the FlashForge 3d Printer Creator Pro in mid December 2014 and started using it on December 25th.  I have printed ABS things that came with it, an ABS bicycle I created with SketchUp, and a wrench using PLA glow-in-the dark filament.  Everything works great.  This is a fantastic machine and technology.  And I had a couple of questions and the legendary Tang answered the first email within an hour on Christmas Eve and the second email within an hour on Christmas morning (Central Standard Time).  Great product, great service and the concept of 3d printing is really cool.  Long Story:  I got interested in 3d printing about a year ago and began shopping and reading web sites.  I noticed that the machines were getting less expensive and per the reviews, more reliable.  In early December I decided it was time to buy one and I suggested to my wife that I was going to do this and it could be my Christmas present.  She said that was fine, but I could not open it until Christmas day.  That was not what I intended but it turned out to be a good thing.  For the 3 weeks or so before Christmas I read everything I could find about how to set up and use this printer. The first thing I discovered is that there is a lot of software involved, and three ways to get objects to the printer.  First, you can download files from the internet.  Second you can create an object then print it, and third you can buy a scanner, scan an object, and then print it.  And you can combine elements of all of those.  You could download a file, merge that with something you scanned, and then import that file into a 3D modeling software like Google SketchUp and modify it.  Im a baby boomer and we all learned things by reading the manual.  Kids today never bothered with manuals so when they started inventing all this stuff they don't bother writing manuals.  You have to figure everything out by reading Customer Reviews and researching on the internet. Scanning.  I purchased a Matter and Form MFS1v1 3d scanner.  I wrote a review about it, so won't repeat that here.  It works. Create a Model of your own design.  You have to learn to use a software program to do this.  I selected SketchUp because there are good reviews and it is free.  But there are no manuals.  You load it on your PC, then work through 4 training tutorials provided by Google, then you just have to do google searches to try to figure out everything else you need to know to create an object that you can print.  Here is what I learned about SketchUp essential to 3D printing:  1. Build your object in a large size, then let the printing software (more on that later) reduce it in size.  SketchUp was developed as a 3d tool for architecture and lacks the ability to make very tiny parts.  But you can make a big part with high detail then reduce it.  2. Every time you create an object on SketchUp  you must select it then make a group.  Then you right-click and look at Entity Info.  If you see volume you have created a solid that will print on a 3d printer.  If you try to print something that is not a solid the print software will discover manifold problems, and the print won't work.  3. After you create solids, you join them together using a tool called outer shell.  This is the tool on SketchUp 2015.  I think tools on earlier versions had other names.  You get to this tool by: View, Toolbars, Solid Tools.  A bunch of solid objects joined together with Outer Shell result in a model that can be printed.  4. When you first download Sketchup you get the Pro version (for 30 days).  With the pro version you get other Solid Tools and you can output object files.  I got so frustrated that I could not get objects to print properly (just using the print preparation software  see below) that I bought the Pro version.  I now don't think you need it.  The free version will output STL files and the Print Prep software can use either an STL file or and OBJ file  5. When you are finished building your object  export it as on OBJ file or Export it as an STL file.  To export as an STL file you have to add the STL functionality to your SketchUp program.  Again, just Google: Add STL to Sketchup and you will discover how to do this  Convert your File to a Print File:  Next  you prepare your file to print.  This is required regardless of whether you download a model from the internet of use a model you created from SketchUp.  You must have software that is capable of creating a file in the format expected by your printer.  The Print File provides all the info the printer requires heat the extruders, move the print bed, move the extruders, push out the plastic, and so on.  The directions that come with this printer instruct the user how to download free software and install it  along with other programs and drivers and so on.  I found this baffling and for $140 bought Simplify3D, which is an alternative to the free software.  Simplify3D has about 9 tutorials that explain how to use it.  Remember, Im killing time until Christmas and working through these was very helpful.  When you first launch Simplify3D you tell it the brand and model of your printer.  Then, as you import the model you either created or downloaded, the software has preconfigured processes to facilitate printing.  You can change all these but I found the defaults to work great.  When you are ready to print the software shows you an extruder suspended in space above a print bed and it prints your model, on your computer screen.  You can watch it and use the repair menu to find all the problems  before even using the actual printer.  When you have the model printing correctly on your PC, you move the file to the actual printer.  But this is the cool thing  if you are thinking about buying a 3D printer  get SketchUp and buy Simplify3d.  Make some models; see how they print.  You can learn an awful lot before making the leap to buy the printer.  Now to the FlashForge  It came, from Amazon, in two days.  It was packed well and everything was in it. The instructions for assembly are clear  but I also found a video of how to assemble a slightly older version that was helpful. This version includes an acrylic cover and front door that help keep the temperature constant which is useful for ABS printing.  The instructions that come with the printer provide a web site with a video that shows how to assemble the acrylic cover that goes on the top of the machine.  Hint:  Take all the protective paper off the acrylic, use some of the painters tape that comes with the printer to tape the acrylic pieces together, install the screws, and remove the tape.  This is a lot easier than the process in the video.  It took 20 minutes and a lot of patience to get the print bed level.  I finally settled on this procedure  Launch the Level Build Plate on the printer, push the extruder assembly until it is right above the leveling wing-nut closest to you.  Adjust that wing-nut until paper just barely slides; move extruder until it is above the other wing nuts and do the same thing.  You just push it with your hands.  Keep moving the extruder and adjusting the wing nuts until paper just slides, anywhere on the bed.  Printing was the easiest part.  First, I printed the objects that are on the SD card that comes with the machine.  These printed fine.  I was a little impatient getting the first print off the print bed, which has a layer of Kapton tape. I used a sharp knife from the kitchen to pop the model loose and actually cut into the tape.  So on every subsequent print there is a little flap of Kapton tape sticking up.  Note, however that when you use the Printing Software (in my example Simplify3D), you can check a box for Include Raft.  When you do this, the printer creates a lattice of plastic under your actual object.  That lattice just peels right off when finished.  And the lattice covers up the Kapton tape tear and minor imperfections in levelling.  Then I moved to printing from my PC.  I could not load the driver necessary to connect my PC directly to the printer  but just copied ready-to-print files from Simplify3D to the SDCH card that came with the printer.  Then put the SDCH card in the printer and it works fine.  ABS.  First 10 prints were using the ABS filament that came with the printer.  I had studied all the settings and variables available to control the print  but when it came time to do it I just told the Simplify3D software that I was using ABS and wanted a raft and everything came out fine.  NOTE regarding Supports.  The reason I bought a two extruder printer was because I thought you needed a second extruder to generate supports for parts with a big overhang, using one of those soluble plastics that can later be dissolved.  It turns out that the Simplify3D software (and probably most others) can print supports just using the same ABS spool as your model.  Somehow the supports are printed so they don't stick very much and they just break off.  The only time you would really need soluble supports is if they had to be printed inside your model where you could not easily remove them.  PLA.  Same story (almost).  I backed out the ABS filament and loaded some PLA (that actually glows in the dark!).  Everything had been printing so smoothly on the Kapton tape that I just told Simplify3D I was using PLA  and printed! I did not bother to use the Painters Tape as instructed because that would require re-leveling the print bed.  The PLA print on the Kapton tape worked fine for about 10 minutes then the entire RAFT pulled loose and got caught against the extruder and I was not watching closely and a LOT of PLA got gummed up on the end of the extruder.  Cleaned it up, installed a couple strips of painters tape, re-leveled and it prints fine.  LESSON:  follow the instructions.  This machine and all the software are really fun.  About the equivalent to a two hour college course, I think.  I highly recommend this machine and the company that backs it up.	1
Otherwise amazing product. Works great; equivalent to MakerBot Replicator 2x; but $1000 cheaper! Thus I returned my 2x, and kept this guy, after doing a head to head comparison on various regards there is not a large gap (certainly not a $1000 gap). Customer service is great, Tang responds within hours. Able to print some great things without too much headache. Good 1st 3d printer. Only issue was lots of shipping issues (UPS's fault more than seller). I plan on buying another one (maybe single nozzle) soon. Unless you wan to tinker with 2 nozzles (for subtraction printing, or always having something pre-loaded) maybe go single nozzle; although you essentially have a "back-up nozzle" if you only print with one material anyhow!	1
As my 1st 3d printer, I doubt I could have made a better choice. Months of research went into deciding on a printer, and I am thus far very pleased with the results. I will update this review as time goes on. I am hoping if (or when) any parts need replaced this company will have replacements available.	1
Buy Simplify3D and use stock settings for the Creator Pro and you will have perfect prints the FIRST time!  Will have playlist on my YouTube channel for this machine. Highly Recommended	1
****Quick Update 3/23/16**** Spend the money to buy Simplify 3D to slice your parts and you will be amazed at the difference in your machine's printing abilities! I have been using this printer for quite some time now and frankly was never 100% satisfied with the results and always attributed it to the hardware.  Nothing would print reliability or consistently, and I was always babysitting the machine.  Turns out it wasn't the machine, it was the software!  I was very reluctant to buy software for $150 when I had free options, but had finally had enough during a run of bad prints.  The free programs just don't give you enough options and control over the hardware to get consistently great prints.  I am shocked by the difference this program has made in my machine but realize that it is because the free programs just don't go into the detail level of control that these machines need to run flawlessly.  I now run prints without worry, at super hi resolutions, and even my dual extruder is finally working flawlessly.  Wish I had known this from the beginning, as it would have saved so much time  *****  A word of caution - I am an industrial designer by trade, very experienced with 3D printing, and highly mechanical.  If it weren't for this background, I feel I would have returned this printer within the first couple days between the vagueness in the instructions and the hardware adjustments I had to make. But perseverance pays and hopefully some of my notes below will make your introduction quicker. The price, flexibility and robustness of the machine are very much appreciated if you are an experienced maker.  The heated build plate, plexiglass panels, and dual extrusion options give you the added flexibility to adjust the environment you need to ensure prints come out great.  Instructions: The instructions that come with the machine are lacking for detail to say the least.  Get a much more comprehensive unofficial document here: [...]  *Software: Makerware (2.4.1.24) works very well with this printer and the user interface is much easier to work with, especially manipulating a part.  The preview feature is the best.  You will use "The Replicator(Dual)" export settings to start with, and enter the settings I recommended below.  Rep G is a good backup to use if Makerware prints are failing.  They use different algorithms to generate paths, so a machine may handle a part differently with different code.  *Print settings. I recommend using the SD card for your prints, so your printer is not at the whim of your computer's issues especially during long prints.  PLA Painters Tape is best I have really enjoyed the color options, and consistency from 3D Solutech PLA.  Made in USA too! fill 10%-95% (your preference) 1-2 shells (your preference) .1-.3 height (your preference) 230' Heated build plate off 90/150  Ninjaflex *upgrade your extruder with this part:[...] *load ninjaflex just until it comes out and stop (loading speed will jam it) *Kapton Tape seems to work better than painters tape here in getting parts to really stick *The build plate cannot be too tight to the nozzle or it will jam the flow. The settings below should work perfectly. If it continues to jam, lower the build plate slightly.  I use a sheet of paper that is .1mm thick (get yourself a nice digital caliper) to level the plate but make sure the paper can slide with just a bit of friction.  When switching from PLA/ABS to ninja, I usually have to lower the build plate so the ninjaflex because hard filaments can have a tighter build plate tolerance. *Even with all settings perfect, I still get jamming occasionally.  I pause the print, unload/reload filament, and then unpause.  But if this keeps happening during a print and all other settings seem perfect, increase temp to 250'. Sometimes it seems you just need better material flow. 95% fill 1-2 shell .3 height 240'(at 230' a minute into prints my machine would start "clicking" because it had jammed, higher temp kept the flow going. Even at 240', occasionally I still have to pause as soon as I hear clicking, unload, and reload filament no heated build plate 30/30 (although 90/150 will work in many cases depending on part shape) NO RAFT (for a variety of reasons jams the filament.  Build a raft to your part in 3D program if needed)  ABS fill 10%-95% (your preference) 1-2 shells (your preference) .2 height 230' 110' Heated build plate 90/150  *Out of the box notes: The machine comes well packaged and arrived undamaged and does require a fair amount of assembly.  The instructions are not very detailed and could use a lot more work making sure to include all steps from start to finish. You will find yourself googling, youtubing and checking Amazon reviews as you puzzle together assembly or usage.  The basics for assembly are there, but a vague video walks you through assembling the plastic top, and very little covers actually printing and using the machines features.  Way too many extra parts are included with no mention that these are extra parts!  Literally a duplicate of every nut bolt and tube came with my machine, and I sat with these parts for way too long trying to figure out what they could go to.  I appreciate duplicates of parts that may break or wear out, but every part is not necessary or should be clearly called out.  Tighten all the belts!!!  Mine started printing out of the gate, but the prints were terrible and I could not figure out why for the longest time.  I adjusted every software setting to no avail.  Finally, I realized that the belt that controls left/right movement was very loose and was visibly sagging.  This belt came preinstalled, but I had to disassemble the entire head in order to significantly tighten the belt.  Further I discovered the motor that controlled the Z axis was also loose and needed to be tightened into position. Lesson here is make sure every belt is tight - nothing is loose.  Do not assume the factory got it right just because it is installed.  If prints are getting knocked off the platform, remove the left extruder.  I removed my left extruder all together as I found it to be more of a liability when printing with single colors.  When I have a dual extrusion need, I add back in the extruder.  With the extruder removed, make sure you set the temperature to 0' when exporting a print so you're not running the heating element needlessly.	1
Bought it Aug 2014, I have been printing non stop since then! Great printer! Just wish it was prettier!  I highly recommend a glass build plate and Octave Filament.	1
It's so hard to rate this unit with 5 stars because in so many ways its 5 stars where as others it's a 2 or 3.  It seems user friendly but does not come with instructions ( I had to youtube how to setup and calibrate).  Most important is to level the build plate and also level your extruder.  To level the build plate you have to run the utility level build plate and slide a piece of paper in-between the nozzle and the platform adjusting the 3 level screws on the plate bottom until you feel a small amount of friction in all the key points.  There are youtube videos on how to do it.  Mine did not come calibrated.  My extruder was not level and Tang was kind enough to get back to me about how to calibrate it.  Weird how these parts are not given to me in a working order but whatever, I guess that's the price I pay with this unit.  I first realized my extruders were not level when the left one kept knocking all my prints that the right one was making destroying much hard work and time.  All that aside after you can get those two things done, figuring out which software you want to use is another issue.  I ended up using replicatorG after using makerbot and I do still use slic3r for cutting stls into larger parts.  Also after trial and error I determined that using an sd card was more efficient that using the usb cable.  USB cable sometimes causes errors.  The setting in the software you use also turn out to have a huge impact on your builds.  The amount of infil, later hight, raft, support, shells, federate, travel federate, extruder temperature and platform temperature all have to be balanced in order to have anything look halfway decent.  After a lot of headaches I feel I've got a good handle on working with abs plastic now.  Infill 20 (1-100 depending on how strong you want your item), layer height .16 (quality of how much detail and precision you want), number of shells 2 or 3 (makes the outside of your item more durable and more passes/shells looks better), feedrate is how fast your plastic comes out of the nozzle (faster is possible but will always sacrifice quality) travel feederate 70 (speed of nozzle moving between where it's print is and where it's going next.  Same here, slower is better and quality is effected if it goes faster).  I think there is some ratio online that explains how they have to be balanced with each other.  There is also extruder temperature, I use 230 because that seems to work best for abs plastic but experiment.  (Also if your extruder ever gets clogged which it will, just preheat the extruder to 270 and it WILL get you clog out for you).  The print bed heating is essential to having your item stick and not warp.  I use 110 with my abs plastic and haven't had issues with that anymore.  Without heating the platform your first few layers will warp and bend making the rest of your build impossible.  I feel like these first few layers are the most important.  Having software that turns off the printbed after 40 or more layers is really helpful to not overheat the bottom of your build, that has been an issue for me as well.  Supports are good to add on to bigger items in the software.  These ensure that your build is being evenly made and will be equally dispersed with weight.  Sometimes they seem like a waste of filament but some builds really need them or they just cannot be printed.  Rafts are well...a little mesh bottom that starts the build to ensure even building and balance.  You can snap this little piece off of the bottom when your done, is sometimes needs a little help from my dremmel or sandpaper though.  Another thing to keep in mind is that you can't just print on the build platform.  You need to have this really expensive transparent tape thats 50-80 dollars a roll or else your prints won't stick to the platform and that's a world off problems.  After looking it up I found out many prefer to use a sheet of glass instead but, for myself, I have taken the road of using blue painters tape and 99 cent store non scented hairspray.  A layer of tape on the platform followed by a mist of hairspray ensures no warping or unsticking to the platform.  Do you still feel like buying a 3d printer?  I would have thought twice before I purchased if I knew this much work was involved.  Lots of trial and error.  Good luck!	1
TL;DR: the FlashForge Creator Pro is A Makerbot Replicator clone with all of the community enhancements "out-of-the-box." The result is in some ways better than the replicator 2X, for about half the cost. What's not to love?  I have been a long time Makerbot Replicator owner, and I've been very happy with that printer. There's a lot to like about the printer, and the support provided by Makerbot has been first-rate. It has been a workhorse, cranking out thousands of prints over the years. I really like the basic design of the printer, with the build area large enough to create interesting things, but not so deep that the printer takes up too much space. I really like having two extruders, both for flexibility of working with multi-material prints and for convenience such as being able to continue printing with one extruder when the other extruder needs maintenance, or leaving one extruder loaded with ABS and the other with PLA so that I can switch materials effortlessly. And with the heated print bed, I've been able to print with ABS, PLA, Nylon and all sorts of other crazy materials (wood, flex, bronze, etc.). But perhaps most importantly, the user community for Makerbot printers is amazing, so whenever there are was something about the design that needed improving, the community jumped in and came up with improved extruders, metal print platform arms, and even the amazing Sailfish firmware. In many ways the community really made the Replicator the wonderful printer that I've been using all these years.  But my old printer is getting a little long in the tooth, so I wanted to buy a new printer to supplement it. After comparing numerous options, and deciding that I wasn't comfortable with the newest line of printers from Makerbot (they're not as hacker-friendly as I like), I settled on the FlashForge Creator Pro . It is based on the open replicator designs from Makerbot, and incorporates almost all of the community improvements, giving me pretty much everything I was looking for. So let's get into the details  Of FlashForge Creator Pro is very similar to the Makerbot Replicator: Metal frame with plastic skin, so the unit is solid and professional looking. Not quite as nice as Makerbot's injection molded skins, perhaps, but certainly good enough to keep in the office. And the metal frame is extremely sturdy, yielding very good-looking prints. Same basic design, with the print bed moves up and down the Z axis, and extruders on a platform that moves on the X and Y axis. Heated print bed give you a good range of materials to print with - ABS, PLA, Nylon, etc. I also like the shape of the Replicator print bed, because the width allows printing long objects but not being square let's the printer fit into normal desk without taking over completely. Two extruders, with spring tension and release levers. Print X3G files from an SD card. This is the same as all of Makerbot's older printers. This means that you can use Makerware, ReplicatorG, or Simplify3D Runs Sailfish firmware as the standard firmware. http://www.sailfishfirmware.com for more information. I love being able to control temperature and print speed manually. This means that I can slice once, then tweak settings for a particular filament in the printer. Dito Printing lets you print with both extruders at once, which is great for cranking out lots of small prints. Enclosed build area to retain heat. This is required for printing ABS. This is a common community upgrade to the original Replicator, And is built into the Replicator 2x. 1 KG of PLA and 1 KG of ABS. And it has some improvements: It has metal arms for the print bed, so they don't sag after being heated. This lets prints be much more consistent without releveling the print bed. This is one of the more popular community enhancements to the replicator design, it is great to get it "out of the box". The print bed has three mount points rather than four of the replicator, making bed leveling much easier. It has wing nuts instead of thumbscrews, which are easier to turn. So leveling the print bed is simpler then on the Replicator. It has a CPU with more storage, letting it run firmware with more capabilities than the standard CPU has room for. For example, the latest Sailfish firmware takes advantage of the new CPU to provide support for automated print bed leveling that won't fit the standard CPU's limited code space. The buttons are mechanical rather than rubber, which I think has better feedback. When you press a button you know it's pressed. The display is inverted, with white text on a dark background, which looks a little nicer given the black case. The power supply is inside the case, which makes the whole thing easier to transport. In power supply is also larger, allowing the printer to heat the extruder and print bed at the same time. Tons of spare parts. Not just hex drivers, but spares of every screw and nut, and even a spare end stop cable. About the only thing I don't like, and it is minor, is that the extruder is not all metal, but has PTFE lining. This is not an issue for printing ABS or PLA, but might limit the ability to use materials that require higher temperatures to extrude. But I still have my original Replicator for that. Out of the box experience  Out-of-the-box the FlashForge is very similar to the Replicator. Both require you to remove all of the packing material, and to attach the extruders onto the gantry with two screws, which is quite easy.  The one difference is that the FlashForge ships configured for 220 V Power, and must be switched to 110 volt Power to operate in the United States. There is a sticker prominently placed explaining that you need to do this, but it does not explain how to do so. It turns out that the voltage switch is on the side of the power supply, which is covered by the bottom of the printer case. To access the switch, you must remove the bottom cover, which is held on with about a half-dozen screws. Or you can use a flashlight and a screwdriver and reach into the bottom of the case and flip the switch through vent holes next to the power supply, which is what I did. Given how critical it is for the voltage to be set properly, I would recommend that the company make the voltage switch much more obvious, or at least include documentation showing exactly where the switch is on the FlashForce Pro.  Once the power is switched, setting the FlashForward Pro up was easier than the Replicator. In particular bed leveling is very easy with the wing nuts, and three mounting points. And the Sailfish leveling routine is more efficient then the standard Makerbot firmware, because you can position the extruders directly over each of the three control points and set each one once. In contrast Makerbot's firmware moves the extruders to the middle and four edges, so you need to adjust the control points in pairs, and usually go twice around the platform before everything is right. So instead of three wing nuts to adjust, you often end up adjusting 24 thumbscrews. Of course, upgrading the replicator to Sailfish makes it much easier to level as well.  The doors and top cover require assembly. It was very easy, though with no instructions. It was pretty obvious how it went together, from the photo's on the web site.  One last minor thing: the files on the SD card were compressed in a RAR file.  So I had to use my desktop computer to unrar the file to get to the documentation, software, and sample print files. Since I already have software and files to print, this was not an issue for me, but it would likely confuse someone buying their first 3-D printer. Long term operation  In longer-term operation (a few prints so far, but I can see how things are working out), the FlashForge is more consistent, because the build platform arms are metal.  The Replicator's build platform arms are plastic, so over time they sag slightly due to the heat. The result is that when printing on the replicator you need to re-level the build platform fairly often, but not so the FlashForge Pro - one calibration, and numerous prints. Conclusion  The Replicator has been a great printer. The FlashForge Pro builds on the Replicator's open design, and improves nearly every aspect, incorporating community enhancements were making nice incremental improvements. The end result is a printer that is a pleasure to use, but at an impressively low price.	1
When I decided to purchase a 3D printer I began doing a fair amount of research and came to the conclusion that this printer was really the best option for my budget.  This printer is very similar to the replicator at a fraction of the price.  Everything is very intuitive about its assembly, operation, and maintenance.  I was making good parts of my own design just hours after opening the printer.  I would recommend going over all of the screws and making sure things are tightened up.  I found some of the bolts were loose when it arrived but these are things that should be checked regardless of what printer you purchase.	1
This is a great product. My first printer was an afinia h series, which only beats this in software and true out of the box abilities. This requires some minor assembly before being usable, but is fairly straightforward. The instructions are on the provided sd card. The only issues I've had are the x axis not being square with the y axis, discovered when I was making some interlocking parts, and getting pla to stick without using an abs slurry. The x axis is an easy fix; simply grab both end of the carriage and give it a twist front to back in the correct direction. The pla is only with large flat parts, which might just be plate leveling. I've printed an indicator mount to true it in better, and will probably get a few sheets of borosilicate glass from mc master, as they seem to be the only place aside from the flashforge main website that sells glass of the right size for a reasonable price.  Update:  I finally got around to using the materials this shipped with instead of spools from manufacturers that I already know how to handle.  The red ABS this came prints things visually well, but the layers don't bond together very firmly, and the material itself is strangely brittle.  I'm not detracting any stars for this, only informing anyone that's having issues and using the stock material that it might not actually be the machine causing problems.	1
This is my first 3d printer.  I have about 120 hours on it now.  The support is really good from Flashforge.  Here are some really important things I've learned.  * You can upgrade the firmware but you need to stick to builds provided by Flashforge or the SD card won't work with 4GB cards.  (Stock firmware builds only support 2G and the bot came with a 4GB card.) * Sailfish firmware is a really really nice upgrade. * I upgraded to a glass plate for flatter build surface.  You can print an offset from thingiverse that fits perfectly. * Level the build plate if you want your prints to stick! * Heat the build plate up before leveling... it changes when it's hot. * My LCD had issues with bit errors on the display.  Support replaced it but also provided some insulating offsets that help a lot.  Could be important for your machine.  I'm still learning lots of tricks but overall I'm happy.  I've printed in ABS, PLA and PET+.  Your 3d modeling skills have a lot to do with how well you're able to use a 3d printer.  EDIT - I've got about 700 printing hours on this machine now.  I'm changing my review from 4 to 5.  Things that have changed: * I updated my creator x to be like the creator pro that is now sold.  It has some acrylic covers for ABS and also an aluminum hotbed holder + updated z axis rods so I don't have to level nearly as often. * I've also purchased another printer for different printing needs.  It's more expensive but I have to say I'm actually still getting better print quality from this one. * Tang and his support team have continued to provide fabulous support and help even though it's past the original 3 month warranty period.	1
I wanted a replicator 2X but it's just too expensive. I bought this and it prints great except for tall prints that end up splitting layers because of temp. variations.  I bought a door from jychua on ebay. Search for "door kit flashforge creator X"	1
I'm upgrading my rating of the printer, now that I have a level build plate installed, to 4 stars. 4 stars equates to, "I like it", according to the tool tip that appears if you put your mouse cursor over the 4th star.  I would not have upgraded the unit it it weren't for Tang's support and readiness to help out in diagnosing the problem, which turned out to be a uneven build plate, and his willingness to do whatever it took to make things right.  (uneven original build plate, with a .152mm feeler gauge) [...]  Once the build plate was replaced, and the first set of replacement screws were replaced by the second set that arrived with the new build plate, the unit prints very well. In some cases, it prints better than my replicator 2 and in others, not as good...but that's something I'm more than willing to live with considering I can now dualstrude print in ABS with enough confidence to start the print button and go to work while it prints unattended, which was the only reason I bought this.  I tried not to let Tang's helpfulness affect the review because it's supposed to be about the product...not support. That's pretty much impossible in this case as it seems almost as if a Customer Support person named Tang ships with each unit (so you gotta include him in the review)  This is a "product" review. It's not a review of Flash Forge's Technical Support nor is it a review of their Customer Support after the sale. If it were a review about those items, this would be the first 6-star rating on Amazon. Tang, the tech support person at Flash Forge, is a really that great of a support specialist.  That said, I received this printer about month ago but I've been holding off on this review. I held off because I've really been trying to find something about it I like but I am left more frustrated after using it because it is so "hit-or-miss".  Here's my first month with the Creator X  I received the unit in damaged condition. They inserted the Spools of filament inside the printer housing prior to shipment and they bounced around and mangled the leveling screws for the build plate.  I contacted and sent him pics of the damage and requested a new build plate and leveling screws. Tang asked me to remove the build plate to inspect it closely to see if it were damaged. Turns out it was just the screws that were mangled. (or so I thought)  I managed to straighten the screws and started printing, unsuccessfully. I could not get the build plate level to save my life. Parts wouldn't stick at all, or they would curl, or the printer head moved around so fast that it seems it would shake the unit apart. (For comparison purposes, the speed of the extruder head in the Creator X at this point in time was moving at least 2x faster than the Replicator 2 I have sitting next to it) This is not an exaggeration. It moved so fast I thought it would literally rip something loose internally. I spent 4 days (remaining awake for at least 48 hours) troubleshooting it. I never could get a decent print using ABS or PLA  I decided to upgrade the Firmware from what it shipped with (Makerbot's version) to "Sailfish", which incorporated many bug fixes and enhancements. I got the firmware upgraded and still could not get a decent print. (This firmware came out in January and I got my printer in April and it had the old firmware...why?)  I then went to Home Depot and purchased 2 panes of 8x10 glass to attach to the build plate because I heard that glass is a more level surface.  This necessitated getting a shim for the Z Axis so the print heads don't slam into the panes of glass. I "did" get it level, eventually. So much so that the bed leveling print, the one which prints a 1 layer circle was absolutely perfect. If I were to rate the success on a 1-100 scale, I hit 102.  Finally, after a week, I'm ready to print! Right?!   I decided to do a dual extruder test printing a computer fan cover and grill using the translucent blue PLA that came with the unit and the Light Blue PLA that came with my Replicator 2. On a scale of 1-100, I'd rate the results at solid, high-90's (97-98) It was a great print.  Since then, I have not had a successful print using either PLA or ABS.  What I have had are the following:  Fingers worn raw from tightening/loosening the leveling screws because it just won't stay level between prints (and the fact the screws are far harder to turn because of the bent leveling screws) Several cuts from handling the glass panes (5 cuts on both hands so far this week alone) 2 clogged left print heads which required a complete disassembly of the extruder unit to clear. Wires work their way loose on the motherboard The unit started screeching in the Y axis when moving. (less than 2 weeks after opening, it needed re-lubed) Right print head clogged, requiring removal and disassembly to clear it out Spools get kinked on a daily basis (to the point I designed and printed out new guides using my Replicator 2 that let me route the filament better Wire loom holding the wires that go to the extruders got kinked and killed a print. The clamps that hold the glass panes to the build plate get in the way of a large print so I had to design and print out on my Replicator 2 a new mounting mechanism which holds the glass panes in place without impinging on the build area (so the heads don't collide with them)  So...what I am going to do is give 1 star for each successful non-calibration type print I've done.	1
the only reason I'm giving four stars is because the spool was broke when it came, but I have been able to manage and the tape works great I use it on ever pipe and fitting I can, great stuff.	1
5s	1
gift.	1
Really amazing product, can do beyond what I paid	1
It works.	1
There is not much to write here.  IT does what it's supposed to and was a decent price.	1
plumbers tape, really not much to say, works as a seal	1
Works fine. I see the price has gone up considerably since I bought it, but probably still a good value. Make sure you use it right -- I found I wasn't after looking at some instructional videos on YouTube.	1
Yep theres a difference in tape but I had to be convinced. I thought no matter what brand or thickness I purchased it was just wrapping more around the threads would do it. Im not a plumber but I do buy homes, live in them for 2-years, make all required repairs/improvements and then see it. Seems every house needed major plumbing work so I just purchased the cheapest 10-packs of Teflon tape I could find and kept wrapping tape until the leak stopped or changed out the fittings. The added thickness to this tape makes for a better seal but it does not tear off easily. Im happy with it but had to go with 4-stars because of the difficulty in tearing it off and the ragged end that is left. If you're prone to cutting it with scissors then its a 5-star item. I think it is much better for metal threads because they tend to cut away the tape more when threading fittings together.	1
works well, affordable, seems durable, i installed it into my air blower and impact wrench and they all seemed to get in okay.  I used teflon tape to help slide them in, and seal the air leak.	1
I would reccomend these air fittings to anybody who needs air fittings to use with all thier air tools, buy now.	1
Dixon makes a quality product with clean threads, no burs, and an air tight fit.  I like the brass so it doesn't rust.  Will ding up if you throw your air tools around.  If your tool bounces around in the back of your truck you might want the chrome plated steel ones or solid steel.	1
What can I say, as nipples go the Dixon's just have great nipples, they are nice to look at and a pleasure to use.	1
Absolutely some of the best connectors EVER! Work well, with no leaks. Of course, when you are dealing with metal to metal connections, you need to use some silicone tape, but that's to be expected. Use can couple of wraps and no problems! Highly recommended.	1
Does what it should, and reasonable cost.	1
Does what it should. Fits as it should. Looks nice. And you don't have to worry about it rusting.	1
Works as described	1
Good Product.	1
Great product, great price nothing but positive	1
Exactly what I needed. Inexpensive but same great quality as others. Fast service to my door.	1
Good, rust-free Brass Couplings	1
A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT THAT WORKS GOOD.	1
This is a great air chuck.	1
The Dixon brass just seems to work a lot better than brass from a certain other tool franchise Harbor, Harbor mmm something or other.	1
Well, it threaded into the 3/8" FPT aok with no leaks & my existing QD fits just fine.	1
Great quality and a great price.	1
JUST PERFECT!!! Thank You	1
Simple, well made bronze fitting in minimalist packaging.  Works exactly as expected. Nice and smooth with no rough edges.  Gets the job done.	1
GREAT VALUE AND QUALITY !!!!	1
These work very well, no air leaks, very well made.	1
Brass. Go with the quality.. No leaking all the time...	1
Good quality air fitting.	1
Works as designed which is what I was after, installed easily with white Teflon tape and doesn't leak or have any other problems	1
Solid piece that feels like it will last a long time, much more substantial than Harbor freight stuff. worth it	1
After applying to the inside foam of my videocamera case, it destroyed my camera.	-1
works as intended	1
Good stuff. I was not sure how this would be but I have to say I am very happy with it. I remember my dad had a can of this a long time ago but never seen him use it. The coating looks large at first but when it dries it gets smaller. I have found other uses for it other than had tools. I recently coated the spindles on my rock tumbler to get better tumbling results. The barrel would not turn all the time on the steel spindles so I coated them and have no slipping issues now. I have also applied it to my pin pointer so sand would not wear the plastic probe and am very happy how it stuck to the plastic and is wearing.	1
I used this product on a file handle. Easy to use and came out great. Find that I am searching for more things to put a grip on now.	1
Works great on pliers and tools.  Be sure to clean them before dipping and follow the directions.  Kind of messy too.  Takes time so be patient.	1
Great tool	1
i ordered this stuff to use to make my husband's socks non-skid. i found the instructions on line. i used a chopstick and applied dots about dime size in a pattern to cover the sole of his foot and it works great. highly recommended. i think i'll do some tool handles, too.	1
Works great, have used in the past to coat tool handles of tools. This time I painted it on the bottom of my tool bag to waterproof it works like a charm. Also used to color coat the bottom few inches of my channel locks to prevent mix up with fellow coworkers when on the same job site.	1
I have used this stuff many times in the past. One thing that I have learned. Spend the extra money and buy it in this 22oz paint type of can. They sell a smaller can, that has a plastic lid. That can has a pull top to open it, and then you seal it up after you use it with the plastic lid. The problem with that is that it lets the dip dry out. Even if you do not re-open it, once it is open, it is just a matter of time, basically within a month or so, it will be dried out too much to use, and you will have to throw out what is left. This can has a metal lid, not plastic, and does a great job at sealing the can. I bought some about 5 months ago, and have used it multiple times, on multiple things, and even after opening it up multiple times, and 5 months later, it is still just about as fluid as when I first bought it. The one with the plastic lid would be in the garbage by now. Just remember to seal it up good with the lid, and you will be good for a long time.  Some things that I have used it for. I dipped the end of some reachers in it to give them some grip. I recommend doing a couple of dips for some durability. One coat is good for coating something if you are not going to be rubbing that area, but if you are, like on the end of a reacher, I recommend doing about 3 dips for a good coating. I had a short in the ground on a car, and ran a new ground cable. I patched it in to the original line by a flat piece of copper, crimping them together. Problem was, it is going to be getting wet, so after crimping them together, I put a thick coating of this stuff over it to protect it from the weather, and salt, etc. I also used some for the same thing, but for a connection for some security cameras, where the connection was outdoors. Works great there too. Got a metal flashlight that you do not like the feel of. Put a coating of this where you grab. I have even dipped my pliers handles in this stuff, after the original coating failed.  This stuff has lots of uses, and is very versatile. Even after years, it is still pretty pliable and does not get hard. It has insulating properties, so it can be used on some electrical stuff too. Just remember, make sure when you use it that you have about a full day to let it dry good before you re-coat, or use whatever you put it on. Yea, I did see someone say that you cold do it after a half an hour. trust me, it is just dry to the touch at that point in time, meaning it will not be sticky. Once it is dry, and cured, it will shrink down to a thin layer that is a fraction of the thickness of when you put it on. That does not happen in 30 minutes.  One last thing to note. This stuff goes on like paint. What I mean by that is that it does not stick to surfaces like glue does. It will stick, but if the surface is flat / smooth, and you scrape the edge, it will start to peel up. It sticks like regular household paint does. There is no real bonding to anything, that will make it one with whatever you put it on, like glue does. The only way that there will be bonding is if it can attach and soak in, in some way, like attaching itself to cloth, as in clothes, cloth gloves, etc where it can meld in with the material that it is being attached to. Other then that, do not expect too high of a bonding process.	1
I used this for the back of my fish tank to roll on because my tank was already set up and i couldn't move it. I eventually got it to work but I would not suggest rolling this product on. It dried quickly when rolled on so sometimes it would stick to the roller and peel off the glass.	1
Used this to re coat some engine bay wiring brackets. Goes on thin so multiple coats is a must. Make sure to mix before use. I'm not sure about shelf life but I still have quite a bit left over.	1
Love this stuff! Easy to use, with fast setup time.	1
Awesome product!  I use this to cost parts for doggie wheelchairs and it's very durable!!  And the price is good to!	1
The photo on th can is misleading, showing a thick coating on a set of pliers like those that come pre-coated from a factory. You'll have to dip your pliers (or whatever) at least a dozen or more times to get that thickness of coating. Yes, it works for all practical purposes, and the coating is pretty tough stuff, just very thin.	-1
Works great. Very easy to assemble and use.	1
The Tow Tuff trailer dolly is a great addition to anyone trying to move around smaller trailers on smooth surfaces.  It is a little challenging on gravel and grass but on concrete this thing makes it a breeze.  The added multi height adjustment makes it easy to change levels to fit various trailers and saves your back at the same times. I would certainly recommend this products to others.	1
Pros: Easy set up, variable use with different trailers. Cons: Not for off road use. Difficult pulling on uneven terrain.	1
Great	1
Easy assembly. Use it all the time. Love it.	1
Love it well worth the money	1
Very well made. Moves my 5' x 8' enclosed trailer with ease. Completely satisfied.	1
great	1
This dolly goes together well and works just fine for me to move my car trailer around.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars is the smell of it!  The foam in the tires or the tires put off an awful smell  It was sitting in the garage and now I'm having a hard time getting the oder to go away.  So what I have done is to place it in the bed of my pick-up truck and I'm just going to drive it around for few days to hope that the smell goes away from the dolly as well as my garage!  Other than that it is strong and looks like something I'll have for a long time... that is as long as the smell goes away...	1
work great here in the pacific Northwest,their stainless	1
Worked Great	1
can hang virtually anything with these.	1
Satisfied customer.	1
Does what I purchased it to do.	1
Decent quality, could not find them loally	1
Well made pieces; perfect for outdoor use	1
Excellent product and excellent price!  Received as requested, was able to wind my transformer, and it worked as expected.  Hurray!	1
Great for making an electromagnet.  I made a linear motor wrapping the wire around a small glass tube with several small round magnets stacked inside it.  It's powered by eight AAA batteries in series (12v).  Connecting the electricity causes the batteries to shoot from one end to the other.  Just what I needed in my project to convert an older mechanical cuckoo clock to electricity.  Mechanical cuckoo mechanisms are prone to failure due to dust and animal hair in my home.  Replacement clockworks are ridiculously expensive, and require constant winding and maintenance.  Using rechargeable Eneloop batteries, my clocks run a full year on single charges.  Plus Eneloop batteries can't leak like Alkaline can, and they don't end up in landfills.  I use only Eneloop batteries in my home now.  Including clocks, remote controls, flashlights and various projects, I now use over 50 of the little suckers in my homesaving me money and saving the environment too.	1
These are great for bathroom fans. You can leave it on for a while after you are done in the room, and not have it run all night sucking the conditioned air out of the house. Note that there's another version that runs for up to 60 minutes.  The blue lights are pretty bright - but they sort of work as a night light, at least for a bathroom. Might be a bit distracting if it was in a room that you wanted to occupy while dark like a bedroom or living area.	1
TEMCo 30 AWG Copper Magnet Wire - 2 oz 392 ft 155C Magnetic Coil Red I ordered this roll of magnet wire to attempt a led lighting project that immolates the strings of fairy lights you see for sale a lot these days.  It will work, but the smallest leds I have found, have been different than the ones I have seen in the other lighting referred to.  I like the wire, very small and I may need to upsize a size or three to all the number of tiny leds I would like.	1
I used it to wind parasitic suppressors in a grounded grid linear amp.  It's fine.	1
Exactly as described. Great!	1
As good as it looks, it is copper, the only material for small current transfer from my temperature sensors. Can be hidden under the plintus!	1
Nice, but wish it had a one hour setting instead of so many small presets. Nice styling, easy to find in the dark. DOES look like the space shuttle controls, like other buyer said. I find that to be cool.	1
Very good wire I'm using it for my plastic models and its really good stuff	1
Great Product for a good price. I order a lot from these guys.	1
Always a great product!	1
Great with a fair price.	1
It is good wire, no crimps or kinks. I got it fast!	1
My downstairs bathroom fan was being constantly left on. The duct and a flapper exhaust valve on the exterior wall is right behind my headboard.  This timer prevents people from leaving it running all night!  It works instinctively, and you can override one time just by pressing another.  Lots of discussions about two versions being available: I was shipped the "night light" version where the blue LEDs stay on (on 100% by the selected time and on when switch is off on the bottom).  Perfect for a bathroom--would not want it in my bedroom.	1
GOOD BRAKES EASY BECAUSE ITS THIN WIRE.	1
GOOD  BRAKES  EASY TO THIN	1
Thank You .	1
Good. But be careful not to pull to tight or it may break. Thin wire.	1
COOL!!	1
really worked well on models	1
I ended up returning this. It seems like the product would have worked, but my wiring is such that I could only configure this in a way that would also tie the lights in a bathroom to this timer.	1
I use this wire for attaching to SMD LEDS, 0402 and up to 1206. Removing the insulation is a minor problem, I just scrape a few places with a razor knife the flux and solder tin it. Once the solder and flux can get under the enamel along with the heat it does a good job.	1
Good quality wire, far sturdier than 42AWG.  If 42AWG drives you nuts and your project can handle a *little* heavier wire (it's still hair-thin), the 38 holds up much better under use and stress of winding, and is quite a bit easier to solder.  Be aware the poly coating on this stuff is near impossible to remove.  I almost knocked it down to 4 stars because of that, but to be fair-- it's almost impossible to remove.  That means it will prevent shorts, which is a good thing.  I recommend very fine sandpaper (320 or so) to strip the wire.  Just fold it over with the wire inside and slowly remove the sandpaper from the wire.  Four or five times should do it.  No standard workshop chemical I've tried on it will do the job.  I've tried acetone, paint thinner, turpentine, denatured alcohol, lacquer thinner, heavy-duty paint stripper... you name it.  Nothing touches this coating.	1
Good quality product	1
Installed this in two bathrooms where we recently installed Panasonic ceiling heat/vents. Those units are extremely quiet and we found ourselves forgetting we had the vents on. This timer switch is the perfect solution.  Just turn on right before showering, and no worry to even turn off when you're done. No worry, no moisture, no mold!	1
I have not tested this wire, but it appears to be exactly as described. The quality appears to be excellent.	1
As long as it's not defective it gets five stars. I measured the resistance of the entire coil to be 8.3 Ohms, so I simply soldered a DC connector to the free ends and connected it to a 12VDC regulated power supply and turned it on. When I dropped a 3-1/4" long 9/16" head steel bolt in the middle of the spool it became a reasonably powerful electromagnet. This truly is magnet wire. AMAZING!!! LOL :-0 :-)  :0  :)  et al	1
I live in an older house that does not have great ventilation in the bathrooms. I use these to set the bathroom exhaust fan to 30 minutes. Works very well for this purpose.  You need a neutral wire to run this exhaust fan, mine had one, but not every switch in my house does. Also the LED lights are bright, making this almost act like a night light.	1
Hook up was easy enough. Perfect as a fan timer. No longer do our bathroom fans run for hours.	1
Originally I used a vacancy sensor switch for my children's bedroom closet light.  For whatever reason (possibly the clothes in the closet were too close to the switch) it would just keep the switch on longer than programed.  I ended up getting this switch to replace the former switch mentioned.  I really like this switch better because it will automatically turn itself off after the preselected time interval which also comes in handy for a bedtime night light.  It functions well, and is easy to install.	1
Good Product and the description is exactly correct	1
This timer does what it's supposed to do, and does it very well. Personally I wish it had 5-10-15-30-45-60 presets. It is not too big and fits easily in the box.	1
Excellent wall timer, reasonably priced, and excellent customer service as well! I installed these switches in all 3 of my bathrooms. I wanted the option of leaving the fan running after getting out of the shower and exiting the bathroom, without worrying about having to return to the bathroom to turn the exhaust fan off. This greatly helps in reducing mold and mildew in the shower! The switch does have little blue LED's that remain on at all times. I initially didn't think I would like this and thought it may pose a problem. I actually really like the fact that these blue LED's stay on! I even removed the night light out of my master bath, because these blue LED's are enough to illuminate the bathroom in the middle of the night. Yet they're not bright enough where they would keep me awake all night, you actually barely notice they're on. But in the middle of the night, when it's pitch-black they do provide just enough light to use the facilities without having to turn on any bright lights. I absolutely love these wall timers! Would highly recommend these.	1
Worth every penny! Always use to be stuck with a dilema... A) shut fan off right after shower and let moisture sit in bathroom and risk mold ...Or... B)leave it on and forget to shut it off and it ends up running for hour.  Not Amy more! Start this bad boy before you hop in the shower and you got nothing to worry about! Every time someone vists they are always amazed and ask where I get it. I had no idea how big of conversation starter a fan could be. Also comes in handy to fire up when someone stinks up the bathroom. Instead of smelling poopery for half hour can just run the fan for 5 min.  Bottom line you won't regret it. Really easy to install. I replaced a normal 3 gang box of toggle switches with 2 decora switches and this one.	1
as others have noted, you need a common wire for this to work. Otherwise its great.  The lighs are a bit bright, but i don't mind since its in my bathroom, and I use it every night. the light below the big on/off button is on whenever the fan is off. Also, the light next to the last timer button you used is also on even while the fan is off.  the button will slowly flash when there is short time remaining on the cycle.	1
It is simple, it works well and it doesn't cost much. Good buy! I am going to be using these for all of my closets and hallway lights. You do need a neutral wire for this (P/N #HET06S) unit. You can also override the timer if you need to keep your light on. Just hold the big button for 6-10 seconds till your light comes on. When it is in override mode, none of the LED are lit so it is easy to see that the timers are not active. Just touch the big button again to end the override.	1
This timer switch works just as it should. I was afraid I would need to do additional wiring since it specifies that it requires all 3 lines, the hot, the neutral and the ground, but in my case (and I believe in nearly all cases) the wires were readily available in the existing electrical box of the standard switch I was replacing. The 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minute timers all work properly and the big button ends the cycle early if you want. The blue LED lights tell you which cycle is active. They give off a bit of light, so if you want a room to remain perfectly dark for some reason, you should be wary of that.	1
Solid. Very easy to install as long as you understand basic wiring (Ground / Load / Hot / Neutral)..I was able to replace the old switch for my bathroom exhaust fan in about 10 minutes. No more guests leaving the fan on (unless they hit the large bottom button) indefinitely. The blue LED is a nice touch as well. Ordering another now for my other bathroom exhaust fan after being so pleased with how easy the install was  *Only hangup (which is minor) is the wires coming out of the unit are twisted threads and not solid copper. For me that just meant taking it a bit easier than normal when wrenching down on the wirenuts.	1
Love this!  With a house full of children they were leaving the bathroom fan on constantly. So, we are air conditioning and heating the great outdoors every time it's left on all day. I had enough.  I received it quick with prime shipping. I did have to purchase a different cover since I have a double switch (a light and a fan). Not a big deal.  I installed it myself, made sure the power was off at the box first. One thing I do have to mention. This will not work without a neutral wire. I missed it the first try.  It's working perfectly! Hopefully it will drop my electric bill. I am very happy.	1
Nice timer at a great price.	1
This is the second purchase I have made of this product.  Works great and it's relatively easy to install.	1
Love is a bit strong... but no reason to knock any stars. Does what it is supposed to do. Clean little switch. I have it on a fan I installed. I really like the blue LEDs as a nightlight. I wake up 2 or 3 times a night usually, and this is enough light to get me there and back without any issue, and without waking me up.	1
Awesome !	1
Installed replacing old wind-up version (that never worked correct). I connected it in parallel with my show light switch so I can ALWAYS turn on the fan when the shower light is on. This to say it must be using a relay or dry contact because it works great). Noght lite is just right amount of light.	1
I really like this light switch.  I have a very large walk-in closet and I often left the light on in there.  After installing this it always shuts itself off if I forget to turn it off.  One thing to be aware of: I sometimes sleep in my closet (we have a newborn) and I am very surprised how bright the blue built-in nightlights are.  They are extremely bright.  I put a piece of electrical tape over them in case I sleep there.  The light going through the tape is still plenty for a nightlight.  All that light is a bit of a waste, but what are you going to do?	1
So far so good. I like the operation if it, I'm using it so I can leave the upstairs bathroom fan running for a while without having to remember to go back up later to shut it off.  Everyone is talking about the blue LEDs because they are pretty bright, in total darkness they work as a dim night light in the bathroom so I like that part to.	1
I purchased this switch to power the exhaust fan in our service department. It works quite well and is designed well. The only drawback is that the layout of the switches and the main large button aren't particularly apparent. You have to read the manual to know exactly the functions the buttons can do. That said, it gets the job done well and is perfect for us.	1
This wire works great for me. I use it to wind coils. I like the green color too.	1
Excellent service. A well packaged product, neatly wound (no kinky cross windings) and lightning-fast delivery...	1
Great stuff for a fair price.	1
Item as was listed	1
Excellent coated wire.	1
clean spool of wire.	1
Grate buy for a hard to find item I use it on my plastic models	1
I use this to wind coils.  Just the right color and flexibility.	1
works good	1
Great item, fast shipping very happy	1
Thank You .	1
got it fast good product.	1
got my wire fast just what I wanted.	1
Its 40 gauge so its very thin. And it will break if you pull on it.	1
Great product at a reasonable price. This is  however a fragile wire so for those not aware of the size of awg, this wire can be broken quite easily with a little bit of tension.	1
Perfect for my needs. Small thin wire perfect for my SMD LED work. Just a PITA to take the enamel off. But I found that just scratching a little of it, breaking the surface then using the soldering iron to tin it works well enough.	1
Cool, cheap and does the job. I like the function over some other similar items. Interesting blue led lights on all the time, probably be better to have an option to turn that off or down or other colors, but for what it is there is no problem.	1
When we bought our old house, both bathrooms had problems with moisture building up. I installed one of these in each bathroom (both run new fan/light combo units I installed in the ceiling) so we can run the fan for an hour after taking a shower. Our moisture problems are gone.  I simply love these timer-switches. Without them, I'd be running my fans all day. With them, I get them to run for just the time I want.  If you have questions about wiring them up or anything else, post in the comments and I'll respond.	1
I love using this for my ABS prints.  The plastic adheres really well (provided you've properly leveled the bed and print the first layer slowly).	1
I think all 3d printing fan know buildtak right? these are the same even cheaper work fine with flashforge printers I have not had warp since I got them, however you need to mind your printing configuration still.	1
Really good product. I love these build sheets.	1
These are excellent.  I have two glass plates that I use for a building base.  When one is done, I take it off and let it cool while the other one is being used.  Almost any design sticks to it.  The trick is the a) don't add glue or any other adhesive , b) wait till it cools before removing c) use a sharp wood chisel to start lifting the printout off the base and then finish by slipping a thin putty knife under it and working it around until the printout breaks lose.  If you need to print a large flat plate directly on the base, then raise it up by about 4 mm using your slicer (I use Simplyfy3D), then use supports.  This will allow you to remove the printout from the base without damaging either the printout or the blue "sticker".  This works well with, ABS, PLA , TUP and PETG  I am adding a note of clarification. This does "really" grab the print. Taking the print off becomes an art.  Once mastered though, I have used it for dozens of print without damage.	1
These 3D bed stickers are very nice. I do however go through them every few months as it gets scratched when I remove the prints. They do a great job of helping the print stick to the bed. I would recommend these if you need bed stickers or don't want to use glass. Also, the stickers come off very nicely with no residue left over if you heat the bed up to 60 degrees Celsius and pull them off.	1
good	1
I think I received 5 or 6 of these with my FFCP purchase earlier this month.  These things work a bit too well, to be honest. I've printed stuff that stuck so well I broke the item removing it from the plate, and removing other items actually ended up tearing the build sticker.  They're far more capable than the 3M blue painter's tape I use on my Replicator 2, Monoprice Mini Select, and Rostock V3  I already migrated to using glass plates on my FFCX and it looks like I'll have to migrate to glass plate with the FFCP so I don't have to replace the sticker after 15-20 prints due to tearing	1
works	1
These grab the prints. I use a Maghold removeable bed and I use these as my Builtak. Very durable, i beat and scrape mine before I had the removeable bed. Totally reccomend.	1
Work great for both ABS and PLA  for the creator pro, if you can't get it to stick use a bit of washable elmers glue	1
I used these in my brew setup. They seemed to be working out . We'll see as time goes on.  I would recommend.	1
As described,Good quality will work as needed.	1
Very good.  Nice, solid fittings.  Have used several in last few weeks and no issues whatsoever.	1
I used this as an adhesive. At first it STUCK LIKE GLUE-- and the objects (metal book ends) remained fixed to where they were glued. I was IMPRESSED. Then... one day --  "CLANG!!" the metal bookends and their contents (6 books, 6 measly little books) went flyying all over the place because the adhesive had decided not to adhere any more. So I grabbed the tube, which I had carefully capped and put away, to remedy this mess -- and lo and behold, the cap was cracked, the sealant at the top half of the tube was SOLID, and although the sealant at the BOTTOM of the tube was squishy and malleable, I don't like opening up bottoms of tubes and squeezing out the contents because that only lets air into the tube and the rest of the contents will be solid by the time I need to use this product again (which actually I will NEVER do again).	-1
Great Product.	1
Use this for several different projects and has always performed as expected. the red and blue variants by jb weld have also done great	1
Great stuff	1
Another great J-B Weld product. It's a bit pricey compared to other brands, but it's one of the best. If you have expensive/important things to glue or seal, this is the one you should use.	1
Did not form a good gasket or seal as intended.  After 72 hours it should have hardened and yet was completely liquid still.  Save your money, but the real gasket.	-1
WORKS GREAT FOR SEALING RUBBER INSULATION ON A TRAILER	1
No problems	1
Always keep this around.	1
RTV silicone is great for working on many tasks. I prefer it to traditional glues and epoxies and I've been using it for years. This time I was using it to secure accessories to lexan R/C bodies. I don't see how J-B weld works better than any other brand I have used, but it's inexpensive. The nozzle will clog up pretty quickly, even if you cap it. If you exert too much pressure, you will also blow the back of the tube out and that's no fun.	1
It's tough stuff.  Dries fast	1
As expected	1
Good bond for medium high-temp applications.  I haven't had the same trouble with cure inside the tube after opening that I've had with other brands.  I'll be using this going forward. ============================ Update - I've gone through a couple of more tubes now and this is definitely my favorite product of this type.  It has a better bond that other black silicone RTV products I've used.  Definitely a different odor but maybe that has something to do with its superior performance.  I've used it for oil-resistant gaskets on my motorcycle, various electrical applications as an insulator with high temperature bond strength, to secure thermocouples that go up to 500F, and other miscellaneous applications where I need an elastomeric bond that will withstand water and high temperature.	1
I've used a number of different versions of such products, and this JB Weld product is my favorite so far.  Sets up quickly, bonds well, and has excellent high-temperature properties.	1
Seals as advertised and smallish tube does not cure up and waste the unused portions BUT when employed to seal cracks, holes and even threads on antenna bolts, get tacky pretty quick as if it can't wait to do its job (so no fears about weather causing a re-do!)  Have also ordered some competitors so will be back to revise this or add praise ....  Rated #2 of the top 3 tested	1
Good Sealer, works well.	1
Needed this to fill some screw holes on an RV - worked well.  I have used similar brands, but JB has always done me right in the JB Weld, so I bought this.  I recommend it, like others, it can get messy.	1
I am using this to coat and insulate the hot end of my 3D printer. It does a great job of insulating the head and keeping the temperature steady. It also protects my hands from burns should I accidentally touch the hot end	1
Not very accurate.	-1
Not really stainless steel...just not right for jewelry cleaning. Sent back.	-1
Couldnt print anything longer than ten minutes.  Filament kept jamming.  I had to keep cutting the filament because it kept getting tangled!!!  I would not recommend.  I simply trashed the whole spool.  I put in a hatchbox and my issues were gone.  Yes I tried many temps.  Im not new to 3d printing.  Waste of money.	-1
I've gone through about 25 spools so far, half ABS and half PLA, from about 7 manufacturers. The BuMat Clear PLA is the only one that is brittle and sometimes breaks during a print.	-1
Quality of prints is okay but it is very frustrating to use as there are random breaks in the filament.  In other words, if you don't watch carefully, your printer will get to a spot where the filament is broken continue on as if nothing is wrong.  I wondered if it was the printer so I unspooled several feet and sure enough, I get to a spot that it is broken.  This is the only spool I have ever had with this situation.	-1
I haven't found this filament to be as brittle as some other transparent filaments unless it gets cold.  Transparency is very good and so far it hasn't had any knots when unwinding.  Here's more information on the clear filament and the brittleness problem. Only the last few inches of the spool become brittle and the easiest thing to do is to unload the filament and just break off the brittle part. The white PLA does this as well and it's easy enough to work around.  But I discovered a bigger problem when I reordered the clear PLA, they sent a different filament which was translucent and not transparent like the last spool (calling it "clear" is somewhat ambiguous). I kept it sealed so I could return it, but they told me it would be the same after it was heated. They were wrong, the package is now open because that's what they told me to do, and they aren't responding to my messages any more. It's too bad, the original clear was good but I don't trust the vendor and will take my business somewhere else. Be careful if you use "Shop 3D Supplies", maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't.	-1
The yellow is more of a Mountain Dew color. Translucent not Opaque!	-1
Very brittle. Breaks a lot.	-1
I had problems with nozzle jams with this filament. I don't know if I just got a bad roll, or if this is an indication of their quality control. I will use up the rest of the roll in small jobs that I can keep an eye on while printing.	-1
After a week or so using this ABS material, I printed a model which needed support.  A popular support material is HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene), which, if more than simple separation from the printed part is needed, is dissolvable in d-limonene, a citrus product.  I have been using this technique with other makes of ABS for a year now, and have had no problems.  In fact, I have a couple ABS parts (from material from another vendor) soaking for a week in the d-limonene, with no degradation or softening of the part.  Last night I put a print that was made using this BuMat ABS to soak, and this morning found it had fallen apart.  I printed out again, and kept track of the part in the d-limonene for a couple hours, and found that the surface had started to soften.  Only a thorough rinsing and applying heat to solidify the ABS and cook out the d-limonene saved it.  I'm very disappointed that this make of ABS (in this case Clear Filament) cannot be treated like other makes.	-1
Twine is way too thin, impossible to get knots out if I need to redo the tie on a plant.	-1
It's silicone caulk, in a easy cheese can for 200-300% more cost for less product.

4 of the 10 did not work.. seller did adjust credit ... thanks. they are not the quality switches i buy even at the local radio shack but much cheaper ... one gets what one pays for.  but i don't with in the field of rocket science so the ones that do work will save me $$$  on the fence if I  would buy again.. for just messing around bread board and simple project yes.. but something that was more... no	-1
They say we "get what we pay for" and "if something seems to be to good to be true that it probably is."  Well in the case of these switches both is true.  payed very little for these switches and they are worth even LESS!  They look well pretty enough, however after taking the time to wire up all 6 contacts on 6 of the switches...  All of them failed after being switched on and off less than half a dozen times. They are all CRAP!	-1
Mostly these and other hammers have soft rubber mallets.  Not these. They are hard plastic and tend to be uncomfortable to both examiner and patient.	-1
First of all, the bearings in these are total garbage. They wouldn't slide smoothly at all on a hardened steel shaft. So I swapped them out for some nicer bearings, and all was well.  Second, the mounting holes are not threaded their entire depth, just the first couple millimeters. The threading also wasn't straight on one of mine, but off at about a 15 degree angle. If you need these threaded the entire depth, you need to buy an M4 tap to go with it. Just be careful you don't follow crooked threads and break your tap.  Finally, these still have a rough cast finish. The bearing surface really needs to be milled flat, which I did on a little desktop milling machine.  After my modifications these were decent, but as they come out of the box there are unusable. Don't buy these unless you plan on fixing a lot of flaws.	-1
About a weeks worth of duty on a 3d printer which didn't print more than maybe 4 hours.	-1
Partially tapped holes limit you to only top mounting. The wholes are not square on all blocks. Some of the bushings are missing 3-4 ball bearings making them jerky. I guess for $8 you get what you pay for.  EDIT: Bought a second set because the 1st ones were useless. These came with the bearings on the outside! Loose in the bag, so... again completely useless! The seller NEVER response to emails and shipping to return them costs more than they did.	-1
Mounting holes are drilled all the way through, but only partially tapped.  M4 taps.  M4 bolts will go in about 11 mm before bottoming out.  I broke a screw off figuring this out during mounting (I assumed the error was misalignment of my mounting holes).  So a thru-hole of about 17.6 mm is tapped just over halfway.  While this may be OK for some mountings, I had to tap out 16 holes just to mount a bed along these rails.  Buyer, beware--another example of Chinese quality....	-1
This is the worst ones I have purchased yet. Perfect for one use but the gel peels off when taking them off your body. I used all of them faster than any I have ever purchased and only got to reuse about a quarter of them. Going back to the ones I purchased before these.	-1
Ok	-1
I unboxed the device, turned it on, and it seemed to work. I exposed it to a sample of ore which had been measured at 750 cpm of Beta, the seller said. I put that sample on the deice - nothing. I then exposed the device to an air cleaner filter - a low level source. Nothing. The output of the device fluctuates up and down even if the sensor is blocked with metal or other objects. This does not seem to sensing anything, and I can't get different readings from concrete walls, carpets, or other items. In other words, this does not seem to measure anything with any sensitivity. This might be a bad tube, so I'm sending it back. I had hoped that it would respond, but was disappointed.  I gave it 2 stars, but it was worthless, I'm sorry to say. I am developing radiation detectors, and hoped for a device to calibrate against, but will look elsewhere.	-1
Acid bottle seals look like someone has tried to open some leaking in plastic bag shipped in. No directions or exertion date silver solution looked very dark. They actually looked like someone had been storing in a jewelers bench had silver and gold flakes all over them.	-1
This does not measure in fractions of an inch, the so called Imperial System.  It measures in thousandths of an inch, which the seller seems to think is fractional.  The size was about right, but the lack of Imperial measurements caused me to return it.	-1
One star is still to good for this POS. worked for the first few weeks and then started acting up. Now out of the 30 days Return time. The electronic is freaking out far before you get a battery warning. Will be ok for a short time after changing the Battery. Also it has IP54......yea but only printed on it.....the slightest bit of liquide (water/coolant) and the display goes crazy showing all kinds of readings. You have to hold it dry and once it gets wet the best Methode is to blow with the air gun between scale and electronic to get it cleaned out. Over all you have to cross check most of the time since you cannot believe the numbers it shows.	-1
Screen goes crazy once it hits 100mm mark 1to99 works fine. Pretty disappointing.	-1
I was really disappointed with these calipers after reading all the positive reviews and I also have other iGaging tools. I let the calipers sit for a day to let the temperature stabilize to match my other measuring instruments. I used a precision 2" block as a check and it measured from .002+ to .002- depending on where on the jaws I made the measurement and I made sure it was exactly perpendicular to the jaws. I then used my digital micrometer and another digital caliper for comparison and both measured precisely 2.000 inches. The other digital caliper would measure the same from top to bottom of the jaws. The calibration check sheet that came with the calipers showed that this set of calipers was supposed to be right on but maybe something happened in shipping.	-1
I was happy with this caliper, but today it stopped working. I replaced the battery and nothing, the screen just flashes random numbers constantly. I used it very lightly this 9 months and it was never dropped. I guess I should have bought a Mitutoyo. You get what you pay for! I will contact the company to see what they will do for me and I will update this review.  Update: October 24, 2015; Not looking good!! iGaging has not answered 2 e-mails I sent asking them for directions on how to send my caliper to them for repair. I stated that the caliper is still under warranty. If I ever hear from them, I'll do another update. November 2, 2015: 4 e-mails total and not a word from iGaging. I give up. Never buying another iGaging product again. End of story.	-1
while its marginally better than the very low end calipers, these are still not as good as mits.  these are about 1/3 the cost of a mit, but I don't consider this a great deal since the cheap ones are as good and are even lower cost than this.  there are also 'many igaging' calipers.  not sure why; maybe its fakes or its a generic brand; but I've gotton very mixed quality on amazon and ebay with igaging.  I can't say I trust this 'brand' and I just don't consider it any better than the lowest end no-name (h-freight) style calips.  only good thing for this is: spc output uses same cable as mit and there is opensource code to parse the data stream.	-1
Worked fine for about a month.  Then went on the fritz.  Had to return it.	-1
First, I should say that my house is far from ideal for the upcoming robot vacuum invasion. There's a ton of stuff on the ground - rugs, cords, dog beds, furniture, ...dogs.  I have an older generation Roomba for pets and it's really a 50/50 chance on whether or not the unit will be stuck somewhere or parked properly on its charging station when I wake up in the morning.  Much like the Roomba, this Moneual RYDIS H68 has the same exact problems getting stuck as the Roomba, but it seems to be worse. The Roomba seems to have a bit more clearance for cords. When my Roomba runs into my Dyson's power cord, it can usually power over them and keep going. So far, the RYDIS has gotten stuck each and every time (with the mopping attachment off or on). It even has this problem with some of my thicker rugs. Also, as far as I can tell, if it can clear the rug, it will try to mop it. This seems like a bit of a flaw in its programming.  As far as noise is concerned, the vacuum is actually significantly louder than its Roomba counterpart. It doesn't seem to have more suction as far as I can tell (neither unit is really what I'd consider a "powerful vacuum"), so I'm not sure why it makes so much more racket. If you have it just do the "mop" function, it's quiet - just the hum of its motor.  For the actual "mopping," I've been underwhelmed. The unit works similar to a steam mop in that it has a reservoir that it pulls water from. This slowly dribbles onto a microfiber pad, which the robot drags back and forth along your floor. There's no active application of the cleaning agent - ie: no jets or nozzles - it's just wet rag on floor. Now this in itself isn't a big problem for me - heck, it's how Mom used to make me clean the floors - but the mapping software seems less than ideal. As I watched my little robot do its "mop" function, it successfully went over about 20% of my floor before retreating to its charger and declaring the work complete. When my Roomba would hit a hard object, it would do that "bounce" maneuver where it'd tap its front bumper over and over against the object, turning slightly each time until it found a free path. The RYDIS would do this once, discover an obstacle, and then smoosh its bumper against the object at a slightly off-angle, rubbing against said object the whole way. In the entire time I watched it, it didn't really go back over areas it had been either - it'd just make a bee line in a certain direction and turn at a random angle, and wander off into a completely different room. It never came back to the original area.  Again, my house's first floor configuration is far from ideal for these types of robots, but my Roomba does a much better job so far. If you have a simple home with fewer obstructions, the H68 might work well for you. Otherwise, they have a few kinks to work out in my opinion.  **Edit - Aug 3rd, 2014: Malfunction central**  I've been running the Moneual RYDIS for a while now and I've decided to modify my initial impression down from a 3 to a 2 star review. As far as cleaning goes, not much has changed. What made me drop a star was the (mal)functioning of the robot itself. Generally speaking, my Roomba has the day-to-day duties, and I only run the RYDIS when I want a separate wet clean. So far, the machine has a 30-40% success rate when asked to both clean and return to the charger. You seem to have two major options - 1: Clean a tiny area back and forth for twenty minutes, successfully return to charger - or - 2: Clean larger part of the house, get "lost," never return to charger. There are a couple of other options that appear more rarely: Move about five feet away from the charger, get "lost" after less than five minutes, end cleaning in error: stopping in the middle of the floor, and the rarest: Successfully clean a large part of the room and successfully return to the charger.  With my Roomba, whenever I find that it's not on its charger, it is generally because the unit got stuck on something; usually cords. The RYDIS seems to just stop in an open area - sometimes far away from its charger base, sometimes less than six feet away in a straight, unobstructed line.  A new and exciting thing my unit has started to do is get stuck on chair legs. The unit crawls to a 30 degree angle or so, lifting its wheels off the ground so that it no longer has traction. Then it just spins its brushes while stuck.  The last time it did this, the unit would no longer respond to any soft commands (ie: you couldn't push the buttons on the unit or the remote). I had to flip it over and disconnect the battery to reset it.	-1
I had bought this in April, 2014, I have been using it in my 2nd floor master bedroom since, I had it set up on schedule every weekday while nobody was at home, it worked ok, once in a while I would find it somewhere on the floor nowhere near the base, so I had to pick it up and put it back, the next time it would work fine again.  However the problem became more persistent starting from two weeks ago, it happened everyday for 10 days in a row, so I decided to call this company and tried to get this issue resolved, the 1st time I called, I was asked a whole bunch of questions that gave me the impression that they were trying to deny there was such a problem, there was question about the location of the home base, the distance between the home base and the virtual wall, blah, blah, blah, and this lady told me that I had to watch Roomba while it's working and see if there's any error message that might indicate what the problem is, so that's what I did on Sat. an Sun., the same thing happened, no error message given. So I called them again on Monday, after 20-min's hold time, I was only to be told to run more tests, that's when I said enough is enough and asked to be transferred to a supervisor. Well, she came on and offered more trouble shooting tips and kept me on the floor trying different things to no avail for half an hour, finally she gave up and said they would send me a replacement without a battery or any other accessories. After the hour-long phone call, I received an email from them stating that there's no warranty for the replacement after the original warranty runs out, which from my understanding is you get this piece of junk for $700, after that, you will be out of luck. I will never buy anything from this company again.	-1
Bottles are smaller than I imagined.	-1
Not great seal; they leak.	-1
Not good.  The orifice reducer fits just fine, but if the reducer is on the bottle, the cap won't fit.  The cap fits fine without the reducer.  So take your pick:  use it as an open bottle and have to use a pipette, or use it with the reducer but not have a cap.  Not a good choice.  My correspondence had been unanswered after two weeks, not good customer service, will not buy these again.	-1
Leaky	-1
The silver color is so crappy, I haven't been able to print anything decent with it. I think it's just a problem with the silver, the prints fail every time. Black and lime green work great though.	-1
I had a great deal of trouble with this particular color.  Poor layer adhesion (pulled apart) and build plate adhesion.  I printed immediately after opening the sealed package, and tried several different settings for temp, layer thickness, etc.  Also seemed to be inconsistent color, as my prints seemed to have lighter and darker regions.  I  use other SainSmart colors and have had great results.  Maybe I got a bad batch?	-1
I really wanted to love this printer. I have 2 other 3D printers including a Replicator 2 and a Printrbot Make that we built from a kit. Both of those are great. The Make is slow but prints nice. This printer produces horrible print quality despite trying every adjustment the book. Blobs and pits and stringy diseased looking prints. Worst of all is Zero customer service from Printrbot. All communication ignored. Including 2 requests for an RMA	-1
The printer prints good but its design has a flaws that allows a connector to become unplug during printing and then shorts the printrbaord and Printrbot will not fix this under warranty as well as their support is all but useless for this problem and their sales site does not function currently as the California tax calculation is incorrect so my attempts to purchase a new board are not successful so I have a dead printer I can not fix. I do not recommend purchase of this product till there are some serious changes to this product and Printrbots warranty which claims to cover material and defects but actually they do not cover a bad selection of a wire that has open metal pins with no protection from shorting if it becomes disconnected during use on a product made of metal especially this is not a common design feature with most manufacturers and the connector is not locking to prevent unintended disconnection as well as the male and female connectors are not of the same type so they could be locked. look at the included photo and you will see the open metal pins that have no protection and this coming from the Printrboard and carries power and signal from the board to the auto leveling probe. but remember they choose the compenets but this can not be a material defect on their part, normally a power providing cable would be femal on the supply side and male on the component side so I concider this a defect no matter what Printrbot calls it.	-1
These magnets will not even hold themselves on a steel surface.	-1
They break by looking at them.	-1
Not rare earth.	-1
Not strong at all	-1
Weak magnets. Bought to hold small items, like gloves, on the side of my fridge. They slowly slip...very weak. Neodymium magnets I reviewed elsewhere are much much stronger!	-1
The magnets shipped in a small white cardboard box. Inside the box the magnets were just loose but obviously all clumped and connected. So the random nature of this led the magnet to scratch the white paint on other hooks. Basically they all had black/gray scrapes and marks on the white paint since no separation or padding was put between each hook. While they "work" technically as magnets with hooks, the whole point of nicely white painted hooks was to look nice when used and this completely failed.	-1
In the image these say the bristles are stainless but they are not.	-1
I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.  However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.  *This review left on HATCHBOX spools where I encountered this issue.	-1
Vacuumed sealed bag was already open, tape was cut on box, desiccant packet wasn't anywhere to be found. Idk how itll print. I feel like I got someone elses return order. Not happy.	-1
There is something not quite right with my spool.  First it is totally mis-wound.  I was having it catch from the beginning of the spool.  I had to unwind over half the spool to get it straightened out.  And the print quality isn't what I expect from Hatchbox.  Are these coming direct from Hatchbox?	-1
Don't buy here... very old very brittle.  Will have to crank up your temps to get to work. Hatchbox is good PLA this spool is just really old.	-1
Good quality filament for a great price.  Using this on my Proforge with a 0.4mm nozzle printing in 0.2mm layers and the results are really quite good.  UPDATE:  So, the quality of prints with this filament are very good.  However, I had TONS of problems with the spool.  Catches were a regular occurrence, and with a Bowden feed, this can be a problem.  They self-corrected a few times, but I also had to run over to the printer and fix the catch many, many times.  A couple of times small prints failed because of this (led to "air printing" where nothing was being fed).  The worst was about 80% through the roll, the filament was completely tangled; not caught, but looped around itself.  It failed 20 hours into a 28 hour print.  So, I probably lost a decent amount of the roll and a whole lot of time.  So far I like the quality of the actual filament from Hatchbox (this wasn't my only roll), but the other roll has also had a lot of catches.  If I find that it is looped on itself somewhere, both items will probably end up with a 1-star rating.  Doesn't matter how nice a good print feels when you have failed prints due to poor QA/QC.	-1
It was absolutely excellent... until it wasn't. One of the three spools I purchased had a 20cm length of PLA that was contaminated. It wasn't black, it was clear. It was almost 3mm in diameter (this is 1.75mm PLA). It also didn't melt at the same temperature as the rest of the PLA and destroyed the hot end of my brand new printer.	-1
I'm really disappointed in this.  I am new to 3d printing but have gone through a full spool of red and am now using white with no problems.  I tried many different settings to get the black to work but it kept curling, warping and delaminating.  I wasted over a half of a spool assuming that it was user error before I switched back to white and everything prints great over a wide range of settings.  It's hard to explain since no one else seems to be having this problem, based on the many reviews.  It works to print in another color and spray paint it with SEM (automotive) black trim paint, but that is inconvenient.  I'll try another brand.  I'm using a Hic-Top Prusa i3 printer from a kit.	-1
Hatchbox is generally a good brand but I wouldn't recommend the red every print I've did has failed with the recommend the red. The black is good	-1
Although the plastic prints good, I was half through an 8 hour print and the extruder chewed through the filament because the winding on the spool was looped under other filament causing feeding to stop. When I unwound  some of it to clear the issue, it was looped on three rotations of the spool out of six. Maybe there's even more, not sure.  I'm new to 3D printing and I've used other brands sold on Amazon that  print just as good, much cheaper, Made in USA and don't have entangled winding. But, I was caught up in the hype.	-1
Not horrible, but not good either. Iv clocked well over 4000 prints on my 5, 3d printers, and this Hatchbox filament is fairly consistent in diameter which is usually the big quality issue, so good there.. but after printing 1 spool of Hatchbox (black) filament i had to strip and clean my hot end to remove an odd buildup of burnt material adhering to the stainless steel filament path and making flow intermittent,.. ~4000 prints under my belt, and I have never seen build up like this before with any other PLA. Was it contaminated, does it have filler, are they blending,. I don't know, all i know is that I did not receive pure PLA. The other big issue is color,. I ordered red, what i got was labeled red,.. but the color on the spool was most certainly orange. I am a photographer, I know color, so I am not just being picky, this is tangerine at best, and nowhere near as close to red as the re-colored photo shows. Ultimately I returned the "red", and if i had any black on the spool to return I would have returned that also. Oh, and i didn't even get a form response when i wrote to them asking nicely about the color issue. aka 0 customer service. For that i just knocked off one of the two stars I was going to give due to the diameter tolerances being fairly tight.	-1
At the price of $21.98 when I bought this (January 2015) it was a good deal. However at the current price $29.98 its not a deal anymore. I can buy PLA filament made in the USA for less than the Hatchbox (made in china) price of $29.98.  2018, January Update: The price is now 27.87 which is still to high. When you get down to the inside winds of this filament it is wound so tight in a small circle that it wants to break just sitting on the spool. The spool should really have a bigger center hole to avoid this issue. Also I have noticed Hatchbox filament tends to get very brittle like dry spaghetti I have had a third of a roll shatter in to little pieces due to the brittleness and the too-tight winding.	-1
I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.  However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.  *This review left on HATCHBOX spools where I encountered this issue.	-1
Poor spool winding destroyed 5 hr print.	-1
Its not terrible for the price but i will definitely buy a better higher priced filament from now on. The spool started off well but it had some pretty major variations in diameter, and towards the end of the spool it started getting air bubbles and had some moisture so the prints didn't really turn out at all.	-1
Only used 1/3 of the roll and threw it away.  I purchased justabs series y had flawless prints with the whole roll.  This lifts off the bed horribly.  Layer adhesion is 0.  This is the worst ABS I have ever used.  Actually had to replace printer parts that broke due to parts lifting and getting ripped off the bed then moving around and jamming into moving parts.  Do not purchase this if you value your printer.	-1
Great vibrant color.  Goopy, stringy and smelly. Would not buy again.	-1
The spool I received prints absolutely beautifully, and is very well priced. The color itself is also deep and rich and very nice.  *UPDATE* My initial review was, alas, too soon. One of the principal reasons to print with ABS, which is more fickle than PLA, is of course acetone vapour smoothing. THIS FILAMENT DOES NOT VAPOUR SMOOTH. Sure, maybe it'll get a little shinier, but it won't come even close to smoothing out. Shame really, because the filament printed beautifully, but without smoothing what is the point?	-1
ok	-1
Worst abs that I've ever used.  This stuff doesn't extrude easily or print smoothly.  I've never had so many headaches with printing anything on my flash forge x before.  Maybe I got a bad batch?  Not sure but switching out other brands instantly fixed my issue here	-1

I got a bad batch. The ABS was mixed with some other thermoplastic, possibly PLA but it could be anything. I only found out when I tried to dissolve some in acetone. ABS plastic dissolves completely in acetone leaving you with a mixture that you can use as glue on your heatbed, or to glue two pieces of ABS together. You can also use acetone vapor to chemically polish the surface of an ABS printed part, it's one of the great reasons for using ABS to print. This filament did not dissolve completely, there were strands of another plastic left behind that acetone does not dissolve. No matter how long I left it to dissolve, this other plastic remained, contaminating the whole bottle and making a mess. So the filament is defective and I'm returning two rolls of it. Hopefully this is just a single bad batch and not representative of the product as a whole. I tried to attach a picture of the strands left behind next to another brands ABS but anytime I attach it my review is not accepted..	-1
I have gone through about half of this spool and I have yet to get a good print.  I've tweaked the temperature up and down - and it just doesn't seem to melt consistently.  I will not be buying this again.	-1
I would not recommend, co,pared to other manufacturer PLA's and other Hatchbox PLA's I've had issues with the blue PLA no matter what i did with it. Prints look great but the strength has been extremely brittle.	-1
Robo3D, E3Dv1 hot-end. Tried all the way up to 265C down to 230C, with and without a touch of oil. Always jammed ~30cm a time.  Looked good when it started at 258 (slightly glossy, free flowing), but jammed during the print.  Ended up using Shaxon for the job, but Shaxon warped a lot...	-1
This did not work well for me.  It had a lot of dark spots in it on the spool so they were in everything I printed.  This filament also burned at low temps, 235 deg, and left burnt pieces embedded in my prints.  I tried various temps from min to max and it appeared lumpy and did not lay down so well regardless.  About 1/3 the way into the spool and temp of 235 deg I was able to get some spotty prints made.  I was very disappointed and will not be purchasing this product again.  As a test I switched to another color and it printed very nicely.  I have used blue and red from the same vendor and those worked very well for me but I Don't Like This One.	-1
Had issues with this roll. Only had it 2 weeks and began to get brittle with every run. Had to discard 3/4 of the roll. I always keep all my PLA in sealed bags with moisture packs when not running jobs.	-1
Nothing but problems with this filament will never buy again.	-1
As much as I love hatchbox filament, the last 3 rolls I have gotten have been riddled with tangles.  I would give a much better review if I felt like I could trust it printing by itself for more than 20 minutes without worrying about it tangling on the spool and killing my print.	-1

First let me say i love hatchbox filaments. There worked well for me I've used 20+ rolls now and love it. However this last roll i got, The first 150grams were good but then the diameter really changed and I never experienced this before with their products but I got a jam.	-1
The filament going to my extruder keeps getting bound up in the filament remaining on the roll and ruining prints.  It has gotten stuck so tightly twice that it broke the filament at the extruder and was nearly impossible to pull out of the roll by hand.  This is not an issue with my printer.  The manufacturer either wound this roll too tight or something because it constantly bind in the filaments on the roll even when you unwind it by hand.  You can hear it constantly snap and pop as is gets caught and then snaps free.  The only way I can get it to print is to unroll by hand before the print however much filament I might need on this print.  Try rolling off 30 or 40 meter for a big print and then winding it back on by hand.  It works but it is a pain to say the least.  I sent a message to the seller several days ago and got no response.  I won't buy from this seller again and likely won't be buying Hatchbox again either.	-1
Same settings that I use on other ABS filaments do not work on this.  It prints, but printed object feels flimsy and bends so easily.  Other identical objects printed with same settings feel very sturdy (I compared case I printed for a RepRap discount full graphics display from thingiverse).  Creates lots of oozing also.  I have tried temperatures going down to 230c (struggles to extrude), and 248c (feels like too drippy).  Will try returning it.  Very disappointed.  Ordered it mainly for low price and good reviews.	-1
eh the material shrinks ALOT i know its because its ABS but seriously?   gaps between layers of prints  print slipping off bed	-1
This filament is okay at $16 for quick tests and prototypes.  The diameter changes every few meters but also is out of round.  Drying is dificult because it softens at 75C and will deform.  After buying higher quality filament I see how bad this filament really is.  I have purchased 7 spools of hatched and black 1.75mm with the same basic problem, the flow MUST be adjusted for eveey print and even during prints.	-1
I got this filament in two forms, as part of the multi color sample and as a 1Kg spool. The center hole of the spool is smaller than normal and didn't fit my spool stand (never had this problem with Makerbot and other vendors). Color is deep blue (good) but printing results were mediocre, compared to Makerbot's PLA. My test object is a 25x25x100mm hollow box with thin walls and nozzle temperature changing gradually from 200c to 175c. The printout had cracks and looked rougher and with more droplets than the Makerbot PLA (in both cases, I am looking for the temperature band with best printing results). I had better PLA from other low cost vendors like this one.	-1
This is the filament that I used to recommend to everyone, decent quality at a decent price but after my last batch no more.  I don't know what they did but they quality really went down hill	-1
At the price of $21.98 when I bought this (January 2015) it was a good deal. However at the current price $29.98 its not a deal anymore.

I don't understand what is wrong with this product but it is the worst I have ever used. It doesn't melt properly to be used with my printer, it completely clogged the nozzles  EVERY time used and had to be heated to 260 degrees to finally remove it from the print nozzles for the fifteenth time! Complete waste of my TIME and money!	-1
Plastic package was not sealed. Right away, I am having tons of issues with moisture as the filament spurts out of the nozzle. I have bought Hatchbox PLA numerous times before and had no issues.	-1
I had been impressed with hatchbox PLA so I gave the ABS a try.  Pops constantly - this is immediately after opening the sealed spool (no leaks, desiccant and all).  Hard to get good print quality when you're getting so many tiny explosions.	-1
Poor quality inconsistent size	-1
I liked it for the first couple prints, but like other people have stated the spool was miswound. I really really wanted to like this companies but now that im moving into bigger production prints i don't know if i would buy again.	-1
Drippy and terrible	-1
The last few spools of this Black "ABS" started jamming my printer. It seems thicker and less ABS in it and more of a blend. I am returning one spool and possibly 3 more. It just doesn't act like the previous spools that I have purchased which means it jams my printer too much.	-1
I got a bad batch. The ABS was mixed with some other thermoplastic, possibly PLA but it could be anything. I only found out when I tried to dissolve some in acetone.

Hopefully this is just a single bad batch and not representative of the product as a whole. I attached a picture of a sample of red ABS next to another brands grey ABS.	-1
brittle and turns white with acetone. overpriced	-1
this filament is some of the worst I have ever used. no temperature will make it work on my leapfrog	-1
So far this filament has been very hit or miss on the prints. It clumps up and curls strangely. This often causes the print to be knocked free of the bed or support. I have tried several ranges of temps from 230 all the way down to 190 and it is not consistent in it behavior through the roll.  It doesn't cold vapor smooth on many of the prints when using acetone. Even when it does smooth it isn't uniform in the smoothing. I did a few test of dissolving some of the pieces that didn't print well and they don't dissolve in the acetone.  This leads me to believe this is not 100% abs filament but is contaminated with some other plastic. I will finish this roll off on non critical prints and try a different brand.	-1
Hatch Box is a fine product, I have several other spools of their filaments, this one in particular is very brittle and had caused several plugged nozzles while using.  Not always but I personally would not buy the RED ABS again. The price is not the least expensive either so I had expected it to perform as well as the BLACK ABS from Hatchbox  that I purchased and am using - did not have the brittle issue with it.  Just be very mindful of the temps when using the ABS - I recommend 235 ~ 245 and prints well.  Looked for contact info for FireSale Merchant and was unable to spot where to let them know about the product, if so I would have contacted them about it.  I suspect it may be old or a batch problem - not sure.	-1
I really wanted to like this product. The reviews were decent, the price was right, but it just wasn't good. For some reason, this filament is horrible at handling any overhang. IF you are printing items with no overhang, go for it. But, sadly almost everything I print has some angle that this filament butchered. To make sure before posting this, I attempted a print about 20 different times with 20 separate settings for support structures, temp, etc. Then I changed back to my normal filament and had no trouble printing the same object with just about any setting. The issue with overhang makes me thing there is possibly bad layer adhesion, which I didn't even bother testing.	-1
Get clumpy prints.  The thing is I get good results and then suddenly bad results in the same roll	-1
Melts well at 230C but forget walking away from an automatic print. Large prints failed everytime, nozzle not obstructed. Noticed knurled hobb screw kept showing chew, found actual blobs in the filament thruout the inside of each roll, not evident from the outside. Could be good filament if they get it together, but there are more choices out there that wouldn't have EVER had this set of errors. RUN	-1
The worst PLA filament I've ever used.  I had a few decent prints from it, but everything else failed.  I adjusted software settings and hardware settings multiple times, but I just could never get great prints from it.  I have nothing good to say about this filament.	-1
Expect the last quarter of Hatchbox PLA to just shatter and fall apart as shown is this photo. This PLA gets brittle and is wound too tight so it just falls apart when you get any where near the end of the spool.	-1
The most poorly wound spool of filament I have encountered. This spool has ruined 5 prints from tangles do to poor winding. Hatchbox has a good reputation and I have had better luck with other spools from them but this one was terrible.  Otherwise very nice filament, good pure white and prints easily, when it doesn't tangle.	-1
Spool is huge, filament pull moisture very fast. Bad prints after a weak. kept in dry vacuumed plastic bag.  The price keeps going up, which is weird as quality is meh.	-1
Watch the price before buying, if you are paying over 22 then you are wrong. It will double in price over night. Other wise this is good stuff	-1
Gets brittle after a while and breaks during printing.  This is my second roll.  Don't think I'll risk a third.	-1
I have had the Hatchbox black for a week.  It's brittle and just not working without breaking in the nozzel.  I spend almost as much time unclogging the printer as I do anything else.  Stay away from the black, it's not good filament.  Maybe I got a bad batch.	-1
Although the quality of Hatchbox filament has been generally quite good, this is the third time in recent memory that shipment has been significantly delayed.  Not talking a few days here, more like weeks.  And it's not limited to one particular color.  It's clear that production is overwhelmed by demand.  In short, if you're on a short timetable -- order something else.	-1
Product isn't real bad but if you don't mind , in the middle of printing , the filament snaps due to being tangled on the spool then it is not a bad product. I had untangled it numerous times and missed catching it before it caused problems. Lost the print, wasted the filament, had to stop and rewind the balance of the spool of white filament unto an empty spool to use the balance of the filament. This happened with better than a half spool of line left on it and it was a Pain In T. A.  But am using the balance of the line and will use another source for filaments.  I have found one made in the USA and unspools flawless and high quality product and is available on Amazon. 3D Solutech Real Blue 1.75mm PLA 3D Printer Filament 2.2 LBS (1.0KG) - 100% USA]]	-1
This filament had several knots in it that caused major problems during prints.	-1
Looks like a blind child soldered this thing.  There's burn marks, shorted pins and cold solder point all over it.  Quality in the through hole soldering is very questionable to say the least. It got one star because Amazon made me to post this review.	-1
Unfortunately, this one is going back to Amazon without even having flipped the switch.  The two attachments (utility and squeegee) fit directly onto the wand and do not move/swivel at all.  If you are on the tall side (I am 6') the resulting angle is such that neither attachment sits flat on the floor unless you bend over, albeit not a lot, but...  The utility attachment is fine for the floor, but may not fit in tight spaces, and does not have bristles.  And, as others have pointed out, there is no long, narrow attachment that is nice for getting in the area along car seats and similar tight spots.  In fact, this vacuum really is not appropriate for cars, unless you remove the attachment, leaving a hose with a wide diameter that is incompatible with virtually all attachments that come with other vacuums.	-1
They work, but there are a few things I don't like, such as: the wires are really too stiff, the welded ball on both are not great in fact one is very poor, one of the wire's strain relief does work and the wire twists back and forth where the wire inters the connector  (if I use it much I'll have to fix it to keep the wires from breaking). I bought them for just for backup, so I'll be keeping them, but I just wish they were better built!	-1
The wire seems to be really type K thermocouple wire but the plugs are not the same alloy and they are sensitive to temperature. as long as they are physically close to the cold junctions that are compensated they may work for you but they will not be usable if the temperature of the plug is different than the cold junction you will most likely be disappointed.	-1
Syringe hardly gathers any liquid	-1
my 60 degree heatbed on the 3d printer measured 168 degrees F an ice cube measured 57.7 F while in the freezer which measured 51 F  Don't trust it...it appears incapable of giving even a reasonable reading	-1
The temps do not match what other temps give.  I would hit a spot first time it is once temp the next time it is a totally different temp and never has given close to same temp twice.  Next time ill spend a little more money to get a better product.	-1
My last gun quit working after a few years of use, so needed a new one. This thing seems to fit the bill nicely and seems to work well. Point it at what you want to measure and it tells you the temp. No way for me to know if it is 100% correct, but for my needs (basic automotive stuff, around the house and just playing with) it works great, and the price was right with coupon code. I do like the blue back light, looks neat and easy to read the numbers.  Edit, July 2016: Well after only having it a few month of minimal use, the laser quit working. Temp part still works fine, backlight and display work fine, just no laser. I have tried turning the laser off and on, tried changing the battery, still not laser.	-1
First of all, the instructions are terrible. Learning by using the thermometer is the only way you will have a general idea of its operation. Secondly, the thermometer reads 2 degrees F higher than the actual temperature. When using the unit for sous vide cooking, it is close to useless.  This thermometer has some good features but they are useless without instructions on how to use them.  The thermometer was returned.	-1
This is just ok. Powers on ok, does not crash, but the resolution is as if were from a digital camera from 1984. Price is good enough but overall I don't use it as I intended to. May come in good for an emergency to try and find something that fell down in a crack or behind something, but overall not a great value and would not recommend.	-1
It did not work with Mac computer.	-1
This toy would not work at all. Some simple troubleshooting revealed that the motor and switch are OK but there was a bad soldered connection in the "red" end of the battery holder, which I had to break apart with a knife to actually see or get at. Not worth fixing, in my opinion.  In any case, this is not a robot with any sort of computing power or sensors of any kind. The legs are just for looks too; it actually rolls on wheels rather than walking. The description must be wrong -- as far as I can tell with mine not functioning, this has no way to detect or react to obstacles. It is only intended to turn when it comes to the edge of a tabletop. And that it does by a simple mechanical trick, not by any "detecting" or "intelligence."	-1
I really wanted this to be great. I love gadgets, and who doesn't like robots? I put this together in about fifteen minutes (disclaimer: I'm not a kid) and gave it a try on the living room coffee table. It did not detect obstacles of any kind, whether a magazine or something more substantial. When it reached the end of the table, it turned and crawled along the edge for a second and then fell onto the floor with a couple of legs flying off.  I don't see how anyone can learn the principles of robotics from this. As a kid, I would be pretty discouraged by this product about pursuing that field. I do not recommend this as either a learning or a fun toy for a child of any age. I ended up throwing it away after a couple of weeks' frustration.	-1

Warped after first week of use.  We have an electric/glass stovetop and didn't realize that the heat would be too much.  All other pans have done fine on it.	-1
I can't see this pan lasting as long as the one I bought a year and a half ago.  The metal is much thinner, the coating appears thinner and the skillet won't sit level on my gas range because it is handle heavy.  T-fal used to be my "go-to" skillets.  The 8 inch one  gets used 2-3x a day.  I wish I wouldn't have tossed my old black one out so I could show you the difference.  The new one is cheap feeling and for a few more dollars, I should have bought a better brand, but didn't realize how low quality these had become.  Just glad I didn't buy the matching larger sizes. I do like the color and the cool grip handle or I wouldn't give this any stars.  Sorry..	-1
The fastener itself seems fine and would be perfect for outdoor applications, but the adhesive on the reverse is very weak and imho renders this item useless for anything other than the lightest of applications.  Expect better quality from 3M.  Returning this.	-1
After a week my teeth weren't white. After 2 weeks I wondered if I kind of noticed a difference but there is definitely no definite whitening action.  Which is too bad because I really suffered using this toothpaste. I don't know if burning like fire is supposed to make me feel like it is working. But this is just burns. My lips hurt. My mouth hurts. My tongue is not speaking to me. There is a point where mint goes from "refreshing" to "chemical weapon". I think Colgate missed that line.  If you are an actor and need to cry for a role, I suggest this toothpaste. But if you like your mouth find something else.	-1
I put these on a rolling computer desk, total weight with computer? Maybe 80-90 lbs total. Within two days, one of them stopped swiveling. Within two weeks, pretty much all of them were either not rolling or not swiveling. And this is rolling across a smooth, sealed concrete floor. The damn desk would move easier if I stuck felt glides on it.  I just bought replacements, and will be tossing these worthless things in the trash by the weekend. (I am replacing them with the Waxman 2" Rubber swivels #4384799N from Lowes. Which I have successfully used numerous times in the past on other desks.)	-1
Maybe it was overloaded!? Wouldn't roll anymore because the plastic wheels went flat. Yes flat! I had a skid made out of 2X4's to mount the wheels on and put a 50 gallon tub on top with the bottom lined with 2" of sand and about 40 gallons of water. Next day I wanted to move it and the wheels just dragged (on level concrete) and left black marks. Upon troubleshooting, I noticed 2 wheels went flat and a third starting. Weight was distributed evenly across the skid and wheels were spaced to the equal measurements. I can only assume the weight was the issue. Thought it would carry the weight with ease. No complaint against the seller. Delivery was on time and packaged well.	-1
I second what another guy said. I've got 300# TOPS, spread evenly across 8 casters - that's less half the rated limit. They were tough to get rolling on day one. They've sat in place a few days and the wheels are visibly compressed/flat now.  Total waste of my time and effort to install them. Negative  value, really. If you need something rated for 25# a wheel, they 'd be ok, but I think that 100# rating must be per set, not wheel. There could just be bad batches out there... but who wants to learn that after they take the effort to build something...	-1

Junk.  This spool caused me no end of headaches.  Tried printing it across a range of temperatures from 195 to 215.  It would repeatedly jam.  The color looks great: a nice flat black, but the highly granular and irregularly shaped filament just wouldn't print reliably on my hexagon hot end.  Look for another ~$20 black filament on Amazon and be happier.  Now I have to figure out what to do with 90% of a spool of this useless PLA.	-1
clogged my hotend, tried different settings would not work, not one print successful ... trash can.	-1
I'll never buy this again. Diameter is wrong and won't pull through my extruder consistently. The material is very stiff and has a very flat type feel. Doesn't feel round so not sure on the quality process.	-1
quality is low, overall.  might be usable in a project, but would never use this in a build that I would do for someone else.	-1
these things are junk; they can't withstand solder heat for very long.	-1
Has a tendency to leak. Won't be buying these again.	-1
not even close to the picture if you want the brass screws that are pictured go else where there not here	-1
Grossly overpriced and not crazy good. $ 89.95 USD/kg while other competitors on Amazon are from $21.99-$22.99 USD/kg like eSun or the very well-backed Hatchbox. There's a reason they don't mark the weight of the spool on Amazon clearly, they say Small instead of .2kg. The industry average is anywhere from $20-30 for an entire reel of 1kg. Makerbot is the worst 3D printing company for many other reasons, but I see this as one of the most cruel. Here's why: Makerbot isn't primarily a consumer product, it's after companies and schools for sales. These Makerbots are under warranty to not tamper with their poorly engineered extruders (purposefully engineered to jam the filament upon unloading filament. You cant open it to fix it yourself, (which takes 20 minutes to do if you know how, done it myself) you have to pay 100$ for a pay per incident report, call in a repairman, or buy a new 'smart' extruder for $175 USD. These schools are also forced to only use Makerbot filament under warranty and I already explained that it was expensive, they are literally abusing this to suck funding from tech programs in schools. NOT TO MENTION the printers themselves are outrageously expensive, especially when there is a $200 USD Monoprice Select v2 with a HEATED BED that allows it to print in more than just PLA.	-1
I buy these often and I have found that almost every seller of serenity seems to send you what ever brand they have at the time. So sometimes I get a good quality tens pad and then other times I get junk that only works one time because the stick peels or loses it's stick. This is a good deal but a gamble!	-1
I have tried different brands without any incident but with this particular brand did hes of seems to wear off so quickly	-1
They're a nice value as far as replacement electrodes go, however, I am having an allergic reaction to the gel/adhesive they have on these. They are latex free, which I'm not allergic to latex...in fact I'm not allergic to anything that I know of, but after wearing these my skin breaks out into an itchy red area starting directly where the electrode was applied and spreading.  I tried being sure to thoroughly wash/soap/rinse the areas where the electrodes were, but it's still extremely uncomfortable.  After using them one time and removing them, I then have a good 3 day span of itching so badly that it wakes me up in the middle of the night. I wish that wasn't the case since I thought the price was excellent, but I won't be ordering these again.	-1
Review amended. Used it for a few days. This thing is useless. Very hard menu screens. Never stays on farenheight. Backlight won't stay on. Junk. Save your money and order a Fluke. The company after reading this review offered me a exchange or refund. I choose a refund and it was issued the next day.	-1
The Etekcity Lasergrip 630 Dual Laser thermometer gun is a nice looking thermometer. It has a nice weight to it and is a nice size. It did not feel like a toy. The Etekcity 630 battery compartment has the front of the handle that swing down and you snap on the included 9 volt battery after you remove the plastic wrap off the battery and swing it back up to close it. It has all the features that I wanted, high alarm, low alarm, max temp, min temp, avg. temp, differential, adjustable EMS, data hold temp, laser on/off, backlight on/off, dual lasers and a pouch. It beeps after you let go of the trigger. And it comes with a holster. But the main thing I wanted it didn't have and that was an accurate temperature readings. It was 5-10 degrees off. I tested it against another IR gun, home thermostat and an instant read thermometer. All three of the instruments were 1/2 degrees different from each other but the Etekcity 630 was at least 5 degrees lower from all three. It also took 10 - 15 seconds to stabilize. At times, it had a max reading number which never showed on the current reading. Sometimes it was accurate and other times it was at least 5 degrees to low. What good is a thermometer if it can't give accurate readings? If it was maybe 1-2 degrees off I can maybe tolerate it but 5 degrees, no that won't do. I might have received a defective one. I tried the Etekcity 1022 and that was very accurate but it does not have all the features that I want. It has max temp, an adjustable EMS, data hold, backlight on/off laser on/off and only one laser. It does NOT come with a holster. It was very accurate, consistent temp readings and the response was quick but the laser beam was off to the right. I returned the 1022 model for the 630 model. What a mistake. Even with an off centered beam, it was more accurate than the 630 with two good beams. I'll be returning the 630 and reordering the 1022. I rate it 2 stars.	-1
Really cheap, and doesn't hold the LED good.	-1
The tiny plastic hole holding the motor to the wand will break eventually so that motor will not stay on the wand. Mine is broken.	-1
The hooks are too loose on the probes.  Its going to be hard to keep these together. They really look like something you would buy in the .99 cent store. I would look locally before you (i spent) almost ten bucks on these,	-1

worst pan I have ever used, Eggs stuck to the pan like Glue	-1
Warped after first week of use.  We have an electric/glass stovetop and didn't realize that the heat would be too much.  All other pans have done fine on it.	-1
I can't see this pan lasting as long as the one I bought a year and a half ago.  The metal is much thinner, the coating appears thinner and the skillet won't sit level on my gas range because it is handle heavy.  T-fal used to be my "go-to" skillets.  The 8 inch one  gets used 2-3x a day.  I wish I wouldn't have tossed my old black one out so I could show you the difference.  The new one is cheap feeling and for a few more dollars, I should have bought a better brand, but didn't realize how low quality these had become.  Just glad I didn't buy the matching larger sizes. I do like the color and the cool grip handle or I wouldn't give this any stars.  Sorry..	-1
These are NOT breadboard friendly. They have short, weak pins that will not stay in your breadboard. The pins break very easily. They also have two annoying mounting ground pins that make it difficult to use on a breadboard, but these can easily be bent back. Uxcell also has no easy way to get datasheets. The encoders also do not have a printed part number. I was able to solder lead wires so i could use them on a breadboard, and they do work properly, however i would not buy these again.	-1
NOT bread board friendly.  The pins are so weak that trying to bend them the slight amount to get them to line up on a breadboard broke one off.  The side tabs force you to place it down the center line, bending those out of the way started to bend the case of the encoder.  Also did not come with mounting hardware.	-1

I have used this name product for the past 15 years, when it arrived is the thinnist garbage paper, it is so thin that when you use it you can lay it down on a magizine or rewspaper and you are still able to read thru it. Garbage !!! and just think I bought One of each size.  Must be a paper reduction act or save a tree.	-1

This smoothing pen smoothed* the print surfaces of my printed objects. However, mine constantly leaked through the threading. I could only use this product if I was willing to get acetone on my hand during operation.	-1
leaks!	-1
Would give zero stars but I can't. I got the pen, tired to open it and the top snapped right off. I was trying to unscrew the top to fill it and the plastic literally ripped in half in my hands.	-1

Unfortunately this "converter" does not work for the popular Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones.  I also tried another converter with no luck.  I called Sennheiser to ask for their recommendation.  Sennheiser said that a converter will not work - I need a DECODER not a CONVERTER.  I asked if they recommend a particular manufacturer and they said that they recommend the Wii digital (optical) to analog (RCA) decoder.  And Sennheiser recommended against using the 1/8 mm audio out jack on TVs (such as Sony, Insignia, TCL) and use the digital optical out with a decoder.  I hope this helps everyone else experiencing frustrations with trying to get perfectly good headphones to work with the new TV technology.	-1
All these great reviews. The product worked, the Optical was defective. The good thing is I always have a spare that worked.  So, the product worked,,, but don't put a defective optical connector in a system. Not everyone has a spare.  Product worked for optical out on a TV to an analogue amp...but if I hadn't had a spare optical cable, I wouldn't have been able to figure it out.  So, it does the optical digital to RCA analog conversion for a TV to a receiver/speaker. But, make certain you have a spare optical cable	-1
I could not get it to work. I sent it back.	-1
Given the price of these I expected great things from them. They are short thin rods and small enough to get inside even a 9mm case. But, they are so heavy compared to the brass case that they go to the bottom in my tumbler and the brass "floats" on top. Nothing go cleaned very well at all. The more stainless material I added, the quicker I realized the process was going nowhere. Not wanting to waste a bunch on money I took a few handfuls and added it to the walnut shell media. There it made a difference. Brass came out shinier and showed no signs of damage. They will be a bit difficult to separate from the walnut media once it needs replacing but be a major project. A vacuum held far enough away to not suck up the stainless rods will still grab the small walnut shell pieces. Running the tumbler to get all the rods to the bottom will make things even easier.	-1
i used it outside in the sun light. it lasted 6 weeks laying on the ground and weighted down on the outsides with plastic nursery pots full of soil. it lasted 6 weeks like this. it then started to crack. the cracks got bigger and longer. it got worse and worse and it got worse fast.  i also experimented with their black sheeting. much the same problem.  this sheeting may work great indoors or in applications where there is no sunlight involved.  in my case i lost my money. this product is a disaster for outdoor applications.	-1
OK, not a bad switch, but it does not fit into any commonly available electrical boxes. I am sure there is a special box, deep box, whatever, that only costs, well, more than this switch does. Then if you put it in, THAT BOX, with wires, you will violate the NFPA- NEC standard for percentage of box fill.  I gave up, and cut an opening in a 6"x6" flat front gray PVC electrical junction box. The extra space made installing the 12 AWG 300Vac wires, a breeze instead of a chore. The switch has a healthy "snap" when it operates, so it takes a bit harder push to turn it on than what you normally are used to. This is a "maintained contact" full voltage switch, (as opposed to momentary, pilot duty only) so no starter or other control circuit is needed. Looks like It makes and breaks two poles, not just one, so better for 208-240 VAC single phase, with two energized conductors. Has absolutely no overload protection that I can see.	-1
Umm this switch is a pain it the "you know what".  It is just very poorly designed and feels really cheap.  To start with it is a mechanical switch, which I knew when I ordered but just wanted to through that out there.  Magnetic switches are much safer.  You have to be creative in order to mount it because the screws on the face plate can not be used to secure the switch, and the switch is to big to fit into a handy box.  The switch also does not seem to be sealed against dust or anything.  Its just not well made and I decided not to use it.	-1
I bought this switch to repair an old Grizzly TSC-10L table saw.  Looked really nice, and I read a lot of the reviews before buying it.  Let's just say the reviewers that said this switch is too big for a normal size box are dead on accurate.  It is too big, but there's an even more annoying problem than that.  The contacts inside aren't sealed from dust.  Within a couple of weeks of having it installed, I had to tear it out to clean up the saw dust inside and it ran again for a few more weeks until I failed again.  This time I tore it down completely, opened up the back side to look at the actual switching mechanism.  The neutral line contacts were so badly carbonized due to the dust intrusion that they were no longer making contact.  Cleaning them with some emery paper solved that problem, but after seeing how easily it was for dust to get inside, I decided to just not bother re-installing it.  Instead I picked up a 20A standard toggle switch and cover plate.  Now my saw is working again with a regular size box and the wires aren't crammed in there.  It's a shame really it's a nice LOOKING product, but it's design is flawed in that it isn't protected from dust intrusion, something that should be considered when it's a switch designed for tools that generate lots of dust.  I can't even imagine the problems you might have if this were being using in a metal shop and metal dust and shavings were to get inside this switch.	-1
Just got my spool yesterday. I'm not thrilled with it so far. It seems weaker than other PLA or ABS I've printed with, and layer adhesion is pretty bad. Overhang stability seems above average.  The description says print temperatures of 195-215. Even at 215 and 0.25mm layers, the layer adhesion was awful. I was able to snap parts off with very little effort. I'm trying a print at higher temperatures and 0.1mm layers to see if it makes a difference.  I tried ColorFabb's woodFill last week and absolutely loved it, so I decided to give this a try. The ColorFabb seems like a better filament all around. This filament has a definite shine to it, while what I liked about ColorFabb's was the nice matte finish and ability to hide layer lines.  Unless something happens to greatly change my mind, I probably won't be buying more of this.  UPDATE: I just tested the 220C, 0.1mm print. It looks quite nice, and layer lines were hard to discern. The layer adhesion was slightly better than before, but still poor. Thin pieces snapped apart with very little effort (using only the tips of my index fingers and thumbs), and larger chunks broke away not just between layers but actually cracked in pieces as well. This is not a high-strength material.	-1
Bought one bottle... fabric beaded like crazy to rain. Impressed,  I bought 10 bottles to do all patio furniture. Almost $200 with tax/shipping but if it worked, $2000 of furniture could last longer. Sadly... only 3 days later furniture was no longer beading. I wonder how many positive reviewers found out this product didn't last but a few days... try it for yourself but "I told you so".	-1
I got this moisture protector because Family Handyman magazine said it worked great on shoes. I put in on my leather work boots and they seemed to soak up MORE moisture from snow and were soaking wet throughout; never got that wet before & I've had them for 10 years.	-1
Nice S hook and the twist tie is a good idea. I used it to tie my coat or my neck pillow while travel. So constnatly switching between the two. At some point (don't know where), I lost the twist tie, so I am only left with he S-hook. Use it carefully.	-1
Wrong product	-1
Bought this in August and it quit working  Worked great till then.	-1
sucks!  does not seal well.	-1
It doesn't have much sucking force.	-1
This product is a great idea on paper but the implementation is totally bad. Pros :  Inexpensive   Has great suction when it works. Cons:  Tips over way too easily.  When it tips over there is no longer any suction and you have to turn it off and then back on to get suction back.   The tipping over happens so often I just want to throw it away.   Power cord way too short.   Hose is way too short.   Filters are very inadequate.  Motor is already getting covered with dirt and debris after only a month of occasional use.   Filter Instructions are very unclear and confusing some of the parts seems to be missing to keep the filter on.  I had to use a rubber band.   The filter should be properly installed by the factory mine certainly wasn't and the instructions seemed to indicate that was normal.   I have not dared to try and pick up liquid as it looks like you need to change the filter somehow and the filter instructions are unclear.	-1
Cheapest instruments ever made.  Quality is WELL sub par.  Don't  even buy to tide you over until you get a better set.	-1
I've been using the supply for bench electronics work for about a year now and I have to say I'm generally unhappy with it.  The pro's are obvious, it has a nice form factor and good specs. But here are the cons: I'd say the most annoying one is that it doesn't have any output shutoff, as in, when you turn off the power switch, it slowly browns out as the internal caps discharge. If your only powering a little IC, it can take 30 seconds or more to shutoff. I consider this unacceptable. It also means that you need to manually disconnect your project before you turn the supply on, since you can't adjust the output before you turn it on. Basically it's a pain. I've been meaning to add a manual disconnect, but I haven't gotten around to it.  A second, minor con which I'll just get out of the way here is that the readouts are pretty inaccurate. The current readout is completely useless below 100ma. I'd call this a minor problem though, since that's what you'd expect for a budget power supply.  Ok, here's the third con, which I consider the final nail in the coffin: The display on this supply has gone blank on me several times. Each time, it required a restart to get the display back. It's not random, I think it was caused by some kind of transient condition that was happening occasionally on a certain project. ..Annoying, and it calls into question the reliability of this things control circuit. I'm mildly worried that this thing is going to shoot up to 30 volts and blow up a circuit one of these days.  The only reason I gave this supply 2 starts instead of 1 is that it does serve its purpose on my bench. I just wish I had spent a little more on something better.	-1
I'm sure this toothbrush is great, but I just can't stand the feel of the high-frequency vibration. It's like nails on a chalkboard for me. I gave it to my wife and she likes it but doesn't love it due to the angles you have to keep it on your teeth to work effectively.	-1
EDIT: They changed the formula, without changing the recommended printing temp, it's less wood like and now I've clogged two nozzles, and am beyond pissed. I will never use sainsmart again, and I was a very consistent customer before. If I could I'd make them pay for the repairs on my printer.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Filament prints easily, and is less stringy than some other PLA.	-1
Constantly clogs the extruder no matter what I set the temperatures or speed to. When I pull it out, the end is darker and smooth, like plastic. Seems when it heats up in the extruder, it hardens and clogs.	-1
For the money, the slides are OK. What IS unacceptable about this item is how they are shipped. The box of glass slides was placed into a large thinly padded envelope - the box of slides DID easily move all around inside this envelope. This resulted in 5 of the outside slides being broken/cracked. Not alarming, as there were 95 other good slides. Had I not needed to use these slides right now, I would have initiated a return. This item was fulfilled by Amazon.	-1
Made covering the print bed of my Davinci Pro quick, but sticks to printed parts better than the aluminum print bed	-1
Fairly low quality ubfortunately but depending on your application the width could be useful.	-1
wrong ones for my printer	-1
Holes are not a consistent size and in one nozzle the hole doesn't even break through the tip of the nozzle.	-1
I used these nozzles to replace my worn out reprap i3 (Maker REPRAPGURU).  The nozzle caused plastic to extrude all over the heater block.  Only buying from the OEM from now on.	-1
It does what it's suppose to. replaced clogged nozzles on my flashforge creator original. I can't compare the difference between the old nozzles to these since I bought the printer 2nd hand. But it solved my clogging and uneven filament problems.  UPDATE: After about 2 weeks, it's starting to clog frequently. It worked great at the beginning. Printing with the same roll of ABS on my old nozzles, which was printed better and lasted longer, even though it was old. Having to pull apart to clean/unclog after every print.  Changing to 1 star. Will have to look for better quality nozzles.	-1
did not work with my Afinia	-1
I knew something was amiss when I installed the first of these - they take a 6mm wrench instead of the more common 7mm. And, the taper was sharper and longer than any other nozzle I've used (10K+ hours of printing). I ended up throwing these 5 away. The sharp point tends to snag on lower layers as it passes over them in non-print moves. In fact, the only prints I could do had to be sliced so that the nozzle would never pass over a perimeter or to do a Z lift on all retractions to "jump" over existing lines. And the sharp point also "grated" over lower layers, making for a very noisy print.  I regularly use other Kamo items, but I will not use these again.	-1
It's small and the lid prevents the oil from coming out.  Have to really shake the vile vigorously for any oil to drop or splash out.  But then it flies all over the place.  The lid should be redesigned for better flow.	-1
I purchased this because it specifically mentioned use with 3D printers. The tape while of great form factor doesn't provide enough grip. I have tried calibrating the printer multiple times and even pushing the nozzle hard against the surface also increasing the extruder temperature to 215 (with PLA filament) and the tape provides very little grip.  I only purchased one other tape to try to 3D print with and the difference is night and day. The ProTapes Pro Scenic 714 has such a grip on my 3D prints that I actually have to rip the paper off the printer bed before I can take the part off (and the tape is thicker).  By comparison this tape has no grip on the printed parts whatsoever. The parts immediately start warping and lifting off the tape. Too bad because I so wanted it to work, because narrower form factor of the Pro Scenic 714 leaves creases in my 3D printed parts.  For reference I have tried this on the Printrbot Simple Metal without the heated bed.	-1
Didn't work. I'm using 3M 2094 tape right now which when replaced with this, doesn't stick at all. I went back to 3m tape.	-1
hard to apply	-1
so thin, so hard to get a clean piece off the roll, get a run it it, prepare to lose and throw away a lot of it. First time and last time buying it.	-1
It's completely unusable. If I pull, it rips... when I manage to get it to come off in one piece (extremely difficult) it takes so much force that the tape stretches and is no longer straight. The ONE time I got it even close to being a decent piece, it wrinkled when I tried to apply it to the heat bed. It is BEYOND bad.	-1
Im a librarian who has used Amazon since 1998 (when they only sold books and magazines) and this is the FIRST item Ive ever returned! Amazon lists me as being a customer "only" since 2000, but I used them before that for work/personal items.  THE SHORT REVIEW:  I plugged it into the wall AC after checking that it was set to 110 AC. This units specs are up to 30V / 5A.  I turned on the power switch and immediately the fan kicked in and the Voltage shot to 50.2V and the current went to 6.65A and the knobs had no effect of any kind.  I snapped a photo and typed a quick note to the seller (By4Easy) about the problem. The CV light was also on. The low switch only changed the current down to 3.3 amps.  A few seconds after sending the email I heard a large BANG and something blew up inside the unit.  This power source lasted less than 3 minutes.  After multiple emails over a couple weeks, and driving around town a bit I received a FULL refund.  THE LONGER REVIEW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED:  Youre supposed to use the supplied leads to short out the unit and make adjustments to the current / voltage but it was at 50v 6a and I was a little leery about that. I hesitated, but again, the unit was on for less than 3 minutes (more about that down below).  I emailed again and asked for a refund saying the unit blew up and won't turn, they asked for a photo of the problem.  I sent them the photo of the readouts at the super high levels (glad I wasted a few seconds taking the photo, or else Id have had to send just a photo of the unit turned off/dead).  They emailed back and said theyd send me a shipping label. It was a self ship. I paid $35 + $15 for this unit. The shipping from the Post Office was $39 BEFORE any insurance. The UPS store was just a little less, but still more than the unit cost me. That in itself shows that if you get a working version of this item it really is a DAMN GOOD DEAL! If  So, I wasted a day driving around to shipping companies, having them way this thing and measure the box and then quote some outrageous price. None of their weights, measurements seemed to match each other, but every single one wanted about $40 to ship this thing back home.  Having never returned anything in my past 18 years on Amazon I thought that was the end of it and itd just pull some of the heavy and nice seeming parts off this thing, but someone told me to re-email the seller. I did and a day later they emailed a new shipping label that was pre-paid. Cool!  They received (and signed) for the package after a few days. About a week later I emailed and asked about the refund. They emailed back and said theyd issue me a refund. Um, okay. Obviously they got the item back but did nothing about it. The next day I got a refund notice from Amazon and a few days after that the refund appeared on my credit card.  I am a librarian. Ive been using Amazon since 1998, back when they only sold books and magazine subscriptions. This is the FIRST ITEM IN 20 years Ive tried to return. I think this is only my SECOND 1 star rating since 1998. You can go see some of the items Ive reviewed/rated beforeI research and am generally very, very happy with my purchases. If the product is what is was supposed to be they get a 5 star, if  kinda sucks or I hate it for personal reasons it's a 4. I'm an easy grader, even though this review will sound run-of-the-mill whiney to many, that's not my style.  I knew this purchase would be a gamble because of all the reviews saying the power cords arrive with short circuits in them. I figured if that was the case I could just use a spare computer cord and throw away the one that comes with the unit. I would have rated it 5 stars if that were the case, but this just went to a deadly 6.6 amps (albeit, the promised 5 amps would be just as deadly I suppose-but not deadly to the actual unit).  The instructions say: turn on unit, THEN short out the terminals and quickly make adjustments. The supplied banana plug fell off the wire lead upon opening the package. Even if this thing didn't blow up I don't feel good about attaching (AS AN INTENTIONAL SHORT) cheap, thin wires to a RUNNING power supply blasting out 50v 6.6a. Yeah, I know people say that even cheap leads are good up to 10amps, but Im thinking: these people cant build a power supply, they cant attach the banana plug to a lead so it stays attached in shipping, Im going to trust my life/fingers to them? Anyway, there wasn't time: the thing just blew up sitting on the shelf with nobody touching it, thankfully. I supposed an experienced electrician would have immediately leaped across the table, shut it down and diagnosed the problem while disassembling it and simultaneously drinking a cup of coffee and doing a crossword puzzle. Um, yeah. Maybe. But with 50 volts at over 6.5 amps they/ I / we shouldnt have to and I'm more of a Lissajous Figure/Oscilloscope mellow type of guy. New to the higher voltages, lol.  Ive watched YouTube videos of people unboxing and using this SAME MODEL unit and they plug it in and it doesnt go past zero (let alone 50v) and explode. They plug it in, marvel at the cool red digital readout and then go on to whatever project their doing. Many owners weren't sure if the unit had a fan in it, yet my fan screamed on start up louder than my Dell desktop running Vista. Mine was special.  After unplugging the now dead brick I noticed 3 of the 4 screws holding the transformer to the bottom of the unit were loose. These are the screws sticking out of the bottom of the unit: I did NOT open the unit up. Did the transformer shift and short out something inside? I didn't want to peak inside since I was going to return this defective unit. I did notice the paint was flaking off the case near the almost all the screws that hold the case on. Had someone been playing inside this unit before or was it just a lousy paint job?  I knew that and gambled it would be a simple power switch, AC cable, AC to unit interface joint problem that people other were experiencing and then fixing. A fun, cheap way to get a power supply that you kind of fixed/modified yourself. Or heck, maybe Id be in the chosen few and get a unit that actually WORKED like promised.  Nope: I guess I got the NEW AND IMPROVED version that is shorted and runs at twice spec for a minute or two then explodes. It was LITERALLY less than three minutes by the time stamps on my photos and emails. Bummer, but for what I paid theres some nice parts I could have scavenged in the worst case scenario.  I noticed the instruction manual covers a bunch of different versions of this unit, including ones that go up to 60v. Maybe some 60v parts snuck into my unit-not enough to keep it from exploding thoughthat awful snap of an electrolytic capacitor (Im guessing) going off like a firecracker.  Honestly, 17 years on Amazon and there was a batch of cheap camera lens covers that fell off because they weren't true Canon size (which I gave a 3 star review); a bipod that arrived missing one of the two mounting pins that were supposed to be WELDED on (which I gave a 1 star review and repaired myself kinda sorta; and then THIS hunk of electric danger. [Edit: I have now made a SECOND return in 17 years on Amazon, because I was shipped a Counterfeit item-confirmed by manufacturer when I tried to register it-but that was not from this seller].  Thats about it for bad experiences in 17 years of buying for myself (tons of weird gadgets like spectroscopes, fancy telescope and camera stuff) and for libraries (books and office supplies). I wasn't even going to buy it and deleted it off my wish list, but I recently had an incredible run of some big, expensive and boring life purchases (mattress, car repair parts, medical bills, etc.) and wanted something fun.  Oh, you can see through the vent holes the less than stellar soldering job the boys in the FlingDung factory did. Its not horrible (what I can see) but you can definitely tell a human did the soldering and not a machinein a not so great way. To be sure, if you look inside the Elenco kit power supply that *I* soldered together a couple weeks ago youd probably laugh at a few things as well, but then again, you don't HAVE to look inside mine because mine WORKS.  Also, Ive only soldered 5 kits in the past few years and Id say the best of their soldering is better than the best of mine, but the worst of their soldering is way worse than the worst of mine. But then: I do not get paid to solder things and again, MINE WORKS! This does not.  My self-soldered capacitance decade box works fine! Along with the Geiger Counter in a coffee can (it raises the voltage when my ionizing uranium/uraninite test source is near, but does nothing with other rocks in my mineral collection and tallies pretty well with my real store-bought Geiger counter).  Are you looking for cheap parts or a possible mystery problem to figure out? Well, this unit is for you. Its very, very heavy and looks really cool. The digital meters wold look kinda cool hooked up to another (working) power supply if you want this thing for parts. There are course and fine adjustment knobs, which if ordered by themselves would probably cost as much as this unit.  The banana plug leads seem nickel coated, which is why the factory workers were unable to successfully solder the banana plugs and alligator clips to each end. DANGEROUS because theyll pull out and youll have a live wire dangling somewhereif your unit actually works. If  I opened the bag with the wire leads and a banana plug just fell out on its own. Ugh!  MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE KOOKY PHOTO I POSTED HERE (sometimes the Amazon phone/tablet apps don't show customer photos so you may have to use the browser version or a desktop computer). It shows 50V / 6.5 Amps. They were both a tad higher, but remember, a few seconds after snapping the photo something inside this thing literally exploded.  I suppose I could be angry/upset/indignant/etc. but I just chuckled. Also: THE SELLERS WERE REALLY POLITE in their various emails to me, and DID get me a FULL refund. However, this product is obviously junk and they really shouldnt be selling it until they fix the multitude of manufacturing problems they're continuously encountering in their factory for the past few years ago to some of the other reviews here.  Save yourself trouble and look elsewhere. Never buy anything that isn't PRIME / shipped by Amazon themselves / Fulfilled by Amazon if it was worth returning upon receipt of a defective unit. I lucked out and (after multiple prodding emails along the way) got a successful refund of ALL my money on this item.  Ive soldering up my own working power supply that is still working just fine. All I did was plug this unit in and it blew up. This was my first ever Amazon return in 17 years. I am jealous of people who just had faulty power cords, etc. that were easy fixes.  -Mike from Detroit	-1
at this point there are nearly 20 of these here on amazon and they all do the same so heh?	-1
This is a pretty good kit of spacers but not for screws or nuts. You can only mount 4 boards then you'll be heading to the hardware shop to buy the nuts anyways. You might save a little money or you might end up with a box of spacers that can't be used with the proper hardware.	-1
This kit is OK, but each part comes in the same quantity, so you're going to run out of the parts that you'll be using the most often (e.g. the nuts... you only get 12 of them, so really you can only mount three standalone boards before running out of nuts.) You're better off just buying the exact parts you need and paying a little extra per part, rather than also getting a bunch of 20mm spacers you'll never use.	-1
These don't fit my pegboards. The upper part fits fine into the pegboard, but then as I rotate and lower the basket into place the lower set of posts hits against the board instead of lining up with the holes. This isn't so bad with the largest basket, but it makes the smallest one completely unusable. Otherwise I like the coating on them and the size.	-1
Amazon keeps removing my bad review of this product. Not sure why, but trust me this stuff is total junk. Got three rolls and two of the three had major issues, If you look at the uploaded photos you will see major issues with blobs every few feet. I just tossed it all in the trash. I would never buy this cheap junk again regardless what the last user says. I buy PLA all the time. I have purchase over 50 rolls from various companies and this stuff was by far the worst I have seen. I guess the truth hurts which is why Amazon keeps removing my review. This stuff clogged my extruder so bad I needed to replace it.	-1
the price was right, it only cost me $9. It came in a cardboard box, the plastic bag inside contained the filament and dessicant but the bag was the first pack of filament i've bought where it was not vacuum packed. The filament itself seems to print suspiciously bad in my maker ultimate 3d printer, like the variation of thickness isn't that consistent and mine at least prints like the roll had already soaked in a ton of moisture. after finnagling with it over a weekend it clogged my printer way too many times and I just went back to hatchbox and monoprice PLA rolls for now.	-1
My Monoprice printer clogged twice in three prints.  I theory is that this plastic doesn't remelt very well, so what is left in the extruder after a print won't remelt for the next print.  Anyway, I returned the spool, I think I'm going to stick with Hatchbox.	-1
This stuff is garbage.  First of all, it shipped in a spool that was so cheap and fragile that it was damaged in shipping.  Pieces of the spool had cracked off and subsequently punctured the plastic wrap.  Additionally, this crappy spool does not work well on my Rostock's mount, thumping around as it tries to rotate..  Secondly, the filament itself is garbage.  The parts printed were brittle, fragile, and demonstrated poor layer adhesion.  I would not use this filament again, or anything produced by this company.	-1
Terrible stuff. Kept getting uneven extrusion. Also wasn't roll up well keeps getting crossed on itself and getting stuck. Last but not least the plastic roll itself doesn't smoothly rotate and causes lots of extra unnecessary vibration during printing	-1
This brand had failed me before, way back, and I accidentally ordered another. No difference. Size is consistent thruout but layer adhesion is crap. Parts look good but ring different when struck when using same gcode as other brands of filament. I won't make that mistake again	-1
Seems to print fine, appears to be genuine ABS.  revising down to 2 stars, the spool is poorly wound and has bound up several times causing prints to fail. It also sticks considerably worse to a 100C glass bed with glue stick vs hatchbox ABS, so the composition may also be suspect.	-1
I purchased this printer from the compnay only a few weeks ago. I have to say it has worked ok, but not for the price level it is at.  The printer is pretty. It fits perfectly on my desk. The fact the filament fits into the receticles on the side is a plus, as it cuts down on the maount of filament spools I have to mount. The print quality is average. I have not tried it at 70 microns yet, but 200 is comparable to all the others I have worked with.  The wifi card inside will not connect to my Comcast Business class router. The company syas it is because the card is a 802.11b card, and my router is an N. Doesn't make much sense since I confirmed my router is a b/g/n router, but none the less they said only to use the AD HOC feature, which is a fail on their part.  The filament is incredibly expensive. I ordered some this week. I loaded it Thursday afternoon and started a print (Frankenstein light switch plate). With a normal filament spool I get from a 3rd party, I can do about 20 per spool. But here, I was only able to get 6 prints done before it was reporting that the spool was out of filament. That translates to about $10 of filament per print, which is insane. But you have no other options. The filament has to be in the proprietary holder and attached.  This printer is a good printer for someone looking for an easy to use printer that they are going to use sparingly, that is if you don't mind the price tag. There are other printers at the same price range that accept 3rd party filament and do as good a print job as this. I would avoid this printer if you are looking for something on the "prosumer" level and doing a small business from it.	-1
Our experience has not been good. a number of parts has failed. You can not buy parts for these printers. My son needs parts and it is just setting here due not able to get parts. He needs LCD+Ribbon+Cable and new belt and a new head. the door has broke also. He also needs new wiring too. He had this printer  only a year old. To me how can they sell these printers without sell parts one needs for repairs. We have looked everywhere for parts. If anyone know where one can get parts email me at laura.merc@verizon.net. He just told me that his printer is XYZprinting da Vinci 2.0A Duo 3D Printer, Blue ...	-1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever.	-1
Update #5 After trying get support from XYZprinting, they refused to honor my warranty.  At this point, the printer is paper-weight. The hardware is decent so I've decided to swap the control board with Arudino & Ramp 4.1.  Wish I've gone with another printer. But will have to make lemonade with with lemon I guess.  If you intend on getting Da Vinci, get the cheaper 1.0A and NOT this 2.0A.  Update #4: After nearly a 9 months of usage, left extruder stopped, then filament gear stopped working. It's become an expensive paper weight in office.  Their XYZprinting support is terrible.  Regret in this purchase.  Update #3: Found this CALIBRATION PROCEDURE works best with less calibrations need between prints: Start a demo print. As soon as it warms up and begins to print, watch  extruder head moves over the side print bed and begins the purge line. TURN OFF power before begins purge line.  With printer off; move the extruder head carefully over print bed by hand. Grab towards the top where the filament feeds in to avoid the hot extruder head. Move extruder head back left corner. Lay piece of  paper on the bed and slide it under the nozzle. Once the paper is under the nozzle adjust the bed height so you can just feel the paper being grabbed by the nozzle as you slide the paper around. Repeat on all four corners.  Once you are satisfied, move extruder head by hand back to home position (back right corner over the white drip pan).  Turn the power on, go Utilities and select "Home all axis".  Update #2: I had to remove the SD card due to "0040" lower memory.  DaVinci support said to re-seat the SD card.  This was not easy to do (had to unscrew circuit board in back panel); but in the process discovered a Class-4, 4Gig SD card.  I replaced this with a Class-10, 8Gig SD card. So far the 0040 error has disappeared.  Update #1: It's important to CALIBRATE printer bed before attempting to print; or it will fail. The instruction says the printer was "Factory Calibrated" but the bed is still off.  You need to calibrate close(but not exact) to X,Y,Z axis of: 100,100,100.  After EACH print select "Clean Nozzle" and brush off excess filament on the metal extruder. If you don't do this; the tiny piece of melted filaments from last print will mix with your new print: resulting in fail. Also, if printing something w/ lots of details or arches; select "support" and "raft" in Advance print option on XYZprint software.  Orientation of item is also important for successful print. Have sharp razor to pry the model after it's finished; the plastic spatula provided is worthless!  For comparison; a friend who has DaVinci 1.0 said the print quality on 2.0 is better.  This printer unlike alot of other 3D printer comes with a door; what this means the smell of ABS melting and noise from printing is kept low. I can't help but stare at the thing printing for first few minutes; it's almost like baking watching anxiously for your creation to "rise" of of nothing.  Finally, I found tinkcad and meshmixer very helpful for modifying and creating 3D model for novice.  My 7yr old was using tinkercad to create army tank with squares and cylinder.  My first package was lost in during shipping. Amazon sent another next-day only after I sent complaint. Now for product review.  The manual says not to calibrate since it's factory-calibrated; but mine would not print and "Filament Jam" error until I had to calibrate it several times and had to remove and re-insert the filament.  After that it printed the demo figure fine. So far; I am impressed with printer in its look and print detail.  Only cons: use of proprietary filament cartridge, and XYZ software.	-1
I bought 14 of these for production of parts for my company and I regret the day I made the decision.  Expect to replace wiring harnesses and motors and main boards weekly.  These machines do not hold up to normal use let alone high volume production.  When they work they work well but when I own 14 of them and they are all breaking daily then there is a problem.  Don't expect to get ahold of anyone at the 800 number they never answer.  When you email them expect broken English responses where they don't understand simple English and it takes a week to get the problem worded in a way they understand.  THEN THEY TELL YOU TO SHIP THEN BACK AT YOUR EXPENSE FOR REPAIR!!  These things weigh a lot so expect to pay $75 plus to ship to California and hope it doesn't get damaged in transit to them because they WILL NOT REPAIR IT!!  Also do not use their filament it's terrible.  If you dare to buy one of these cheaply built machines buy a cartridge reset offline.  What they charge is highway robbery.  You can buy hatchbox filament for $22 for a 2 pound roll versus $28 for a one pound roll.  The reason the machines are so cheap was they figured they would get you to buy the product and rape us all on filament.  I also own flash forge machines and would recommend if you want one that never breaks get one or else expect to be waiting for emails from xyzprinting for a week or longer and expect each time it breaks down to be offline a solid 2 weeks each time.  I submitted an issue yesterday again and still no response.  It took them 24 hours to copy and paste what I emailed them to their online system that has code written by a child who does not understand how to design a intuitive user friendly website.	-1
This printer is a basic printer. It started right up with minimal fuss and only 1 minor adjustment that did not involve having to contact customer service. The heads were leveled correctly (something I've never seen on makerbot, flashforge or Wanhao and I have all 3) out of the box and all three test prints printed fine. The software is the weak link - its cumbersome and difficult compared to others but still quite serviceable and gets the job done better than I expected at this price point. I also have their AIO with scanner - its a useless paperweight and this is a MUCH better unit. Overall I was pleasantly surprised given my experience with the AIO and an early model 1.0. Its not going to compete with models twice the price but at 600 and change it is one of the best in in its price range I've found.  Update one week later - Worked fine the first few days, lots of good prints. Sadly the software seems completely unstable. Saying the unit is inconsistent would be kind. The electronics are definitely sub par. Connections, even basic power up is intermittent after less than 30hrs printing. Its a shame - it would be a nice unit and worth the extra added price if they improved quality control.	-1
Horrible smell.  Smells toxic.  Never had a PLA smell so bad.	-1
The material itself was fine in my case. I bought 2 spools, one black and one white. The problem I had with it is that it tangled up every few turns, basically making it useless, unless I'm going to babysit my printer for the entire print. The filament would tangle up so bad as it was trying to extrude it would lift the x carriage. Not only does this cause the print to fail, but more importantly it's hard on the printer. I burned out my extruder stepper because I left the printer alone. I should have known better, seeing as how it was tangling on all of my other prints. It's really too bad, because I liked the material itself. I had consistent diameter on both rolls and when I sat through a print, I had good looking parts.	-1
The smell is awful. Stinks like burnt plastic and not he sweet smell I usually associate with PLA. The diameter of my rol;l is averaging around 1.68 mm and is inconsistent, which makes it very difficult to use. I will not be buying again.	-1
These are quite simply poorly made bottles. These bottles leak onto your hand when you squeeze the lever. This is not good if you are using  cleaning products at the time. Also, this makes a mess on the floor.  My husband decided to take one of the spray units apart to see what was wrong. It turns out that the nylon plunger and the barrel don't make a good seal. The nylon has a very uneven edge that lets liquids get by.  You can smooth the working edge of the plunger with an emery board or sandpaper if you are so inclined. It is likely that you will break the lever in the process, so why bother?  I have to chalk this one up to experience and move on. If you do buy these bottles and yours leak too.....you could give these as presents to people you don't like - if you run out of other ideas. Please don't give them to me.	-1
Leaks, must be upright, leaks.  People on here are nuts or we received different products.   These leak both at the nozzle and the ring connection to the bottle.  They must be 90 degrees to the surface to even work.  They should pay me for foisting this travesty.	-1

Is not calibrated with the solution and varies the measurement every time!!	-1
Totally inaccurate and could not be calibrated.  This device uses a single potentiometer or calibrate the device, which means it will only be accurate at one point along the 1-14 pH range.  The use of the term High Accuracy is highly inaccurate.  The accuracy is barely 0.8 units, and only if calibrated immediately prior to use.  Mine worked poorly for about five days, and then the Devil took control of it.  When I turned it on, it displayed 666 (see picture), and after a few seconds, displayed a very low pH value nowhere close to that of the solution being measured.  I worked with it for nearly an hour trying to get it to recover, but 666 kept showing up.  There is no 666 in the instructions, so I assume my meter was possessed.  I returned it the next day.	-1
This did not work for me. When I received the item it would not settle on any number, it kept jumping from 1 to ridiculously high numbers that can't possible be accurate. And it never settled into any number high or otherwise. When I pulled it back out of the water, it was still jumping all over the place instead of returning a stable value.  I did contact amazon about the issue and they graciously gave me a refund for the item. Instead I am going with a better but more expensive model/brand.  Update: The company did contact me and offer a refund or replacement. As Amazon had already taken care of me it was unfortunately too late. Since the product did not function for me I have left my original review but the company has earned +1 star for their effort in trying to rectify the situation.	-1
First of all, know this; I always use new batteries when ordering anything that requires them, usually at the same time I place an order, but not necessarily from the same company;  This one failed miserably; I put this one in storage when I received them about 2-months ago but when it came time to put it to good use,the display died shortly after power-up. It did work for a few minutes, but quickly went blank.  Suspecting a display issue, I moved the connection from a known good set-up to the bad display to see if the problem would follow it, and as suspected, it did. Just to verify the connector and it's associated wiring, I moved the sensor cable to a known good display, the combination was successful.  The item I have is now known to be defective but since I already missed Amazon's 30-day return window, it is now hoped this one gets read by the seller for whatever resolutions they may have.  Would I buy another one?, maybe, maybe not; I bought two of them in the past and they still work OK; I suppose it would depend on what happens here; the working ones I have in service seem a bit sensitive to static, but they work none-the-less... so, here's hoping to hear from them.	-1
Only works with universal type motors.	-1
I'm re-writing my initial 1 star review after working with this device further.  I think this works as expected as long as wattage is below 500-600W.  The problem with it is it is rated at 2000W.  Maybe it would do better if the heat sink were optimally cooled, but I can only apply some fan cooling to it in my application.  Once it gets hot, it starts acting erratically and then clamps to full power and won't change the settings in response to potentiometer input; i.e., you turn the potentiometer all the way back, and it is still at full line power.  So I guess I'd give it 2 stars or maybe 3 since it is not defective, but its power capability is definitely over-rated, in my experience, without optimum cooling.  I don't know what it would be with optimum cooling, but I'm thinking less than 2000W.  I will be using the PWM on Amazon that sells for around $16.66 and is rated for 4000W.  That one worked well for me previously in a similar application with a standard level of fan cooling.	-1
really? look it is missing a tooth it failed as expected - as the weld was not good.  No good!	-1
adhesive isn't  better than ordinary.  maybe i got an old one, but is even less sticky than another roll of ordinary duct tape i have.	-1
The adhesive came off the tape over night.  I taped together two pieces of Coroplast. There was some tension on the tape which is what I needed to hold together.  I came back in the morning and the whole thing had come apart.  The adhesive stayed on one of the Coroplast parts but not to the tape's own backing.  The tape itself stayed on the other piece of Coroplast.  I would have expected perhaps the tape to not hold to the Coroplast if the tension was too much,  but I did not expect the adhesive to let go of the tape backing..  Time for Gorilla tape.	-1
received mine with rust on it. may have been used.  did not seem to be well made. returned it.	-1
It changes all by itself from inches to MM and does this quite often.  Also when you measure something with it then close it, it should go back to zero, but most of the time it doesn't, so you're never quite sure what measurement you really have.	-1
Poor shrink ratio. I have used other shrink tubing in the past that shrunk down quite a bit. This tubing took a lot more heat to activate than other tubing I've used in the past. It got the job done but the results were not up to par compared to all other shrink tubing I've used in the past. Would not use again.	-1
Garbage.  Barely shrinks enough when hit with a heat gun, and actually shrinks a bit if you hold it in your hand too long.  Crappy stuff, barely usable, total waste of money.  Avoid!	-1
I wish they would have listed these as being way too short to do anything useful with.	-1
They shrink when heated other than that they are very cheap. I used them but have no trust in them so I wrapped with electrical tape.	-1
Go to harbor Grosvenor and but there shrink tubes. These are about an inch long and are package in small tiny pouches. Looks decent from the picture. But when I opened it to see scary what I bought. I was going to return it. But was in a need for this for a radio repair job. So I kept them.  Deffintly look elsewhere. Harbor friegth stores have them in spools on sale eBay now and then waaay cheaper and much more to your liking. Severely disappointing.	-1
Photo is misleading, these are JUNK the sizes are so small its not of any real use. Stay Away from these. Waste of money	-1
not  at all packaged like in the photo. I expected a plastic case  , no its a bag  that can get all mixed up	-1
Very powerful toothbrush!  With the softest toothbrushes available, it made my teeth hurt for the rest of the day after the first use.  When I tried a "barely touch" method (actually, didn't even feel like I was touching my teeth) there was no pain, and my teeth came out feeling like I just got them cleaned at the dentist's office.  However, after a couple of months of use I no longer use this toothbrush.  For me there are two problems: 1.  I just barley feel the toothbrush on my teeth and yet this product causes my teeth to hurt for days afterwards, now.  2.  I can't seem to get the toothbrush at the back of my bottom teeth at the right angle to clean them well.  When I tilt the tip of the brush downward the brush works, but the toothbrush handle is too long and it hits my upper mouth.  This strain and mouth contortions causes all the fluid to fall out of my mouth!  Sounds funny I know, and I suppose it is if you were looking at me.  That's ok, but the bottom line is that it discourages me from using this tooth brush.  I clean my teeth very well, normally.  But because of the above problems I started skipping the back of my bottom teeth and this is not good!  Conclusion: This toothbrush does a great job on cleaning the teeth where it works smoothly, but the brush and handle on it are just too long to give individual teeth the thorough attention I like to give them.  I am going back to the round brush electric toothbrush by Oral B.  And forget the powerful "sonic" type system.  In my opinion, the tarter control electric toothbrush works just as well.  I just wish Oral B had softer toothbrushes, even their softest are not soft enough for me.	-1
I can't even say two stars because I am 1/3 of the way through this spool and, everywhere between 190c and 235c, this PLA has terrible issues with delamination at the base with my hotbed at 70c.	-1
Sticks after a few uses.	-1
worst pan I have ever used, Eggs stuck to the pan like Glue	-1
Warped after first week of use.  We have an electric/glass stovetop and didn't realize that the heat would be too much.  All other pans have done fine on it.	-1
I can't see this pan lasting as long as the one I bought a year and a half ago.  The metal is much thinner, the coating appears thinner and the skillet won't sit level on my gas range because it is handle heavy.  T-fal used to be my "go-to" skillets.  The 8 inch one  gets used 2-3x a day.  I wish I wouldn't have tossed my old black one out so I could show you the difference.  The new one is cheap feeling and for a few more dollars, I should have bought a better brand, but didn't realize how low quality these had become.  Just glad I didn't buy the matching larger sizes. I do like the color and the cool grip handle or I wouldn't give this any stars.  Sorry..	-1
junk, flimsy metal frame, motor had big problems right out of the box, wouldnt spin without help, then only turned very slow. get what ya pay for i guess.	-1
It works... I have it for my chicken coop kind of flimsy and the motor seems to speed up and down on its own but let's see how long it lasts as of now I'm satisfied  ***UPDATE*** It died after 6 months.... I bought another one that one was DOA on arrival.	-1
good air flow and low power usage for a 6 inch fan but the cord is only about 14 inches long if that. I was hoping for it to be at least 3 feet long. over all ide buy again if needed i was just dissapointed at the short cord and the fan is really not that noisy but you have to expect some type of noise for 246 cfm  UPDATE 4-2-16; DO NOT use this in a space that is going to be above 130 Degrees it will fail. Caused a catastrophic event with my generator set up. After 30 hours run time this thing failed and it was all down hill from there. Amazon was nice enough to give my money back on this fan and the rubbermaid cabinet that was destroyed but could not help with with the generator being it was not eligible for Prime. All i can do is hope for the best on the warranty for the generator or im out 750.00	-1
Not bad on specs, the diameter is actually fairly tight, but that's where the positives end. This is not black, at best it is silver, grey, pewter, platinum, white gold ish. I did a photo that i sent to Hatchbox and got no response what so ever. I have added that photo to this review. there "transparent black" is the lower left step pyramid, opaque black top left, opaque white top right, transparent white lower right. decide for yourself if you consider this (the lower left) transparent black. The color problem is a shame actually, because i kind of like it as a silver/pewter,.. but what i wanted was a transparent black, and when i think transparent black what I am thinking is dark tinted car windows, this is nowhere near that. keeping it only because its probably the closest to a real silver iv ever printed with. Oh and the half spools at nearly normal full spool pricing is just ridiculous, not doing that again, ever..	-1
Unlike the other Hatchbox filaments, this one had large impurities in it.  Buried down in the spool were chunks of black burnt nasty stuff that messed up my print.  See photo.	-1
Great color. However, great spool design. It's slightly larger than the filament so when it unwinds it doesn't tangle and has holes to rethread the ends.  That's about it.  It jams constantly, haven't had 1 out of 4 jobs work.  It's brittle too. Should have not bought the cheapest product.	-1
Spooled horribly.  Absolute disaster to use.	-1
I received a 1 lb spool, not a 1 kg spool.  Basically half the roll which makes it not worth it.  i have emailed the seller and hope to hear back.  If I do I will change the review.  The one starts due to receiving the wrong item size.  The spool arrived as all hatchbox does sealed with desiccant in a hatchbox box.	-1
Inconsistent width of the filament has jammed my printer 4x now, and im not even halfway through the spool	-1
This isn't terrible filament, but it's the worst I've found of the five spools I've purchased so far. My biggest complaint is that it's not really red. It could look red under the right light, but I've just started describing the color to people as orange.  Please see the attached picture for an example of two things printed with this filament, it makes the color really clear.	-1
I purchased this to go with a 3D pen as a gift.  The filament worked well in the 3D pen (the pen did break after a few uses).  I did think that the plastic was a bit pricey AND the glow in the dark feature never seemed to work.  We tried repeatedly to get it to glow - which never did happen.	-1
I saw the mixed reviews on the brightness of the glow effect and was very disappointed at my results with this filament.  I also have the Solutech glow in the dark filament and the effect is MUCH brighter.  Please note that in the attached image, the Hatchbox print is on the right and the Solutech print is on the left.	-1
Tried multiple times to use this filament but it broke both parts I tried to print. It bubbled and split the parts or it curled on its own. Will not buy again. Comparing this to 3D Solutech this is worse. Even the price is more for junk.	-1
Wrong color.  Everything about this filament is classic Hatchbox great.  Except, as someone else mentioned - it's not red, it's orange!  And I bought it for valentines jewelry.  Oh well.	-1
I have bought 6 spools of Hatchbox PLA so far, and they have all been reasonably good filaments, however this ABS is garbage.  I have managed to get a single print of about 150g with this stuff, but have so far cleared my bowden tube and my hot end 5 times because this garbage keeps snapping.  I have had to take apart my hotend to clean this garbage out that I am going to need to replace the heatbrake as it is now bending	-1
very hard to print in and prints look ok i guess sometimes	-1
Problematic prints with this material.  Typically Hatchbox works really well.  This batch has constantly broken off at the extruder, it's very brittle.  Color is really nice, but print quality suffers.  Tolerance is advertised at +/- 0.03,  the spool says +/- 0.05,  actual seemed to range from 1.65 to 1.78	-1
I like hatchbox.  Its always been the best I've found. But my issues are like the others. There is a bunch of popping and sputtering going on. Plus I ordered silver and they sent me black. I will order more hatchbox, but not from this company.	-1
I'm printing with .5mm nozzle, which is not prone to clogging. I had two prints ruined by lost extrusion. Both times pulling the filament out and starting a new print resolved the issue. But in both cases the filament I pulled out was so brittle I could not reinsert it without breaking. Different parts of the roll seem to have normal pliable ABS-like filament. On the finished part, I see streaks of missed extrusion which comes back after 2-3cm of stringy uneven line. I ended up printing with 245C and 30mm/s - any faster or cooler, I get clogs or perimeter separation because of missed extrusion. Boy, I can print PETG at 230C and 50 mm/s, so this is definitely no good for ABS.	-1
I am new to Hatchbox ABS filaments. One thing that I have found is the silver consistently clogs the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print just fine for a few minutes and then it clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore thereby ruining the print. A lot of reviews have said that this filament is particularly brittle when compared to the others. I've had it break when unwinding  some to load into the extruder head. This brittleness seems to compound the problem with the filament extruding properly so it doesn't clog. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return date had passed  so I have a roll that is only missing about 3 feet that is worthless.  I find it very hard to purchase any HATCHBOX product in the future because of such poor quality	-1
I was very very disappointed with this Filament it warps badly even with the slowest and optimized printing configuration I really tried for 3 days to get the best out of it and still warps bad. I have no idea why would anyone give it 5 stars. Sadly I bought 2 spools one by mistake now I have to waste them as much as I could and perfect the printing to best I can	-1
do not buy this color unless you are ready for headaches. Hatchbox usually makes great filament and "fire sale merchant" was very helpful (I only recently tried using it, a few days after the return window and when I let them know it was bad they sent a new roll). The new roll is has better adhesion and less warping, but is simply unusable. the difference between two rolls says that there is some variability, so maybe some people get lucky, but even under the best conditions (filament stored in a dessicant box, well-tuned printer in an enclosure) you'll have issues.	-1
Haven't been able to get a single print to finish with this filament. It works fine for the first 15-20 minutes and then just jams in the extruder. It's easy to remove, but if I can't get any prints done, it's basically worthless.	-1
I haven't had trouble with the majority of Hatchbox ABS filaments that I've used except for one other specialized version. The silver consistently clogs the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print just fine for a few minutes and then it clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore thereby ruining the print. As some have pointed out this filament is particularly brittle when compared to the others. I've had it break several times when unwinding it some to load into the extruder head. This brittleness seems to compound the problem with the filament extruding properly so it doesn't clog. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return date had passed and so I cannot return the unused filament.	-1
Maybe I failed to read the product description.  While I have not measured the length of time this tape glows, it is direct correlation to the last light received by the tape.  I wanted a product that would take in daylight and glo throughout the night.  Not this.  Shine a flashlight on it and it will glow, but not for hours.  So I suppose this tape would be beneficial where prolonged luminescence is not required, a short time frame of illumination needed.	-1
does not glow very long	-1
This product seemed like it might be helpful marking stairs etc. but it doesn't glow all that much right out of the roll. Also, I'm NOT that convinced on the durability of this tape.	-1
I've purchased this product before and I recall it being pretty average -- not great, not bad. This time I'm not particularly pleased with the quality of the paste. It's too thick. It's too dry. It feels like old spoiled paste.  1) It's not shipped with a cold pack. Even when manufacturers claim their paste doesn't need refrigeration, decent manufacturers often ship with a cold pack. As no care was made in shipping this paste, I have to wonder how much care was made in storing it.  2) The needle that it comes with is relatively large, too large for any reasonable use on the projects I'm working on. I do have a bulk stash of smaller needles that I've previously used with other pastes (mainly zephpaste) with no difficulty. My smallest needle size wouldn't work with this paste at all. My other needle sizes required herculean effort.  3) It just didn't melt very uniformly and didn't flow "right". It's hard to describe, but when you've done this a few times you know when it's working right and when it's not, and this time it just wasn't working right. I don't have confidence in the work I did with this product. I had to spend a lot of time retouching under the microscope and I still don't have confidence.  This product just didn't work out very well for me this time. I wish I'd have spent the extra money to buy better quality. Maybe I just got a bad batch as other reviewers seem to give it raving reviews.	-1
Cheaply Made, not tinned coated copper, many defect terminals in the bag. No information on where they're manufactured. I contacted the Absolute USA Inc. and received no response.	-1
These test strips are totally inappropriate for testing body pH. You need test trips that test between  five and 9 not between zero and 14. This will only give the roughest idea.	-1
All of the translucent Solutech PLA filament colors that I have tried (Blue, Red, Clear) were brittle. They also contained an excessive number of air bubbles. On prints with lots of retractions in a small area (aka: prints with multiple small islands), the extruder drive gear frequently grinds through the filament. This leads to failed prints. This sucks. It is possible to down-grade retraction settings and prevent this. However, diminished retraction settings lead to stringing. Therefore, this filament leaves me stuck between a rock (stringing) and a hard place (grinding). It's not worth the trouble. That said, Solutech opaque colors seem to be OK. Colors are vibrant, but filament diameter variation is frequently greater than the stated +/- .03.	-1
Prints ok, but expensive.	-1
This is the second Solutch filament we've used and it will certainly be the last. Horrible to work with. My advice, if you use this brand filament and begin to have printing issues, switch filament brand before spending hours troubleshooting machine	-1

Sorry, but wish I could share the same 5 star enthusiasm as others, but this filament has been nothing but a headache. It has blobs, it's stringy, and let's just call it cloudy translucent, not clear.  I recently purchased  5 rolls of Tianse and 2 rolls of AIO Robotics. Both brands worked first time right out of the box, and continue to perform flawlessly without spending my life trying to dial in workable settings.	-1
I Have had nothing but trouble with this roll. I should have returned it after the first problem.  The roll was wound up incorrectly constantly stopping prints and getting Tangled Up. Also noticed some color differences  throughout the roll.	-1
Nothing but a headache.  I tried every temperature from 185 to 235 with little to no difference in results.  Buyer beware.	-1
one star !!!! no good	-1
Solutech comes in middle to upper range in print quality but is last and unusable due to the way the filament and the narrow spools like to fight each other, the narrow spool kicks loops off to the side before the extruder needs them due to the brittle stiff filament.  Just had to disassemble entire hotend and bowden setup from this clear yet again screwing up a simple print.  kicked loops out to side onto spool holder, cinched up and stopped spool feeding, ground filament in extruder, stopped extruding and air printed, hotend clogged from this brittle clear filament seizing above the melt zone.  For like the 10th time, having used less than 5% of the spool.  Most filament is a little 'lively' and wants to uncoil, but this stuff is like satans filament, jumps off the spool while printing and then stops everything working correctly.  Probably going to try and transfer the nearly full spool of filament to a better wider spool so it might get a print off but never buying Solutech again.  Sort of angry at fighting this stuff for several days of failed prints when other filaments work so much better for me.  The brittleness and stiffness and coil tightness, combined with narrow spools, make this stuff a nightmare for me.  Surfaces look great but can't get the darn stuff to feed well and when it seizes up it clogs the hotend sooooo bad.	-1
The worst feeding PLA I have EVER SEEN, constant tangles, contest ruined prints, I HATE THIS PLA, the other 3 brands and colors I have feed off the roll fine, this one has overlapping issues, were you can actually pick my whole printer up by the spool end and it won't unroll. If I could give it negative stars I WOULD!  When it feeds its a good print, but you have to baby sit this roll like a 1 year old with a knife...  I WILL NEVER EVER BUY THIS AGAIN.	-1
I love 3D solutech, but the real black is unusable!  I have a diamond full color nozzle and I cannot go over 210 degrees because the other colors only need 190-195 and they would run out like water if I tried to print that high.  Ill continue to use this brand, but will never buy real black from them again.  Ive wasted half the roll and all my prints ended up in the trash.	-1
After testing Zyltech, Hatchbox, AIO, and CCTREE filament, 3d Solutech offers a great filament for a decent price. My only gripe is the red pla they offer. Its not quiet red and more of a light red. This is very disappointing. If you don't mind having a light red for your prints, then this pla is for you.	-1
I like the color but the 2 rolls I tried were garbage. It's like the filament is being twisted as it is rolled onto the spool because the issue I'm having is that  the filament is twisting as it is pulled by the extruder motor causing the gear to make a clicking noise as it pulls the filament, and in turn causing gaps in my prints. This is also causing print to be brittle. I have oriented the spool in many different positions (mounted on top of printer, spool on table next to printer, ect) Some parts of a print will look smooth while other parts look bad. My bed is leveled,  I have every upgrade on my printer there is I have been 3D printing for close to 2 year and I have never had an issue like this with any other filaments I have tried. I have not tried any other colors from them but if it is anything like this green I got I definitely will not be purchasing this brand again.	-1
I have had terrible luck with this filament.  It has jammed up three separate printers, tends to produce prints with tears/lines in them, and seems overly brittle.  I can't recommend this at all, and am sad to have bought two rolls of the stuff.  Going back to the USA Filament when it becomes available and the Hatchbox stuff which has been good enough.	-1
Full of bubbles, inconsistencies, and problems. I don't recommend this or and 3D Solutech	-1
The filament itself prints very well however towards the middle of the roll the diameter was anywhere from 1.8mm to 1.6m causing issues in the final print. I will not be buying their filament again as I ended up wasting about 1/5th of the roll because I had to re-print the parts I was printing with it.	-1
straight out of the bag and have had nothing but water bubbles in prints ever since.  thinking it was something else until i looked at the filiment still in the head...BUBBLES!!! bubbles everyplace...	-1
Lost of first's with this filament. First time ever experiencing first layer adhesion problems, first time ever having a filament that constantly oozes out of the nozzle, first ever nozzle clog. Also this filament uses yet again a different size center hole, I had to make my own rolller adapter for it, which didn't go well because I can't get this filament to stick to anything!  After a successful first layer it seems to work OK but it still leaves stringy things between the layers of the print. Why the filament quality issues?  I'm in need of the quality of filament that came with my Anet A8.	-1
The filament spool is wound terribly to the point of unusable(constant tangles causing failed prints .  I won't buy from them again.	-1
i bought 2 spool black and white and tried both of them and not even 1 succesfull print. keep jamming my extruder or cloging the nozzle.. i bought bad fillaments but this one is worse	-1
I'm shocked, because normally this is a great product and consistent. The spool I received has been problematic. After a good drying, it is stringy and jams. One nozzle jam, at 220C and many extruder jams, leaving my hot end empty. Many inconsistent builds with skips. I am very disappointed with a product, I use to depend on.	-1

This filament is out of spec with some areas at 1.9mm and has jammed in two distinct printers. In both cases it was necessary to bring the printer up to 225 degrees to clear the jam. Worse yet, this vendor is playing the Amazon ratings game by paying for good reviews with a free roll of filament.	-1
i bought 2 spool black and white and tried both of them and not even 1 succesfull print. keep jamming my extruder or cloging the nozzle.. i bought bad fillaments but this one is worse	-1
My first print with this filament was great.  The next print failed because several of the layers were under-extruded and the part split at those points.  I got out my micrometer and the diameter was all over the map -- from 1.71 mm to 1.97 mm on random samples. I can't use this stuff.  Looking at the mostly positive reviews, I guess I got a bad roll.	-1
Even after putting it away in dry storage for months it still prints gapped, airy, brittle prints! This stuff is GARBAGE!	-1
The color seems more like a blue/ black ink. 3D Solutions on the left and 3DMars on the right. Hatchbox also is a smoother black then the blue tint ink color of 3D solutions. I also had numerous tangle issues where the filament wanted to jump off the spool which i had ran into on low cost filaments. So nothing special about 3D Solutions and i would Ultimately not recommend.	-1

I really like the material.  Prints well when it prints.  However, I am giving it only 2 stars since I am having a terrible time printing with it.  The filament is all tangled on the spool.  This is the first brand and first time I have ever encountered a spool that is tangled on the spool and keeps ruining prints because the spool is messed up.  Very disappointed.  I have tried to fix, but keep finding more tangles.  I have other colors and spools from this manufacturer and haven't had this issue.  Must have got a bad one.  Not sure yet what I will do.  May have to stop using this one.  I can't trust it on a large print if I am not here.  If it wasn't for the messed up spool, then I would probably have given it a 5 stars.	-1
This is the second roll of this that when it gets down to the middle its all tangled up and because of this ruined a 17 hour long print when that I was 15 hours into. The same thing happened to the first roll but it hapoened on a 19 hour print with only 20nminutes to go. Will never buy this companies products again no quakity control. They are lucky i cannot give them a 1 star for each purchase.  Maybe if they spent less money on putting stickers in the box and more towards properly extruding the filament it would be a better product.	-1
Tried this but was very brittle that tells me it has moisture problems.	-1
I use a LOT of PLA, and this is pretty disappointing filament.  I've had more clogs with this spool than I've had in a long time.  If a print was more than a couple of hours, I KNEW it just wouldn't be able to finish.  I suspect that this is not pure PLA, based on the awful smell and weird super-glossy appearance of the (unmelted) plastic.  I've had better luck with some of their other colors, but their black is a definite stay away from.  I ended up throwing this spool out when it was still 2/3 full.  I couldn't even in good consience give it away.	-1
I'm hoping I got a poor QC'd roll as the stuff I got was nothing like the reviews I read. The first 20ft or so was kinked badly which I had to discard. The size tolerance was pretty poor in my opinion varying from 1.63 to 1.86 which I guess is why they don't list a tolerance %.	-1
Prints fine but our spool had a knot in it down near the end of the spool.  Of course it was in the middle of an 18 hour print job and I didn't catch it in time.  Other than the loop knot in the spool, the filament prints well and looks good.  Can't risk another print like this failing.	-1
keeps breaking	-1
No clear description on the correct settings to use this filament. I received this filament with an insert card stating to use nozzle temperature of 230c. That's not a common PLA temperature, and the temperature on the product details is 190-220. Same on the filament website directly at 3d solutech's website. I tried to contact them to clarify, but I got no response. So instead of risking it, I returned it since the description doesn't match the actual product you get.	-1
bubbles...bubbles everywhere...  this is a hit and miss manufacturer.  some rolls are good...while others seem to have been stored at the bottom of a dirty lake.  i feel bad about dumping a bad review, but after the third roll of of this stuff that was freshly opened and within minutes was being used left tiny bubbles of water vapor in my print and in the nozzle.  i hope thing can be improved on your end.	-1
keeps breaking	-1
Prints smoothly, no clogs or stringing (12 hour print@195F on ROBO R1+). The color is bright white. Maybe it depends on the lot. It definitely wasn't a cream color like others have commented. There is a slight amount of gloss.  UPDATE: I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 2. Quality went downhill after the initial successful print. I've tried a variety of settings and temps (195-210F) but the quality is poor. I've experienced several partial clogs and jams with this filament. I've switched back and forth between this filament and Hatchbox to confirm. The attached picture shows the quality difference between Hatchbox (left) and 3D Solutech (right).	-1
First of all it isn't a metal filament, but it does look nice for a gray. That's about it. I've unjammed this 3 times so far and the black from the same company is even worse. I'm also getting inconsistent extrusion, but only from this gray and black. I doubt I'll be buying any more 3D Solutech.	-1
It's a great plastic and prints really well but about 1/4 through the roll mine started breaking due to being rolled up bad. I had to end up baby sitting my printer it kept happening so much i stopped using the roll. It was basically rolled tight and every so often as it was coming off the spool it was under the next layer instead of on top. I've tried  reaching out to solu tech but have yet to hear back. Not sure if I just got a bad spool or if this is common with this brand.	-1
Wasn't a fan of this filament. Heard good things about this brand but the filament was really stringy and had a hard time with layer adhesion. Not sure if it was just the roll I got but I won't be risking another purchase.	-1
Lots of firsts with this filament. The first time ever having first layer adhesion problems, first time ever having a nozzle clog, first time ever seeing the fillament oozing out of the nozzle, especially at warmup.	-1
Are usually only buy 3D Solutech but this has been the worst roll of filament Ive ever used. The quality is good the prints come out fine if you watch and untangle it every 20 minutes. Its kind a like the filament is super twisted and all it wants to do is Come off the roll or get tangled up.	-1
I have issue with material quality. When printed with  a model with same layer heights. Material extrusion is not consistent leaving gaps and holes because of material quality. Printing same model with different material yield better result. Buy with caution.	-1
I will not buy again.  I usually buy Hatchbox or Inland but they did not have Chocolate. Not because  Hatchbox or Inland is great but because most formulas print at same temp and speed with no problems no matter the color. This filament does not stick to my plastic build plate.  Maybe it sticks to something else but not my build plate. I had to go from normal 200C to 230C to even have a chance and it still separated (lifted).	-1
So far I've tried filament from 3 separate companies, and this has been the only one of the 3 I had problems with.  I bought the Chocolate Brown and the silver, both were wrapped so poorly that it failed prints simply because the filament was caught in the spool and couldn't feed.  But that's not the only problem I had.  I had actually paid someone to create a model for me and I had them do two reworks because the print would fail between 1/3 and 2/3 through - it would start getting stringy and trash the entire print.  I never had this problem before with this printer but I tried everything - cleaning it out, re-leveling it twice, etc.  After their 2nd rework he said there's nothing wrong with the model and suggested that I check my printer, I switched filaments to a Hatchbox spool.  It printed perfectly right out of the gate.  I apologized to the designer, tipped him for his trouble and vowed never to buy filament from this company again.	-1
I have been a fan of 3D Solutech's filament after switching from Hatchbox. Usually their other primary colors print out really well (except their red, its too light in my opinion). As quality is concern, I had trouble printing with thier Silver Metal color. Even though the packaged was sealed, the pla was still very brittle. It keep on breaking during my prints. I contacted the company but still awaiting a response.	-1
This filament has been driving me nuts. I've been attempting some 10 hour prints after doing some 10+ hour prints successfully with no issues with 3D Solutech's black and white PLA filament. I've had to restart three 10 hour prints after the filament has snagged; it turns out that this filament is not completely 1.75mm through out it's whole length and that's been the issue for the filament. I'll be unwinding the whole spool and checking the diameter for consistency as it definitely has spots that are much larger than 1.75mm and has repeatedly clogged my printer. I like the color, but what use is the spool if I cannot use it for the prints for which I purchased it.	-1
This filament has been most PROBLEMATIC of all my spools.  There's constant breakage, and expansion that causes jams. I have 3 other 3D printers with other brand filaments that does not have this problem.  Do not buy this filament.	-1
Jammed my printer more than 10 times. Mp maker select, not that the filament is horrible, its just too slippery for the extruder gear to grip too when theres alot of retraction.	-1
The printing quality was fine until I hit a snag. The roll was completely useless because of the way they rolled the spool on this one. Knocked off a few stars because of that. I had to throw away the rest of the roll because of the mess it was in.	-1
Looks after first few meters it is crap. Missing lines, doesn't melt evenly. Hatchbox works fine at same settings.	-1
I love the other filaments that they sell but this one was rolled incorrectly so it keeps stopping my printer from printing my jobs	-1

This filament is potentially out of spect by a whopping .2mm;  you are going to get jams here Pictured is a 1.75mm measured at 1.95mm!  For sure a filament this out of spec is going to jam.  This same roll of filament jammed two different printers!	-1
I love the color and printing appearance with the the Solutech real grey, but the spooling is a complete mess.  The spool is narrow so the filament is spooled almost to the edge, on top of that it looks like its a loose spool so as soon as I loaded it, it started coming off of the spool sideways getting tangled.	-1
iv got though a roll and a half and i just cant seem to get good results... the color is semi inconsistent and on both rolls it goes all the way to 1.9mm so not very true to 1.75mm. one roll tangled rather badly but the other was fine so it must have been a bad batch.	-1
No clear description on the correct settings to use this filament. I received this filament with an insert card stating to use nozzle temperature of 230c.

I have a version of this with only 4 protoboards on it rather than 6, but it is otherwise identical. Molded in is "Bread Board" across the top, and "SYB-118" at the bottom.  Terrible connections. I just tried to wire up three identical Joule Thief circuits on it. I tested each one as I wired it in. By the time I got to the third and applied power again, only the 2nd circuit worked. But even then, only after much wiggling of wires and checking of connections.  I stuck wires in many of the holes and measured the resistance, I found it would change drastically from an ohm to completely open just by slightly moving the wires. Completely useless.  The power connections at the top are horrible. They are those spring connectors you find on the back of cheap speakers. Not reliable with 22 gauge wire.  I pulled out my Radio Shack mini protoboard from 1980, blew the dust out, and it works. Why does a 36 year old protoboard outperform a brand new set of protoboards?	-1
Absolute garbage.  I had previously purchased a black and a white Hatchbox and loved them.  Hatchbox is naturally softer ABS (be aware of this before buying) which was perfectly fine for me but this one was total junk.  I am not sure if Hatchbox is now making lesser quality ABS or the dye did something to it.  I tried extruding from 190c all the way to 245c (J-Head max) and it clogged and did other nasty things.	-1
This is NOT PURPLE.  Some people call it 'pink', its not pink either.  Calling it pink is about as bad as calling it purple.  Although, if you add pink to purple, you might get this color.  It's pretty bad.  I have become a fan of Hatchbox. I've had good results with all of their filaments, and generally their colors are very accurate, but this one is WAY off.  I feel like I got scammed for $20+.  Having built up trust in Hatchbox I didn't bother to read the reviews, which I am now regretting.  If you need "PURPLE", don't buy this...	-1
I have been using HATCHBOX exclusively ever since I got a 3D printer but lately I have been encountering an issue on several of their filament spools. After about half of the spool has been used, there is sometimes a point where the leading filament is looped under the rest of the spool creating a tangle. This has caused failed prints because the filament is no longer feeding through the extruder. This is especially frustrating when I set up a print before I head into work and come home to find the print head moving around in the air because it stopped feeding quite some time ago. This has also created jams in the extruder and it wastes my time having to clear a jam.  However, when it doesn't have this problem, I am real happy with the results. I have given away prints as gifts and made things which I use day to day.  *This review left on HATCHBOX spools where I encountered this issue.	-1
size not to spec	-1
At the price of $21.98 when I bought this (January 2015) it was a good deal. However at the current price $22.99.  2018, January Update: When you get down to the inside winds of this filament it is wound so tight in a small circle that it wants to break just sitting on the spool. The spool should really have a bigger center hole to avoid this issue. Also I have noticed Hatchbox filament tends to get very brittle like dry spaghetti I have had a third of a roll shatter in to little pieces due to the brittleness and the too-tight winding.	-1
Seems to be absorbing moisture too quickly. Cant get good first layers due to bubbles & low adhesion.  Price is too variable to be a reliable filament	-1
I have reviewed hatchbox before as 5 stars as it is perfect, but until now I have only ordered black and white.  The problem with the orange is that it is spooled onto a different spool than their other filaments.  This different spool is approx 2.25 inches in diameter whereas the black and white spools have a diameter of 3 inches.  This would probably be ok on their black or white filaments as they are more flexible, but the orange is not.  Even right out of the sealed bag with desiccant I noticed that the filament was very brittle.  I printed 3 orange rings for bb8 but the last 10% of the spool is unusable due to being tightly wound and breaking.  I have one more spool of orange for the rest of my orange rings, after that i will no longer order colors from hatchbox, only black and white.  If hatchbox starts using these spools on all of their filament I will stop using them altogether.  My experience: I have printed at least 30 rolls of hatchbox filament.	-1
The color is trash! Looks nothing like whats in the pitcure	-1
1st Purchase - Was fairly brittle. End of roll was almost useless as it kept breaking before it would even get off the roll.  2nd Purchase - Tried it again.. EXACT same experience. End of roll was unusable. We're buying a kilo not 2/3rds a kilo. Will contact amazon to discuss return of faulty material and claims of 1 kilo of useable product.  Open 8 days... printing parts each day. Broken sections in bowden tube by day 7. Unacceptable.	-1
I just finished my first spool of this stuff.  I love the color but I had a few tangles...one in particular that was responsible for wasting almost 1/4 of the spool since it caused a jam towards the end of a huge print.  In spite of that I liked the color so much I was going to give a 2nd spool a try, but with the price varying wildly from the $22.98 I originally spent to over $33 when I looked yesterday, and now $27 today...forget it.  For $29 I can get a spool of top-notch Atomic Filament's silver PLA that's made right here in the USA too.  I think $22.98 with Prime shipping is a fair for a decent printing Chinese-made filament....but not a dollar more.  There are plenty of high-quality domestically made filaments for about the same price or a little mode like Protoparadigm, Atomic Filament (awesome stuff), and even MakerGeeks regular "Maker" PLA.	-1
While Hatchbox is normally very good...the roll of gold I got had jamming problems in 3 different printers....but...I've found no gold has every worked well EXCEPT for Zen's (and they changed the dang color of it last year)  If you're really wanting some gold I would suggest some ultra premium stuff...most of the mid grade stuff (from any manufacturer) has problems...  AND...I do like Hatchbox...I've used the other PLA's and ABS with great success...	-1
I've had a lot of trouble printing with this particular filament. It keeps clogging the nozzle and leaving gaps in the print, my only guess is that the PLA has some additives that are not uniformly distributed within the filament and 210C I was printing at wasn't always enough to melt it. Usually Hatchbox stuff is top notch, but this particular color (or batch?) is crap.	-1
I left an earlier review, but have to revise it now.  I loved this filament when I first got a roll a couple years ago. I bought a new one back in October (2016), and it seems like this new roll is much lower quality. The prints are still nice, but I've had more filament breakages with this roll than any other filament I've ever used. I'm probably only 25% of the way through the roll and I've had the filament break at least a dozen times. Sometimes it snaps at the roll, sometimes at the extruder. If I let the roll sit for a month, I can almost guarantee that the filament will be snapped inside the feeder tube the next time I go to bring. Lots of failed prints and wasted time.  I can't recommend this filament anymore, and will not be buying it again.	-1
Nothing but problems with this filament	-1
Really looks like cheap junk cannot get consistent color out of a print no matter the temp. I have tried all variants on extrusion but this stuff just didn't deliver. On FFCP all metal end. Possibly a bad roll I have had success with 3d Solutech before.	-1
All the other colors I have tried from 3D Solutech have been fantastic... However.. This one was not so good. Maybe I got one from a bad batch, I don't know, but this one isn't very good. For starters, this isn't gold. It's more like a bronze or the color of a dirty penny. I was very disappointed in the color. Second, it was harder to print with than the other colors from Solutech. I tried all temps from 190-220 and different speeds with different retraction settings.. Kept getting stringy prints with this one. If they can correct the issue, maybe I'll try it again, but for now I can't use 3D Solutech gold PLA. Still using the other colors I have purchased, and running out of them.. Hopefully they stock more soon..	-1
OK, this product printed quality is fine as most of the 3D solutech is.  However the color is nothing like "gold"  I expected a brighter, more shinier color.  If you are looking for a reflective metallic effect, this is not the product to do that.  It is very dull in color and can serve as a base color if you want to just sand and paint with a metallic gold paint.  This is more of an antique "old" gold color.  Printing is fine just not what I expected for color.	-1
Nowhere close to gold color, this is some light brown shade. Even quality is poor.	-1
I was pleasantly surprised to find abs filament at such a good price with prime shipping. I was especially excited to find a glow in the dark filament that wasn't $130 (I'm looking at you M****bot). I've printed numerous things with this filament and although the spooled filament feels somewhat brittle, the actual print comes out with no problems at all. Printer used: Makerbot Replicator 2X  Nov 2015 update: Recently I've had issues with the consistency of this filament and now it WILL NOT print past the first 30 minutes of the build. I've tried everything to get it to print (temps 210, 230, 250), different print speeds (30,60,90), but alas nothing worked. What really is annoying is that I was printing really well with one spool of this filament and then it ran out. When I replaced it with a new one right out of the bag it doesn't work. You can see air bubbles forming as it extrudes so I'm wondering if there is a moisture problem from the factory. I'm trying to dry it out, but I'm not sure how successful that will be.	-1
I usually don't have issues with the Hatchbox ABS filaments although I did have issues with their silver which has identical issues with this glow in the dark filament. This filament seems particularly brittle and I've actually broken pieces of it several times just loading it into the extruder head. This appears to be compounding the problem of it clogging the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print OK for a while and then the nozzle clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore and has to be cleaned. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return period passed and thus cannot return the unused filament which also cost extra being that it's a special filament being glow in the dark.	-1
This is not a true ABS product.  It appears to be MABS - a clear more brittle form of the ABS family of plastics.  Glow is decent , but nothing special. overall it works but it is not ABS and lacks the impact resistance.	-1
I am no longer a hatchbox customer. I have been fighting like crazy with failed prints until the other day I bought matter hackers filament and ran the exact same part with the exact same settings on two identicle printers. One running hatchbox the other with matter hackers. The matter hackers printed great and the hatchbox failed. I switched the filament around and guess what? the failed print stayed with the hatchbox. Junk! junk!! junk!!! gets gummy and does not melt correctly beware!!!!	-1
Beware! Tip broke off!  In all my years using these kinds of plugs Ive never had one destroy another piece of equipment. After 2-3 uses, the tip of this broke off inside a jack.  I was stunned.  It is impossible to remove the tip, now I must attempt a repair on that gear and replace the jack.  Avoid these!  If you insist on buying these check my garbage can for 9 more unused plugs. I will not risk the destruction of any more gear with these.  (Amazon - why no zero star ratings possible?)	-1
I bought a bag of 10 of these and the first one out the bag wouldn't go into a 3.5mm jack pass the center section of the plug. I measured it and it was 3.62 mm, too big to fit in the jack. So I measured the center section on all of them and they ranged from 3.42-3.62mm with the majority measuring 3.47mm. I just happened to pick the bad one first. These are still a decent deal when you know there might be 1 or 2 bad ones in the lot and are prepared for it.	-1
they are cheap not fit for actual use  plugged into audio for 3 different player, 2 comps 1 phone. they don't fit perfectly so it can't detect it unless you hold on to it. if you wiggle it, it will connect and disconnect continuously. for phone makes weird noises and static where computer doesn't.  only use for practice if anything as they are  cheap,	-1
Cheap!  Incredibly cheap!  The outer plastic thingies are pretty awful.  The metal is thin and cheap.  However, they were inexpensive and if they don't fail, they'll do.  Absolutely lowest quality, though. [edit to add: these are a joke.  The inner barrel rotates independently of the outer barrels...  That is, the contacts move around when the tip is handled.  Garbage.  Do not use.  Fortunately, my application only requires TS, not TRS.  These are junk, FYI.]	-1
Worked the first time. Second season, the red plastic pump cracked open a few places and I lost suction. Not really reusable for more than one season.	-1
While the device can work as advertised, the output is worthless for realtime data streaming.  Reading output is a surprisingly unpredictable at 2-8 seconds, and accuracy isn't stellar.  My purchase lasted 3 weeks, then poof ... unreadable.  I am sorry I made the purchase.  Rather than wasting money on a DHTxx series sensor, it is best to advance straight to the more rugged next generation Bosch BME280 with reliable 20 ms I2C read times, and measuring 3 parameters: temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.  The BME280 readings are precise (cv = 0.08), and my specimens have been accurate within 1% of NIST calibrated references.	-1
Fails at the seam, or I should say where it is creased. It splits under heat when it is tight. I gave it two stars because if you are making a loose fitting bundle, it is just fine.	-1
No where to attach the wires on the switch inside. The screws do not move the terminal to hold the wires. Contacting Uxcell got me jinglish back that was not understandable.	-1
Only received the female parts	-1
I've ordered these four times, and received different polarities and different wire insulation thicknesses. If you only need them for a small project which is covered by one batch, they are great. Batch to batch there are problems because of the polarity change.	-1
This printer should not be on the market. This is beta Kickstarter trash that was haphazardly retrofitted into a product. The version I have is the newest "R1" model. From the moment you power on the printer, the nightmare begins.  First you're given a horrible 3D printer software called MatterControl. The interface crashes when you minimize the window (At least on Windows 8). It also has the appearance as if it was created in the 90s. Many times you'll notice it fails to detect the printer.  Usually the first thing most people will do is play around with the X, Y, Z controls for the print head and watch the head move up, down, left, right, etc. However, if you control the head too low on the Z axis, the leveling switches will get loose and spin uncontrollably, and possibly get their connections permanently severed... pretty much self-destructing your brand new printer. I went on the robo3d forum to complain... but some guy named "Mike" said the solution is to not go too low on the Z axis, because MatterControl doesn't "respect" the switches. Are you serious!? Then why are the switches there in the first place!? Derp?  Before I continue, this is pretty much all the support you'll get from Robo3d... A guy named Mike on the Robo3d forums... Their support center is pretty much non-existent.  You'll get a few, maybe a dozen decent prints before more problems occur. First thing that you'll run into is probably the filament drive gets jammed or slips filament in the middle of your print... The solution the forum suggested was to buy a new "hobbed bolt" from eBay. Really? Did they build this in their garage!?  Next thing you'll get is an uncontrollable plastic leak from the top of the extruder's heat block. This is "common" according to Mike.. The plastic accumulates on top of the block, burns into a black liquid, and then falls on your print while releasing visible fumes. The black stuff hardens into nasty-looking boogers and causes the print to fail. There is no true solution to this, only a risky and potentially destructive tightening method that requires you to heat the extruder to almost 300C! While you're trying to work on the printer (which is what you'll be doing most of the time), the blue LEDs, while cool, blind you until you are forced to tape them up.  Maybe a few weeks in, things start getting very sad.. The filament drive jams even more, the leak becomes a flow, and you realize its almost impossible to print anything but the simplest items on this... Last but not least the fans over heat and fail (mine caught on fire), rendering your printer absolutely useless until Robo3d can send you a new parts, which on the forum I've read cases where it took several weeks (or even longer) to get replacement parts. Besides the parts replacement, the warranty is completely useless. Robo3d will not send you a new printer if it dies on you. In fact you'll be lucky if you even get a response from them. Only "Mike" on the forums might be the only help you get.  Thankfully I bought the printer from a retailer that has a decent return policy, and was able to get a refund for this hunk of junk! I just ordered a Dremel3D :)  **Edit - I just noticed a suspicious "5-star" review was posted shortly after I submitted this first review. I'm guessing someone at Robo3d is finally listening to me! Too late!!	-1
Simply put, I went through 3 different Robo 3D R1, 2 of them were Dead On Arrival, and the third was a used printer, missing a majority of the parts.	-1
Poor quality connectors don't waste your money.	-1
Harbor sells this exact item for $9.99 and its junk. Not even worth the 10 bucks let alone the 18 bucks they want for it here. My crimping tool destroyed the outer plastic. Its almost a hard plastic that will break off in pieces. The metal ends are a joke, they are so thin you can bend them with your fingers. The price suckered me into buying them but when more of them break then you can use its a big waste of everything.	-1
I have tried to use these things on many occasions but I hate then. They are undependable. I prefer soldering my connections together and use shrink rap wire covers. Much neater and more dependable. If I need to frequently disconnect a circuit I use the two wire universal quick connects.	-1
Ok! PETG will stick to this material to the point of ripping it when removing the print. Really pissed because it is really expensive for a pack of 3. I received them on Monday and by Thursday (Today) I have gone through all 3. Every print with PETG rips the damn thing right off. Also THE HEATED BED SEPERATED THE GLUE FROM THE ACTUAL BUILDTAK SURFACE. So it just came off very easily.	-1
I had really high hopes that this could serve as a replacement for my Flashforge Creator Pro Heat Pads. The FF Creator Pro Pads work great but seem to only be available through their site and at the hefty price of $12 a sheet. I figured this got good reviews and comes up in many forums. It should be noted that I'm a pretty experienced printer with realistic expectations. Unfortunately, BuildTak failed most of them. I was optimistic as I looked over the sheets, they come three a pack and the surface looked promising. I peeled off one of the backs to apply and soon realized that the glue didn't seem to be very strong, and only barely adhered to a clean bed. I releveled and began a pretty straight forward print. Good news is that the print stuck to the bed, the bed news was that when it was done, the print wouldn't release. When it did, it took a large chunk of tape with it and since the rest didn't connect to the bed anyway, the first sheet was gone. Round Two: Rinse and repeat with a new print, now the entire sheet came off along with the print. Round three: More of the same, luckily only a small piece came off and I was able to patch it with some painter's tape for now, but I do not recommended these if you are more than the occasional printer. You get one print a sheet. By way of contrast, the Flashforge Pads, are much thicker, adhere very well to the bed, and last about 20 prints each. Guess I'm spending $12 again.	-1
I keep looking for "the best" solution in printing, but nothing beats blue tape, PLA would lift, curl, and warp while using BuildTak on my Printrbot, I reverted back to blue tape.	-1
Not pleased really, hard not to damage this stuff just pulling prints off, going to try something else	-1
I bought this for three of my printers.  On all of them the print stuck so hard I had to use a heat gun to get it off.	-1
I did not find any benefit with these sheets and they were much more of a headache to use than anything else.  These are thick; so thick that the extruder height will need to be adjusted so that your nozzle doesn't rip right through.  These are also VERY sticky which made removing them a huge pain.  The sheet will rip right off the glue.  I had to use Krud Cutter and a razor blade to scrap the glue off my bed.  I have an aluminum bed as a point of reference.	-1
bluck	-1
I cant find a good bed height for this to come off easy so. well it works but I have removed it due to how hard it is to get the prints off. athe height is about .3 mm so I removed that amount from slicer. was still to hard to get off. removed .2 more and well it still won't come off. move more and it isn't bonding.  Id rather use my glass bed which the models slide off once cool or with a small amount of use of the metal "spatula"  I still have one more sheet to try and maybe ill give it another go but doubtful	-1
this product would not let go of my prints, too aggressive in my opinion...use kapton tap instead	-1
Apart from the problems where a number of the nuts didn't have threads cut in them and were unusable, I don't appreciate getting spammed by sellers looking for positive feedback. Appears to be no quality control in the manufacture of the this product, will not order this product or from this seller again.	-1
I call them "popcorn" as they have a habit of popping and smoking. These stepsticks have no protection from either the power supply or other devices.	-1
These leak air bad. I had to return these. I wouldnt trust these for traveling at all.	-1
These are a nice size and I love the flip cap but the plastic is hard and makes it difficult to squeeze out certain amounts of product without making a mess. This is more practical as a screw off pour bottle not a flip cap spout bottle. The spout guarantees you will have to squeeze to get thicker lilquids out.	-1
While it works it will also give you an incredible headache for hours and leave you feeling nauseous. I don't know if its absorbing through the skin (I barely touch it) or its the smell (I barely inhale it.) This is after very minimal expsosure and plenty of fresh air coming in.  I recommend something else! Im writing this trying not to throw up.	-1
I have been using Oatey 30203 Dark Cutting Oil to drill hard steel with cobalt bits and it works great. I decided to try this oil (always looking for something better) based on the reviews and was very disappointed. It simply doesn't work as good as the Oatey oil. It took me twice as long to drill a 1/4 inch hole in 1/4 inch hard steel. I drilled four holes, two holes with this oil and two holes with the oatey oil. The oatey oil is far superior for my type of work. Won't buy again.	-1
Prusa i3, Printing with an enclosure and abs slurry, an extra baffles to retain more heat and prevent any drafts at all. This set-up has worked flawlessly for the past 1.5 years using HB to produce the same part I print all of the time on it. Being that HB increased 50% for no reason, I thought I'd give this a try. Nope... Keeps popping off, keeps warping, changed up and down from 220-250 for extrusion, change up and down from 80 -115 for the heated bed. First layer is amazing, even added extra brim and mouse ears. No luck. Guess I'll pay more for something that works. I'm going to try brands that aren't on azn as I've started to have great results with those and pricing is starting to be better. I like eSUN for other material types of filament, PLA, PETG, but the ABS is a big miss for me.	-1
I had a lot of trouble with clogging with this filament. I ended up throwing away most of it because around 75% of the prints using it failed (other filaments didn't have this problem). YMMV though. I was using a Qidi.	-1
Worst filament I have purchased to date. Very brittle. It was broken on the spool about 4 feet in (I saw it before I even opened the wrap - should have returned it then) so the first few feet were wasted. Breaks trying  to load it. Breaks entering the extruder while printing. I have been able to get very few complete prints. By the way, this is first time I have written a negative review but this product has provided nothing but frustration.	-1
This is my first experience with printing in ABS, as the maker space that I go to doesn't really let anyone use ABS--as we're still on the Replicator 2 and that printer doesn't handle ABS. And our delta printer was down. I used this filament on my own personal printer which is an Ultimaker 2. Overall, I had a really hard time in getting the filament to stick to my build plate and read online about making ABS slurry which is super smelly and totally a hot mess. Another user suggest that I spray hair spray on my build plate instead--which is simpler and much much easier.  Overall, I did managed to print through most of this roll but here are some out standing problems--the filament snaps/breaks apart a lot--I had to take apart my feeder because this filament breaks apart in there a lot! I also the printer head now looks yellow--the fumes for some reason have a yellow coloring which has now "dyed" my printer head a strange shade of yellow. Also because this runs hotter than PLA I now have to replace the PTFE coupler on my printer head. I'd say avoid this material if possible or try a different ABS filament manufacturer.	-1
Not recommended.  It came in a vac sealed plastic bag, but it had a ton of moisture in the fllament.  Immediately after unsealing it and loading it up, the extrusion pops and hisses and bubbles as bad as I have ever seen.  The extruded filament is crunchy and foamy, and it's impossible to control flow because of the steam pressure created by the moisture. It also was prone to frequent clogging in my testing.  I ordered silver and gold, both rolls had this issue (and are promptly being returned).  I did not have this issue with a roll of natural ABS from eSun I got previously, so possibly it's an issue with certain batches.  As far as color goes, neither gold nor silver have any metallic or reflective qualities.  Silver is simply light gray, and gold extrudes to a dull ochre yellow.  The spools are big, but the filament unwinds over the sides easily.  Can't comment about diameter or resulting print quality, as they were basically unprintable.  Update: I did get a proactive response from the seller,  INTSERVO, to help me.  I'm bumping up the rating by +1 for good customer service, even if this batch of filament is useless.	-1
Too soft. Doesn't  un-jam anything. Maybe okay for clear nozzle, but it doesn't measurablely clean anything.	-1
smaller in dia, won't pull through without adjusting drive..	-1
This clogs my nozzles. The two times I have used this I had to disassemble my hot heat to clean is out. The prints were horrible after using this. My machine: Rostock Max V2 with HE280 hot end.	-1
Diameter is smaller than advertised. I have to recalibrate before/after using OR manually help force this through the system for cleaning the nozzle.	-1
Works about as well as as heating up the nozzle to 240 and pushing through any normal filament.	-1
This seems to jam up the extruder feed so I don't recommend it.	-1
I'm not sure if this stuff is needed or how It uniquely cleans.  I wonder if flushing any white filament through dirty nozzles will show contaminants.  I know one thing through experience.  You must run the stuff through quickly and use filament loading and unloading.  Do not run snippets through to the end and hope to push them through with a following filament.  It will clog every time.  I can't blame this material on this behavior.  My main point is I'm not sure it does anything.	-1
Great idea but I couldn't get it to feed into my hotend for anything. So didn't work at all.	-1
Filament density is higher than black, requiring recalibration to go between the two. Difficult to make consistent prints due to this.	-1
I had been buying 3D solutech filament exclusively for the types and colors they have in stock.  All of the previous spools I had purchased were vacuum sealed with moisture absorbing material sealed in as well.  This spool came unsealed with none of the normal stickers or little temperature card that were in EVERY other spool of 3d Solutech Filament I have bought.  It actually looks like the spool was returned and I got the returned spool in the regular 3D Solutech box, as there was no clip and the filament was very loosely wound on the spindle.  As I had great need for this, and I had to change filament spools in the middle of a print, I couldn't return it.  I haven't noticed any moisture effects YET, but will lower my rating to 1 star if there are.  I do not know whose fault (Amazon or 3d Solutech) it is that I got a returned spool, but it should not have happened.	-1
The product description does not say anything about this being "flex" filament.  But the product is very flexible, like a wet noodle, and the actual product has a tag on it describing it as "flex filament."  Due to the flexibility, it will not work in my Solidoodle extruder.  When I emailed the vendor to ask if I could return it, there was no response.	-1
Purchased this item to replace an older Hoover that, while it still worked, really showed its 10-year age (attachments broke, seals weeping, etc.)  Did a fair amount of research, and no matter where I looked, every model from every manufacturer seemed to have about 5-10% of the ratings at 1 or 2 stars.  Most of these were motor failures.  This unit fell in the lower range of failures, so pulled the trigger. . Out of the box, it's easy to assemble (slide-in the handle, and turn a lever), and easy to use.  The dual-action brushes worked well.  They also stop rotating when the handle is locked upright (nice if using the hand-held wand).  Water and solution tanks aren't the largest, but more than enough for an average-sized room (and their smaller size makes the machine smaller and lighter).  Plenty of suction, with the suction nozzle designed to remove for cleaning (simple lever to remove).  All these newer models have the handheld wand as a separate unit, so the unit itself is lighter with better suction and the hose is easy to clean.  When it worked, it was a great machine.  Now, the downside.  Used-it 4 times without incident - twice for "regular" room carpets, once on some stairs, and once to clean carpets in a car.  Each time, I cleaned the tanks and hoses, rinsed and cleared the brushes, then toweled-off the unit, storing it in a closet.  Started using it the 5th time, and it just didn't sound the same.  Noticed an unusual odor after less than a minute, and another minute or two later, the motor just stopped.  Double-checked everything, just to be sure there were no obstructions, but wouldn't turn-on.  Fortunately, it was within Amazon's 30-day window, so back it went for a refund, and on to purchase a different model.  Due to its short life, my personal experience is a 1-star, but I bumped it up to 2 stars because it really is designed well (if mine just had a better motor).	-1
Seem to leak.	-1
Does Not work very good!	-1
Needed this for duct work inspection, but the focal length of the camera is 5 to 6 feet away like a cell phone or USB computer camera.  So anything within 12-24 inches of the camera are out of focus. Its really like this just a standard pinhole spy cam with a really long USB cord attached to it.  Adjustable LEDs work fine except you can't completely turn them off.  Even at their minimal setting they are extremely bright which just means harsh reflections inside anything metallic like a duct.  I assume they did this to prevent these things from being abused as spy cams so some would see it and know they are being recorded.  But that totally negates its use as a scope in a reflective environment.  Maybe I just got one that didn't have its focal point adjusted correctly or something, but as it is it won't work as advertised.  One plus is that it would work on my cell phone with a 3rd party app and a micro USB converter.  But I had to send this one back in favor for another from ebay.	-1
After very little use, several times, the lens fell off and then the housing came off and then the connections broke very useless. it is a nice idea, the lights need a little bit of work (brighter) but it is a fantastic size	-1
Don't waist money.  Picture is unreadable.	-1
The included software (AmCap) would not install on Win 7 using the setup.exe on the disk.  It would just crash the installation software.  BUT, you can just copy all the files to a new directory on your hard drive and run it from there. Apparently it does not make changes to the registry file.  Just make a shortcut to Amcap executable file and put the shortcut on your desk top.  It works... sort of.  It will not go to resolution of better than 640x480.  I don't know if that's the fault of the camera or the software.  I might try some webcam free ware.  See if it will get better resolution.  I also intend to run it on a tablet.  I am waiting for Amazon to deliver a usb to microusb converter.  I hope the resolution will be better than 640x480 on the tablet.  That is a little too primitive and not what was promised.	-1
One LED was not working so I returned the item...thanks again to Amazon for the simple return!  Also, the image was not as clear as my first phone camera ten years ago, I was very disappointed in the resolution of the image and do not recommend this product.	-1
Did not work for me cause my computer not working and can not use it on anything less it has USB, I Gabe it away.	-1
Video quality is very very low res, looks like an old vhs...probably not even that good. I have ear tubes...I had one blow out. While I don't expect to self diagnose myself, I just wanted to be able to see if they are in place ...the last time I went in to the doc, he showed me my eardrum and it was plain to see there was a big prob so I got this camera. With this camera, you just cant see much detail  when looking inside something. It's just very low quality video in general. At the same time, what can you expect for a $20 endoscope . I rolled the dice and it's not so hot. My bad...I won't return it, it's $20 worth of endoscope. I'd suggest probably look at ones that cost a bit more and maybe have some youtube video's showing the video quality. This one is just not worth even the $20 , because you just cant see anything clearly so it's kind of useless. Yes, I cleaned the lens. I have many camera's, GoPro's and many other electronics all my life ...i'm the guy everyone calls to help or fix their stuff. Trust me, save your money.	-1
It is Tiny! No wiring instructions came with this button.	-1
Worked for 2 months then broke. Screen is garbled and its now useless.	-1
I had  this meter for 2 days and then it just stopped working.  It wasn't dropped, damaged or anything. It took 4 readings and on day three it would not turn on.  I tried everything.  Plenty of better meters out there and I would prefer test strips - at least those work!	-1
Water or other liquids can get easily inside item when testing solutions for PH wetting and damaging the batteries and small electronic pieces. If water get inside tester and is not dried properly before putting away, then eventually batteries will oxidized along with the internal electronic inside item and the Digital pH tester won't work and costumer will lost the money payed for this item	-1
Stopped working after 3 uses.  I should have spent the money on a better unit instead of going cheap..	-1
Either the batteries went out or the darn thing just malfunctioned. At any rate, it worked only once. During the first use of device, it failed to read correctly. I changed the batteries, recalibrated the device using professional calibration solutions, but still the device would not read correctly (LCD screen malfunctioning). I contacted seller and said seller denied my claim for a refund saying that it was past the allotted time for a return(!). Maybe 2 days had past since I received the device and it failed. Contacted seller on same day as failure.	-1
Did not work out of the box. Trimmer did not adjust anything. Many LED bars were out already. Would not change reading regardless of solution it was in. More junk being sold by Amazon.	-1
I love this printer! however it comes with its upsides  and down sides: Pros: -Great value! -It comes with everything you need! screws, nuts bolts, and I still have plenty of extra parts if it needs to be repaired! It even comes with all the tools you need to do it with! -ships quickly and is packaged very well -Fantastic LCD screen Cons: -Terrible guide! the instructional video was terrible quality and had no voice over to help you along - does take some modification/ fixing bad parts (a part of my board shorted out and I had to replace it) - SD card doesn't work! I don't know why but whenever i put an SD card in, the printer reads "no SD card detected" - takes some skill and time to assemble,  ***DON'T BUY IF YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DOING** I am very happy with this printer, and it is well worth the cost, however I must remove a star for the terrible guide and "instructional video" UPDATE: After A years worth of upgrades to this printer It can print any material, including polycarbonate, however, I did have to make some major (expensive) upgrades especially after *****************THE PRINTER BOARD CAUGHT FIRE**********  IF I HAD TO DO IT AGAIN-----------------> LUTZBOT MINI	-1
If you are thinking of buying this printer, PLEASE trust me and do not buy it. It's absolute garbage. Their support is terrible. My printer is 2 months old and i have spent more time fixing it, than printing.	-1
$120 cheaper at  www <dot> gearbest <dot> com/3d-printers/pp_128938.html and the one at gearbest states it'll print ABS in addition to PLA.  Lots of physical collision points.  Be ready with an angle grinder or small hacksaw.  Frame is square (good).  Electronics failed, vendor said it worked when they shipped it so I was out of luck.  I replaced the electronics with a RAMPS1.4 card I had and it now works fine.  Bearings needed lubrication.  Ok price for a kit except for the electronics failure.	-1
This filament is potentially out of spect by a whopping .2mm;  you are going to get jams here Pictured is a 1.75mm measured at 1.95mm!  For sure a filament this out of spec is going to jam.  This same roll of filament jammed two different printers!	-1
Hopefully it was just from a bad batch, I've had to be super careful with this filament to get it to stick. It's the only filament that I've had trouble with. Luckily there are other fish in the sea...	-1
Works great up until it doesn't.  The first month I had mine, everything was fine but then it started to jam.  After taking apart and reassembling, everything just started falling apart - If just barely touching the fan broke it ($15 + 1 week) the heatbrake snapped off in the heat block ($18 + $5 shipping + 1 week) and the broken brake could not be removed from the heat block ($18 + $5 for shipping + 1 week),  the thermister wire broke ($5 + $5 shipping)(where the wire leaves the glass bead) and just trying to keep the thing running after a little usage has turned into a nightmare.	-1
Followed all instructions and still had tons of issues printing PLA. Swapped out the throat with a PTFE lined one and issues... Poof ... Went away.	-1
My E3d v6 came out bended from the box and supplier doesn't want to replace it. E3d v6 is a good maybe the best hotend but please be careful cause sometimes it can be bended right out the box	-1
Performs no better than the stock hotend on my Prusa i3.  PLA and PETG ooze out once it gets hot, even if you have the filament retracted.  Too much cooling (considering that it doesn't provide any benefits).  Prints with PETG often fail from thermal runaway because the hotend can't maintain >240.	-1
came with shorted heater	-1
The description and pictures do not state this come disassembled, only using the word "kit" to allude to this, which has been a major point of contention due to the tedious process of assembling the thermistor and placing it in the tiny screw hole in the heat block (under a washes shiny side down mind you!) without it breaking or having the cheap fiberglass sleeving fray. Its assembly is like putting two threads through 4 needles at the same time and trying to keep them all spaced properly at each step of the way while tieing a knot. This was not what i paid $80 for.  The hotend worked well for the few days i got to use it, then the thermistor burned up and was useless, unfortunately this seller, 3dmarkerworld, was unhelpful at first, offering to replace my assembled thermistor with a disassembled one, then outright sleazy when i decided it wasn't worth it to replace this low quality thermistor with another low quality one and wanted to return it, with them making excuses as to why i wasn't going to get a refund, saying because i assembled it i cant return it (amazon made them anyways).  On the up side when it was working it performed very well, and there are better themistors out there, metal stud thermistors, which don't require this painful assembly process and are far more durable. So if you are going to get this hotend check e3d's genuine resellers list, there are better resellers out there who care about their customers.	-1
this is no better than the cheap ones you buy at the grocery store.  Sonicare blew it with this one.  I had one of their earlier models that used standard AA batteries and it had the normal high frequency vibrations that you expect from Sonicare.  This one vibrates at less than half the speed and doesn't do nearly as good a job.  highly disappointed with this.	-1
Just not what you expect from Sonicare. Previous model was very good and great for for tossing in your bag to use during day. I didn't want that kind of wear and tear on my in house one. Plus I leave my work bag in the car. But this model never leaves your teeth feeling really clean. I've been taking manual brush with me to use after. So I'll be looking for something else to use during the day but just upgraded to new Healthy White Sonicare 9/2015	-1
Defective-Does not turn on when batteries (that come with product or other new batteries) are inserted.  This item is not eligible for return which is not stated in item description.	-1
It is hard for me to give this only 2 stars but either I have a defective product or this is poorly designed.  The good news is that it cleans well for the sections you are able to use it. It gives that just from the dentist feeling in at least some situations--all for under $15! I love the small brush head compared to other brands as well.  So why did I rate it so poorly? Because unlike other battery powered toothbrushes (including more expensive Sonicares) the HANDLE vibrates so much it is distracting and hard to grip/control. Again, I directly compared this at the same time to other Sonicare models and the difference was shocking. That means you are wasting battery life vibrating the entire toothbrush and likely obtaining the power the engineers planned on sending to the brushhead.  Past that, the vibration is so rough that I, like other reviewers, felt I might chip or otherwise damage a tooth while using it. I certainly would not allow children to use it at all.	-1
System to get them tight is terrible-Rings always fall off when tightening.	-1
Don't waste your money,  small amount of adhesive on the back of the foam is useless, doest stay up, unless you want to nail it or stable it don't buy this product.	-1
Bought this unit to operate the chute on a 47" snowblower.  Just installed it today, Dec. 12.  It operated nicely for about 4 or 5 cycles.  Then it stopped working.  I went to return the item, to late.  The unit was purchased Oct. 22, had until Nov. 22 to return it..  Since I could not return/exchange it, I opened the end of the unit and found when it was assembled, one of the power wires was pinched resulting in the wire burning off.  This failure was without a doubt a manufacture fault.  Because it did not get put into service within 30 days of purchase, the failure of the manufacturer is now my problem.  SO, if you purchase one of these, put it in service as soon as you get it.	-1
Not suitable for #12 wire or larger	-1
I don't know what this is, but I do know that it is not adhesive lined or dual wall. I work with aircraft and military grade shrink tubing and this stuff is far from having an adhesive lining. It is thick walled if that is what they are calling dual wall. This was a complete waste of money and my time. I needed this to complete a project before the weekend. I will now spend valuable time looking for the correct shrink tubing instead of working on the project.	-1
Gunk Cheaply Made Rusting After 5 months of use only reason it isn't 1 star is due to price. shipping was on time and packaging was appropriate	-1
Easy to rust	-1
Cheap. Does not contain stranded wire compression strips. Tinning ends of stranded wire required but that reduces reliability in high vibration or flexing connection environments. Plastic material cuts easily but seems too brittle. Careful not to over torque, screws strip easily. Not sure about oxidization and conductivity of metal used. Recommend Molex or equivalent for critical or fixed long term applications.	-1
Of the 10 bearings, 3 ran smoothly - 2 were torqued slightly causing them to not be perfectly flat and the remainder had scratched bearings causing noticeable vibration when spining.  Next time I'll pay attention and by ABEC speicification rated bearings.	-1
First one broke within a week. Replacement was DoA.  I'm upset.	-1
Tried 2 differant ones thought the first was broke... but nope I wasn't very impressed returned!!!	-1
I have returned mine as the image resolution is not that good and field of view is very limited. the Flir generated much better images. Will probably buy the Flir, its more expensive but worth it.	-1
can see to good. cant make out what's in front on me looking in the iPhone	-1
The imager itself isn't bad. It's sensitive enough to read a handprint off a hand placed on bathroom tile for just a few seconds. However, the app on the iPhone is absolutely horrible. First, on iOS 11 it constantly gives you an error that you don't have enough space on your phone even though my phone has several gigs free. Fortunately, the image is actually stored in Photos properly so it's a super annoying bug but not a killer one. The main reason I'm disappointed with this is that the imager doesn't read values below 20C.  See the photo of the insides of my freezer attached. It should be reading -5C (23F) but it says instead, 20C (68F).	-1
Don't waste money on this,  u won't to much money!!!!!  ( for 20.00 dollars in parts) if that . Chinese parts are even cheaper. u can make this out of surplus parts 4 pennies,  People go get a flir TK, at least u get something complete . O and u have to supply the  hart the 300 500 phone and os. 45.00 max and the app stud be free.	-1
They did something to the Android app, and it wants me to register (which doesn't work), and they don't have any way to get past it so I have two expensive bricks.	-1
Sounded like a good idea, use the cell phone's screen for a viewing device.  I don't know if the quality of these cameras vary as some seem to be very happy with the results, but the images I got were totally worthless. Even knowing what the camera was looking at was no help. Thankfully returning it to Amazon was an option, so I was only out time, frustration and disappointment that it didn't work.	-1
The new app shows the temperatures really nicely, with a vertical scale at the left of the picture. But they're meaningless. See attached pictures showing a near view of a washing machine drum, and a medium distance view of the same machine. Temperatures are wildly different. This device is fun to play with, and may be reliable for showing variations in temperature, but you can't take the temperatures seriously, at all.	-1
Updated - 08/15/2016: I went to use the thing today and found that my smart phone had automatically updated to a newer version of the software. The new app is horrible. I had to log on with a username and password (WHY?) to use a camera attached to my phone. It was a very simple app and now it's needlessly complex. In addition to the needless login, it's bloated out with a useless "home page" that seems to only serve to advertise the company. Rather than focus on improving the quality of the images, they have focused on collecting user information via a login and self-promoting their products. I have removed one star from my review due to this app update, and after seeing the direction the company is taking, I can no longer recommend this product. Had I to do it over again, I would have bought the FLIR instead and added an aftermarket lens for closeup work.  Original review:  I bought this thermal imager for a variety of purposes, including imaging electronic components on circuit boards. For someone considering this camera, the first thing I would suggest is to visit the Thermal Imaging forum over at eevblog. There's a ton of information about various imagers from different manufacturers. I considered both the Seek and the FLIR imagers for my iphone device. I ended up choosing the Seek because I liked the idea of an adjustable focus. Sometimes when I'm imaging electronic components, I like to get close, and being able to focus at a close distance is an advantage. Note that Seek also offers an extended range version, which will give you better performance at distance at the cost of worse performance at close range. The FLIR is considered by many to offer better image quality, even with reduced pixel count.  Also note that you can choose either Android or iPhone/iPad operation. I chose the Apple version as I'm an Apple user rather than an Android user. In some ways I regret this decision, as the Android version can be connected via USB to a windows PC and thirdy party software can be used that generates better image quality than Seek's software.  If your iDevice is in a case that has any thickness to it whatsoever, then you'll either have to remove your device from its case, or buy a lightning extender to extent the lightning port down a little lower. Amazon has lightning extenders from a variety of vendors. I'm using this camera in an otterbox case with an extender.  Generally I've found the device to be quite handy. I've used it for checking electrical components, checking heating/cooling around the home, even looking at cylinder temperatures in an airplane. You may see claims that you can use it to diagnose plumbing leaks and/or see pipes inside of walls. I think those claims are a little exaggerated. I wouldn't expect to see anything but the most egregious leak, and while I can easily see exposed pipes, I can't see pipes inside the wall.	-1
Having used a few FLIR devices, this product is woefully inadequate and lags.  Any moving objects are not picked up in real time, or in time at all.  Disappointing.	-1
Being an inspector with a need for an Ir camera.  I was looking for a smaller version than my bulky flir b-cam.  Seek is not for any professional. Images are so blurred. Not of any true value ffor any real practical use.  Being a Firefighter and Inspector , having used an assortment of Ir-camera's over the years. I had low expectations of this system from the start. But was optimistic. 2 minutes of use and I printed out a return label. It's a kids toy imo.	-1
LOVE camera but NO product support,  want to buy upgrade but cant get access to company, additionally worked on Samsung G5 and Nexus 7 but they stopped operation on Nexus 7 after "trial period":  cant contact anyone,  SUPPORT SUCKS!	-1
I have a motorola Moto E2 and a Galaxy s5 active having problems with both motorola lock up all the time with camera and drop feed same with the  Galaxy s5 active and It has a hard time fitting in with the cover for the microUSB xr real can not be useful in side a house only for out door!	-1
I found this difficult to deal with.  First, as others have commented, it was difficult to attach with a cover on my android so I used a cable.  That really didn't work well for me because it was hard to aim.  There is a delay in the refresh rate so when you aim it at something it takes a second or two to "materialize".  By that time you are not sure where you have aimed it if you are holding it by hand and if you are still there. Further, I did not find a way to overlay a photograph on the thermal image as some cameras do.  I was "lost" looking at globs of color.  I attempted to focus but with the combined bouncing around and refresh delay it was very difficult.   I am a novice at thermal imaging.  Perhaps someone with more experience knows how to do this better such as a stationery mount of some sort.  But for my application where I want to move around easily I found holding the camera apart from the smart phone cumbersome and impractical.  I am returning this camera and am investigating FLIR cameras which are more expensive but they  do overlay the thermal image with an optical image so you know where you are, and exactly what is causing the temperature variations.  The overlay feature is worth the extra money for me.	-1
The sensor has a problem where a very large section of it is not working correctly (consistently shows a different temp than whats around it, whether you have it pointed at a hot stove top or the inside of your freezer. Normally I would think that the warranty would cover this, but its been 24 hours since I emailed Seek and all I have received is an automated confirmation email - I can understand that they are busy, but if their support is overwhelmed, then that means the company has both problems in leadership if they don't have enough support persons, and/or they have a LOT of RMA's and can't keep up.	-1
I don't actually know if this item works well, because almost every time I push a button it seems like the device resets itself. There must be a short of some type, which has me wondering whether the manufacturers quality control is as good as it should be.	-1
