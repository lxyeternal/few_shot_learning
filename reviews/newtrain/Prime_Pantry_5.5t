These feel off. In a good way, though. They feel extra absorbent. The only negative thing I can think of is that the roll is a little small, but they do a great job at soaking up things and wiping stuff down.  There aren't any ridges on the actual paper towels, so that is something that could be added I guess, but I don't normally scrub with paper towels so it doesn't really bother  me anyway.	1
These were a super value and I have always used Viva.	1
I love these! They really are a great value for the price. I like that I can choose a size. Sometimes I only need half a sheet to pick up or wipe something. WIth other brands I have to waste a whole sheet. Not the case with Viva. They bring 6 so you know you're going to be okay for a while without needing to re-stock. My cleaning lady started buying them for other houses she cleans at. She recommends them to everyone she cleans houses for.	1
They are paper towels.....	1
very small rolls	-1
Great paper towels, soft and absorbent.  The rolls are small, but that works great for me, my paper towel holder won't take the bigger rolls	1
Super tough material. Way stronger than I expected. Does the job well.	1
Oh yeah, I forgot these are the paper towels that are stinky, scratchy, thin, and cheap.  I have to remind myself to stick to Bounty or even my local store brand.  Oh well, I guess they're okay for cleaning up cat vomit.	-1
I like that I don't have to use a huge piece. Whoever created the choose a size is Genius	1
Let me start off by saying this product was an excellent concept.  This is for those times when toilet paper simply will not do, or is insufficient for your needs.  I would suggest, using the toilet paper first, then cleansing your body area with these.  These are quite flushable and are safe for cesspools and septic tanks.  We are going to order refills when we run out.  I am finding that these are quite useful in keeping yourself extremely clean.  You can even take them along on a car trip when some of those gas station bathrooms have no toilet tissue.  Just remember keep the box closed or they dry out!  This was a great idea.	1
Viva is the absolute best paper towel and I will fight anyone who says otherwise	1
I really like these paper towels, they are so much better than other kinds I have used.	1
great product	1
My little friends love them.	1
Product arrived on time and as described.	1
Personally my entire life I have used Bounty. Now, knowing that these were not bounty I am somewhat pleased. I love the select-a-size which I think should be a requirement for all paper-towels! They absorb a lot, and don't shred which is what is most important.	1
Favorite Brand	1
I like them okay....they actually seem a little too thick. But, I would buy again.	1
product as described	1
Tried for first time for something different. They worked well	1
Theyre ok. The price is good	-1
works well	1
Great product; arrived on time; reasonably priced	1
Nice and keeps your areas clean	1
Excellent product	1
I don't think I need to explain this one to you.  Just try it, youll like it.	1
I absolutely love these wipes. I have been using them for years. Sometimes you just need a little freshness in your life. These do the trick. Sorry but toilet paper alone is not going to get your booty fresh and clean.  There's no kind of burning sensation whatsoever. It just feels like a little bit of wetness period easy to use. The wetness dries quickly. Guaranteed to leave you feeling fresh.	1
Do not know how anyone could do without these.  Really make you feel clean and fresh.	1
Will forever be my favorite brand of paper towels! So durable and doesn't leave lint residue. A++++++	1
I love viva paper towels and I don't care how boring that sounds. They're thicker than other brands- they're perfect for cleaning, using as a napkin for messy meals and whatever else needs wiping. For me, as a person living alone, this 6 pack lasts a really long time.	1
I use the ones that feel like cloth, keep them in both vehicles and in every room in the house. I am allergic to tissues which also spread fibers on everything, besides making me sneeze but the Viva towels don't do either one.	1
perfect	1
seem to dissolve when wet, don't tear clean when grabbing for a towel.  Won't buy again.  Back to Bounty I guess.	-1
Love this paper towel. Best ones out there. I've tried them all	1
Rolls are pretty small	1
Excellent.  Thick and stretchable.	1
Love this product	1
Hey men...no undie streaks!	1
Good For The Price If You Want To Save	1
Thick paper towel so it holds up to messes and scrubbing. Recommend!	1
we love the viva towels, so much thicker	1
these are stronger and last longer than any other paper towel out there.	1
cheaper then the bounty and they work better as i have compared them	1
same as supermarket and cheaper price, love the choose a size option	1
This is the ONLY paper towel I trust	1
These work, but I do not like the texture. I am sure this is my own issue, but can't stand to peel them off the roll (and that is what it feels like) and I don't like how they feel in my hand. Icky--can't explain it. I probably have some un-diagnosed  sensory integration issues, but back when I was little they did not have names for these things-lol!  Anyhoo...just prefer the brands that have the texture and are more paper towel-y (sorry, that is not a good description!)	-1
Will never go back to regular paper towels! They may cost a little more but well worth the purchase .love the stretchy clothlike material	1
asorbs and wipes very well	1
Perfect: -Density of wipe -Nice smell -Hygienic.  Get these!	1
I love these wipes--they're great for making you feel fresh and clean in between showers. The one down side is that the container is not airtight, so the wipes can tend to dry out between uses. The plastic pouches are actually more airtight. Also, I was not aware that there are different colors and that they are sent randomly. I thought I was going to receive a white one, but got a light green one instead.	1
ok	1
as described	1
These are a nice size and I like that you can flush them.	1
Good product! Good price!	1
Great way to stay clean and fresh. These are great and the dispenser works to keep the wipes moist and ready for use. Probably some of the best wipes I've had the pleasure of using. All in all, great purchase. Will buy more as needed.	1
These are strong, do not fall apart and cleanse as expected. I like the fact that they can be flushed. I would hate to have to discard them into a wastebasket. They are great to have around during a hemorrhoid flare-up when you need a more gentle cleaning regimen.	1
Cottonelle  fresh care flushable cleansing cloths. Is flushable. Love.	1
The rolls do seem a bit small for regular.  But if you look at the square footage they are the same as most, they are just tightly wound which leads me into my second comment.  These are not super easy to unwind for use even with a heavy towel holder.  But the plus is that you won't get more towel than you want (I only need 1/2 size mostly), with other brands (you give it a yank and end up with 2 towels even though they are "choose a size) and rather than rolling them back up most just use. I didn't like the tightness at first, but the rolls do last longer as I get the size I need.	1
These towels make clean up and some general household cleaning much easier.  I love how the dust clings to them and they truly are strong.	1
Great	1
These are my favorite paper towels ever the best part is that they don't roll off of the role because they stick together which is great for kids !	1
Super as advertised!	1
juct right	1
I had no idea Viva was different from other paper towels, but now that I've run out of these I'm hooked.  I usually go through a roll a day of regular, generic paper towels.  Using these, especially with choose-a-size, stretched each of these mini-sized rolls to a week!  I'm going to look for the standard size rolls in my local grocery.  I agree, they are a little rough, and leave some lint on things like my glass cooktop, but the clothlike feel and sturdiness is great.	1
Ok	1
Works good for whats intended for.	1
good product good price	1
There are convenient & have an easy access top.  I wouldn't flush to be safe.	1
My butt is so much cleaner now	1
College Ship	1
I was surprised how many paper towels were on the roll, I usually buy bounty.  Now I'll be switching over to Viva.  I actually don't care what I use but it gets the job done.	1
does the job	1
Perfect for my needs. Good product, price and quick ship. Thanks!	1
The dispenser works very well. Great product.	1
Very useful, easy to use.	1
love THESE IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD THEM THEY ARE A MUST HAVE IN THE BATHROOM.	1
does what it says.	1
Great item.	1
The item was delivered on time and exactly as described.	1
great stuff	1
SATISFIED.	1
The rolls are kind of small but I'm used to the jumbo rolls.  Viva is very soft (imagine those blue shop towels).  I find them just as absorbent as more expensive brands but they don't have any quilting- just flat.	1
This is my new favorite brand of paper towel.  I love the select a size on them. They are so absorbent too.  We normally purchase Bounty, but I think I may actually prefer Viva!	1
Best paper towels ever	1
super wipey	1
perfect in all ways	1
nice product.  Soft and durable.	1
Feel great	1
as expected	1
The best paper towels ever.	1
Meh.. so & so. Will try another type next time.	-1
as expected	1
comfy for hemeroids	1
A good product, fairly priced and delivered to my door!	1
Ive tried other brands and keep coming back to this brand. They never fail me. They do not clog in toilets, they are nice and thick and easy to pull out of packaging.	1
Love these paper towels because they are so soft and absorbent.  Well worth the price.	1
Purchased through prime pantry. Great value. Arrived on time and as described.	1
Love Viva, they are so much better than any other paper towel out there	1
As expected.	1
Uh uh...not worth the money, don't last, don't feel right either. No one in family wants me to get more. Sorry, viva.	-1
a good value from a trusted brand	1
amazingly soft, work great!	1
nice	1
better than regular paper towels :)	1
great wipes, i do wish they were a bit bigger	1
These are terrific and you can flush them.	1
So it's only toilet paper... er, I mean, bathroom tissue! But I don't buy any brand other than Cottonelle, because I think it is simply the best.	1
Can't do without these and Amazon price is better than local stores	1
Great price for fresh flushable cloths.	1
as expected	1
love these	1
I will not be buying this package again, although I like viva, this particular pack has 6 very skinny roles !	-1
In my home, we have always had dry toilet paper and wet toilet paper.  Over the years I have tried many wet toilet paper brands and have found many to be good or bad.  During my checkout, this wet toilet paper was recommended and I looked at the product description along with the reviews and added 2 of these in my cart to give it a try.  This is really some good wet toilet paper, very happy with this purchase.  The box that the wet toilet paper comes in is very impressive, it looks nice as far as dcor and is perfect for many refills.  The top of the box has a long press button which makes it easy when pulling out the wet-nap, when you press down the top opens smoothly. I really like that the slit where the toilet paper comes out of is made of soft plastic, it makes it easy to pull out the paper and it snaps shut perfectly.  The portion of the box for the refill is easy to open and you do not have to struggle prying it open like so many other boxes.  Also, the bottom of the box has 4 feet which helps keep it in place so it does not slide away from you when trying to pull out the paper.  The wet toilet paper itself cleans very well and the ripples themselves really clean better than wet toilet paper without the ripples.  They are very effective when used as a feminine hygiene wipe as well! Using this wet toilet paper in conjunction with dry toilet paper has improved the overall cleansing process.  And I also feel fresher with the ripples.  Having sensitive skin, I have had no irritations or experienced any rash using this product.  Also, my husband has not experienced any issues either and prefers this wet toilet paper brand over the others I have purchased.  Will be purchasing a few more boxes and refills for the other bathrooms in the house and would recommend this item for sure.	1
prefer this to other products ...also receiving it in my Prime order  is easy for me	1
Just what the doctor ordered.	1
These are great. Wish they were still available.	1
as described	1
wonderful	1
Great Product!! Super Quick Shipping!	1
Best paper towels you can buy. Strongest and most absorbent I have ever used. They can be on the expensive side but you will use some many less.	1
Was slightly disappointed in the size of these, but I still love the Viva brand just know that these are small ones and not large ones.	1
good	1
Excellent product	1
Very good!!	1
Great product, dispenses easily, stays moist.	1
These should be labeled "mini rolls".  Very small, not what I expected.	-1
very small rolls although product is very absorbent	1
I like the way these smell.  Not antiseptic like some other brands. They do a good job. Would recommend to others.	1
THESE FRESHCARE FLUSHABLE CLEANSING WIPES ARE GREAT TO HAVE.  KEEPS YOU FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN.  I LIKE THAT THEY ARE FLUSHABLE AND WON'T CLOG THE TOILET.	1
These are truly a gift from God if you have hemorrhoids, or really any sort of rectal/intestinal issues. Even those who have no problem at all just using regular toilet paper alone--give 'em a shot. You'll thank me, and your porthole will thank you in return.	1
A+	1
Great paper towels, very strong and hold up well, use them both in kitchen and in the garage.	1
These are great paper towels.  Just want to point out that they are regular rolls, and not double or jumbo.	1
This product delivers an extra clean feeling. The wipes are ribbed to remove morr. They are flushable and thick. They smell fresh. The container can be reused so you can just purchase refills.	1
it burns can't use at all, unlike other brands I have used this one leaves me feeling like I wiped with fire.	-1
Nice product.	1
glad to find at good price	1
nice	1
I'm enjoying this and my septic system seems to work with flushing this without a problem.	1
Great value,	1
These are skinny rolls and the sheets stick to each other, they are hard pulling them off a dispenser. Won't buy again.	-1
Best paper towels ever. Period.	1
I was on my last roll ordered these. Viva is the best paper towels ad I like the choose a size it helps my family to use less! These are super soft and very absorbent so you do not have to use as many great product!	1
Awesome!	1
Works great!	1
Dries out easily.	-1
glad they are able to be flushed ,	1
UPDATE: I love these! the first two were difficult to pull up, but  now even my daughters asked that I purchase them again when they are gone. I purchased refills already and I am so happy that I did.	1
it cleans	1
i wish i would have read some reviews these are tiny rolls !	-1
I know, I know, how different can one paper towel be from another...but as a lifelong Bounty customer, I expected these to be inferior, as many other brands are.  Yet loving Prime convenience, I thought I'd try.  I was wrong.  They are so much better!  They are softer, more absorbent, stronger, easier to tear...plus you can't over-pull and get more towels than you need because they sort of cling to the sheet underneath.  You never have to re-roll the towels, as I have many times, usually with wet hands.  They make other brands feel like sandpaper, they are more like a cloth than a paper towel.  Bravo, Viva - where have you been all my life?!	1
Not too thick not too thin.	1
Nice and soft, i  really like the bigger rolls, though	1
Oh My! These rolls are less than 1/2 the size of my regular brand and not significantly cheaper. I will not reorder.	-1
Very small rolls, would prefer more sheets and seal on the first sheet is so sealed you lose the first sheet and need to try and use right away to get the roll started.	-1
This pack lasted my family about a month total before I needed to buy another pack.  These paper towels are thick and there is a lot of paper on the roll. They don't break easily and can hold a lot of moisture.  These are a great buy, even more so than bounty brand which I too love but hate the price point of.  For those looking to save some money viva paper towels is the way to go for a name brand paper towel.  This is a purchase most wouldn't regret.	1
nice to feel clean and fresh !	1
Girls in the house love this, as does the man!  NIce wipes to have in the restroom both for personal and quick wipe of surfaces.	1
Like it because it's refillable	1
Really nice product.  Perfect for everyone in house. We don't flush contrary to label.  Not worth testing the plumbing.	1
These wipes are great.  You always need a good wipe handy and this is one I like to keep on hand.  Leaves you feeling fresh and clean.	1
Best paper towels available and this is a great price.	1
matched the description	1
These are absorbent. I like the feel of them too. Feels like quality paper towels.	1
good deal	1
I love the Viva brand but I was expecting the roles to be a little bigger.	1
Viva is the best! I love the feel and way it works when you add water. Added plus the choose your size.	1
I enjoyed this brand	1
The texture of these towels annoys me. The towels work but the fibers tend to cling to each other. It's a little hard to peel apart the sheets. It is okay though for kitchen use. I won't buy these again though as I prefer smoother softer sheets.	1
VIVA is my favorite, it is a little more but you use less. It is softer than a napkin or tissue. I love VIVA.	1
Great quality and great price.	1
Thick wipes work well for freshening up in a hurry. Dispenser makes it easy to remove wipes and keeps them moist.	1
Pleased with purchase.	1
does the job so I can go commando...  o_O	1
Love these	1
Works as expected.	1
Awesome paper towels!  These feel more cloth like than paper.  I will continue to buy these!	1
Thank you	1
Loved them	1
Purchased for a friend with a small child. Sometimes the toilet tissue alone, doesn't get the job done. These work well, like baby wipes, but not as thick and flushable!	1
When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!	-1
good	1
It is what it is! I like it.  I don't flush though.	1
Container keeps wipes fresh.	1
Too thin and tear really easy, won't buy again	-1
Get's the job done. Haven't really used it much but it smell and feels good. It isn't too wet and it's strong. The smell isn't overpowering either.	1
These are very soft, I'll give them that, however they're not very absorbent. I normally use a different brand that unfortunately isn't available on Prime Pantry. I find that I use 2-3 times more of these vs. the other top name brand paper towel I normally use. These are cheaper by definition, but more expensive once you factor in the amount you have to use to do the same job.	-1
Love the thing choose a size for very frequent all day use. Best with little kids at home.	1
good product at a good price	1
These may cost a bit more than the bargain brand, but you get what you pay for. They are strong enough to rinse and reuse, so you use fewer. They hold up to scrubbing with abrasive cleaners too. Well worth the slightly higher price!	1
Flushable cloths and thicker than generic brands. Decently priced	1
Helps keep things nice and fresh :)	1
Leaves me feeling very fresh and clean.	1
Very nice wipes with mild scent nicely textured.	1
One of the strongest paper towels out their	1
always like viva	1
Not impressed the rolls are small and don't absorb well. They also stuck to one another. Won't order again.	-1
They are flushable!!!	1
This is really handy for that finishing touch on cleaning up the back side. Also love the fact that it just flushes down when you are finished. This is a must have item for adults and kids alike. I make sure I keep a pack in my bathroom and also in the guest bathroom. I also keep a pack in my car and use them as wet wipes.	1
soft to use.	1
Ok	1
Great Product!!	1
The paper towels work well for cleaning and absorbing liquids.	1
Satisfied purchaser	1
Good paper towel, decent price	1
I'm more of a bounty fan, but I like using Viva too. These are soft towels that can take on cleaning jobs that one may not want to use a sponge or rag for. I like the select a size, as often times I do not need a whole paper towel to wipe up areas. These can be linty, so they are not great for glass or reflective surfaces.	1
I prefer "choose-a-size" paper towels. The brand does not matter that much to me. These are fine, I didn't have to lug them home with groceries, but I feel the rolls are a little small, not what I have been used to. But sheets are nice and thick, like cloth. I am not a big paper towel user, a half towel a day usually.	1
Very soft for those moments of need.	1
as expected	1
I have already reviewed the cloths elsewhere  strong, moist, and mildly scented, a pleasant addition to the bathroom or makeup mirror. I want to add that I love the dispenser. The release mechanism is easy and clever. One tap on the edge will pop the top up.	1

Very best non-Sented	1
helps when laid up in bed for 7 weeks to have on hand.	1
good	1
I like that these viva can be reuse. They are sturdy and does a good job. However, I don't like that the texture is like cotton. It doesn't work for certain kitchen jobs.	1
Great absorbent paper towels. I like the select a size, but you may not, don't forget to check if that's what you are ordering. These are small rolls also.	1
My husband doesn't love these because they are a little more fibrous than he's been used to but I quite liked them.  They are soft and absorb liquids well.	1
Great price, great product!	1
good	1
Great addition to any bathroom.  Great product.	1
Perfect way to freshen up and get a clean feel!	1
I love these, I bought them for my disabled mother in law. She lives on her own and has a hard time taking care of herself. She uses these to stay fresh. I love cottonelle and totally trust this brand. My rating guide: *****5 stars: Wow! This product is of awesome quality! A steal in value and definitely can live up to whatever their claims are. I will definitely be keeping and maybe purchasing more. I would recommend to friends and family. ****4 stars: Good product of quality! This item has met at least 90 percent of my expectations, The design is sound, The build is great and the product does what it was made for. Its a great product that i can recommend buying. However it didn't completely wow me. This is what most products fall under. I would not return item. ***3 stars: Product is just okay. May have some cool features but did not meet all of what it claimed it would be able to do. Something is off and you would want to be warned about it before hand of buying it. I probably will not return but it would be settling. **2 stars: Product is not the worse of the worse but is of cheap quality or does not live up to description. Would still be returning because does not meet the needs I purchased it for or that it would probably won't have longevity in my opinion. *1 star: Not worth the time or money I recommend you keep looking for something of better quality. I wish I would have not purchased and wish I could have given it no stars. Will be returning product.	1
I like to use this as toilet paper when my skin is sore.	1
WIPES	1
I was very disappointed in these paper towels.  They are so small that the whole pack should cost maybe $3. They were half the size of any normal roll I've purchased from Target.  I will not purchase these again...very deceiving.	-1
This paper towels are not so great for everyday use for me, but more for heavier cleaning.  I recommend it for cleaning, and not just wiping up spills.	1
These wipes leave you feeling clean and refreshed. I love the fact that they are flushable. It makes them a lot more convenient!	1
Great alternative to the overpriced Dude Wipes.	1
Great case	1
Great personal cloth, smooth and fresh feeling.  Fast delivery.  I wouldn't flush them though as they seem too thick and could create a problem with your plumbing.	1
Worked as expected.	1
Good product!	1
I love that these don't fall apart when being used and that they are flushable. They leave you clean and fresh.	1
This is a fantastic quality paper towel.  It absorbs well without being overly bulky, so you get more per roll than with some of the thicker towels.	1
Whole family likes the great prices we get just by buying what we needed  and ya a better price for the same thing is always good these don't break up to fast just right .	1
Also, a cheap alternative for play wipes, which are the same thing, just overpriced.	1
Who doesn't love a little soft touch to the tush...!  A household staple for us that voids any skids in the undies.  Which I very much appreciate on laundry days.  Thank you Cottonelle!	1
easy to carry in purse....can be flushed in toilet	1
As described, good price..what's more to say?	1
love having grocery and supplies sent to house, no runny around and finding basic supplies.  Plus no shipping	1
This product is wonderful. Nice and soft, yet absorbent  for any job. A must-have for all homes.	1
I think Viva paper towels are the best because they're reasonably priced but also work well for cleaning up messes. They also work well when wet. I have pets and am always cleaning up carpet messes, and these don't immediately shred like the thin, cheap kind. Also, since they're plain white, you don't have to worry about the colors running.	1
Great for RV's,!	1
We love using these to feel extra fresh. Great size which makes it easier to flush. Love that they are flushable.	1
good smell and very handy	1
feel so good, fresh, and clean! love these! and you can flush them!!!	1
ok	1
I always use this brand	1
A little on the expensive side but definitely worth it.	1
Does what it's supposed to do. Clean scent, stays moist, flushes easily. Perfect for those hemorrhoid days when TP feels a little rough or to clean up when you get Montezuma's revenge.	1
Good product. Good transaction.	1
Subtle fragrance.  Nice closure and inside tear off feature to prevent too many sheets from being exposed to air-prevents additional sheets from drying out	1
They are refreshing to use and make you feel cleaner.	1
Love the select a size products.  Saves so much money.  And Viva is about as touch a paper towel as you can buy.  I've used them for years.	1
Great ! A bit expensive	1
i used to only use bounce.  very please this model.  it works well.  it works as well as bounce, but not better.	1
Love! Love these paper towels.  Won the school science fair as best of the paper towels available  at our local grocery!  Knew it was great because I've used it for years, and the handy choose your size is nice for all my different needs.	1
These are perfect for when toilet paper just doesn't seem to do the job on its own. Fresh scent, soft, flushable and septic tank safe. Start with TP and when that just isn't enough then grab the box and Usually just 1 will do to finish the wiping. We take these on trips, they come in very handy when gas stations are out of tp or even when the kids have a snack and need a quick clean up on those long stretches of road.  If my review was at all helpful to you please click the relevant button, thank you.	1
Item listed is what I received	1
Great product for the whole family including guests it's a high quality soft absorbent type tissue that is definitely discreet and yet approachable enough to use as you need	1
Nice cleansing and easy to get at. Easy to re-fill, too. I like this product.	1
I bought the Cottonelle Fresh Care 42ct Tub to finish up a Pantry box. I actually like these more than I thought I would. They are basically baby wipes for the big kids' potty. They are nice and thick, and have a well balanced moisture level. They are durable without being too dry or too wet. I don't use them often, but once in awhile you just need a little extra somethin' somethin'.  Although I frequently do reviews on products offered to me at a promotional price, this was a personal purchase. I paid full price. I was not asked, nor am I obligated to give a review.	1
What can I say ? Great	1
We love these paper towels, very absorbent. Three boys, enough said about the spills and messes around this house. Viva does the job and keeps me coming back for more	1
soft & absorbant	1
As promised,	1
the best paper towels available anywhere,very good price.	1
Good Job	1
These work pretty good! I like them.	1
Yeahs	1
no comment	1
These can be a life saver	1
Rips & tears when you try to use one from the box. I will never buy this again	-1
Rolls are smaller than I expected. But they are reasonably priced and absorbent.	1
Very good price and good quality paper towels	1
They are really good. Love the choose a size, saves on waste. A bit to thin for my taste, but the clean well. I just made a big spill tonight and two cleaned it up. They are satisfactory an absorption.	1
These are the only paper towels I will buy. I love the select a size option, the weight of the paper towel, its heavy duty and durable. They are good quality and good price. I've tried many other brands I will not name, always go back to these. These are the quick pick up go to towel for everything. We stay stocked up on these. I highly recommend.	1
I bought these because Prime Pantry offered a pretty decent coupon. Usually, I'm not picky when it comes to paper towels - I always buy whatever is cheap. After trying these, I'm sold. I deal with allergies throughout the year and frequently have to blow my nose - these are sturdy and soft and SUPER absorbent (and gentle on my skin). Also, even though the rolls appear to be small, I find that they last MUCH longer than traditional rolls. They are the most 'cloth-like' paper towels I've ever purchased. I can't get over how awesome these are for such a low price. My only complaint (which doesn't knock off any stars in my opinion) is that these have a little bit of a chemical smell when saturated (I only notice it when using them to blow my nose) - I'm assuming this is from the warehouse they were stored in. I ordered a second package of these for my next Prime Pantry box - I'll update this if the smell was isolated to my first package. :) I recommend you try these out if you see them on sale - you won't be disappointed!	1
Love these towels. Thick and very good quality. I like that they are good at not tearing and can be used as a cloth.	1
Helps in the car	1
Great $	1
as expected	1
Great	1
Like the fresh scent without irritation and a big plus for FLUSHABLE!!!	1
The best paper towels ever!	1
Great household standard	1
Awesome product... We love buying off of amazon prime.	1
Nice size so as to not have to purchase but maybe only every couple of months!	1
Arrived in good shape.  Works well.	1
This is a great dispenser for these wipes.  I bought this at a great price on Amazon and also purchased the large refill kit of wipes.  They were priced competitively with the store and the refills fit in this dispenser perfectly.  You only need to purchase this once. It looks nice in the restroom and is easy to refill and to take a wipe out!  These wipes are great. They don't clog your toilet, and they don't tear apart in your hand.  They clean well without a strong smell.  One wipe will do ya!  We are very pleased with both the quality and value of these cleansing wipes.  Your husband or wife will love them, too, even if they won't admit it!  (Warning.....stop reading if you don't want TMI) Especially helpful during your period, or anytime you need an extra reassuring cleaning.  I think you will love these wipes.	1
I have not been using these- love them.  They are like a "rag" to use, not just a paper towel. Very surprised of the quality.  Love the half sheet so that I can use lesser amount when I need a small job.	1
better than most paper towels	1
Love the new packaging.  Goes with my new bathroom colors.	1
I keep these near the toilet! If you don't you should. Great addition if you want to stay fresh and clean all day.	1
good	1
never had trouble with these, so soft on my sensitive skin!	1
These are actually much nicer than the charmin ones I've been using	1
Item arrived as Described	1
It works as expected.	1
good	1
As described	1
the best paper towels out there! I like that there is a 'choose a size' option because the larger pieces are too big and is a waste.  I can honestly reuse one piece over and over again. This is a great product.	1
These sheets are softer than regular paper towels.  I love them.  They are very absorbent and strong. I scrubbed up some dried soup on a tile counter with no problem.  The towel sheet did not tear.  Well done Viva.	1
Wonderful purchase.  Will buy again!	1
Cottonelle has great quality products!  I only buy Cottonelle and have been for about a year.  I used to buy Charmin but these products are far superior!	1
As expected	1
Yes the commercial is correct	1
I like this so much better than regular. Being able to choose a smaller size and not waste is wonderful.	1
very well made	1
The container is better than most and it doesn't look like I have baby wipes in the bathroom...much more adult looking and well made to keep the cloths moist.  I have very sensitive skin and had no issues there.  Of the flush able wipes this one seems sturdier than others I have used, I just hope it breaks down well and doesn't cause issue with the septic tank.	1
Nice	1
Work well. Handy container	1
We have Cottonelle Fresh Care Cloths in each bathroom in our home.  For some the idea of having these cloths is odd, but after you've had them available to you they really are a nice thing to have.  You can buy individual containers like these that are disposable or can be refilled or you can also buy dispensers specifically for these and baby wipes like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OXO-Tot-PerfectPull-TM-Wipes-Dispenser-with-Weighted-Plate-Aqua/dp/B0067GKHQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OXO Tot PerfectPull(TM) Wipes Dispenser with Weighted Plate- Aqua</a>&nbsp;which I have in my home.	1
I use these in my kitchen as well as in my china painting classes. We wipe our brushes on them to remove excess paint or oil. It doesn't shed any particles that would interfere with the painting. So, to make sure I don't have to worry about any shedding, I just use this brand all the time for whatever I need a towel for.	1
So fresh and so clean, clean!	1
Great!	1
Excellent wipes and good container	1
GOOD PRODUCT. IT DOES ITS JOB.	1
I love these	1
accurate description.  thank you.	1
Works great and is flushable.  Plus looks nice in the bathroom.	1
We really love these wipes in our house!!!  They are great to help my younger kids get themselves clean and also adults when they have painful potty issues!!!!  Will definitely buy these again!	1
The best paper towel out there.	1
I'm such a fan of VIVA paper towels  I've found that these are just as good as some higher priced brands out there!  The select a size is awesome. Keeps us from burning through our rolls to quickly... sometimes you just don't need a whole paper towel!  Absorbs well so makes it perfect for those messy jobs that need cleaned up  It's soft too which makes it just as perfect for cleaning your little one's face	1
my kind of a towel!	1
Good	-1
I use the Viva Choose-A-Size Roll Paper Towels for our craft room.  I love that I can select the size I need for the project we're doing, and that they are tough when wet.  These do the job of keeping our homeschool craft room clean and they work great for projects, as well.	1
As expected, great price.	1
Good product..	1
good product	1
Great.  Strong enough.  Big enough.  Comfortable enough.  And flushable.	1
I have never understood why we use wipes to clean a baby's behind, but then wadded up paper to clean our own behinds. After using these, I don't think I can ever go back to just using toilet paper. There is a little button you push that pops open the lid and the wipes pull out one at a time (similar to baby wipes, except these can be flushed.) You need to make sure you shut the lid all the way so that the wipes don't dry out. My rear end is very happy with this product.	1
Good value would buy again.	1
These are really fantastic at doing their job and keeping you nice and fresh and clean, and they are ever-so-lightly scented which is nice. I only flush one at a time just to be sure it doesn't cause some clogging problem.  Another good feature of them is for use with toilet training little ones. They often need some "clean up" help, but you can tell them they are big kids now and can use (with help) mommy's/daddy's wipes. In my experience they like the idea of having outgrown "baby" wipes, and it encourages them to not only stick to what can be a frustrating time for them (toilet training) - but help with their hygeine too. A win-win.  So, great for everyone in the family (just use under supervision with kids - the lid needs to be tightly closed or they dry out, and you also want to avoid an over enthusiastic toddler putting multiple wipes down the toilet!) I recommend this product and will be buying the refills.	1
for the odd messes.	1
soft and strong	1
Love these paper towels they are thick and soft. grate for cleaning and everyday use.	1
awesome value on nice absorbancy towels	1
Took a little getting used to since they are not like other paper towels - but they are so much better.  Will not be going back to the traditional towels unless Kimberly Clark changes this product.	1
Very good product for home, work and travel.	1
A great product!  Love the Choose-A-Size feature!	1
This is NOT like my previous order.. someone has downsized the rolls. This item isn't worth the price charged.	-1
Once you go VIVA you will never go back! I am a value shopper and while VIVA is more expensive than other brands it is worth it! I use two (which equals the size of one standard paper towel) to clean my entire stove top after cooking a grease-splattering meal. You can even scrub with them a bit before putting a hole in them. Especially appreciate the VIVA that comes in select-a-size because I have young twins and a half-size paper towel is perfect for them to self-clean their hands and face after eating, and it's soft enough that they don't complain.	1
love the price	1
Treat yo self.	1
Exactly what I was looking for	1
so much better than toilet paper	1
Love these handy little wipes that can be flushed right down the toilet. I keep them right on the toilet tank for my kids and any guests to use. Gets you that extra little bit of clean that toilet paper just can't. Smells nice, too.	1
Smells good, clean feel, flush easily, but tear easily coming out of the container even though it isn't sharp where you pull.	1
nice price	1
always in my bathroom.	1
Great! - Life saver. Fast shipping. Thank you.	1
Absorbs pretty well and holds up nicely.	1
In my opinion this is the best papertowel available.	1
Pleasant to use!	1
Leaves you feeling fresh and clean and haven't had any plumbing issues even with use on 2nd floor bathroom. Great fir yse with toddlers. Will buy again!	1
Cleans the butt...LOL	1
Use them daily	1
I think that "Fresh Care" is a good name for this product!  I generally use toilet tissue and then finish up with these Cottonelle wipes.  It leaves me feeling fresh.  I am giving only 4 stars because I wish they were a little bigger like some of the larger diaper wipes.  I really like the fact that they are flushable.  The wipes have a fresh scent to them as well.  It is not an overpowering perfume so it can be used by folks who have a sensitivity to strong smells.  Just remember to keep the lid closed when not in use so that the wipes don't dry out.	1
ok	1
Tried these because of the jump on price of Bounty paper towels.  Grandma and I both found them to  unimpressive because  - itchy and scratchy to use to wipe our dry are hands on. - fails a part easily when wet. - doesn't soak up spills well. - sticks to each other on the roll - doesn't tear at perforations So over all they aren't cheaper when you use more towels for a task. We won't by a second time and could not recommend this product based on our experience with them.	-1
clean clean clean	1
Feel safe that these towelettes are safe and really flush able.  They stay fresh (as long as you seal the top  tight (bg).  I purchase them from Prime Pantry, good price and offered in a bundle. Pleased with Cottonelle brand	1
Great product	1
the best kitchen roll there is. So many uses- It stands up to cleaning, and I make scented face tissues with them too, so soft. :)	1
These smell like vinegar or something-super weird paper towels to me. not like normal texture either and very small rolls....not buying again	-1
No issues from the kids.	1
Brought this along for a camping trip. Definitely glad we did!  It's portable and easy to pack away!	1
A must have for any bathroom	1
Perfect for getting extra clean!	1
So great that they are flushable. Soft and with a nice mild scent	1
I honestly ordered it just to fill my Pantry box.  That being said, they are strong, and nicely smelling - I think that's all that needs to be said!	1
So soft. Love them.	1
Great buy	1
Love the softness of Viva towels best out there!	1
I knew that this would be a smaller role as I usually get the giant sized rolls that they sell in store. The price for these is decent with the coupon offered here, but I would agree with other reviews that the quality seems to be lacking compared to what I usually get at the grocery store. I even compared a sheet from my last store bought roll and one from this pack and it much rougher and a smidge thinner.	1
Always feel fresher when using cleansing towels after.... KWIM??	1
Cottonelle Fresh Care Flushable Cleansing Cloths are wonderful especially because once used, they are flushable. They are also great for taking in the care on trips - keeping your hands clean. Packaging and shipping were great as well.	1
good product	1
Bought this for my 93-year old grandma and she loves these.  They are very soft and smell pleasant but not overwhelming.  I like Cottonelle brand for toilet paper so wanted to try this out and I'm glad I did.  It's relatively inexpensive and does the job. I am always worried about flushing wipes but these haven't caused any problems so far.	1
This is great for freshening up any where. You can bring it anywhere also because it's so portable and you can buy refills for your tubs. No one likes using public bathroom,especially my sons so these solve that problem when they need to feel extra clean. They are flushable too, unlike other brands we've used. The smell is light and fresh and it's gentle.	1
Bidet in a box, very nice.	1
Not only are they crazy strong but they are the softest on the market. I like that. I have used them for years and will continue to. I would recomend to anyone who uses paper towells.	1
Love how heavy they are and being able to select the size you want is great.	1
Nice Proudct	1
Love these for extra cleanliness.	1
Feels good on the hind quarters	1
Love flushable cleansing cloths. To be honest I am not brand loyal for these, but these are great. All I wonder is, why don't more people use them??? Your butt is not getting that clean with regular toilet paper. Babies get to use them, why not adults??	1
Love the fact that you can refill this dispenser. Small and durable. Doesnt take up lots of room in your bathroom or shelves.	1
Viva has been my favorite paper towel for a while now. Strong enough for quick pickups, yet soft enough to blow you nose!	1
fine	1
Excellent quality paper and at good price.	1
good product	1
I'd never tried this brand before, and when I got these I thought the rolls looked too small and not what I wanted, BUT, we use fewer sheets and find the product more effective than the other brands we've purchased in the past.  We always get the rolls that tear into 3rds, we found that one 1/3 sheet did the job of 3-4 thirds of the other brands, so we are really impressed, we'll get these again.	1
absorbent beyond belief	1
Nothing bad you can say about flushable wipes really. They are soft have a lovely smell and keep you extra hygienic.	1
Same as before	1
Let me just preface this by saying that I do not have sensitive skin and RARELY have I ever reacted to something.  I purchased these here on Amazon and within a fairly short time period, I started itching!  What could be wrong with me??  I emailed my doctor in a bit of a panic.  Do I have worms?  Anal fissures?  Hemorrhoids?  AAAAHHHHH!!  The itching was intense and I had no idea it could be the wipes.  Other people use them without problems.  But then it dawned on me.  Could it be my beloved Cottonelle wipes?  So I Googled Cottonelle wipes and itching and BOOM, there it was.  Pages upon pages of stories and consumer reports of anal itching caused by the wipes.  Stories of people that have used these puppies for YEARS without problems.  Or they went through hell for years and never related the issue to the wipes!  Apparently it's narrowed down to one ingredient in the mix called MCI (methylchloroisothiazolinone) and is used as a preservative.  Well, Google that and this is what you are putting ON a mucus membrane!!  You may as well just pop it in your mouth.  No bueno.  Stay away.  I think other brands also use this same preservative.	-1
as advertised	1
very worth the price	1
Cool little case so you don't have just a baggie sitting out which is a appealing visually ... soft and clean since the bidet is not common place in the states im glad that these are becoming more common (get you much more clean!)	1
Let me say I am not using these for the advertised purpose. Instead, I use these for instant cleanups of the carpet and floor when our puppy (or an older dog) has an accident. These are SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE than trying to clean up carpeting with soapy water/vinegar/baking soda and rolls of paper towels.  Seriously, a couple of these sheets are as effective as ALL those other things combined. (It has NOT affected my carpet color but you should test your carpet first to make sure it doesn't bleach or stain it.) However, I DO NOT FLUSH these because I've watched the TV news reports showing how "flushable" wipes are jamming municipal sewage treatment equipment. Just toss them in the trash.	1
Love these! Use them daily.	1
Perfect and they can be flushed which is nice.	1
Great. Thanks!	1
Better prices than my local CVS!	1
Lovely	1
These have a slight fragrance and I don't mind it. They could be a little stronger for a wipe.	1
Love these!  I honestly don't know how I lasted so long without using them.  This is my first choice of brands for wet wipes. These are soft and just moist enough.  They are lightly scented which is nice.  I love that this even has the part on the back so it can be hung on the wall with the hook that I have.  I think it came with a pack of Cottonelle wipes I bought in the past.	1
Easy to lift lid with the press of a button. and great cleansing wipes from Cottonelle. Very happy with this refillable box.	1
Lifesaver for pregnant women and British bulldog moms!	1
Been using these wipes since they came out and I still love them.	1
Good product that leaves a clean feeling.	1
The container on these is decently useful to me. Lids opens with 1 hand. Easy access.  Once you pull the labeling off, it's all the one off-white color which makes it much more "presentable" to leave out next to or on the back of a toilet.  They're as thick as needed - not overly so, but not wimpy.  I used them for about four months with an extender when I had a stenosis issue and couldn't fully use my arms, and they held up quite well.  I took off a star because they're heavily scented.  They can be smelled after you use them and your clothes are back on.  It's a sickly sweet kind of smell.  I do not continue to use them, because of this issue.	1
These work as you would expect. I do have a septic system though and had to get it pumped last week. I'm not blaming these, but the person who pumped the tank told me he saw a story about using this type of wipe. In New York City they showed a display of a large number of these that they cleaned out of the sewere system that were still totally intact.	1
I don't wanna get into a whole big thing here but these really are great to have around, they smell quite nice and do the job for which they were intended.  =)	1
As advertised.	1
These are great for personal care, but too small. Must have been men who made the size, because ladies have a bit more area to clean.	1
I eat a lot of Thai food. I mean a WHOLE lot. Sometimes, I get my Thai food a little spicier than I should, and sometimes, I regret that decision later. In a perfect world, I would sit in a cool running stream and think happy thoughts until the pain subsides. Since I haven't yet saved enough money to install a cool running stream in my bathroom, these wipes are the next best thing. They're soft and comfortable yet durable enough to stand up to the spiciest of curries without making me worry.	1
It's a party on your bum bum and it's a real relief if you eat spicy food. Cleans you up like a shower, I like.	1
Good product.	1
If you are reading this, you are likely wondering why I gave this product 5 stars. I'm sorry to disappoint with a review completely lacking in detail...but take my word for it...the product is as advertised.	1
why wipes are so expensive	-1
Sometimes TP just doesn't do the job.  If you're yearning for a cleaner, fresher feel, give these a try.  They're baby wipes for adults with a clean odor, not the cloying baby wipe smell.  They are thick enough to protect your hands but don't clog the plumbing.  My only issue in the past has been that the packaging allows the product to dry out before I go through the entire container.  This package is a little different, so hopefully it's improved.	1
works really well and the wipes come out of the container nicely.	1
Thank you!	1
I love this product and the convenience that it offers. I like to keep this type of item available for the dirty little tasks and visiting children. During a recent illness, I was unable to go shopping for certain household items. Amazon provided a super easy and somewhat affordable way to get the necessary items and a few healthy snacks with no fuss and no bother. I gladly recommend the service (on select items) to anyone.	1
not big enough	1
good product	1
I love having this item in the bathroom, put some in a baggie in my purse, a necessity as opposed to a luxury.	1
these are great and are safer for your toilet than baby wipes.	1
A must have for all bathrooms especially when regular toilet paper just won't do. You can use it to wipe off make-up too. Refillable. I keep one in each bathroom.	1
Love these	1
Great product.	1
Smelly smell good!	1
As described.	1
excellent product. you can not go wrong with this one.	1
Good product. Amazon shipped as promised.	1
Gets the job done.	1
Very effective cleansing ability. Good smell, not over-powering. Preferable size. These are considerably bigger than Scott brand wipes.	1
i use this all the time....it is a sure way to keep clean...	1
Nice container for the wipes.  Keeps them moist, too.	1
I have been using the Cottonelle cleansing cloths for many years. They are indispensable even for quick wipe ups of spots other than personal. I wanted a new dispenser but I usually order the Cottonelle cloths in Amazon's 126 refill packages. Of course the dispenser is nice to take when travelling.	1
These are my go to tissues . They are the best as far as sore noses and make up removal.	1
does its job	1
Great Value	1
Fits my dispenser, and is a product I love!	1
order this often	1
great brand! love these	1
kleenex  is the best	1
These work well and do the job. Forget all those fancy schmancy scented, oiled, crazy abominations of the simple facial tissue. Just go simple. Can't go wrong! You're not powdering your nose or trying to get an Academy aware, FFS!	1
Good quality.	1
Perfect as always	1
Soft. Got it at a great price and with winter here never can have enough of these.	1
great soft tissues when yo uneed them the most	1
thanks	1
Seems to be just fine. bj	1
Exactly as labeled. Soft, comfy, great when you have allergies or a cold.	1
Good stuff!  These are the largest boxes that amazon sells anymore.	1
These keep your snots in place!	1
Great	1
What can I say? They are Kleenex tissues.  Kudos that the don't disentergrate in the clothes washer if you forget one in your pocket.	1
Nice to have around the house.  Soft and absorbent.	1
Great.	1
Great price, quality and size.	1
they are kleenex -)	1
Great, soft, never have had a problem.	1
########	1
great deal	-1
Good	1
I get this every two months. Good buy.	1
ok	1
I got these because I can no longer find Puffs Plus Ultra Soft and Strong.  I was wary until I tried them.  They feel exactly like the previous Puffs I was using.  No Lotion, but very soft AND strong.  I have stopped looking for the Puffs since I got these.	1
As expected	1
as expected	1
School Supplies. Great deal.	1
My new favorite tissue!  These are very soft and the boxes are pretty.	1
Great tissue boxes. Not much else to say!	1
I was without a car and prime pantry worked out great for me. Prices were better then at the store.	1
always keep these handy, love the product.	1
PERFECT SIZE.	1
love these mints	1
This is a great way to purchase mints to stash everywhere.  I am a fan of altoids.  I love that they are a strong mint flavor.	1
Good price for great product	1
Yes, very nice.  Very, very nice.	1
I've been a fan for years. Small or regular great taste -they work!!	1
Perfect for my purse.	1
Love 'em and the tiny containers are fabulous.  What more is there to say?	1
The small size is perfect for small purses	1
This is my favorite mint - hands down. I needed them and when I saw them on Amazon for the price - I had to do it.	1
I went with the 2 lb package and I'm not gonna lie, it's a ton of Skittles!!!	1
Has equal parts of all the original favors.	1
yummy	1
Love these candies -	1
Great product! Fast shipping and delivery, as well very tasty!	1
I've ordered these before and are by far my favorite type of Skittles.........I call these my 'computer brain food".........	1
excellent	1
Yum	1
A good value	1
Grandkids love these! good bargain	1
fast delivery and arrived as described. Love Skittles and their combine-ability. Every flavor goes with every other flavor in a surprisingly versatile way. Very addicting for sure.	1
Skittles are great. Especially at this price.	1
Love skittles at any price.  So colorful and plan to put them in candy jar for a dessert buffet for a wedding!  Always one of the first to disappear!	1
Yum! And what a great price! Much most cost effective than buying it at the grocery store.	1
Great product	1
Good size!!	1
This bag is great for parties, teachers for treats or just a snack. It goes a long way.	1
Wonderful product	1
Love these	1
my grandson's favorite.  These didn't last long.	1
Skittles...son loves them!!	1
Yummy!	1
Great candy, good value	1
A huge fresh bag of skittles!! Good stuff!! Nice bag to bring to work to share :) packaged great!!	1
Wow! Awesome buy, and great snack for the Super Bowl given Marshawn Lynch being in the game! Was able to snag these with free Prime Pantry shipping due to a special going on, and I highly suggest snagging these if you can.	1
Love these small ones.	1
Best candy ever, so much better than having to open each one individually.	1
Nothing to like	-1
These where fun and easy to pop a few in your mouth and go.	1
Candy was stuck together eww I threw out the bag.	-1
tastes awesome very addicting, kids love them	1
Love this candy	1
yummy	1
Tasty but has a different texture.	1
Great snack	1
Nice not to unwrap the chews.	1
Great taste.	1
love the mini's	1
Daughter loves these as well.  Will be buying again and again	1
Yum!	1
stuck togethr	-1
I was disappointed in these.  They did not taste like the original ones at all.  I ended up throwing them away.	-1
odd texture  and flavor is off compared to full size starburst.. wouldn't order again.	-1
Tastes like the floor of the factory where it was made (Mexico). Does not remotely resemble Starburst original in taste or texture. I threw away the entire bag. Horrible.	-1
taste horrible nothing like a starburst taste like wax teeth we chewed on as kids , Seriously does not taste at all like original starburst !	-1
These Mega rolls are too mega! The roll is so big that it won't comfortably tear away for a sheet. This is a case of too big for the need.	-1
box was dented and smashed	-1
Yuck it smelled horrible	-1
I wish it actually worked. :( This is only effective for things that are fresh (i.e. within 10 min)  and not oil-based. You know, the same things you can just scrub out with regular soap and water. I bought this hoping it would provide a good way to treat stains on the go, making them easy to wash out when the item went in the laundry later. Nope. Worthless--literally does almost nothing. Also, this is the size of a sharpie--very small, and was empty after treating a half dozen stains, none of which it got out. Total waste of money, and I suggest you save yours. If someone discovers a stain remover that actually works,please let me know in the comments--seriously. I need one.	-1
I'm not a fan of this scent at all. I love Lavender Vanilla, but this scent isn't even close to the soft, subtle scent of lavender and vanilla; instead, it's a sickly sweet scent that doesn't fade throughout the day. As for performance, the dryer sheets do what they are meant to do.	-1
Did not work at all!	-1
I've tried it on two different stains, didn't do anything on either one.	-1
I have a medical condition called "dry eye" and have used Systane Ultra for years which gives me great relief without any problems. It was not available the last time I ordered so I tried Thera tears. Thera tears is terrible. It makes my eyes hurt and itch until I wash it out. My eyes cloud up for a time also. I tried it several times thinking that since it was a different product, it would start to feel good after awhile, not so. This is a product to avoid if you have dry eye.	-1
I finally figured out that all of these different brands of eye drops use the same bunch of ingredients. Some have more of one or less of another, some leave out one or add another. But they're all more or less the same. I was born with dry eyes but then had lasik and made it worse. Learned to live with that, but then had cataract surgery, and here we go again! Tried all kinds of drops, not just these. Almost all of them made me have to use more and more drops all day. In other words, irritated my eyes worse than they already were. A friend suggested that I try normal saline drops. It was a miracle! I started using them and immediately my need for eye drops lessened. Now I don't use anything but normal saline, and mostly first thing in the morning and in the evening when my eyes get tired. I'm happy to not be putting all these chemicals into my eyes anymore. Saline was the answer for me.	-1
Don't buy this you can get it for less.	-1
Leaves my eyes feeling like they have liquid Vaseline in them yet my eyes still feel dry beneath the coating. I finally threw it away after tiring of trying to wash it out of my eyes every morning.  I am searching for a better product for my eyes. Genteal Mild was the best but it was discontinued.	-1
didn't do a thing...didn't help at all sadly....the best lubricant for dry eyes is "clear eyes maximum"...i've bought 6 other products, none of which work but that one...don't waste your money on this one..	-1
Worked okay for only a few days and then started making my eyes hurt and turn red..and stay that way for hours.	-1
This product didin't work for me.  I'll stick with Icy Hot with Lidocaine, which works well for my pain.	-1
Neither me or my grand aunt could open it - so I took a mallet and smashed it open. - Be sure to open it up if you are giving it to someone who is in pain - I don't understand why it's so hard to open,	-1
This doesn't do what it's supposed to do.	-1
This arrived today.  I had been using Kush cream for severe itching and pain along my spine from nerve damage.  Kush is fantastic but it's also very expensive so when I saw this, thought I'd give it a try.  I was quite excited about trying it but got a nasty surprise instead.  Within an hour of my husband applying it up and down my spine and around my back , I started to feel kind of sick....strange...it's hard to explain....just didn't feel well at all.  We washed it off my back and I started sipping ginger ale for the feeling of nausea.  The feeling is slowing subsiding but I'll never try this again.  I'm returning it.	-1
I purchased this tub and the spray can. I honestly found this to be no more effective than the Aspercreme lotion (not the roll-on).  Also, I thought "Blue-Emu" was just a catchy name but nope, this whole Blue-Emu line has actual Emu (the bird) lard in each product. Ummm, needless to say, I won't be purchasing any of this again.	-1
Didn't work for my arthritis	-1
I try to use natural products as much as possible but this did not work at all. It is like putting on lotion but I needed something for pain not moisture :-(	-1
Not a favorite and didn't work well for me.	-1
The tops are ridiculously hard to twist off, I can't grab it because it's too small (my hands are not huge, either, actually they're smaller than average).  I noticed the change a while ago and that's when I stopped purchasing these.  Drinking water shouldn't be an aggravating experience, but with these tiny things it is.	-1
Has a label that says something like, filtered water from texas public water supply. I won't buy again.	-1
one of the bottle in the middle was open and half fill and the cap had been opened	-1
Good price but it tasted weird to me. Might have just been me though.	-1
weird taste to it	-1
The bottle are very thin and when I twist the top off they spill all over. Water just okay.	-1
Pure must be the owner's kids name. Cause this has a flavor unlike water. Perhaps it was distilled from their chocolate milk line. Very thin container.	-1
It arrived in perfect condition. I was hoping to like this water. The date wasn't old, but the added baking soda, calcium chloride, and magnesium sulphate give it an "off" and salty taste. Not refreshing. Felt thirstier afterwards.  Rather than return it I will use it to rinse my hair, which is better than our tap water here.  If Nestle' has a product with just water, I'll buy it.	-1
Besides Nestle continuing to collect water from drought-stricken areas out west, they added chemicals to this water!  Will never buy again.	-1
"Pure" life water.  "Purified" water... enhanced with "minerals" for taste.  It's water, and the taste is a vaguely salty aftertaste.  Says it contains "Purified water", calcium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium sulfate.  I wouldn't mind the weird ass chemicals if it didn't taste like salty garbage water.  It's really hard to screw up bottled water, but against all odds, with tremendous effort, Nestle succeeded there.  Coming from the company that put out&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nestle-Pure-Life-Splash-Water-Beverages-with-Natural-Fruit-Flavors-Lemon-16-9-ounce-plastic-bottles-Pack-of-6/dp/B00W4H8EJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nestle Pure Life Splash Water Beverages with Natural Fruit Flavors, Lemon 16.9-ounce plastic bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, a lemon water with absolutely no lemon and tons of artificial sweetener, I suspect they are on an active assault on basic flavor	-1
Source is fluoride water.  Wasn't expecting fluoride.	-1
As the CEO of Nestle has stated "Water shouldn't be a human right" I will be boycotting them and all products.	-1
I don't know what was wrong with these. My husband, dogs, and myself got sick.  We finally narrowed it down to the water since all of us were very sick.  Once we stopped feeding the dogs the water, we stopped drinking it... We were all better.  Very strange.	-1
If you want to go out in public and use this, DON'T.  It stinks and does not work.  Buyer beware, look at the ounces before you buy, if this smelled good, I'd feel more cheated.  Sorry Aveeno, but this is not a winner.	-1
I am SUCH a fan of Clear Shampoo, or as it used to be called Clean & Clear. Maybe this change is part of the reason I'm not so satisfied with this? Not the name change of course, but the fact that there's maybe a formula change as well?  The scent is odd. It has that typical medicinal smell that is in dandruff or scalp care shampoo, so I'm okay with that, but the cucumber on top of it makes a little strange.  It works. My scalp feels clean, but I don't love it. My daughter, who often has an itchy scalp, found that it wasn't a good fit for her oily/combination hair.	-1
The liquid globs together and a lot of it falls to the bottom of the shower when you try to lather. Smell is nice though.	-1
I'm missing the smell of the original Dove!	-1
I love Aussie Conditioner for shaving cream and ordered this shampoo by mistake, my daughter has used it a few times and her hair looks greasy afterwards.	-1
This shampoo makes my head itch and gives me noticeably more dandruffs, but it could just be me.	-1
The description on the product page seems to indicate that this is a two in one or all in one style shampoo and conditioner combo type product, but the instructions on the actual bottle say otherwise. The bottle states clearly to use the Clear Shampoo Total Care Shampoo with their Total Care Conditioner.  That's important, because using this shampoo alone left my long, thick and healthy hair feeling dryer than usual, tangled and looking like a giant puffy mushroom when I dried it. I had to use a spray on, leave in conditioner and do the "bad hair day pony tail". Not amused.  Using this with a regular conditioner was better, but not much. The shampoo itself smells nice - a light and airy coconut scent that isn't overwhelming. It lathers well and my hair is clean, but twice I've been forced to resort to the pony tail look and adding the extra leave in conditioner after my shower. This shampoo is definitely stripping moisture or something from my normally soft hair. I'll be returning to my Suave Moroccan Infusion. If you have short, straight hair it might be fine.	-1
Didn't like the scent	-1
Ok this used to be awesome!! It smells different now and no where near as thick as the older version. I loved the smell of THIS!! This new version blah!! Aussie please go back to the old version. Also this version did nothing for my hair absolutely nothing. It was like I used 89 cent V 05!! This is not for long course hair. May work better on fine hair.	-1
Used as directed but it made my hair feel really dry.	-1
I cut my hair right after I bought this but it seemed to work good	-1
no good for my hair.	-1
I HATE this conditioner. I remember using it years ago and being the perfect mask for deep conditioning. Now, it is heavy and just coats my hair leaving it limp and greasy. Don't waste your money - it's not the same 3 minute miracle you remember!	-1
I really want to love this conditioner, but it doesn't make my hair feel conditioned or smooth.  Will not rebuy.	-1
Lotion doesn't soak in well. Leaves a residue	-1
Is pretty greasy and smells like Grand Ma's house.	-1
Is moisturizing but i hate the smell	-1
Smells nice, does leave a residue and quickly dries out my skin.	-1
I did like this foot balm. I looked at the ingredients and thought it would be more moisturizing seemed to dry out my heels.	-1
Have to agree with other recent posters, this formula is weird and heavy, not absorbent, not creamy. No idea if this is how it's supposed to be? I remember using it years ago and it wasn't like this.	-1
I felt like trying something new, and decided on this here. I'm not impressed at all. I see nothing special about it, it's not particularly hydrating, and it makes your face feel GREASY! You know that feeling after you put a greasy lotion on like you're waiting for it to dry but it never does? That's what this feels like on your face. It literally made my skin feel greasy and dirty. So you think, ok, it's kind of a heavy cream type thing right? I mean ti does say intense hydration, yeah? Nope. It's not even that hydrating. I don't get it. So not only is it greasy and heavy but it doesn't even give you the benefits that usually come along with stuff like that. I at least gave it two stars because my face didn't explode or something so there's that I guess. But really, look elsewhere. "Yes To..." and "Jason" both make natural face lotions that are way better than this, if you're trying to go the natural route.	-1
It seems as though the product is changed...the consistancy and feel of the product on my face does not feel like the authentic burts bees night cream. I will not be buying any more products through Amazon as I am afraid the products are being tampered with....	-1
I have been using RoC products for eons and finally thought it is time to read the label.  What a disappointment. Petroleum by-products, glycols and parabens do not belong on anyone's skin.  Skin breathes. Dimethicone is the second ingredient listed - this smooths lines and wrinkles on contact (temporarily). The retinol is towards the end of the ingredient listing (companies must list in the order of concentration).  I am sad and will be moving on to another product sans the heavy chemical junk that harms every living thing and potentially causes cancer in both men and women.	-1
I usually like Biore products but was not the case here. I really didn't like the tingling effect (which is not even mentioned on the package and I wouldn't buy it if it was advertised) when i was washing my face. It almost felt like a burning sensation. It also didn't foam enough for my liking. And it definitely doesn't work with a spin face brush. It irritated my skin and made it very blotchy => returned.	-1
Maybe it's because I'm menopausal, but since I've started using this cleanser I've had more pimples than since I was in highschool. I have more breakouts than a pubescent beauty queen after a week long pageant filled with makeup and tears :(  I hate it. I'll never purchase it again. I feel like it gets the make up off, but I also feel like it's making me break out.	-1
has an odd "cookie dough" scent and not in a good way.  Very thick, hard to spread or lather up.  Got for my young son who is breaking out, but it still seems to irritate his skin.	-1
This was okay. Not the greatest .	-1
Sticky and smells weird. Something like coffee - I cannot really describe the smell. It is so sticky that I cannot rub it all over the area I put it on, it kind of just stays put.	-1
I have extremely dry skin, and I bought this thinking it might be as good as my old favorite that has been discontinued.  Nope.  Sure it cleans and smells nice, has a nice lather..... but it didn't hydrate my skin at all.	-1
I am a fan of Loreal but this leaves a film on my skin which I do not like at all. I am a minimalist when it comes to skin products and makeup. It does not feel good on my skin.	-1
Irritating to my skin. Needed 2 pads to remove just mascara. Slightly moist small round pads, not worth any price.	-1
Ineffective. Takes multiple wipes and a lot of effort to remove waterproof eye makeup. Save yourself a lot of time, hassle and money, and just buy some baby oil.	-1
So terribly over scented I ended up just using this product on my body. Look for something else.	-1
I bought this cream reading all the positive reviews .They were a few that said that it broke them out .So i thought y not give it a try. I have dry sensitive acne prone skin with  the occasional pimple that bursts out with stress climatic change etc.  The first day i used this cream my face felt hydrated and plump like a very very deep nourishing moisturizer.nothing else . I thought it stayed on my face for more than 24 hours . The next day i woke up with a cystic acne on my chin, i never get acne on my chin ever . And 2 days it flared up. Immediately stopped using it .  Will i recommend : Very good moisturizer plumps  hydrats as mentioned . If you apply before going to sleep you will wake up with hydrated skin.  But for people with sensitive skin run the other way . Causes pimples in places you have never got before.	-1
Soap turns mushy and messy after a few days in soap dish. Don't get half the bars use before I have to through it out.	-1
I am not a fan. It isn't water proof. But to such an extent that it just smudges and runs throughout the day. I look like I have a dark smokey eye by the end of a regular 8 hour shift at retail. My pencils don't smudge this much.	-1
I thought this was unscented, my mistake.  I don't like the smell, the oil is lighter than the unscented ones I've purchased in the past and overall, not great.	-1
I personally did not like it, but I am sure that there are people that would.	-1
Not worth it, doesn't do anything	-1
I don't know about this product. It leaves streaks behind.	-1
leaves streaks like it was made to.	-1
Maybe my container lost too much of the liquid in shipment. These wipes were very dry and I was only able to clean a very small area before needing to throw away.	-1
I bought these on sale since I was running out of windex. I decided to try the wipes, since I am a huge fan of Lysol wipes for the kitchen and bathroom. I was pretty disappointed in the streaks they left behind on my sliding glass door. While they are easy to use, streaks annoy me as much, if not more, than dirty windows. Not sure Id spend the money again since they do leave ugly streaks but for someone who wants clean but not perfectly clear windows or mirrors, these would work for you.	-1
I buy a lot of convenience-package cleaning products, in the hopes of convincing my kids to be a little more involved in keeping the house tidy. These glass wipes at first glance seemed like a good option for quickly cleaning bathroom mirrors, windows, and glass tabletops. True, it is easy and quick to grab a tub of wet wipes for those chores, but the quality of the work suffers for that convenience. This product leaves streaks and haze behind, which even very vigorous rubbing doesn't improve.  Two stars because this cleaner is probably OK for people who 1)hate cleaning generally, and 2)hate cleaning so much they don't mind if it's not done too well. I'm leaving this tub for the kids to finish off in their rooms where I don't have to be bothered by the streaks and haze.	-1
they work well enough if you finish with a good spritz of windex and use paper towel to remove the hazy residue	-1
Although this new beverage may taste great, Pepsi has yet to be held accountable for the deforestation taking place at their hands. Once the rainforests are destroyed, we can't magically bring them back. But, Pepsi can find a way to acquire sustainable Palm Oil not linked to deforestation. Animals such as the sumerian tiger, orangutans, and countless other species are being pushed to the brink of extinction by giants like Pepsi Co. Let's make sure that they know that enough is enough. It's time for Pepsi to truly lead the way and commit to only buying palm oil from 100% sustainable sources -- now.	-1
Something wrong with these.  I usually love Pepsi, it was always my cola choice when the rest of the house drank Diet Coke.  This purchase, however, was disappointing.  I don't know if it got hot, maybe it was old stock but it wasn't to my liking at all.  I left it out for the staff to find.  Hate complaining...The only reason it got the two stars is that the Prime Pantry is a real lifesaver sometimes, quick and painless, delivered right to my door.	-1
Bright neon green is the warning you get before buying this new formula. Take the previous mountain dew and add the flavor of chalk and a bit of child's play clay to create this flat soda. I had already switched the the "Throw Back" flavor when I wanted a treat. But at some places such as restaurants and machines, you can only find the basic Mtn. Dew. I noticed the colors on the package (the new green), but didn't know the formula was different until I took a swig. Worst thing to happen to the Mountain Dew since corn syrup. Now it isn't as good as the knock-off store brands, to me.	-1
What is PepsiCo doing monitoring the reviews?I will never ever buy again!	-1
this product will never be in my shopping kart again	-1

The flavor seems okay, but the aftertaste is awful. Especially when warm. Sierra Mist tasted better the last time I tried it. The aftertaste is bitter.	-1
Tastes a lot like diet. I use to love this pop, it reminded me of Amtrak trips where small cans were available for free if you had a sleeper. Now the pop does not taste that good anymore, probably because of that sucralose..	-1
Its not coke by any means!	-1
no comment	-1
last time I remember eating pepsi, it had 61g sugar per can.  this one had 40g sugar per can.  figured maybe with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup it would at least taste more palatable.  I grew up on cocaine cola but I don't believe in brand loyalty so I thought I would enjoy this.  it was atrocious, I guess the recipe for the drink is rotten at its foundation.  tasted a hell of a lot sweeter than coke equivalent (with 39g sugar per can) and gets flat more quickly	-1
This product said "real sugar" and all that poured out was a liquid.	-1
I wanted root beer, but Prime didn't have Barqs which is my preferred root beer. Barqs is a Coke product and apparently Amazon must only have a deal with Pepsi. Mug tastes too watery for me, it doesn't have that heavy caramel flavor. I've actually been forcing myself to drink through it because I don't like it. I've been cutting it with a good molasses-whiskey.	-1
WANTED DIET	-1
This doesn't taste like root beer very much. When I had it warm, there was not much of a root beer taste. When I tried it cold, it still didn't have that much of a root beer taste. The only good thing is that it has a mild bite when it's cold. Smells like root beer though.	-1

It has been brought to my attention that PepsiCo continues to use a chemical in Mountain Dew, brominated vegetable oil (BVO), that has been banned by the European Union, India, and Japan. In May 2014 PepsiCo said it would stop using BVO in its drinks. As of this date, it continues to use this chemical. I will stop purchasing Mountain Dew as long as this continues.	-1
Wrote the company and found out that the CEO doesn't feel worried at all about the radiation leaking from Fukushima into the northern Pacific where they get most of their tuna.  Today (4/7/15) it was just posted in the news that it was PROVEN that there is radiation just off the coast of Vancouver.  I don't recommend this tuna.	-1
I did NOT ever suspect these would be tiny, sharp shards to stab my gums between my teeth.  Drink down fast!	-1
Just didn't like the taste	-1
I was expecting these to be delightful and boy was I disappointed.  After watching an entire episode of Brooklyn Nine Nine and Terry Crews' character gaining 50lbs on these snacks, I was expecting them to be amazing.  Dark Chocolate is a family favorite and I've tried lots of different kinds--this is not in any way like chocolate.  It's horribly bitter, is so bad I didn't want to try a second piece, and then finishes off with a fermented after taste.  It's hard to describe the taste.  They look like little chocolate shavings and I can't imaging anything you would mix these with to make them palatable.	-1
Not edible straight from bag. Very acidic and bitter. Does not remind me of chocolate at all. Does not help curb chocolate cravings or satisfy sweet tooth.  The resealable bag is a joke. No matter how carefully I tried to open it, it ripped and cannot be resealed.  I was going to throw it away but decided to blend it (a couple nibs a day) into my breakfast protein and fruit smoothie. I cannot even taste that it's there but hopefully I am getting some antioxidant benefits from doing so.  Not sure I would buy this again.	-1
Ugh, these were so bitter. I really enjoy very dark chocolate, and I was hoping these would be a good snack, but I don't see how they would be edible unless they were mixed in with something very sweet.	-1
smashed	-1
Not impressed. I like Kettle Brand chips, but I did not dig this flavor. They tasted kind of bland.	-1
Great product but it was opened some in the Pantry box, and it got all over the other items in the box. So it was a small bottle to begin with for the amount of money you paid. Not worth getting besides being split all over every thing. It was not packaged in a bag. We were a little dissapointed.	-1
not enough chips in each container	-1
Buyer Beware!  This package actually contains 9 sets of plain Pringles, 6 Sour Cream and 3 Cheese.  The way they are stacked, and by use of the window cut (so you can see in the package), would have you believe there are 6 of each, very deceptive, and just plain unethical.  The manufacturer will probably reply, 'The counts of each type of chip are written on the side.'  Yeah, but your use of a window-cut display deters anyone from reading the side, and you know it.  Why would anyone read the side to know what's in the box if you think you're already looking at the contents of the box?  It's classic bait and switch.  This is clearly meant to deceive, people don't buy variety packs to get overwhelmingly plain chips, and you know it.  This makes me not trust you in general, and people need high trust in food manufacturers since we put their products into our bodies.  So good job, you got my sale this one time, but you've just cost yourselves dozens (or more) future Pringles purchases from me, and I am going to tell a lot of people about this, probably for decades, each time I see Pringles or if they come up in conversation, or anytime someone talks about unethical and deceptive business practices.  Send this review (and the other negative reviews on this site for this product) on to the 'hotshot' that thought deceiving customers to get a one-time purchase was a good idea, and please also send this to their boss.  You've bought so much ill-will from me and cost yourselves so many future Pringles purchases, and you did it so needlessly, all over saving yourselves a few cents... on just one sale!  Unbelievable.  I wish I read the reviews first, you've angered other customers as well, as should be expected with this product.	-1
Disgusting and stale	-1
You would expect there to be an even amount, but nope! Guess you got to read the description for even food these days. Apparently powder is too expensive for Kellogg's; Because there was only 3 cheddar, 6 sour cream, and NINE original.(I hate the original; Why do people like plain chips?)	-1
I should have read more reviews before buying.....I was disappointed to discover you don't get 6 of each flavor - you get 9 original, 6 sour cream and only 3 cheese flavors. I felt a bit cheated! Each little tub is convenient for carrying to work or school (occasionally!!), or even camping or outings. But each only contains about 12 chips. So you don't get much bang for your buck with these. Like most chip snacks they have their share of fat and salt, so the idea is not to knock off several at once - and it is not always easy to stop at one tub! Several of mine came with broken chips, which doesn't spoil the eating but makes getting them out of the little tubs tricky and messy. It would have been nice to have them all intact :( Overall I would opt for the larger tube of Pringles over these next time.	-1
5 of the containers were busted inside pack. Not edible. The rest were Ok.	-1
I didn't read how many of each there were, that's on me (most of them are regular), but they're sort of flavourless, and that's on the product.  They also came on the bottom of the pantry box and therefore the top row dug into the bottom row of chips and now I have a bunch of these that have a rip in the cover.	-1
did not last very long	-1
These are the wrong batteries for Solar.  They do not last.  You have to purchase the NiCd kind in order for them work.	-1
A big yucky mess. Made the wrong decision to use a bagless vacuum cleaner, my own fault I know, too clean it up and the powder got everywhere. Was impossible. Will never use a powder again	-1
leaves my dishes powdery... the liquid rinse is much better	-1
gave it away because I have no pets	-1
Doesn't do much for urine smell. Didn't even take stains out of the carpet completely.	-1
This product wasn't effective for my carpets. It created a funky white residue and didn't effectively remove the smell or stain. I would not recommend.	-1
I don't like this. Will not order again.	-1
leaves streaks, I prefer windex.	-1
I thought I was buying WINDEX....noting is as good :(	-1
Damaged in shipment but was able to transfer to a new bottle for usage.	-1
The smell is fine but it takes a lot more soap to clean than other brands.  It doesn't cut grease at all, and you have to use numerous squirts for one greasy pan and repeated washing.  My husband complained about this very thing the rare occasion he washed a dish.  The squirt thing is ok, but as soon as you get to the last couple inches, the squirter starts sputtering because it's coming out of the soap at the bottom of the container -  kind of inconvenient.  A regular squirt bottle works better for this application.  The bottle shape is unique and attractive.  Just not worth the money for the quality.	-1
Very bundlesome and hard to refill hand soap bottles. I had to transfer it to a large dishwashing liquid bottle to use to refill my containers.  Fragrance is extremely light.  Probably would not purchase again.	-1
Very goopy soap and drys skin out	-1
Usually I'm a big fan of Method products and citrus scents; not so much with this particular item. The smell is just ok, and the scent is a bit too strong and tends to linger on your hands for too long after washing.	-1
too acidic - wouldn't buy again	-1
Smells nice, but feels so heavy and thick	-1
Just tried this soap today .  As a soap I like the Method brand,  have been using the foaming  Waterfall and Hibiscus flower for awhile now.  I actually bought this for my grandmother, who likes fig and rhubarb.  She called me over to smell it . "What does that stuff smell like to you?" She asked me.  I put some in my hand and really didn't smell anything. When I washed my hands, it hand a strong  aftershave smell.  Like that of Old Spice.  The gel lathers very well and rinsed clean.  I wouldn't mind my man using this soap but,  my grandmother doesn't care to smell like aftershave and I have to agree. Won't be buying this for her again.	-1
Probably the worst scent from Method brand. It just is so overpowering. Very floral.	-1
Like all of the other Method products I've tried, it smells great, but doesn't do anything else.  I have not noticed any improvement in the surface of the table I've been using it on.	-1
of the wet product was missing. UPS driver advised me of complaint procedures	-1
Love the smell but it doesn't work properly	-1
The actual soap product was okay, it cleaned well without drying hands. However, it was thin and shot out of all of my soap dispensers wasting product. My biggest problem with this purchase was the size, it was pretty small in comparison to other similar products at that price point. If you do buy, however, pour slowly because it comes out fast!	-1
I love Method products, and have always purchased the refills for hand soap, dishwashing soap, detergent, etc. So I was really surprised and disappointed to find that this particular refill pouch appeared to have been watered down significantly! The consistency of the foaming hand wash was very different from what I'm used to, much thinner and more liquid, and produced far fewer bubbles/lather when washing the hands. What's going on, Method?  As a devoted customer, I would absolutely hate to see your quality go down in flames like this.	-1
This is watery garbage. I seriously regret purchasing and will not buy any of their products again.	-1
This body wash dries your skin out so bad!	-1
we use all Method products - they seem to either be top notch or 'what is it and what does it actually do?'. Doesn't leave a 'clean smell' as their other cleaners do ie abscence of less than fresh odors.	-1
I think the product probably works fine, but who can get past the smell long enough to find out!  I got the eucalyptus-mint, figuring that since I love both eucalyptus and mint, by default I'd love this.  I don't.  I don't love it at all.  I live in a board and care facility where housekeeping is a hit or miss deal, so I try to keep the common areas clean.  They don't supply nor encourage chemicals so I supply my own.  Three out of three caregivers had the same reaction as I..."what is that SMELL?"  I tried to fix it by adding a few drops of a really good peppermint extract.  To no avail.  The whole point is to leave the place nicer than I found it.  With this spritz I fail.  Please, do yourself a favor and try to get a sniff of this before you plunk down your hard earned cash.  I had such high hopes.	-1
I do not think it smells like what it says, its supposed to smell minty however smells like a bad sugar cookie.  It is not really cleaning the shower tile at all.  The only good part is it seems to keep the glass spot free.	-1
Smells nice..but no cleaning power. I wish I could return. I love method products, don't waste your money on this one.	-1
Leaves water marks down side of shower.  Product does not say to rinse product after use.... defeats the purpose.  Shower looks worse.	-1
Method missed the mark on this one.  I would say it works effectively, if you can get over the noxious plume that you create when you use it.  The scent is awful and in an enclosed shower/tub with a glass door, I haven't figured out a way to use it without being in the middle of the vapor cloud you give off when you use it.  Trying to use it up, but would definitely not order again.	-1
Left more scum and I did not see any improvement as far as the cleanliness of my shower. I think it may have made it worse.	-1
Didn't really notice a difference. Didn't care for the smell.	-1
We used this religiously until realizing the Methylisothiazolinone in the soap was causing skin problems for everyone in my household. It may be free and clear but includes this horrible chemical.	-1
I bought this to use in my existing Dial pumps since Amazon doesn't carry the Dial Gold refill in Prime Pantry and suggests this as a substitute. While the initial price is cheaper, the end cost is more expensive as it takes several pumps for each hand washing to get this soap to lather. I'll use about three pumps, but my kiddos get a handful. It also dries out my skin. I will say that the pouring spout is wonderful! There is no mess with this design and I wish other companies would incorporate it. It truly is superior. We bought the Free and Clear because of some allergies in our house and except for the issue of drying out my skin, we weren't disappointed on that end. So to review:  Pros: Excellent no mess pouring spout, no issues bothering allergies (Free and Clear version)  Cons: Takes multiple pumps to get a small lather, dries my skin  We clearly won't buy this again.	-1
a huge disappointent; pretty, but not very functional either as a gentle cleaner or for leaving a nice scent in the room ... have used Method products in the past, but trying out three new scents has been a disappointment. They Are pretty though...	-1
These bags are so small they won't fit over my usual 13 gallon recyclable trash can. The material is cheap plastic too.	-1
Extra strong brand. Bags.  Easy to poke holds in	-1
Hands-down, one of the weaker trash bags I have purchased.  While getting rid of "stuff" during preparing for a move, I purchased will over 200 trashbags.  These were among the biggest disappointments. Because of the woven design, the bags easily tore open when they were filled to the top. When I realized he couldn't handle any significant weight, I limited the contents.  Still, it didn't perform well. I used up the box, but will not be purchasing this again.	-1
Thought they would work better	-1
Pad are Too small	-1
Terrible batteries. I put 4 Duracells or Energizers in my low-voltage LED lantern and they will give me 15+ hours of reading time. 4 of these give me about 2 hours. Absolute garbage. Lesson learned: Duracell or Energizers. Everything else sucks (and yes, I've tried Costco and Rayovac--they all stink compared to the big 2).	-1
Not great; pretty flimsy & easy to tear.	-1
Meh. Cheap and weak. Only bought them to get free shipping.	-1
These have an odd burnt smell, and they tear easily. What a waste!	-1
Bought these on a whim. Now I know why they were so cheap. These are 3rd rate bags, even cheaper than Great Value bags. I won't buy these again.	-1
Makes a mess.not worth the effort.	-1
Awful! Size Small! Price awful!	-1
Leaves a greasy residue on the counter.	-1
Top wasn't screwed on tightly & ended up getting all over everything in my Prime Pantry Box.  Kuddos to Amazon Prime though - I didn't have to send it back for a refund.  I've bought several of this brand hand wash & most smell WONDERFUL.  This one, based on the smell of the Prime Pantry box, smelled less natural & more like cleaning supplies.	-1
I thought these were terrible but I haven't had anything else from Larabar either	-1
Not a good taste. Tastes sour and not at all like cookie dough. We can't even force ourselves to eat the rest.	-1
I just couldn't eat these. They just weren't edible at all.	-1
Strange flavor.  Will try another flavor next time.	-1
The picture of the product clearly states it is soy free, I was so excited to try these to find out after I opened the box that it didn't say it was soy free on the box... that's the only reason I bought these and I can't even eat them now, very disappointed.	-1
I couldn't even stomach one bite. Worst tasting bar ever!! I spit it out immediately.  Naturally, I had my roommate try it. She proceeded to spit it out as well. Neither of us are picky eaters by any means, this bar just tastes like crap.	-1
Weird aftertaste.	-1
IN WHAT SICK TWISTED HELL WAS THIS ABOMINATION CREATED?!?! LARA has not ONE TIME tasted the flavor known as "cookie dough."  I've heard that this is not one of their better flavors but i will never find out. Was a truly disgusting experience and i will be asking my taste-buds for forgiveness.	-1
not very good in flavor and texture.	-1
I didn't really like the Apple flavor :( But I have the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor every morning for breakfast!	-1
These ones are nasty. The blueberry muffins ones are amazing though	-1
yuk	-1
Nothing wrong with product but I do not like the texture, wife loves them.	-1
Love Apple snack bar but these were not what I expected.	-1
Apple pie flavor???? I didn't care for it and not as healthy as you think.	-1
What the.... this tasted like chewing up a multivitamin and old lawn clippings and I usually love natural and health foods	-1
Much more mushy than some of the other Lara Bars. And it tastes HORRID after coffee!!	-1
its ingred list showed [some sort of] nuts, but i expected to be able to pick around them. The nuts are all ground up and throughout the bar so you can't avoid them. Would be much better with no nuts at all. I do not like it at all.	-1
These simply aren't what I've come to expect from Lara.  I do not recommend, Thoug I highly recommend several of her other flavors.  I started to put one star on these, but upgraded it to 2 due to my respect for this company.	-1
Not good: in texture nor flavor	-1
awful.	-1
I don't like the blueberry muffin flavor :( But I have the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor every morning for breakfast!	-1
Horrible 1 was missing from box, the rest were not edible!	-1
Not good very chewy and doesn't taste like blueberries at all	-1
not so good	-1
I appreciate General Mills for trying.... This was sadly - one of the worst snacks I have ever eaten. Maybe it was ruined during shipping? Was a weird tacky texture that did not taste good.. held my nose to get it down. I will never buy this again.	-1
did not like, it was like jelly with oatmeal in it	-1
Just don't like them.	-1
Sorry, didn't like the taste or looks. Reminded me of a chewy brownie wanna-be the color of the three I looked at a dark color. There wasn't enough fruit in them to make a difference in the flavor all that much. I threw all away.	-1
I bought three of these, different flavors. They are all similar in looks i.e. chewy browning type and mostly taste the same. I didn't like.	-1
I eat a lot of cereal/energy bars. I am giving away the rest of the package after barely being able to eat one. The texture is very weird. It is dense and mushy at the same time and it is way too sweet for me.	-1
It was something to munch on.	-1
I just couldn't eat these. They just weren't edible at all.	-1
Tastes more like dates than anything. Way too sweet	-1
Bland & relatively Unhealthy. Both myself and another family member remain Unimpressed. Since new management, quality has fallen greatly.....	-1
Terrible taste.	-1
Very small! Not really a bar at all! The taste isn't that great either. Way overpriced.	-1
I love the taste of these bars. But they are ridiculously small.  Two bites. Literally. Every time I ate one I would remember how each bite costs sixty cents.	-1
Would not buy again. Smells nice but leaves streaks on every surface I tried it on especially mirrors and stainless. Also nozzle broke of first time I dropped it on the floor	-1
It's OK	-1
Smells awful and causes me a rash.	-1
Cooking this product was infuriating because they nested together then stuck together and crated large lumps of hard in edible junk. I usually love Barilla products.	-1
Worst Barilla ever. We make a pasta dish with gravy, ground beef, spices and pasta. Normally we use shells but we wanted to try something different and picked this Orecchiette to try. Barilla has been our go to brand for years but this was awful. The domes stack together, stick together and come out undercooked. We stirred, vigorously, numerous times during the cooking process and they still stuck together in large numbers. The meal was edible but it wasn't great and we definitely won't buy this style pasta again. Very disappointed.	-1
Although excellent dried pasta, this shape is too small to be useful - give me rigatoni every time.	-1
too expensive for the product  probably will not reorder	-1
We love peanut M&M's, every so often I will pick up a bag when I find them at a good price.  This time we received a bad bag, so I was a bit disappointed. There were so many broken M&M's in this bag, and  quite a few naked peanuts in the bag (no candy shell or chocolate).  M&M's  were missing peanuts, and some peanuts had a horrible taste. It's as if the company scraped up whatever was left in the bottom of the bin and bagged it up for sale. I have received these before from Amazon and they were fresh, looked good, and tasted great.	-1
box was way to big. allot of the pretzels were broken.	-1
What isn't ultimately apparent here in the advertising is the size of the individual packages ..... these are less than half the size you are used to seeing in the store displays ...... cheap you say? .... yes because you are getting a bunch of sample size packages ....	-1
When these arrived the expiration date showed I had only 4 days to eat all three huge bags filled with a lot of tiny bags. I bought these for my grandchildren	-1
If you see that there are different flavors. IT IS A LIE LIE LIE LIE  If you read different shapes it is fact.  Myself I read different flavors and shapes. We wanted the flavors.  BUT there are only different shapes. What a REAL rip to my taste buds. I change stars to don't like because they are not what i was led to believed  to be ordering. With all said and done.  I do like there pretzels.	-1
SO DISAPPOINTED, I bought this bag because it listed flavors we love.... now I have 22 packs of regular pretzels in different shapes and no one wants them.  I only ordered because it listed the flavors.  Amazon needs to correct this as I am not the only one deceived by the description.  I already have a big bag of plain pretzels that no one is eating.	-1
There is some weird taste to prime pantry. It taste almost expired. Sad and waste of money.	-1
2 thick n dry	-1
As so often, this product has tons of fake, paid-for 5-star reviews. Many are lazy and say nothing much. You can't write much when you get paid by volume. Some just write "Five stars" or "Yum."  As for Nutella, I won a free sample at my local Vons grocery store in Santa Monica. I wouldn't have bought it myself.  I expected this "hazelnut spread" to be similar to peanut butter. I hoped it had some&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/health-benefits-associated-with-nuts/dp/1583330119/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">health benefits associated with nuts</a>. But it was NOT to be. This is PUDDING! It looks and tastes just like chocolate pudding. Yeah, maybe with a hint of hazelnut. But this is pudding.  This is loaded with calories. 200 calories per serving (along with 23g of carbs, and 21g of sugar, and 12g of fat). My 13 oz jar of Nutella has 10 servings, making for 2,000 calories. This larger 26.5 oz jar would have over 4,000 calories.  As with most JUNK FOOD, a tiny portion contains many calories. Unfortunately, it also tastes great, encouraging overindulgence. People will buy a sack of potato chips or tub of ice cream, and devour it in one sitting. If you eat half of this 26.5 oz jar of Nutella, and spread it on bread, that would be half of your entire recommended daily calorie intake. No wonder Americans are increasingly OBESE.  This is great-tasting JUNK FOOD. Lots of sugar and carbs. So if you're goal is to raise&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/obese-children/dp/B01CZDZKH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">obese children</a>&nbsp;-- who are&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/diabetic/dp/B000FCJZIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">diabetic</a>&nbsp;to boot! -- then go ahead and buy this for your family, and stuff yourselves silly.	-1
we will not purchase Nutella again because of the products preservatives  in it.  We made our own with filberts nuts, easy to do..	-1
Was a bit disappointed .  Not as expected .	-1
Recieved one not 2	-1
I wouldn't call this solid tuna. Not even chunk. It's light, so probably albacore, but it's scraps. Certainly not solid. I am so angry right now. I am sitting on 8 cans of this garbage!	-1
Not the best "solid white", very fishy and rather unpleasant!	-1
I am not a fan of Tuna Fish.  Should not have purchased this product.	-1
I couldn't get the water to drain for anything. Ended up exploding tuna water and chucks all over myself. Fed it to dogs for a snack because I don't want to eat soggy Tuna sandwiches.	-1
the tuna was mushy (no chunks, just tuna mush saturated with water) and really difficult to strain.	-1
I guarantee that when you open a can you will be totally grossed out with the mushy, watery mess you find inside.  I've seen cat food that looks more edible.  I am not exaggerating when I say it looks like something someone threw up.  You can't even disguise this mess with mayo, hard boiled eggs or relish.  Check out my photo (trust me the photo looks better the real deal and that's saying a lot), do you see any chunks?  Buyer beware!	-1
I may have gotten cans that are mislabeled, because it is not chunk tuna.  I ordered two of these packages, and they were all more like ground tuna, very weird.  It was like a mush.  I feed it to my dog, and he loves it.  Won't be buying this again.	-1
Mushy, I didn't like it	-1
Had a bad taste	-1
This is a can of tuna mush. Where most canned tuna (at least the generic I usually buy) has recognizable flaked meat in it in almost a filet, this is just watery mush. After squeezing the water out, less than half the volume remained. Absolutely terrible quality and a horrible value.	-1
Terrible look and taste. I have seen open cans of cat food that look a whole lot tastier!  Awful MUSH describes it perfectly	-1
Looked like mulched tuna, not chunk tuna.  I could not serve this to my family.	-1
Think I got some Escolar here - wasn't tuna. Did horrible things to my digestive tract.	-1
Mushy and had a little "tin can" taste and smell.  Hardly tasted like tuna.	-1
Did not meet expectations. The content of the can is about 20 to 25 percent mush (bits and pieces and broth) used as filler covering the large pieces of solid albacore I suspect to reach the stated package weight. So, more accurately this product contains solid and chunk tuna, which is not what I thought I was selecting when I purchased this product.  Also, most of the flavor seemed to come from the broth rather than the tuna, which was a little fishy but mostly flat. Product of Thailand, the cans arrived in perfect condition and the expiration date on the package I received is 32 months in the future. It is edible but I won't buy again.	-1
Disappointing compared with Starkist or even Bumblebee	-1
I can't believe I ordered this tuna AGAIN...without realizing it......horrible, just horrible tasting and the liquid contents looks like a solution of some kind of liquid with an oily substance to it.  Sick to my stomach!!  Genova i horrible!!!	-1
Something on the verge of tainted here. It is eitehr bad storage or bad product to begin with. INEDIBLE,smelly,bad tasting after years of eating this line never again	-1
I love sushi. And I usually buy white albacore in water, Wegman's brand... which is tasty and solid. This stuff reminded me of the cheap oily tuna my mom used to make sandwiches for school with. It's not gourmet, it's marketed to attract the "fast foodie" crowd... hipsters whose parents didn't have to buy cheap cans of oily shreds. No solid pieces in this, I doubt highly that this is olive oil, also. It's oil, alright. This was a return to crap canned tuna from childhood (I wouldn't eat this again just like I avoid things like "chicken roll" or "olive loaf"...). I tossed it, not even bothering to pawn it off on my cats, who would eat it and I'd have to deal with the litterbox after. AVOID THIS HIPSTER PACKAGING. Buy a 89 cent tuna in oil cheapo brand and it will taste exactly the same.	-1
I think the quality of food was fine but the taste was not up to par. This was bland. Recommend the channa masala over this one.	-1
Ok, but more a snack than a meal, mini or otherwise. Higher protein than other crunchy snacks, so pretty good in that way, but not very tasty.	-1
come in under the search for VEGAN snacks in Prime Pantry...they are not Vegan.	-1
I tried. I really did. These are hideous. My newly college graduated nephew thought they were terrible too, but as a broke youngun' he took them off my hands!! I really wanted to like these so that I could have a healthy boost of protein to manage my blood sugar and stay slim, but they really are unbearable - I'd rather eat nothing or a rice cake.	-1
A real waste of my money.  Boring, very little flavor	-1
My husband and kids HATED these. I was okay with them...until halfway through the bag. It started tasting gummy.	-1
I did not realize this was part of a diet program - it seems to be some sort of lose weight in a few weeks thing and that said - it might be fine for it's intended purpose. But I just wanted a high protein snack to replace the chips and cookies I love but don't need. I wanted to like them - I tried - and they are NOT flavorless like some reviews said - they have plenty of flavor but the flavor is awful! Truly. And if you can get past the awful flavor you have to deal with the chalky / gritty texture. I give them two stars for a great idea - but they failed in every other way. Sorry Kay's Naturals.	-1
Taste of most of these flavors are crunchy cardboard... the cereal flavors are all delicious but the rest are eh!	-1
I really didn't appreciate the size of these bars when I read the description, so I'll give you some context to keep you from making the same mistake:  If you take one of these mini snacks and fold it in half, it will be just about the same size as one of those "Fun Size" Snickers bars that come in bags for Halloween.  You may also notice these snack bars are also about the same price as one of those bags ($4 - $5 as of this writing), but instead of 30 bite-sized candies you get 6. You may also get an added helping of bitterness and resentment, but your mileage may vary.  I would not recommend these for preventing a sugar crash either because they're designed to burn off carbs slowly.  Honestly, you're better off spending $5 on a package of sugar tabs and a bag of oranges.	-1
So, these are "diabetic" right? So why did you take a TINY little bite size candy and call it a snack bar...even a mini snack is larger than this....and then have 19grams of carbs?!?! This is only diabetic friendly because it is so tiny I can eat a full sized Clif bar and only double the carbs. Yes, calories skyrocket, but lets be honest here...most diabetics don't care much about calories since the carb reduction tends to take care of that for you.  So, since I see that the carbs are sky-high for such a tiny little thing, I expected nice and real flavor. Instead I get chalky and nasty, like most diabetic food. So We gained only in a small 80 calories. We taste a nasty snack. We get MORE carbs than a larger and tastier fun sized snickers bar (9grams).  Yes, you read that correctly. It has MORE THAN DOUBLE the carbs of the larger, better tasting, non-diabetic snack! Heck, a full size snickers, about 6 - 8 of these little things, has only 28grams! Where am I benefiting?  Do not buy.  It tastes terrible, it has more carbs than non-diabetic snacks, it is smaller, and it costs an insane amount compared to snickers.	-1
My husband said they don't taste good and aren't worth the money. They must not taste good because we don't really budget our money when it comes to groceries, and he is desperate for sweets.	-1
These were also mostly crushed those that were edible tasted fresh and good..	-1
Smashed, don't buy with ANYTHING heavy.	-1
These looked so good on TV but they weren't that great. The inside that I thought was soft fruit was two different flavor of hard gummy candy type things?	-1
I don't care for these at all. It is low grade chocolate around a not very tasty gummy fruit. Maybe it is the texture or combination, but these just don't taste good to me at all. I would rather eat a higher quality chocolate.	-1
Too much money for the price.	-1
Melted	-1
I love peanut butter cups but I was very disappointed when I received this and it was melted and smooshed. Sad face. It was packaged with my water. Very disappointed. And the only reason I kept it is because I love peanut butter cups, one of my guilty pleasures.	-1
Not as good as huggies brand  of wipes	-1
Only because I thought I ordered an adult soap. :(	-1
Disappointed.  Tastes more like artificial sweetener than chocolate.	-1
not was what i wanted but mistakes are made	-1
I just don't like the smell.	-1
Good grief, I haven't had a chance to try it, yet, as I have open gluten free food that I would finish, before opening a box of anything!	-1
she made this and it did not come out right, came out super hard no good,  she did just what the directions said and they were not good at all	-1
Normally love King Arthur GF products but not this one. Taste was good but does not rise with egg substitute	-1
Poor results with egg substitute, but no other brownie mix does well.	-1
the box came from the point of origin obviously infected with flour-beetles, because there were no any flour and grains in my pantry; i opened it a month later, and thus was unable to ask for refund. If you had bought this brand, watch out for flour beetles	-1
tore package	-1
Over priced for 14 ounce, instructions lack the proper liquids, a very dry mix, taste was missing.  As this was a test of scone mixes, I will not purchase this brand again.	-1
Well, if you don't know what scones are like, this isn't the flavor to try them. They look good on the box but I think the birds got the last two I made.	-1
I generally use Trader Joe or Honeyville Farms brand almond flour. I ordered this to see what it was like, even thought it was more expensive. The texture is ok for baking, but the flour was rancid when I opened it. I won't order it again.	-1
Arrived with tear in bag and oily from another product in prime pantry item.  Unusable, so I have no idea the quality of the product itself.	-1
ok	-1
They changed the ingredients, breaks easy, threw them away	-1
they were all broken and crumbling.	-1
Hard to eat, Grands could barely chew them. Not like homemade. Packaged well.	-1
The expiration was only three days away once delivered. The food product was dry and actually hard. We couldn't eat this and it wasn't allowed to be returned. This actually happened to MOST of the food items in my order. What a waste of money. It all went into the trash. So upset about this. I will never order food from online again.	-1
too sweet	-1
There is NO notification regarding GMO on the box. But Inside on each individually wrapped bar is a Tiny nearly impossible to read statement - "Produced with Genetic Engineering. " This line is found On the fold at the upper right hand corner on the back of the wrapper. To me this is an insidious ' bait & switch'.  This was a 16 Bars Value pack code SEPTEMBER 30  17  PMB72	-1
This stuff is like a dry piece of crap i actually had a different brand of this and it was good but this taste like gunk i don't know whats up with all the good reviews	-1
Tastes like shoe leather.	-1
I really wanna love this crap but holy hell did you know this isn't gluten free!??! I don't want to be a prima donna, but if I may, this crap is loaded with some funky glutens that I cannot eat. disclose it please. For the sake of modern plumbing and also my own plumbing.	-1
Dry, not good	-1
did not care for	-1
Disappointed. Weird texture and flavor	-1
very dry. not good or worth the calories. should just eat fresH fruit	-1
It leaks	-1
Ordered the wrong thing.	-1
I am just using this till they run out.  The fragrance is too much for me.	-1
Too strong of a perfume its smell	-1
I am sorry but odor is too strong but does work functionally as a trash bag.	-1
smallest trash bag i have ever seen.. i have never seen a trash can this size..  note to self  /...  go to Walmart so  u can SEE the size of the bag guess i can used them for the car!	-1
too small for average bathroom and small space trashcans....very thin	-1
Useless. The bags are packed improperly. You have to take them all out to get to a single bag. Also, the package is not resealable. That means the scent will escape, in time.	-1
a bit undersized for my can. Me no likey that.	-1
ok, but I don't care for the smell	-1
These things smell horrible like nasty chemicals and strong cleaner scent. They made the whole house stink.	-1
This product truly needs a LOT of work and redesign!  I first tried to use it today, and when I moved the dispenser to the first position, hardly any gel came out.  So I further pushed it to the second position, and too much came out, and fell into the toilet!  I tried to dispense the remainder of the product with what was left, and the gel went all over the dispenser, but didn't stick to the inside of the toilet.  I threw the product out in disgust, cursing the whole time, thinking "what a waste of money and time" this was!	-1
I did not find these to be helpful at all in keeping the toilet bowl clean plus they seem to turn into a big glob of goo in the tank which lasts lasts for several months and can aid in clogging the commode.  "The Works" makes a product that does keep the commode clean and the tablet slowly decreases in size until it is depleted over a period of several weeks, depending on how often the commode is flushed.	-1
spilled all over everything	-1
Not nearly as useful as the ultra.  I wouldn't buy it again.	-1
Note to self: buy the concentrated version. You'll use a lot of product to get your dishes clean. Don't be fooled by the low price. it does smell nice.	-1
Would rather have the concentrated one, It takes alot more to do the dishes	-1
Don't waste your money.  This seems to be a watered-down version of regular Dawn.  You have to use three times as much to get the job done.	-1
For a Dawn product, I am surprised at how gentle this is, which is great for your hands but not so much for the dishes. It's not the best at getting all of the grease off - I would rather wear gloves and use the stronger (blue) Dawn.	-1
smells nice but its watery suds do mnot last	-1
Just about worthless for cleaning greasy dishes and have to use twice as much.  Will never buy again.	-1
watered down	-1
This is OK, nothing special, get Dawn Ultra, there are a much better products in the Dawn Ultra line.	-1
Too watery	-1
I had tried these once before and because of the value price thought I would try again.  They are a pain in the neck to apply and if you make a mistake it is easy to waste one.  I will go back to the tank tablets.	-1
Total waste of money. They don't last more than 2 days. I will not buy them again.	-1
they don't stick well once applied very nice scent they need to revise the dispenser	-1
terrible.	-1
I wouldn't buy it again. The smell is far too strong and didn't really clean properly.	-1
These are weird little guys. For one, there's a LOT of plastic involved, which I hate and is the ultimate reason I won't be buying them again. Second, the 'stamp' doesn't last nearly as long as it claims to, and if you need to give your toilet a really good clean, you have to scrape off your stamp earlier than planned.	-1
Did the job!	-1
I picked this up on a deal and didn't think much about it at first, but I started noticing that I was putting in a lot more elbow grease than normal. I kept resorting to warm water. "Wow, this stuff really works great when you just add warm water," I thought. The next go-round I skipped out on the cleaner and went straight to the water. I knew that there was still bacteria everywhere, but my elbow leaked not a drop of grease. I've switched back to good ol' Johnson & Johnson. While I have issues with chemicals, I'd rather just use conventional products in moderation and have a clean house. I'm willing to bet a bottle of lemon juice concentrate would do just as good a job.	-1
I bought this foolishly last time I was at Target (I try to only go there once every 12-18months or so) because of a buy one get one free coupon... I'm hoping a grocer nearby will give credit for the one that will remain unopened-otherwise it's a literal four bucks and 1 gel tab down the drain. Within two hours my eyes were irritated, but I stupidly gave myself a little time and few flushes to see if it was only an initial blast of harsh chemicals. Nope-the entire bathroom and EVERYTHING in it STINK now, a mere half day into its supposed week.  Imagine a massively concentrated industrial toilet cleaner-or a mix of Irish Spring soap and Lysol bowl cleaner-and ponder whether you want it absolutely permeating every millimeter of some items... Shower curtain-not the end of the world. The actual sink&bath tub-I suppose showering is fine-washing the tub TWICE to soak seems a waste. How about toilet paper? We know where that goes-starting to get uncomfortable now. Feminine hygiene? Great, just the fragrance I always wanted there-toilet bowl disinfectant... Let's not forget the towels, ALL of them. Want to dry off with something smelling like that? What about washing and drying your face with stinky cloth? Your fancy soap now needs a rinse before using, sustainable, eh? Oh, what's that? My Q-tips&makeup brushes&sponges that while not used often aren't cheap...pity that pressed powder and blush isn't in an airtight container, too.  What REALLY drew my attention to how pervasive and bad the smell had become in so little time was my CAT. I have massive 54" tall body towels that I toss over her cat bed. They're naturally stored in the bathroom closet with all my bath-kitchen-hand towels and my cat howled-a TERRIFYING sound-and refused to lie on the towel despite initial happiness. I had to take a thankfully-bedroom-stored flannel sheet and plop down she went, happy sprawl achieved once she got over the shock of that horrid smell in her cat bed. No way am I going to leave it to permanently wreck my teak spa mat&likely even the shower head what with its grippy handle and the little rubber inserts. My bottles of shampoo&the like, my cotton pads, my medical tape&gauze, and again the absorbent items that touch my most delicate skin, from Kleenex to Kotex so to speak, reek! There's a LOT of laundry to do now, CLEAN laundry that I can't put so near my face with it stinking of hospital bathrooms--it's not so unlike that steri-clean soft-n-sure soap that hateful clinics use, the ones that want everyone to smell like they were made in a toxic chemistry lab to make nursing homes smell that special kind of bad stench! I'll stick with the smell that leaves with the second flush. This should DEFINITELY never be used in a house with kids or pets-bad enough exposing adults to it but airborne irritants are never good news&quite unkind to expose will-free kids&pets.	-1
the first dispenser was empty; and the second didn't had very little stuff in  it.  I sure would like you to replace them; as I didn't get to use them in my toilet.	-1
I know I like coffee on the milder side but this was disappointing because it was better even in made weak.  Perhaps that is to the liking of the people who buy it regularly?	-1
I had high hopes for this product.  I would have been willing to look past the girly applicator, if the product worked.  The product had to be reapplied every 10 minutes.  I have much cheaper lip balms that can outlast this one.  This is not a great product.	-1
This honestly made my lips crack up worse than before. I am going back to regular chapstick.	-1

The selection of teas is somewhat strange, and I didn't like most of them, although I love to try new teas. Also very pricey.	-1
All in all, I found this collection of tea unimpressive and I must say that I would not buy Numi organic tea in the future based on the flavors I've tried (almost all of them) in this variety pack.  The worst was something-or-other desert lime (immediately threw it out) and best probably Chocolate Pu-erh or the White Rose, which simply tasted *exactly* like jasmine tea, even though it does have a nice rosy scent.  All of the chai and rooibos varieties just left me wishing I had something by Tazo, Stash, or even Celestial Seasonings, with actual flavor.  No thanks...not impressed at all, even if I got some old stock it's just unacceptably flavorless tea.  I was honestly expecting to like this a lot and figured I'd want to buy at least two or three of these again in the future but that is not gonna happen.	-1
Sorry!  I have tried 1/2 of the box so far and still haven't acquired a taste for this tea.  It comes off as a thin dark chocolate with a funny aftertaste that stays with you.  I love chocolate even the dark bitter kind.  So this is a disappointment.  I find it a bit more palatable with 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.  Since I bought this to help weight control, adding the sugar is not a help.	-1
Bleh. Not the best tasting tea.	-1
Summary:  This is a pretty weak orange and cinnamon spice.  I did not like this and I would not buy this again or recommend it.  I am a big tea drinker and orange and spice is one of my favorite blends.  Being a Twinings fan in general, I was pretty excited when I am across this blend of orange and spice.  But I was sorely disappointed.  The flavor is very mild--even when you overbrew it--and the orange flavor is very week.  The cinnamon flavor also is muted, as it takes a back stage to the other spices included.  I have shared this tea with 2-3 other people, and neither enjoyed it.  If I was given this tea, not told what it was, and told to guess what it was, I would NEVER have guessed orange and spice.  The flavor is just weak and not characteristic.  Twinings tea is very good in general, but in my honest opinion this falls short.  I didn't give it one star because it was still drinkable, just not particularly tasteful.	-1
Sorry I didn't like the taste of this product!	-1
this is one brand of dish soap that is really good soap cleans really good on bad stuff pans.	-1
Much thinner than it was about 1 year ago for 2X. Used to be really great for cleaning pots and pans.  Have to use twice as much for any suds at all.	-1
Even w 2nd rinse, clothes come out stiff and stains still in tact. Although rated high by EWG, it contains 6 C-rated, 1 B-rated, and 3 A-rated ingredients. Going to try Better Life next which has most A's and couple B's with good reviews.	-1
It don't clean my clothes well.....	-1
They were okay, Not a very good balance with the chip and the chocolate, That could of been improved but definitely a nice treat overall.	-1
Didnt work for me	-1
Works good but costs as much as 2 spray new bottles. Whats the point of a refill at that price?	-1
If you like gummy candy, then this might be a good product for you.  It tastes like gummy candy because, basically, this is gummy candy with some added fish oil.  Unfortunately that means that these pack a fairly good sized wallop in terms of calories and grams of sugar.  Since the amount of Omega 3s per serving is not particularly high, I just don't find this a good choice of supplement for anyone looking to add Omega 3s to their diet.  You would be much better off eating a small piece of salmon (or some other food high in Omega 3s) so you could get not only more Omega 3s but also protein.  If you're a regular consumer of gummy candy anyway and don't eat much food that contains Omega 3s, then this would be a good substitute for your candy.  For anyone else, however, there are better ways to add Omega 3s to your diet.	-1
I tried them. My son tried them  My son's friend tried them. The verdict was the same; yuk. The vitamins may be good for you, but the taste isn't good. The texture isn't good either-the kids both thought they were nothing like gummy items they've eaten before. I can't recommend this product when no one here liked the taste or texture.	-1
Compared to my normal multivitamin, this is a pretty weak sister. You might need something in this format for kids, but this is positioned as an adult product. Just buy a better product and glug it down with water.	-1
No doubt about it, this is the way to go if you like looking forward to a vitamin that is delicious. I mean some kind of gummy brand anyway. They do taste really good.  Nothing like the vitamins of my youth that were candy like in funny shapes that still tasted...Well, like vitamins. Any adult would enjoy these.  However for me that is where the assets of these things end.  I won't even go into the ingredients and what is there or missing.  To me the high dosage of 6 of them per day is just way too high.  (Making this 180 count bottle only a 30 day supply).  And at over $35 at the time of this writing, its gotta be one of the most costly multivitamins of any kind on Amazon...But that is not the worst of it in my opinion...  By far what aggravates me the most out of these is you can't get them out of the bottle.  These are not gummie bear shaped, but little mounds like the old Dots candy.  With all the smooth edges they stick together something awful.  I mean even banging the bottle briskly on a hard surface loosens just a couple of them off the top.  Personally to get the dosage they recommend you have to bang the bottle hard constantly, (which is increasingly not working at all), or, stick a knife or some other object inside to break them apart. And this is a big bottle.  They are so sticky I am frankly surprised that its barely mentioned among the other reviews here.  I'll be finishing this bottle, but won't be ordering it again.  The taste and fun of them is lost on me having to excavate my dose every morning...: )	-1
Basic Jerky at a high price for what you get.	-1
Kids hated it. It smelled ok but tasted very bland.	-1
Doesn't really taste like Tootsie Rolls, light chocolate flavor	-1
FYI, these are 70 calories per cup, and only 10g of carbs.  So not a bad choice.  For those who care, these are gluten free. For me, this would be better if they added some more powdered milk or creamer.  It's very chocolate-y, but not rich.  It needs more milk flavor.  If I had any at work, I'd add coffee creamer.  However, if you are all about intense chocolate flavor, this may agree with you.  I prefer Land O Lakes cocoa.	-1
Didn't care for the taste, although others in my family liked it.	-1
Clogged cup EVERY TIME! Such a disappointment seeing this was the one I looked forward to the most between this, the Tootsie Roll, and Junior Mints. So far wasted 5 and haven't even been able to try the flavor. It starts for a few drips then stops. But I don't have this problem with any of the other dozen flavor/brands I've tried. Just junk...	-1
I do not like the flavor of this cocoa. The thin mint however, that one is amazing. I would say give that one a try if you don't mind mint.	-1
Far too weak!  I thought I'd take a chance just to see if The Donald could get something right.  Oh, dear.	-1
TASTE LIKE S***.......	-1
This is a decent cup of coffee but nothing special.	-1
AWESOME IDEA  These have a very good flavor, but I can't seem to get past the "artificial sweetener" after taste.  THERE ARE NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS LISTED ON THE PACKAGE, but I still taste something off.	-1
First ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. Not good for you, and the taste took some getting used to. I used a bit and threw the rest out. Come on, Kraft, you can do better than this!	-1
Read about 10 reviews before purchasing this product. Nothing floral about the scent, smells like chlorine pool which I don't even care about the smell. However the review that said it cleaned stainless appliances? No! What a streaking mess took me four tries plus stainless cleaner to get the film off. No good at cutting kitchen grease either. Saving it for the bathroom, at least it kills germs.	-1
Don't like the quick tie feature.	-1
though these are relatively strong the "handles" are not nearly as good as the drawstring kind..these do not grab the trash can and are constantly falling down when I add stuff to the trash. can't wait to use them up so I can buy the drawstring kind that grabs the trashcan.  would not recommend	-1
Not worth the money. Generic brands hold better. These are very thin and seems oddly shaped when trying to close. They also have a strange smell even thought they were not the scented type.	-1
seem smaller than other bags	-1
These bags do not hold up well, disappointing	-1
This stuff sprays a really fine mist which makes me feel as if it's killing my throat. It doesn't work nearly as well as actual bleach. The fellow next door said he's used it ... so I gave it to him.	-1
Not happy with this product.	-1
great deal	-1
Not as effective as advertised--!	-1
It works, but the smell is awful and this type of cleaner is very bad for the environment.	-1
Leaked all over the ENTIRE prime pantry box that was half food items. NOT impressed with shipping considerations. Won't be able to use much of this to test out the actual product.	-1
This is a rip off. The bottle was half full. What a waste of money.	-1
Trying to save money but I am going back to tide.	-1
Im disappointed, today, for the first time with my delivery.  I opened the box to find the cap on the detergent had not been tighten down before shipping. Not everything was damaged because thankfully it was a slow leak. The 3 boxes of Honey nut Cheerio were mush. I'm glad they have a sealed bag  on the inside so I just had to find a container to put them in. The other things were washable. I usually don't complain about little  stuff  but this, I had to say something so in the future the lids will be checked for tightness.	-1
I bought this because it was on sale and didn't heed my wife's warning: "You have to use so much that this isn't really a deal." I was determined to prove her wrong, but she was so absolutely right. I've had to double up the amount used with each load, so I effectively bought half as much detergent than I had bargained for. I'll be passing on Arm & Hammer detergent in the future.	-1
Don't like blue detergent........	-1
Just as another reviewer stated, it burned up my motor on my shark vacuum the first time we tried this. The motor was so hot, you could even touch it. So while it does seem to work by getting rid of odors, I don't recommend using your vacuum to suck it up. Maybe try sweeping it up with a broom?! I'm really at a loss for words. Super frustrated and disappointed to have to replace my expensive vacuum.	-1
WILL NEVER AGAIN ORDER WHEN PLACING A FOOD ORDER.....THIS BOTTLE LEAKED AND CONTAMIATED EVERY FOOD ITEM IN THE BOX.	-1
Clorox makes great products.  I was not impressed by this one.  I used it, let it sit and scrubbed  the area.  It did not have the cleaning power that I was expecting.  I will use the rest of the bottle.  I do not plan to repurchase.	-1
leaked into delivery box	-1
I received the product defective. It would have been better if someone inspected the shipments better to avoid issues like this.	-1
Doesn't even kill basic mold on my tub. No thanks	-1
Didn't work when I put black sweatpants with other dark colors. I'm sure they help though, I order them and will continue to do so.	-1
I missread this,  I thought it was cleaner with bleach but it doesn't contain bleach. If it isn't bleach it's not good enough for a bathroom, especially when that bathroom Belongs to two little boys!	-1
Updated from 5 star down to 1, simply because these are one use only. Unless you want wired particals and rust on your dishes etc. I figured out how to not waste these by cutting them into 4 pieces. But it's the hassle and I shouldn't have to!	-1
If you want a Snickers bar and expect full size peanuts, buy the full size version. The minis contain chopped/minced peanuts and do not pack anything more than a sugar kick w a hint of peanut flavor. Otherwise, the packaging was good and the product was fresh. I'm going to toss a bag in the freezer to see if that helps...	-1
Disappointed to find the pkg DID NOT CONTAIN ANY ALMOND.  Really?  Opened and proceeded to dig through and then pour out contents because I was in total disbelief. None. Not one.  Other flavors good as you would expect from snickers.  Really really not happy that this appears to be some sort of reject since it is missing a complete variety.	-1
Smelled unpleasant and had a bland flavor. Will not buy again.	-1
I love Wholesome Sweeteners and use many of their products. However, I wish I would have ignored all the rave reviews and listened to the person who called this "sugar syrup."  It's horrible. I don't even care that it doesn't taste like maple. I normally just use the Wegman's store brand pancake syrup and it's much better than this. Also, this has 63g of sugar per serving. No thanks!	-1
not for our family. expensive for what you get.	-1
I clicked on the large bottle.. when arrived I was not happy.. some of this looks like samples, they are so small	-1
When using this I didn't see any difference.	-1
This bottle is tiny.	-1
Didn't see any benefits to using this versus not using this. I use finish powerball tabs to do my cleaning and I noticed some spots from time to time on my glasses. I added this to help with that but it didn't seem to help at all - in fact sometimes it seems to make it worse. I think what works better if you get spots is making sure to run the hot water in the sink nearby until its hot before starting the wash and turning off any heated wash options. This doesn't seem to add any value to my washes so I just stopped using it.	-1
small bottle...smaller than i expected and smaller than big box stores normally carry	-1
Burned to the slow cooker	-1
I used it in a brand new slow cook pot and the bag leaves a plastic film on the crock surface. It makes me worry what might be going into my food!	-1
Check the size on these bad boys! I am not sure who has a crock pot small enough to fit these but it certainly isn't me.	-1
The concept is perfect- I loathe cleaning out my crock pot. It's heavy and awkward, plus the sides seem to have baked in food that only a brillo pad removes. So enter these bags, the perfect solution. I ordered several boxes of these with a pantry order. Our kitchen has been torn apart for major remodeling since November and my crock pot has seen heavy use. Unfortunately, I've averaged a 25% success rate with these. The other 75% have leaked before the meal was even done. You'd think this was no big deal but it makes the initial problem worse. The layer of liquid and juices from the food is very thin and burns down to a sticky, awful, burnt film very quickly. Removing the leaking liner is a huge mess. I have to have my husband hold the crock pot over the triple lined trash can so I can quickly remove the soggy mess and not leave a drip trail. This is before I've even served any food. Scrubbing that film off is worse than what I've had to scrub off without the liner. I gave this two stars because the 1 time in 4 this thing works it's great. The concept is the solution to a nagging problem and I think the product could one day be excellent and a regularly purchased item for me, but not in its current incarnation. Do better, Reynolds, this is a good idea. Meanwhile I'll slog through the remaining twelve liners in hopes of saving myself the hassle of three pot scrubbings.	-1
THICK HARD CRUST VERY LITTLE FILLING.	-1
Ours were out of date before the end of the month.	-1
Taste is not to good. Is not what I expected to be in taste.  Does in no way taste like Mothers Home Baked Apple Pie.	-1
I actually love these crunch Donettes; unfortunately the ones I received were not fresh.	-1
not much fruit in them. no contest to the original pies.	-1
Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, filling hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.	-1
very old , the taste was poor.	-1
Expired and wet.	-1
Too sweet	-1
Ordered four boxes...don't ask why!  Arrived old, stale and one box all pies were moldy. Another box had some moldy ones. Probably frozen in warehouse.. Filling was very dark...they were ruined, because didn't expire till 2017!	-1
Pies molded and rotten. Just barely within expiration date of July 06, 2016.	-1
Worst Apple pies I have ever had. Not like the old Hostess apple pies. Crust is very hard and the apple filling is like a gel rather than a nice sauce with apples. Plus these pies are so small, calling them mini is a stretch, they are more like micro mini. They are only about 1-1/2 maybe 2 x 2 inches. Very disappointed, so wanted to enjoy the Hostess Fruit Pies of yesteryear, not these.	-1
Rather dry and crumbly and lacked in taste. Hard to eat and difficult to swallow. Not worth the money or the trouble.	-1
I've always liked Hostess Fruit Pies and hadn't had one is years.  These are NOT what I remember.  They're much smaller (I was sort of expecting that), and the taste is "right."  Not sure what the problem is, but these were NOT good.  It was clear that the box had been dropped because every pie was squished on the same end, with the filling oozing out.  They were almost "greasy," too.  Very off-putting texture in the crust.  I ended up tossing the entire box.  Won't be buying these again.	-1
This was a disappointing purchase.  The boxes were all open and the pies were stale.  Will never buy again.	-1
these were dry cuz  they were too close to the expiration date. filling solid and dry. better at gas stations.	-1
Just plain gross in taste. Hostess has certainly changed their products.	-1
dry	-1
I thought about my childhood and was looking forward to a hostess pie...grossest thing I have bought in a LONG time...MOLDY and when I broke it in half it was a thick gel that made me want to throw up...so VERY, VERY gross!!!	-1
My son loves these when they come from the store in a bag, but he did not like these. He said they were dry and tasted old.	-1
Donuts arrived on Sept 30.  Expiration date is Oct 1.  Very unhappy!!!!  They do not taste fresh.	-1
Stale and expired. Avoid.	-1
Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.	-1
Horrible. ..stale	-1
I liked these when they were made by the real/original Hostess but the coating is distinctly greasier than they used to be.	-1
Shipment arrived and the chocolate coating had melted and they were all stuck together.	-1
Too sweet, must be refrigerated as well or it gets messy	-1
TOTALLY SMASHED!!!!!!	-1
could have been much fresher.  Go to your local grocery.	-1
yucky. go with the raspberry ones if you can.	-1
Ugh - I can't eat this stuff.	-1
Yuk	-1
Unlike the other brand of Danish I have tried it had a funny taste. Like the berries were over ripe or old?	-1
The product was old.	-1
Even worse than their cherry fruit pies I received the same day. Sure if doing a long stretch in prison these would be jail yard currency no doubt - both treats arrived with 2 week expiration date looming so gave them to a neighbor who did time. Perhaps all the positive reviews come from those who have been in total institutions as only then could I eat this dreck.	-1
They were not fresh.  They were moldy within a month.	-1
I never thought Iwould give a Hostess product a one star review! These are awful!  They have a funny sour smell when you open the box, fake berry I think.  The pastry isn't pastry anymore it is just like bread and not good bread at that. Where is the cream cheese? I would have given these a negitive 5 if I could! Bad! Bad! Bad!	-1
Product stalr, cream cheese was discolored. ..yeck	-1
pretty gross. texture is lacking. taste is bland. I didn't microwave it though so maybe that was my problem.	-1
arrive totally stale!	-1
Horrible...stale	-1
These seemed to taste just okay but were too plain and made my throat hurt. Of course, this could also be because they were expired. I seriously didn't expect Amazon to sell expired stuff but, oh well. Probably not buying again.	-1
stale,hard	-1
First, these things are huge! It took me a day to get through one. If you want something with A LOT of sugar, get these! It had too much sugar for my liking. I did like the little bit of cinnamon in the middle but it was not enough.  The best thing to do is pull off the desired amount and warm it up in the microwave. It really makes a difference if it is warm.  After one I gave one to a family member and had someone take them to work to give them out. They were just too sweet for me.	-1
Just didn't like them.  I think it was the texture.  I love Hostess powdered mini-donuts, but not these.	-1
Arrived with a next day expiration date.  The icing was hard and stale.  Tried salvaging it by heating for a few seconds but that didn't work.  Not the memory I was trying to conjure up from my youth.	-1
Way too sweet for me.	-1
the quality has declined on these so much I won't buy again. The size has shrunk to about and inch and a half high, they are litterally two bites and they're gone and I have a very small mouth opening, they changed everything about it for the worse, the top frosting is thin, the inside cream is stringy not at all like it used to be. These are a pale shadow of what they used to be. The generic copy brands now taste better and are bigger! Shame on you Hostess, where's your pride in your product?	-1
taste like fast food, leaves a lot to be desired.	-1
Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, filling hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.	-1
it was good as far as freshness and such but i personally didn't really like it and thus gave them away.	-1
I was a little disappointed with these coffee cakes.  I like cinnamon but these had too much.  I had baked apples to ear with the cakes and some great ice cream but even those additions didn't help that much.  Probably won't purchase again.	-1
These were out dated when I received them. Not nearly as good as I remember them.	-1
Eh. I like Ring Dings or the Little Debbie version much better. These kinda taste dry and less flavorful by comaprison	-1
My child loves Ding Dongs, but these cakes arrived stale and tasted like they were old.	-1
Disappointed in the taste--OUTDATED when received--another disappointment.	-1
Pinched on both ends, these were like little half moons or crescent moons rather than square on the end .The box was square, so the way these were pressed down on the end was clearly a factory thing. Not early in their life, but not past the sell-by date, there was nothing fresh about the taste. The Icing on top was like a flavorless piece of plastic. The icing and much of each piece of cake needed to be tossed in the trash. Won't order these again. Even though I like a treat sometimes, this is a good time to quit ordering this crap from Amazon. The price currently is not so great, so even if I felt like taking a chance, I won't waste my money on this Hostess junk.	-1
Dry and gross	-1
Who doesn't like HoHos ... seriously, they are low in fat, high protein, cure male pattern baldness, helps increase lean muscle mass and will give you the self confidence you need to get that raise at work. Seriously, keep telling yourself this while you're finishing of the box.  UPDATE: Ok, I should have quit while I was ahead. The re-order (ok I reordered 3x) were nasty! Old, stale, crushed... the expiration date has consistently been within 2 weeks of receipt so I can only imagine production date was several months back.	-1
They were very dry didn't t like	-1
Ugh - I can't eat this stuff.	-1
They were old.	-1
What a disappointment.  Dry and tasteless.  Not like when I was a kid.	-1
Cakes were crumbly for some reason, not what I usually get in my store for less price. I ordered them for convenience since I can no longer drive, but I won't be ordering these again any time soon. It's unusual,  too, because I generally love Hostess snacks	-1
Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, filling hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.	-1
great	-1
Stale	-1
H O R R I B L E !!!!  Just opened my $10 plus box of glazed donuts.  Ready to enjoy one BUT it is like putting a spoonful of sugar in your mouth.  I did not finish even one of the little 6 packs.  And I would never give these to a child.  Just give the kid a cup of sugar and a spoon.  A complete waste of money.  Going to talk with customer service now.  Save yourself, don't buy these.	-1
They are ok but the donuts leave a wax-like residue on my tongue.  Can go without.	-1
Not as good as I remember. There was hardly any chocolate coating, In fact, on most of them it was just chocolate sponge cake with a bit of chocolate drizzled on top. On top of that, the cakes tasted stale. Did not enjoy this at ALL!	-1
