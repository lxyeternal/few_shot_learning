Lovely.  Really enjoyed it.	1
Two gorgeous voices blending together for a most loved song.	1
The music is wonderful. I loved the music. the words were inspirational. It was easy to listen to. I can listen to this music over and over again	1
Love this duo, what amazing voices and such a beautiful song, gives me chills when I hear it. Have shared this with so many friends and they also love it.	1
Used as the theme to 'Charmed' this is a great funky mood setting song. Liked the series and this song just was haunting enough I had to go get it.	1
Buy it even if you only like this song by the smiths...its pretty much in every 80s movie ever. Its well written and very memorable.	1
...miss the show - love the tune...(and can anyone tell me WHY the 'winchester' boys from 'supernatural' have NOT gone to san fran to fight off evil demons with the 'halliwell' family???  i know this is totally off base for the review...had to tho!)  ;)	1
Awesome!	1
Classic.	1
Awesome!	1
Just one of so many tunes you just gotta have on your song list.  It is ok but I love it.	1
It 80's music what can i say. I love the group and the song. Worth every penny and i play it all the time.	1
Again I like the idea of picking out just the songs I enjoy.  It's a nice clean, clear sounding recording and It's where I can find it easily without having to put it away.	1
I'm not familiar with Brian McKnight but I was willing to purchase the MP3 with Josh given that this is one of my favorite songs.	1
This is a song for all time. The Foster/Groban team is exquisite and this performance is off of the chart. If you liked the original, you will like this...who wouldn't.	1
Josh Groban & Brian McKnight....Need I say more? Honestly I listen and wonder who else could have done any justice to this song after Art Garfunkel. What a pairing though. Truely was thought out. I think Brian McKnight Is probably the best choice to sing with Josh. David Foster has given us so much and this concert proves he's still giving. Honestly the 30 second you can hear In advance Is not enough to hear the splendor of this song fully sang by these two guys. That's what you don't know so If your on the edge of buying It...Do so as you will not regret It.	1
wonderful song	1
I can't even really put a review and post what I feel about this song. It's Enya. And at times her music is a reflection of heaven itself. Listen to it.	1
As always Enya's music is complex, moving and exactly right for Christmas time.  Thank you for a great sound - would highly recommend	1
Alright, do I even need to tell you why it's amazing? Enya is an amazing unique voice. Very like the Celtic style singers. She's amazing. O Come O Come Emmanuel is an amazing song, almost written for her to play with. She pulled of an amazing arrangement that is so perfect to the feeling, so inspiring you just want to listen to it over and over again.	1
Enya's version of this song is awesome! I love the way half of it is in Latin. Such an amazing voice!	1
Must buy! Enya has such a beautiful voice.  Everyone buying this will love it!  Such a relaxing and enjoyable song.	1
as always a wonderful voice echoing the most beautiful sounds in music.  thank you Enya for all of your calming and beautiful music you have shared with those of us who will never have the ability to sing as you do.  I know it took many years to perfect the ability to sing as you do. I used to be able to sing, not anywhere like you do but now because of illness i can not produce more than a few words in song.	1
Nickelback continues to produce hit after hit, and still pleasing mainstream rock listeners. That is very difficult to do, especially with so many club hits and hip hop hits. I praise Nickelback for keeping their style despite fame.  Vocals & instrumentals : A  Rocking and fluid combination of bass, guitar, and drums! Flawless as usual. Most of Nickelback's instrumentals are always top notch, especially if their lyrics are lacking. Here, as expected, their vocals  are pleasing to the ear. Passionate, ranged, and consistent.  Sing-ability : B+  Most of the lyrics are easy to sing along to, but there are only some sequences to follow along. The chorus is easy and fun to sing.  Lyrics : A  Despite some dark moments, the lyrics are generally very positive and optimistic about love. The main message of the song is that everybody has someone to love them.	1
It is such a shmae that a lot of artist rioight now are coming out with songs that feel like the acts are just shells of themselves from what they had made good a few years ago. That sadly has been with the case with Nickelback. After the well-driven hits from All The Right Reasons like Far Away and Saving Me, their latest single doesn't feel like it cuts the mustard. Gotta Be Somebody, the latest single from their latest record Dark Horse, doesn't feel like it is anything spectacular or different from before, which is a dissapointment. I was honestly hoping for something different from Chad Kroger and company, but it didn't strike the chords the way that Coldplay and U2 have shown recently. If there is a better song from Nickelback in the future, it should be sunnier than the dark horse.  Song: D	-1
This is one of the hottest bands on the planet.  Everything on the CD just works.  Not much new ground broken here, but a solid piece of work from first track to last.	1
what can I say ...but..love it	1
Love this song downloaded great didn't have any problems with it. I would recommend this song to anyone it is really good!	1
What can I say?  :)  Nickelback says it all!  But I wanna say there isn't a song that I don't like by them.  This particular song is one of their "love songs" and I LOVE it!  I'm a sucker for a good love song and this is a beautiful song.  Nickelback seems to be mostly rock n roll, but even so, this song is all about love and having Somebody that will be there for you and love you!  GREAT MUSIC!  Thank you!	1
This is a song that makes you want to get up and dance. It's a feel good song! I love this song.	1
My daughter introduced me to this band. If you liked 38 special back in the day you will like Nickelback.	1
this is the best song ever. Could nor expect any more from them. Love that I can download from home.	1
I really like downloading my songs to my cloud player.i get to listyen right away.i really love my cloud player	1
Good song	1
Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good.	1
Great Song	1
For my wife Renee!	1
Nickelback always does it well.	1
Love it.	1
Great song.  The remaster is excellent.  Really enjoyed finding it and adding it to my collection of music that has been lost over the years.	1
From the album Empire, ranked #21 on VH1s Greatest Power Ballads, reached #9 on Billboard Hot 100, #1 on Billboard Album Rock Tracks, and was Grammy-nominated for Best Rock Song.	1
As described.	1
Almost 25 years old, and still great. Metal is dead now. There aren't songs like this anymore.	1
Originally released in 1990 and nominated (not selected) for Best Rock Song (Grammy Awards), this song has transcended the years and now, in 2014, it is still amazing; ethereal, melodic, and wonderfully engineered.  Geoff Tates voice/delivery is simply flawless.  Composed by Chris DeGarmo (lead guitar), Silent Lucidity is dynamic and backed by an orchestra.  Silent Lucidity is originally from the album Empire; and is matched with numerous tracks of quality musicianship. (Silent Lucidity, Empire,  Best I Can, Della Brown, and Hand on Heart are my favs).  Enjoy.	1

nice job. thanks	1
This song is very upbeat. It has a fun vibe to it, and you will either be snapping your fingers or tapping your foot or dancing. If not, then you don't necessarily see yourself as a Beyonce fan.  If you have liked her upbeat numbers in the past, this one shall satisfy. I have liked it since the second listen and I'm not turning back. I have it as a ringtone and it's very fun and almost always gets me dancing or snapping my fingers as I sing along. :^)  4 stars.	1
yasss	1
5*	1
great dance tune.	1
Beyonc makes a good point with the song.  Great lyrics and meaning.	1
Great song!	1
After the Super Bowl nonsense I won't be buying any more of this talented ladies stuff but this song sure makes your toes tap. Such a talent such a shame.	1
Racist	-1
Put a ring on it!	1
Awesome	1
Even people who HATE Beyonc love this song! Makes even the worst dancers get up and move.	1
I put together 2 CDs for our 25th anniversary party.  I purchased single songs; not the entire album.	1
I love this Song. I still enjoy dancing to it !	1
Easy to download with free web archiving.	1
A Great Recording And At A Good Price!	1
Still awesome and best anthem for all the single ladies out there	1
Love this song, a Beyonc classic!	1
love good music	1
Very catchy tune, true message!	1
Awesome!!	1
THIS SONG IS AWESOME!!!!	1

Perfect song for the bouquet toss!	1
Love this song!	1
FUN! FUN! FUN!!!!	1

Good song and so true.	1
I have heard this song so many times I new I needed to buy it.  Best song ever by beyonce	1
great!	1
love this music if your into this kind of sound.  I would recommend it to others. wish they would come out with more like it.	1
This is a song for all women. If you're dating a guy make him put a ring on that finger and make it official!	1
I purchased music that I liked in order to lmearn how to download music to my smartphone and Kindle Fire.	1
This was the only song I liked on the album so this one the only one I downloaded on my Kindle	1
My oldest daughter loved this song so much when she was younger.  She learne the chorus by age two and the dance to go with it.  It still gets her dancing 2 yrs later.	1
How can one not put some pep into your step while working out.  The song makes me keep going when I want to hop off the treadmill.	1
Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!	1
I bought this song for my ipod touch. I love the song, every time I hear it , it make's me want to dance. The single ladies song was the anthem for all singles last summer . When I go to the club and this song comes on everybody goes on the dance floor. This is beyonce she could never do no wrong.	1
I don't use the word amazing very much but I saw Beyonce sing this song to a little girl who was very ill and I was captivated. It's great.	1
i would rather go to my backyard and eat one of my dog's turds than listen to this garbage! what a crappy, annoying song this is!	-1
I have always been kinda on the fence about Beyonce. Her music is okay but I never liked it enough to own a song until this one. My 20 month old son loves this song and video. I think all babies love the video according to youtube. I enjoy this peppy song during my workouts as it really makes me pick up the pace and shake my bon bon too. Would recommend this song for a energy pick me up and to excite babies.	1
Single Ladies (Beyonce) / B001KQFZWQ  This song is simply a must for anyone who has left a painful relationship with someone who just wasn't willing to commit... until they saw that someone *else* was interested in what they had. Beyonce, with her gorgeous voice and fantastic vocals, reiterates that if her ex had liked her so very much then he should have been willing to make a commitment at the time, rather than shopping around for the best 'deal' - and that reacting childishly when he realizes that another man wants what he discarded is ridiculous. I particularly like how the song stresses that this is not about the new man - there will be no fight to 'win' the lady back, because she's not a prize for two men to fight over. This is between her, and her ex, and she is telling him that he didn't want to commit, he wanted to shop around, so he should now sleep in the bed he made. Perfect.  Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.  ~ Ana Mardoll	1
One of the two best songs in my opinion.  Get the album, you won't be disappointed.	1
This is one of the best songs I think I have ever heard.  I just love it!  Get the album, Beyonce is great but her latest songs I think are her best.	1
Great song!	1
The beats on this one is off the chain. The lyrics and the best of the best with especially riding with the roof open and a good sound system.	1
Quick buying on the computer, downloading not so bad. Once again, issues getting to iTunes or Windows Media. But I think that's a computer bug.	1
many fun times jamming out to this song. I enjoy it and know other people have flashbacks to it also	1
If you like Snoop Dog then you don't need to be told that this is an essential for your collection.	1
Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.	1
I love their music and this cd did not disappoint. They are a great band that has been around for a while.	1
this is the best song ever. Could nor expect any more from them. Love that I can download from home.	1
Like that I can just download from amazon right to my phone. Always great quality. Lots of great songs to choose from.	1
One of my favorite Nickelback songs. Very empowering! The lyrics are well written and the music goes along with words beautifully.	1
IT IS A GREAT SONG AND I LOVE THE WHOLE ALBUM.  WILL BE BUYING MORE OF NICKELBACK. THE SINGER HAS A DIFFERENT SOUND AND IT IS VERY NICE.	1
Good cd.	1
GREAT!!	1
sexy and great music	1
Great Album!	1
one of my faves!!	1
Not as spectacular as I had hoped but good nonetheless.	1
if you don't like ENRIQUE don't buy it - if you ENRIQUE this is A MOST HAVE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED !!!	1
"Greatest Hits" by Enrique Iglesias showcase a range of diverse songs and duets. "Bailamos","Hero", "Be With You", "Rhythm Divine", "Could I Have This Kiss Forever" (duet with Whitney Houston), and "Not In Love" (featuring Kelis) are some of the catchy songs that feature on this cd. "Greatest Hits" by Enrique Iglesias is best for those who like greatest hits collections with a blend of dance and pop music.	1
Enrique is the best latin male artist ever. He has a sexy voice and sings from the heart! He puts his heart and soul into his songs. If your a fan, then you already have most of the songs that's on this album, but there is a few extras on it. "Away" is very heart felt sad song. Love the tone of the song. "Takin Back My Love" is a great pop song, with a good beat. It's a song that's about breaking up, but has you feeling sexy for some odd reason. This album has some of the best of Enrique's songs. Like "Addicted", "Somebody's Me", "Escape" "Bailamos" and the muched loved "Hero". It's a really good combination of his best, so buy it and enjoy!	1
He takes after his Daddy....he has several songs I really love!  Has a seductiveness I really love and enjoy listening to.	1
Its Nickelback. enough said.	1
Exactly what I was expecting it to be. I am happy with my purchase.	1
This sonG rocks you to the core!!!	1
I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?	1
A+ awesome!!	1
Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good.	1
this one smokes	1
great song !!	1
Great Workout Song. Love it!	1
WOW. Loved this song. If you like guitar and want a bar song, this is it.	1
Nickelback has it's critics, but this particular song I liked specifically.  Perfect theme for	1
Great song and an easy purchase!	1
Great great song, if you like the artist you will love love this song, one of there best songs ever.	1
I really like Nickelback. This is such a good song to get you amplified and hyped. I recommend you add it to your party playlist. I love listening to this song before I get ready to go out and have fun.	1
Who rocks harder than Nickelback? I downloaded this song because I listen to it weekly when WWE comes on.. so now I use it as a ringtone for my android phone.	1
LOVE the video! Go to full screen, turn the volume WAY up and crank up that sub!!  (Need to sell a Blu-Ray HD-1080 version of the video on here)  Three thumbs up on this song...	1
great rap	1
Of course I love it.  I just needed a copy.  I couldn't find my old one	1
I was so glad to see this song and I have been trying to find it for along time. I had to download this mp3 song and the download was fast, it sounds great.	1
Wanted to have a variety of music and what better choice than 2Pac!!!, I still like the old rappers better than the new stuff.	1
I like this artist and I wish he was still with us today, I do not own the cd and I wish someday to purchase the cd.	1
While Beyonce' has had a lot of hits, there are a lot of songs that she has had on her own, and with Destiny's Child that have been less than a entity for your music collection. Diva is definitely one of those lackluster songs. The third single from her 3rd album I Am Sasha Fierce, really fails to ignite a heart and soul appeal to her singnature style. The song is trying to show that she can rap and be the best of both worlds, like Mary J. Blige or Lil' Kim. While it feels she is trying to bring that side out which she borrowed from her husband, Jay-Z, she misses the beat by a longshot. This song is even lower than Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It), and much worse than If I Were A Boy. I hope that the next single from I Am Sasha Fierce feels more like a tiger, than feels timid like a sad pussycat.  Song: D-	-1
... is a female version of a hustler! Listen to this song doing cardio gets me so pumped up! For the diva in all of us!	1
decent club song b or her demon half sasha is telling everybody's she's a legend and a moneymaker please spare us this melosdrama.	-1
This joint friggin jams!!! Love me sun Calif love!! This is prolly my favorite tupac joint out of all his shizzie!! If Uv never heard or don't know who tupac is (or wuz), crawl out from under that bridge u live under get this joint!!!	1
"Halo" has to be one of THE most played songs on the radio these days but this time it's for good reason - it's addictive, it has good lyrics and it subtly draws one in.  Beyonc has been one to watch for a while because of her great vocals. And although she has released some mediocre songs in the past, I can attest that this one is not one of them.  This and "If I Were A Boy" are great tunes.  4.25 stars = B	1
Great vocals! She really shows her talent on this song. It has meaning, a story, great composure, a great beat. Only downside is it gets a bit repetitive and the ending seems to just drop off the edge.  For Beyonce: Just take off the glove and come back down to earth and make more good music.	1
When it honestly has came down to Beyonce', she has had so many different singles from her album I Am Sasha Fierce since it came out last year, actually 6 of them. Unfortunately, after her first single If I Were A Boy came out, it all felt like it fell down hill. That sadly is the case is her latest single from I Am Sasha Fierce. Sweet Dreams, the latest single from the album, doesn't really deliver the thrive and feeling that she had done from her earlier albums. I felt that this song wasn't really a definitive song. In fact it was a very weak dream to thrive on. I really think Beyonce' needs to find better songs to make all her own for her next album. The soulfulness she had been known for from her work, and with her Destiny's Child days just haven't been driven on this song.  Song: D	-1
When it honestly has came down to it, Beyonce' hasn't really been able to stride with a strong single in awhile. After a few dissapointing songs from I Am Sasha Fierce, it is hard to tell if she can really pull it off. That unfortunately is not the case with her latest single, Sweet Dreams, the 6th single from the album. The song tries going into a more dance rhythmic R&B style, but the feeling of the song just honestly hit the nail on the head. It just really wasn't a very strong song, and felt like it was just a bit too much of the same from her music as was the case with the lackluster Diva. I really hope Beyonce's next record doesn't have a song like this one that felt like it was a crash and burn.  Song: D	-1
Racist	-1
as it should be	1
Great song	1
Awesome	1
I love this song, I think it is one of Beyonce's best song. Her other songs are ok.  This is my favorite song of hers.  The words of this song has great meaning and it really touched me.  I can listen to this song everyday.	1
THIS SONG WAS VERY EROTIC WITHOUT BEING RAUNCHY IT BLEW ME AWAY WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS SONG IT WAS THE SONG THAT MADE ME FALL INL LOVE WITH BEYONCE. BECASE EVERYONE HAS X-RATED THOUGHTS .SHE IS SASHA FIERCE!!!	1
This os perhaps my favorite song of hers. Beyonce has always made great ryhthms to her songs. Thst beat was perfect I thought.	1
I love this song, it takes you to another place, time, world almost. It's so dark and sexy, and I love how one can interperate the lyrics. I always think. supernatural influence XD. But that's me.	1
The song has a great beat and I like listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics has a nice meaning to them.	1
"Sweet Dreams" by Beyonce first came into my awareness during the winter season of late 2009, when I was still living in Orlando, Florida. The song grew on me after I listened to it many times on the radio stations that were playing it.  I also enjoyed the video to this song and highly recommend it for those who may be undecided about purchasing the song.  It is a heartwarming love song and communicates a message of lasting love with the lyrics "Not Even Death Can Make Us Part".  Please know that my husband and I have a healthy partnership and that we both actually encourage each other to move on to the next realm whenever we both pass away.  It is just that from my subjective but humble perspective,the lyrics of "Not Even Death Can Make Us Part" symbolize a message of a powerful love that withstands any mortal challenges and only gets better. "Sweet Dreams" by Beyonce is great for either those who enjoy Beyonce's music and/or tracks containing musical hybrids of hip hop and dance.	1
This is a high energy song that helps during my workouts. My 20 month old son really likes the video.	1
beyonce is once again on her demon woershipping fantasies this time she dreams of being pocessed by satan way to go be or whoever you are nobody makes more songs about demons and cover it up like you do.	-1
this is a great song. It transports you .	1
love it	1
love this song	1
My favorite Beyonce song by far, the words are breathtaking and I still cry every time I listen to it.	1
One of the record love by Beyonce.	1
Perfect... Thanks!	1
Loved	1
I sing this one way too much too.	1
Beyonc is not my favorite but I do love this song.  If you only have one Beyonc song this is it.	1
I first heard this song on the radio and I fell in love with this song.  I hope Beyonc&eacute; will do more songs like this where you don't have to worry about the bad words in songs.	1
When it has came down to music lately, there honestly have been a lot of weaker songs that what really has delivered a few years ago on radio. For even superstars, they haven't even hit that nail on the head either. That honestly has shown a bit of tear for Beyonce'. Her latest single, Ego, the 5th single from her album I Am Sasha Fierce feels like it is honestly lukewarm, and honestly doesn't deliver the strength she had been known for from her previous songs from the album like If I Were A Boy and Single Ladies (Should've Put A Ring on It.) I really didn't feel the rhythm on this song from the album as strongly as it could've brought in. Hopefully, the next song she releases as a single can be better than what ego brought in the ring.  Song: D+	-1
I love Beyonce. She is so talented and beautiful and her songs always have as strong meanings which I can totally relate too..This is one of my favorite songs...	1
I still don't understand why I downloaded this song. I haven't heard it in a while and decided to listen to this again and it's pretty relaxing to listen to.	1
Wow, I am not a Beyonce song purchaser but when I heard this song, I decided to purchase it and I'm so happy I did.	1
I love to listen to this song when I can writing because I find it very inspiring. Nice music, not bad lyrics, and not a bad price.	1
I got this song because I liked Beyonce.  She didn't disappoint me.  Her song is inspiring and recommend it to everyone.	1
Not usually a huge fan of this artist, but I love this song and don't tire of it. It is so uplifting and whoever wrote it or helped write it was obviously coming from a place of real love and inspiration. A feel good song to go to when you need encouragement.	1
Beyonce seems to never do wrong.. even when you think her new work won't be as strong.	1
It has been 3 years since Beyonce' originally released her last album B'Day, and a lot has changed in her life. She got married to her longtime beau Jay-Z, and hard to believe her songs actually got better with age. That actually is true with her latest ballad If I Were A Boy, the first single from her 3rd album I Am... Sasha Fierce, is actually her most-heartfelt ballad yet. The song speaks a more meaningful message about learning from the heartaches and the losses of love, with understanding about what a woman wants, if was in a man's shoes, and the other way around. Unlike other songs she has recorded on her own, this is one that doesn't feel cheesy and flavor of the moment. I don't know why Beyonce' has made songs like this one in her solo efforts. Hopefully, there should be more to come from her like this.  Song: B	1
Thanks.	1
Wonderful Song!	1
Good!	1
Everything she does is awesome!!!!!	1
Loved	1
She hit on quite a concept here. Its a great perspective song and done very well. The engineering on it is excellent and just a beautiful song overall.	1
I love this song it is one of my favorites!! Listen to it all the time when the mood is right!	1
She's such a great role model. Aside from her multi-remarkable talents, she's a good person with good morals, she behaves, sets good examples, doesn't act like most other celebrities of all ages out there, and she's so beautiful too. She is a real person with awesome talent. Great songs as always.	1
My sister found this song a year ago and it is still one of my favorites.  I had never heard it from her before but it is such a heartfelt song and is on my favorite list.	1
love this music if your into this kind of sound.  I would recommend it to others. wish they would come out with more like it.	1
My mother introduced this song to me when I was really getting frustrated and I understood the song instantly. The song is about a girl who wishes she was a guy for one day because the guy is always putting himself first, using her for granted, always with another girl, and he knows his wife will wait for him. Women always put everyone first and themselves last and they always wait for him to come home. The song is from the girl's point of view of how the guy acts and how she wishes to be a boy for one day so that way her man gets a taste of his own medicine. This is an excellent song by Beyonce. Thanks mom for introducing this to me!!  ;)	1
She has an excellent voice, love her music. I would buy more songs in the future. I have a few or her songs, need to buy more songs.	1
Great song, easy purchase and use of just as quick and simple, not to mention great options to save on your computer with free back-up on Amazon...great place to buy from!	1
The lyrics are heartfelt, and hold a lot of meaning. Her voice, is spectacular. This is probably my favorite out of all of her songs. It packs a punch and really makes you sit up and listen.	1
I love Beyonce and this album is hot!! I downloaded it from you and I couldn't be happier.	1
good	1
Good song!	1
Awesome song makes you drive your twin turbo fast!	1
Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good.	1
As expected	1
Great Song	1
Gotta love Nickleback	1
Amazing!  Love it!	1
Great quality sound and playback, it was an awesome addition to my overall music collection.	1
Great Workout Song. Love it!	1
A good song. But then, I am partial to nickleback so I suppose this review is a little bias. Thanks	1
I just love their music in whatever music, lyrics they compose. They create some great music along with the lyrics.	1
I like this song because it is essentially about living a fulfilling life and not letting pettiness hold you back. Living as if you will be dead tomorrow.	1
This is a great CD and song. Everyone in the family loves listening, young to old. Great product, high quality and best part of all instant arrival.	1
My daughter played this song for me and now I am a nickleback fan! For me it is poetry set to music.	1
I usually only listen to gospel. This song played on Pandora and I was hooked. The lyrics gave me something to think about. Their singing style was an added bonus.	1
My dad really loves these guys and he was going crazy over this song so I decided to get it for him.	1
Amazing that such a rocker group that has questionable lyrics in other songs can produce such a memorable and inspirational song.  I love it.	1
Awesome music for a reasonable price without buying the whole album... what else can I say. Something to say about the digital age.	1
This song is so meaningful and this song also makes you want to turn up your speakers and rock n roll :)	1
"My best friend gave me the best advice He said each day's a gift and not a given right Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind And try to take the path less traveled by That first step you take is the longest stride"  "Against the grain should be a way of life What's worth the prize is always worth the fight Every second counts 'cause there's no second try So live like you'll never live it twice Don't take the free ride in your own life"  Wow, Nickeltrash. Think you've forced enough cliches in there? Hell, this song even made it into MSN's list of "Worst song lyrics ever" (although personally I think Photograph has worse but not by much).	-1
Fast Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fast Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Problems what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Enrique is one of the best crossover latin performers. I love this song and the video with Anna Kournikova is fantastic.	1
A haunting tune.  From the early Sixties.  I think she got play on both Country and Pop with this one.	1
I have always loved this song and was delighted to find it on Amazon. I can now enjoy it whenever I have the notion. Wonderful times we live in.	1
love being able to find old music. It is the same as I remember from listening to the old 45's.	1
Enjoyable but it doesn't quite sound as good as the version that I loved when it originally came out.	1
I have this song now thank you for this lovey song its one of my best on my cell phone now.	1
This song reminds me of what a great voice Harry Nilsson has.  I downloaded this song because it reminded me of when the movie "Midnight Cowboy" was the movie to see.  The song got played on the radio so much that you couldn't turn on the radio without hearing it.	1
Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!	1
This is my second favorite song from Harry and the sound quality is great. Very happy with purchase and would buy again if needed. I urge anybody considering purchase to listen to the sample clip first.	1
I was stoked to find a big collection of old music on Amazon. But as I listened to them I started noticing the tone was all wrong for 1950's recordings. So I played it again and found some of the songs I remember hearing from old records were definitely re-recorded for this collection. To me it's a waist of time to buy re-recordings of old songs unless it's A LIVE PERFORMANCE and CD's or mp3's should be clearly labeled as such! If you are looking to replace long lost records, forget this this album it has little to do with any of the music you remember.	-1
nice song	1
Love anything he sings, his voice is a classic one.	1
I ordered this song because i liked it. this is my obligated review. At least you get to sample the music like at the Virgin record store before you buy so i'm not sure if I could have a complaint...unless it's rap music, modern day rap then i wouldn't be purchasing it...just complaining	1
One of my most favorite songs!  It never gets old!	1
Please do not purchase this song. This is a horrible version and unfortunately I accidentally purchased it. The original by The Drifters is phenomenal. This, however, is awful.	-1
I finally have this song on my iPod and am glad to have it!  I always enjoyed these dramatic car crash songs and am enjoying it.	1
another one for the collection, pretty soon I will have thousands of songs, hope they are passed on to my kids, they brought me smiles	1
I couldn't find this song in other website but found it in amazon.com. It was for my wife and she liked it. So I'm happy with it too.	1
Great to hear music my older siblings used to play when I was five years old.	1
Brings back so many good memories, and a few of a broken heart. Danced all night to the oldies, and loved every minute of it.	1
Just what I wanted.	1
I grew up in the doowop era and enjoy istening to it now,I saw a clip of this group on a  TV show an downloaded it off of amazon.	1
I love it!!!  I love his voice.  What more can I say?  I've got to check into more of his music.	1
Play this long with "Everybody's Talkin'" and after awhile you'll wonder how you could be born into such a cruel world.  But wasn't it wonderful feeling sorry for yourself while singing along with these songs late at night in your lonely room?  Fond memories!	1
Cover of a Badfinger song, but Nilsson made it famous.  Don't really understand Amazon's pricing.  There's the same version of this song for two different prices.  This 99-cent version is just fine.	1
Downloaded this song to my Kindle with no problem. I also was able to download the song to my computer and then to an mp3 player.	1
I have a love-hate relationship with this song.  Although I have never been dumped, this song makes me sad and happy. This guys voice and the way he does this song is second to none.	1
Enjoy the song.	1
Best version of this song IMHO.	1
Love it!	1
Great song	1
Love it.	1
You just have to admit it is a great song. It is "moody" but it captures grief so well. Besides it brings back the old wild days of my youth.	1
good song	1
I always liked Harry's version better, even if he didn't write it.	1
Great album, would highly recommend to fans	1
There are newer versions done by more current artists, but NO version can touch Harry Nilsson's, which reaches right into your chest and grabs you by the heart.	1
I loved this guy, and I always wondered what happened to him.  His music was so soulful and sweet. He really was an excellent singer.	1
Can no longer download songs to my media player. I would not have purchased had I known.  Customer service was not able to help me, but they were very nice.  Have not played the music, any chance I could get a refund?	-1
This is the original hit. I do not care for the artists of today. I do not like when they take a great song like this and try to sing it. And I do mean try. They mess up the lyrics and they all sound alike. This guy sang with his own unique voice and style. This song is very haunting and beautiful. This is the only rendition of it worth listening to.	1
Jeremy Camp's is one of the great artists, and this song is one of my favorites!  Like to sing it too.  <3	1
I love Christian music and this is some of my favorite.  It truly makes my day more enjoyable.  I would recommend it.	1
I heard this song only one time and had it stuck in my head. I had to find it and buy it. Its a great song.	1
On July 23, my mother left her tired body here and went to be with Jesus.  20 days later our family experienced the loss of a 14 year old member.  This song powerfully reminds me that there is an end to these kinds of losses--that total redemption awaits.	1
A wonderful worship song to listen to over and over again	1
5 stars	1
xlint	1
What I buy here are songs I've heard on K-LOVE and made a note of to buy later when I got the financial opportunity. They're all a five star pick, to me, or I wouldn't buy them.	1
Love it! :D	1
beautiful song	1
Everything that I had expected, and more!	1
Great song!	1
love it	1
Great song	1
another wonderful song.	1
I enjoyed this song very much it's awesome I found it to be very encouraging helps us to remember what we have waiting for us	1
This is an awesome song with an awesome message!!! We need more music like this in the world, it would make it a much better place to live in!!!	1
I really like Jeremy's voice, he gets right to the heart of each message with the lyrics, and his tone just melts deep into my soul.	1
Very good song, hope this is a good one for the band, will have to listen some more to memorize.	1
Awesome song!!! A must listen to song. In fact all of Jeremy Camp`s song are great songs. I could listen to his music all day.	1
This song reminds me of the good ol days when my dad used to dj and he would be in the basement practicing. This was one of his favorite songs. It is now his ring tone everytime he calls.	1
good	1
It is pretty much what you would expect. Good sound quality.	1
Pleasant sounds.  What I had expected.	1
This is a soothing and meditative album/recording for such a decent price.  Definitely worth the money I paid for it.	1
This sound works perfectly to help me go to sleep.  I have always suffered from insomnia and with this I no longer lie awake for hours.	1
This particular recording of The Sound Of Summer Rain is just that. It sounds like an afternoon thunderstorm does, the soothing sound of rain with just the right sounds of thunder mixed in. And I did hear some gentle and light wind in the background as well.  This recording is perfect for any age even a small child because it is a gentle type of thunderstorm with gently claps of thunder, and does not sound scary like some I have heard with the sounds of thunder being overpowering. This one is PERFECT in my opinion.  **One more plus: This can easily be placed on a CD if you want to because a CD will hold up to 80 minutes of music and this is 73 minutes. So this way I you want to play this on a CD in your car or office for instance, you can place this music on the CD for that purpose!  Highly recommend!	1
See my other reviews at "Wind and Rain" This is my favorite of the four I downloaded. In future downloads I will emphasize babbling brooks and bird twittering more, since these sounds seem to work best for reading and relaxation. But, I like this one a lot. If your looking for a study aid (no college student should be without this recording, when studying for tomorrows big exam), I would recommend starting with this one.	1
I purchased this product, as well as 3 others, to help me fall asleep at night.  this is my favorite one, however.  As one other reviewer noted, it brings back memories of sitting on my front porch during a humid, yet refreshing, summer rain shower.  It works......I have no idea how it ends or when it ends because I am far away in sleepy land before the ending.  It's very much worth a try if you'd like some calming 'white noise' to fall asleep to.  I didn't need to buy 4 different rain/thunder products but I did and I don't regret it.  Pleasant dreams!	1
This is actual recording of the storm as it approaches, during time at that location and it's recession from the recording location.  Very high quality as well as nature background 'noise'  Great recording	1
dont know if summer rain sounds any different..I know it does feel different. This however sounded like rain and not like someone running a faucet at top volume. Listen to the samples and find what speaks to you.	1
How can you not love the sound of rain falling. Sometimes you need to take a rest from life's. businesses.  This was an absoulute delight. I look forward to purchasing more from the seller. The gentle.soft quietness is good for relaxing your mind and spirit.	1
Loved it so much I bought it twice!	1
I lived in New Orleans when it was popular and still love it strongly today. Anyone who likes music should have this one.	1
Good job.	1
GREAT MUSIC!!! WILL BUY MORE!!!	1
Nice an relaxing, I really like it	1
Relaxation	1
Relaxing, w/ distant thunder being just right for helping you fall asleep	1
I find the sounds soothing and enjoyable.	1
Really soothing. No problems downloading. I have always had success with the MP3 downloads and will continue to purchased from Amazon. Top quality.	1
I'm not quite sure what I am supposed to say. I downloaded the song and it is what it is.	1
I've heard several covers of Have I Told You Lately, and think that Rod Stewart sings it better.  Perhaps because in listening to him it makes me believe that he is actually singing it from the heart.  I got this one for my other half and she loved it;  I  scored several points.	1
Great tune	1
mom loves song	1
nice song	1
An older song, bought it for night club 2 steps, right tempo, romantic, perfect for the dance and great to listen to in the office.	1
Absolutely beautiful song and Rod Stewart does a fabulous job singing it. This is the way music was meant to be!!	1
I love using MP3 songs from Amazon as ringtones on my driod2.....hopefully this one will transfer when I upgrade later this summer.	1
I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music	1
Hubby and I both love the Zac Brown band. Listening to this now. Upbeat and a lot of fun. :-)	1
This song reminds me of the time when my kids where little and they were going back and forth between myself and there dads house. How tough it was for them back then.	1
Love his music	1
I love this song and Zak Brown band.	1
I downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition.  I like downloading the .mp3's from Amazon - the process is easy.  I like Zac Brown as a singer and a musician.	1
i love his music and video he just great the band is great hope they keep making great music xo	1
MP3 is typical Amazon quality. No bad spots. No fuzziness. Sound level is good. Do distortion if played loudly. Downloads without problems.	1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	1
Great Song!	1
Zac Brown's songs are awesome, and we love listening to all his recordings. You won't be disappointed by this one.	1
I thought this was my comments  but this thing requires a certain amount of words (20) to give feedback. Stupid!!! what do you think?	1
great sound quality, love song, glad I chose this site to purchase from, I recommend this to everyone. thanks for the service.	1
They are great hope they win more awards there music is great and it make you feel good that great	1
love this song it makes you feel like he is singing to you and just like every woman we want and hope to have whatever it is...lol	1
Yes, the words are inappropriate for kiddos.  I am not a kiddo, and eveytime I listen to this song it makes me smile.  I can so see myself in this setting - maybe just down on the Gulf Coast.  "Life is good"!	1
a+	1
Love this song	1
great	1
Beach and lake tunes!	1
One of my all time favorites	1
NEVER DOWNLOADED	-1
great	1

Once I figured out the title of this song, the rest was easy!	1
Love it!	1
Love this band!	1
Love this song!	1
fun dance song	1
Excellent	1
Lyrics just resonated wit me and music was good.	1
good music	1
LOVE IT	1
Living in sunny Florida as I do, I have sat just as described with my toes in the water, etc. I love this song: it makes me relax and smile.	1
Fantastic song that reminds me of the beach.  In the winter this song reminds New of summer sitting in the sun by the pool.	1
Don't we all wish we could be like Zac in the song, glad to be able to download songs to my Amazon 3 cloud account	1
This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.	1
This song has all the elements necessary to get you in a relaxed feel good mood. The lyrics are easy to sing along to as well.	1
The lyrics are a little non-sensical in places ("the plane brought me farther. . .?"); the whole second verse makes no sense at all (was he gone for 4 days or the whole summer?), but you can't overthink a song like this. So it's not the masterpiece that Margaritaville was - it's still a fun tune to play and sing.	1
A good song, that is great to sing along with. I recommend this song to everyone that likes a great country song!	1
When this first came out, the radio station I was listening to had the balls to play this original version. Then everyone started playing the edited version, which I don't like at all. If you like this song, buy this version.	1
This Is A Great After Work On A Friday Song, I Love The Lyrics, This Song Pretty Much Describes The American Working Class.	1
I now tell people to listen to this song when it's cold and snowing up north! You can't listen to it and not think sun & fun!	1
A good country song on my Sansa Fuze I enjoy every day as  I work. Enjoy these country songs. Love it	1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	1
I am so glad I downloaded Zac Browns Band "Toes"  from Amazon.  I have enjoyed listening to this song. Thanks	1
I love this song and video, listen to it over and over and wishing I was at beach instead of home/work.  Fun song !!	1
Heard this on the radio and began to relax while driving. Now I can listen to it at work when I start getting stressed. Great song.	1
One of his best songs.....	1
great	1
Great band, great artist, great music	1
I love this CD!  For a city girl!	1
I have heard this song on the radio forever and always loved it so I finally looked it up and bought it. It has made the favorites playlist that I listen to all the time. Just a simple and honest country song. I highly recommend it.	1
Love this band!	1
Hard to find a bad song by the ZBB. This one, however is one of their best, melody, harmony and a well written song.	1
They have some good songs and some not so good songs.  If you like his music, then buy it. If not, save your money.	1
This is a great song I like to listen to over and over. This band is awesome and all their songs rate five stars.	1
Love this one.  I don't think I've heard a bad song yet by Zac Brown Band.  Love them, for sure.	1
My wife and I really enjoy Zac Browns music, he and his band are really great. You can tell they enjoy what they are doing.	1
if you like zac brown band you will love this song i love there music it like there singing to you	1
MP3 is typical Amazon quality. No bad spots. No fuzziness. Sound level is good. Do distortion if played loudly. Downloads without problems.	1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	1
These boys make a county song a  blast to sing along with! The band puts the heart of county in their songs! It's a fun song!	1
Awesome music for a reasonable price without buying the whole album... what else can I say. Something to say about the digital age.	1
No problems with downloading this song.  Used it for a 75th Birthday memory compilation DVD.  It was very clear and fit the bill perfectly.	1
My husband and I absolutely loves this song!	1
Awesome!	1
great	1
It is ok.	1
Love this song	1
great	1
like this song !	1
I really have no idea what to say when rating a song besides how many stars I give it.  <sarcastic music professor> I feel the base lines smoothly supported the chorus and hit its crescendo during the 5 verse of the piece.  The tone of the lyrics adequately reflects modern rural values and perhaps idealistically portrays the sub culture's passions and overall ambitions without contributing to the socioeconomic degradation that is so often reflected in popular culture's media.  In short it provides a positive reinforcement to easily attainable stimuli for the proletariat.</sarcastic music professor>  Perhaps the artist could appeal to a more erudite audience by releasing a "baked chicken" version and a "pair of Ralph Lauren jeans that fits just right."  I know, I know that's redundant; all Ralph Lauren jeans fit just right.	1
Good song	1
Love the music. I love the way you can get the music from Amazon.	1
Good	1
I really do hate it, played out	-1
Good music	1
Classic!!!!	1

This song took a long time to grow on me, but now I absolutely love it.	1
love it	1
yup	1
Thx	1
good product	1
Downloaded fast and easy and sounds great. So much easier then buying the whole cd!	1
Excellent	1
I love this song. I enjoy all of Zac Brown Band's music. I can play it over & over.	1
good music	1
Perfect song for your 4th of July BBQ Mix Tape. Kick back and enjoy the good things in life!	1
Great product and fast shipping.	1
I am not a huge fan of country music but will say that I cheer right along with everyone else in the bar when this song is played. This is the PERFECT song for a warm summer night ... it hits just about everything you expect a country music song to talk about. This is pure and simple feel good music. Put this in your playlist and a party will become a PAAAARTY!	1
I really liked the tune on this one. The lyrics are somewhat sentimental but not too sappy and not too sweet. Definitely country but not too much "twang".	1
I've recently gotten into country - having shunned it for too long. But it took fusion artists like Zac Brown, Dwight Yoakam, Lyle Lovett, Big Al Anderson, Vince Gill, to ease me into the genre. The Zac Brown Band is deep - deep into rock, deep into country roots, deep into jazz influences, etc. so Chicken Fried isn't only just a catchy song, there are layers of the song that you can discover on repeated listening.	1
just a great fun tune, so glad to be able to download songs to my Amazon 3 cloud account .	1
I bought this song because I heard it on the radio and I like it.  If I wasn't going to give it a 5 star rating, I never would have bought it.	1
This is a great addition to my music collection. Zac Brown has a great hit with Chicken Fried. Most working Americans can relate to this song. This is a must have for your music collection.	1
One of Zac Brown Band's classic songs. Brings back great memories.  Whats not to like and the price is great as well.	1
This is a great song...Super easy download...Great song to cure the insanity of the long drive home in rush hour traffic. Just love Zac Brown Band.	1
true humble story of a song of the south that a lot of people can relate to . would recommend Zac Brown and his band and songs	1
A good country song on my Sansa Fuze I enjoy every day as  I work. Enjoy these country songs. Love it	1
love music and video and love this song very much hope you would try there music there out of this world	1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	1
Make you want to dance and sing. Zach Brown Band is a very nice change from other music out there and easy to listen to and sing along !	1
I love Rod, and I am so happy to have found his "original"  version of this song without having to buy a CD!	1
It is a great song from the past. I am pleased to have it in my collection. Way to go Rod!	1
Rod stewart is awesome love the song and for me brings back memories of it being an oldie when I was young...lol	1
Was exactly the track I was looking for.	1
I remember hearing this song at the office one day, and I had to stand and think for a minute about where I was in life. Even though I barely caught the ending of the song, I went in search of it, and I found it. Very inspirational song.	1
I am slightly embarrassed to like a Rod Stewart song as much as I like this song. I guess the truth is, I like Rod Stewart. I'm not the kind of person who normally thinks of himself as a Rod Stewart fan. "Do You Think I'm Sexy" came out when I was a child and that kind of represented everything I didn't like about music at that time. But since then, I've come to discover a number of Rod's songs that I like quite a lot. This is one of those songs.	1
It is hard to write a review for a MP3 download.  It is a song that you have heard and liked.  If so, you would not have downloaded it.  I liked this song, downloaded it, the price was right.  Good review.	1
I have all of  Rod Stewards song s have gone to many of his shows  I would have to  Young TURKS is of his best songs	1
This song is timeless!	1
This recording was nice and crystal clear. I found that purchasing and dowloading the tune from Amazon was a breeze!	1
No matter what your thoughts are about him personally, you have to admit he can sing.  He knows how to get your mind working.  Isn't that what music is all about?	1
My favorite Rod Stewart song.	1
I love this song. It is now in my video library. Thank you very much.	1
Gets you going	1
There is no doubt about when it has came down to male singers, Rod Stewart has had a brilliant way of reaching people young and old through his gift of songs. Even with time and age those songs still haven't even lost their luster. His classics are still just as infectious today, as they did place a groove in the heart back then. His classic Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? is one of those songs that definitely brings out the sensuality of a classic male at heart. It is just as infectious as other disco anthems that have honestly withstood the test of time like The Bee Gees anthem Stayin' Alive and The Village People's Y.M.C.A. The song still gets better with time shows just what Rod Stewart has made out in song. I honestly do not get tired of this song, and if you are new to Rod Stewart's music, I sincerely recommend you have this in your music library. Do You Think He Still Is Sexy after all this time, Rod Stewart sincerely is.  Song: B+	1
great	1
This song was great.	1
Great Rod was my favorite Faces was a great band wish he was touring with them ,but...........He had a sound of a era	1
Guess I'm showing my age again. This is a song that I grew up with and enjoyed with my friends.	1
I loved this song from the first time I heard it.  I have always liked Stewart's gravelly voice and enthusiasm.	1
My favorite Rod Stewart song... I remember listening to this, really enjoying it but not doing anything about getting a copy of it. I'm glad I was able to get it here for my iPod. I always enjoy listening to this song.	1
I love the 80s.  At least the music.  And this is a good one.  It's an awesome song about the love a parent has for a child, and even though I don't have kids, I can still understand the underlying thought.  Plus it's so pretty...	1
This was another requested by my sister for her husband's 60th birthday, she didn't want to use it but I sneaked it in.	1
But sometimes you need some cheese in your life, and cheese in the shape of Rod Stewart is great. Why don't you go and get you some  cheese!	1
There is no question about the lack of really good songs out there right now. So to me, I think turning back the clock on a lot of great pop classics has been a great idea for right now. While Rod Stewart has lately been more focused on covers and standards, his classics from the 70's and 80's still haven't lost their shine like Forever Young. The song still remains as freshing from Rod as you could ever expect from him. Yet, I do deeply wish that Rod would consider having original material for himself for now, instead of him doing his "songbook" standards. Still Rod Stewart will always be Forever Young in his fans' hearts and this song definitely matters to that notion.  Song: A-	1
No problems with downloading this song.  Used it for a 75th Birthday memory compilation DVD.  It was very clear and fit the bill perfectly.	1
Love	1
Great song	1
One of the best videos I've ever heard of. Young in spirit, great at heart.	1
perfect	1
Rod Stewart had the voice that made you feel his music. The song "FOREVER YOUNG"  tells the story of deep love that's lasted and is forever young.	1
great	1
Good for the traveling playlist.	1
Great tune good beat	1
Great song.	1
never ordered it	-1
This is my favorite version of the Bob Dylan song. Keeps me young just listening to it!!!	1
This is classic Rod Stewart. If you like Rod Stewart, this is an excellent choice. I prefer the earlier Rod Stewart myself.	1
ROD IS AWESOME SINGING THIS SONG, I TRULY FEEL HIM. IF I WAS GETTING MARRIED OR CELEBRATING ANNIVERSERY THIS WOULD BE MY SONG!	1
No matter how many songs he records, this will always be my favorite. Words can't describe how touched and emotional I feel whenever I hear this song. Thank you for the song, Rod.	1
When I'm working on a scene in one of my stories and I need to set the mood for a poignant couple's moment, listening to Rod Stewart sing Have I Told You Lately always helps put me in the right frame of mind. Rod's version of the song makes me want to get right up from what I'm doing and tell my wife how much I love her.	1
We got this song to use in a DVD Memorial for my son's father who passed away from cancer.  He was always very active and thought he was 30 even though he was 65.  This song fit his personality to a T	1
This is one of Rod's best -- it touches the heart with what should be priorities in our lives.  And the overall sound is engaging.	1
Really great	1
a classic.	1
Great memories.	1
I don't know why. See my "Both Sides Now" review for more detail. I may be too old and stupid to buy music from Amazon.	-1
"Help Me" is 60's and 70's icon Joni Mitchell's signature track and only top ten hit. The song is ranked #282 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time". A must have for any fan of 1970's music.	1
Being a baby boomer gives me quite an objective view of  Ms. Mitchell's musical talent.  Her music has been covered for over thirty years. I had the unique honor of seeing CSN debut at the West Texas rock festival in 1970. By covering this song a almost year later, it helped turn them into a super group.	1
Joni Mitchell was one of the most noteworthy folk artists to emerge from the 1960's. Although Mitchell's version of Woodstock may not be the most widely recognized adaptation of the song, it is arguably the best. Her wide ranging vocals and distinctive singing style are perfectly suited for this 1960's iconic track. A must have for any fan of folk music or 60's classics.	1
Love my music!	1
Love this song! How Country Feels CD even better!!!	1
Randy is the man to sing this song! Just get 'em on!!	1
I'm clearing off my review list. This was a purchase for someone who WANTED it. Thus, they liked it. I personally am not a fan.  I'd turn my nose up at this by the name alone. I'm southern and I DETEST the promotion of "hillbilly" or "Red neck" ideas/ideals. To me southern is simplicity, relaxation, a charm and sophistication with manners and poise, and GOOD food (that may kill you off at 40)	-1
song is worth every penny, great quality and excellent payment options. Recommended for anyone that has interest in this music	1
It's an mp3 download - product is exactly what was advertised.  Not much more to say about it, you either like him or you don't.	1
The combo between Toby Mac, Kirk Franklin and Mandisa is ingenious.  Reminder of not gaining everything in this world, and losing who I am in Christ.  Nothing in this world is worth that.	1
loved it	1
Nothing Matters in this World if we lose our soul for Eternity	1
Love love love Toby Mac	1
great song	1
awesome!	1
The Greats said all music should praise the Lord, TobyMac and his group seem to know just how to do just that.	1
Even my teenagers love this song. Well done!	1
love it	1
When i think of GOOD Christian music... i think of stuff that sounds melancholy to hopeful.... has a message about one or more of the aspects of Christianity... takes it's stuff seriously and DOESN'T try to make a hip-hip-hooray song of it... and has beautiful or thoughtful lyrics. Now... most of Toby's stuff IS happy... and the reason it doesn't fit into the blah christian music category is because it's more inspirational music than evangelical. This on the other hand, IS evangelical, and it's amazing. One of the best Christian songs I've ever heard.  Lose My Soul is about us... as Believers... going through our lives attempting to serve and please our God, Jehovah... even as the world and it's material things pressure us and call to us, pulling us away. We can't afford to go that route, ladies and gents. How does it profit a man if he gains the whole world... but loses his very soul? OH. It brings shivers. So much is at stake.  It's a powerful song with a great message. Very peaceful and mindful melody. Great lyrics. TobyMac, Mandisa and Kirk Franklin performing a great collaboration. And all of it comes together and serves us fanboys (and girls) with a perfectly delivered message.  It's awesome. Add it to your library. And enjoy it.	1
love the music.	1
TobyMac has a gift and I am glad he shares that gift with the world.  He is truly blessed and I am honored to be a viewer of his talent.  This song says it all for me and holds as a reminder of what prize I want in the end.  The question is posed, do you want what the world has to offer and lose your salvation?  When you think about it, it is not worth it.  Taking back to basics, to gain this world I forfeit my soul that is one decision I do not want nor choose to make.  In the end, it is my prayer to see God's face.	1
The chorus of this song is great! To be honest, I am not a fan of rap. There is some rapping in the first portion of the song, which I somehow don't mind because the melody is nice...once you get to the chorus. This is, of course, my opinion. Also...this song has a nice message. I am a fan.	1
I don't want to gain the whole world and lose my soul for sure. great song!!! the duo sings great together with a little rap in there as well. :)	1
I love this song the quiality is great,adn I enjoy putting it on my own personailized cd. I would recomend this way of purchasing	1
What a great, uplifiting Christian song that really tells it all. While a description shouldn't be necessary because you'll either like Christian music or not, this is a great song	1
This is somewhat of a mix of classic gospel music with urban contemporary. The lyrics are really great though and they have helped me make some good choices when I was in a tough spot.	1
This is a great song to listen to when doing the stepper at the gym.  Nice fast beat that keeps me going.	1
Womanizer (Britney Spears) / B001L29H7I  While wishing no offense to Ms. Spears, when songs from her "Circus" album started showing up on my Pandora radio and I was instantly hooked, I was shocked to see that these were Britney Spears songs. I remember listening to her *years* ago when I was a teenager, but I haven't heard any of her 'new' stuff in forever.  "Womanizer" is a solid dance song - it has a good beat, and I like the vocals - I'm impressed at how much deeper and lower Spears' voice can go now that she is a little older. I don't know how much of it is natural talent and how much is post-production tweaking, but this just sounds a lot richer and fuller than the way I remember Britney Spears.  Check this song out - you might be surprised to learn that it stays in your head. Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.  ~ Ana Mardoll	1
I never thought she would ever make a comeback but this song is great.  I downloaded it to my mp3 player and hear it on the radio all the time.  Turns out I was wrong the song "Womanizer" and the album "Circus" is great music from a teenager who perhaps has finally grown up, or at least her voice has.	1
Probably a bit hard to get used to as it reminded me much of what Blackout sounded like, though it turned out to be a real great pop song which granted her her second #1 hit in the U.S. after `Baby One More time' back in 1998. The beats are infectious and to me, they remind me of an alarm for some reason, warning everyone of a womanizer out for the kill. It is a fun track, its sassy, it is so catchy, and the hook and the chorus will be stuck in one's head for days. Even though it's repetitive, it doesn't get old.	1
I really like Tom Petty, and this song is classic Petty. I bought this one by accident as I was trying to pruchase "little Runaway", but found it very nice.	1
This is one of those songs that you listen to and it brings back memories, memories that are stored deep inside and only come out with the right smell or music.  LOVE IT!	1
This is exactly the type of song I expected from Tom Petty. A very unique style  but, one that I really like.	1
"If I Had $1,000,000" by the Barenaked Ladies is a fabulous, warmhearted, and fun song. I actually have the greatest hits CD from whence this came, but it was packed away in a box after an arduous move and I really wanted to hear it. The download is very reasonably priced and is generally easy (though settings can go astray if you have never done it before.)  The song itself is a lighthearted love song, and I have listened to it now on numerous occasions for two primary reasons: first, it's just a great song; second, it helped me prepare for my initial karaoke outing on a cruise ship. The quirky lyrics, ranging from exotic pets to John Merrick's remains, are humorous, quirky, and actually work well as a sweet and endearing song. (Really!)  This is a great song, and I recommend it without reservation, especially for the price. While you're at it, go ahead and download the whole CD! Now if I could only find some pre-wrapped bacon....	1
not my favorite Brittany album but it was okay overall. would not by it. Maybe just borrow it from the library next time.	-1
I really like this song. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.	1
Now it's kinda weird how I heard about this song. So I was on youtube and I was watching Demi & Selena's videos they would do together and they were jamming to this song. I looked for it, listened to it, learned the lyrics, and now I LOVE it! From the video to the song its self...it's just all weird, crazy, and Britney.	1
Good download with the amazon cloud player. Had issues with first downloading product, but they fixed it right away. Thanks	1
Circus (Britney Spears) / B001L29H4Q  While wishing no offense to Ms. Spears, when this song showed up on my Pandora radio and I was instantly hooked, I was shocked to see that it was a Britney Spears song. I remember listening to her *years* ago when I was a teenager, but I haven't heard any of her 'new' stuff in forever.  I simply cannot get this song out of my head. It has a great beat, and I really like the vocals - I don't know how much of it is natural talent and how much is post-production tweaking, but this just sounds a lot richer and fuller than the way I remember Britney Spears. The lyrics are light-hearted, but very fun, and I like the exhortation that everyone join the dance - this isn't just another 'look at me' solo songs.  Definitely check this song out - you might be surprised to learn that it stays in your head. Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.  ~ Ana Mardoll	1
This is one of the best albums I have heard from her in a long time.	1
Highlights how Britney sees her life in the public eye, comparing it to a circus with "All eyes on me, at the center of a ring just like a Circus", reflecting how her life has been portrayed and followed through tabloids and other media means, how it is all entertaining to all of those watching when she "puts on a show" but there's more to it lying behind. Personal favorite right here, it can easily be the best song Spears has come up with and put out there, the beats are so innovative, contagious and have this dark circus, mysterious sorta deal along with heavy strumming and pure pop elements to it that makes it spooky, it almost makes it R&B.	1
When it has came down to this past year for Britney Spears, she struggled from the depths of near fatal death after being placed in a hospital, after a standoff in regards to custody of her kids, to claiming she is back on top with Womanizer. Sadly, though she hasn't really shown that she has the feeling that she has got it again. Circus, the title track from her latest album, doesn't feel like it is the top of her game. I really wasn't impressed with the song. It just wasn't really convincing that she had delivered on a knockout, and that feeling still lingers on after her documentary MTV's For The Record, where she looked and acted like she didn't want to be a singer anymore, because of the casualties. What I think Britney needs to do is take more time to find herself, then get back out there and show she could do it again.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
Its obvious Britney still has it if she can keep on the right path.  This is another great song from her (second) comeback album.	1
For Britney Spears, her life has really been placed on too much overdrive. With her perfromance recently on Good Morning America, and her recent documentary on MTV Britney: For The Record, she has shown that she has been more unhappy not having control over her life, than her career coming to full force. That is shown on her latest single Circus, the second songle and title track from her latest album. She doesn't feel like she has captured a new essence to that next level. The song feels like it rehashed from the beats from her earlier material like I'm A Slave For U. I really felt like she has run out of songs, and her feeling is that she just doesn't want to sing anymore. I think she needs to put time off from her career, and get those loose ends of her life together.  Song: D	-1
Downloaded this for hubby because he heard a song on the radio he swore was going to be this song and when it wasn't he was disappointed.  So I said I would get it for him and like magic you have it!!!  Yay!!	1
Fun song about, what else, werewolves in London--and classy ones at that! Sipping a pina colada at Trader Vic's, eh? May I join you, guv?	1
good song	1
Classic!!!! You got to love it!!!!	1
What can I say.  Warren Zevon (R.I.P) a true artist.  Miss him.	1
A Lot of fun	1
Rocks out!	1
once again brit is making a whore out of herself talking in those devil like codes we know rock stars love using those codes and swear the public knows nothing about it anyway more techno crap about how brit talking about all the boya and gals wanna screw her.	-1
When it has came down to Britney Spears the past few years, it is really hard to tell whether she is back on track smelling like a rose, or having another mental breakdown. Unfortunately her latest single doesn/t really show she has the appeal she has shown either. If U Seek Amy, the 3rd single from her lackluster album Circus feels like a paperweight in the the mind, and not in the soul of the voice. I found the song to be less appealing even with the spotlight going towards others like Rihanna and I Kissed A Girl maven Katy Perry. She hasn't shown she has the beat back, and unfortunately, neither does this song. So if you really are seeking Amy, tell her to listen to something else.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
This is exactly the type of song I expected from Tom Petty. A very unique style  but, one that I really like.	1
This is what I call 2nd generation of Petty, Not as hard rocking as he used to be. Looking for a spot on the pop charts. Still nothing wrong with that. You will enjoy.	1
Great songs.	1
Just a 5 star classic	1
A must have on any song list!	1
Love it	1
good	1
We love Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in our home. It's just a fun group with a lot of fun music. This song is a favorite of ours as well. We completely enjoy this. The tune is catchy and the music is typical BBVD.	1
This is an entertaining song.  While it does mention Christmas in the chorus, it really isn't necessarily a Christmas song, per se.  The real focus is on two characters with polar opposite preferences of weather and temperature.  Since I have not been fortunate enough to see the original special that this song came from, I can't comment on where it fits into the story, but I think the fact that this song isn't strongly attached to the holiday actually makes it a bit more of an evergreen song.  Listen in the middle of the summer and call yourself Heat Miser if you like.  I'm happy being a Snow Miser...  As to the quality of the song, first of all, when it comes to modern swing, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy can't really go too far wrong.  They are experts of the craft of making music that sounds like it was recorded decades ago but with impeccable fidelity.  That said, this song is a bit slower tempo than their more popular songs, so if you are already familiar with their music, be warned that it isn't Zoot Suit Riot.  It is still superbly crafted and is a refreshing change of tempo from the run of the mill Christmas fare.  Since this song isn't really directly about the holiday, there isn't anything to object to.  Unless you will only put religious music in your playlist, there is no reason not to give this excellent song a try.  And if you are only looking for religious music, you don't need me to tell you this ain't it...	1
When it has came down to it, we honestly haven't seen many strong cover songs lately. Considering so many R&B acts have been just taking instead samples like Ciara with Never Ever sampling If You Don't Know Me By Now. So for Avant it might feel like a breath of fresh air covering a classic R&B twist on the classic light moods of the 80's classic hit Sailing by Christopher Cross. Sadly, I really didn't feel the sense of comfort in the way Christopher had carried for so many years. It isn't as strong of a cover, as was the case with recent covers like Beyonce's remake of Etta James hit At Last. Still, I would've liked to have heard more sailing away from Avant. Hopefully, if Avant comes out with a better cover song, I'll get a better listen.  Song: D+	-1
She has a nice voice which at times is very etheral...feathery, so don't pick the vibe up for the dance floor or just chillin' but still going to give her other albums a try.	-1
she was cool back in the day but brandy needs to sit down she's fake she lied about beibng a virgin we knew wanya, kobe, usher, tyrese, mase, aND EVEERYBODY ELSE WENT THROUGH HER SHE WAS ON DRUGS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD now she's back with a nosejob and a so called iomage makeover please this sucks I'd rather buy lil kim's wack mixtape still she should quit music and prostitute hersel;f out like maia campbell and superhead.	-1
Here is another great song from the sixties that is not the original version. It's a shame that the studios are pulling this stuff and not warning us before we plunk down our dollars on something we will ultimately trash. You would think they'd give paying customers a fair shake, but no....	-1
THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE CUTE LITTLE SONG WE ALL CAME TO KNOW & LOVE	-1
Overplayed and overrated.	-1
Linda should've learned to leave well enough alone! The Eagles' Desperado is one of the most played out, overrated songs we're pummeled with mercilessly on this so called "classic rock" radio format that is tired and tacky already.	-1
So Jackson, who was clearly listening to a lot of Bob Dylan records at the time, decided he wanted to be like a certain critically acclaimed, commercially successful living legend/cynical street poet with a really bad voice - only with a considerably better voice (technically speaking, anyway) and soft-rock instrumentation. Really, he only blew it on one count. Too bad that count was he didn't have the talent of Dylan's elbow. He tackles weighty topics - depression, suicide, drug addiction, apocalypse - but he doesn't say anything too revealing about any of them, and we wind up with several spare piano and acoustic guitar ballads that are lifeless and unoriginal, if earnest ("For Adam", "My Opening Farewell", "A Child in These Hills", et al). But he doe nail a couple of these: "Jamaica Say You Will" is a lovely ballad that's been covered by just about everybody; the piano-driven, pessimistic "Doctor My Eyes" is probably my favorite of Jackson's songs, and actually is pretty good as far as Dylan knock-offs go; and "Rock Me on the Water" is enjoyably apocalyptic. Now if the rest weren't so turgid, we'd have a classic on our hands.	-1
I really like this song, but the crackling in the background makes this song miserable to listen to as it sounds like a needle on a record being scratched across the record.  I'm very disappointed with this purchase.	-1
It is hard to tell who Jamie Foxx is right now. After his public so-called comedic rant on Miley Cyrus, many people have questioned him and his role as a performer. But for his latest single, Blame It, the second single from his 3rd album Intuition, feels honestly more like a lackluster vibe than imagined. I sadly didn't feel it was a driven R&B song that hit the nail on the head, unlike recent tracks from Solange', Kanye West, or others that've been strong on the soul. I do hope though for Jamie that he can find better music for himself, and I definitely hope that he can be really start all over by making peace with his feelings about what Hannah Montana would show.  Song: D	-1
Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol	-1
i want to download the songs to my music player and I am tired of missing my music as I do not want the player it uses sometimes and am looing music..	-1
I prefer more family friendly Christmas lyrics	-1
This is by far the worse song GAGA has ever written, in fact Rebecca Black's "Friday" has more intelligent thought put into it than this. This song is so tacky and dumb, it wouldn't even be played in the background of a porno.	-1
I don't -hate- Lady Gaga, but this song is just awful. I heard it in Las Vegas while looking at the CSI gift shop, and my reaction was wanting to puke. "light me up, put me on top, let's falalalalalalalala"?! What are you 13 years old.  Cherry cherry bomb bomb.	-1
I like Lady Ga Ga, like her music, but frankly this song is not that good. It sounds like "lets put something out that our fans will snap up at Christmas and lets make more money for a better meat dress". Now if Rob Zombie does "Carol Of The Bells"......	-1
It isn't!  How funny is this, I downloaded this a few days before it was offered in the 25 Days Of Free thinking it seemed very odd for Lady GaGa to be doing "O Christmas Tree" but I also downloaded a bunch of other stuff at the same time that I was in a bigger hurry to listen to.  Then I got so wrapped up in protesting the listing of "Slower Than Christmas" that I didn't even take the time to look at the reviews this song was getting until today's offering of Badd Santa "Christmas Girl".  I hadn't even listened to it until today.  Surprise surprise, it isn't "O Christmas Tree" after all, but a song that makes sexual metaphors out of Christmas trees (and female metaphors at that, figure that one out).  Setting the gross inappropriateness of this song aside for a moment, this is a weak song musically.  If I'm not mistaken, there are two lines in the entire song, maybe three.  It makes a strange shift in the middle to Space Cowboy rapping the same line, then shifts back to GaGa, and then finishes with one of my big pet peeves, a self reference (and a double one at that)!  The backing music is a choppy, repetitive bed of electronic harmony which has nothing exciting to offer.  The only thing this song brings to the table is overt sexuality.  Coming from a former burlesque dancer, this seems no surprise.  That Amazon wants to advertise it as part of the 25 Days Of Free would be surprising if it weren't a part of a disturbing trend this year.  Amazon is trying very hard to push the "edgy" envelope and it is leaving a lot of us scratching our heads.  I think it would be more understandable if the edgy songs in question were particularly good, but they aren't.  This song brought to mind a song they sometimes play on Bob and Tom about Santa going to town, only that song is FUNNY, this isn't.  This song is blatantly irresponsible in that it is targeted at pop music buyers.  The age bracket for pop music buyers is 12(ish) to 25.  The upper range of that bracket I have no issue with, but this includes middle school kids.  Singing this kind of innuendo to middle schoolers is just plain wrong.  With the setup of getting this song off a Christmas recommendation list and an innocuous title that can easily be mistaken for an age old Christmas carol, I'm sure this will lead to many kids getting their hands on this right under their parents' unsuspecting noses.  AMAZON PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION!!! YOU ARE GOING TO START LOSING CUSTOMERS IF YOU DON'T SHAPE UP YOUR ACT HERE! One slip-up in the 25 day cycle could be forgiven, but three in a week is looking very deliberate and people are getting offended.  25 Days Of Free is looked at as a platform for holiday friendly, family friendly music.  A nice way to get some songs to add to the playlist when company is over.  Stop wasting slots on songs that the vast bulk of your customers are summarily deleting.  And for Pete's sake, READ THE REVIEWS PEOPLE ARE LEAVING!  Stop trying to pitch to the 5 to 10 people who like raunchy instead of the 100's that don't want it!	-1
Even if you ignore the lyrics, this track is just unpleasant to listen to and incredibly repetative. I enjoy a couple of her other songs, but this is a special kind of awful, especially for a christmas song.	-1
God, this song is awful. But its not just bad, its lazy and sloppy. Why on Earth would anyone listen to this and think(be able to think after listening) that this is good? More and more of this trash is flooding the music industry, Madison Ave. has no shame. Gaga belongs on the Gong Show - not any human's music collection.	-1
Im sick to death of the attempts of the media to ram this trash down my throat, it sucks like 90% of radio garbage.  If you heard this song LIVE you would realize how truly bad and talentless Lady Gaga is.  Just another britney.	-1
There is no doubt that there are some artists who've made some songs that have felt like flavor of the moment, and those who've made songs that are just overdone. That sadly is the case with Lady Gaga, and her latest single Poker Face. I really didn't find the song to have anything that made it stand out from better dance songs. After the novelty of Just Dance, it seemed like she would be a flavlor that would be gone. For Poker Face, it really wasn't a track that struck the chord or give you a royal flush that was everlasting. I really didin't see anything that made her seperate the mold from the overdone beats from Rihanna or Beyonce', hand in heart. I think Lady Gaga has just been in the court of a pair of deuces, and needs to find something that a song that will give her a four of a kind.  Song: F+	-1
Live to Win being Stanley's 2nd solo album and 2006 release has here created an ok hard rock album with good vocals and quite well-written lyrics. The first track "Live to Win" is a good track. Unfortunately the rest sounds like standard light hard rock music and gets a bit tedious after a while. Allmusic gave the album 2.5/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and for each track we get a list of whom plays what. 2/5.	-1
Live To Win is a great rock song but everything else is just lame cheese and nothing to get excited about. I purchased that 1 mp3 on here and it's worth a buck but skip the rest unless ya like cheesy Kiss music that's not as good as their old stuff.	-1
There was a lot of hyp because this was Stanley's first solo output in 28 years. But I'm sorry to say this: this album does not deliver.  Of course it's immaculately produced, but the songs themselves are nowhere near "great" status... They have absolutely no discernible and catchy riffs... it's a wall of sound, sometimes sadely with nu-metal tones all around.  I'll wait for his next solo release.	-1
Why would any Rock Star just make themselves look stupid like this? Because they know the mindless Kiss army will support it regardless of quality.  This is Just 80's garbage KISS sounding trash.  Hot in the shade B sides made more pop radio friendly *BARF*.  Maybe this is why kiss sucks now too.	-1
First of, John 5 is an amazing guitar player, but he is restrained to power chords on this release just like he was in Manson. But he can wail, just listen to his solo stuff. I can only assume that person didn't know much about his guitar style.   That said, his inclusion doesnt really add up to much on Educated Horses. The whole thing falls dead on its feet in under 40 minutes. I understand change and new direction but this just seems so forced and fake. The riffs are the same ol' back forth notes, with a few pretentious acoustic numbers. The cool horror film samples would have helped this album some, but not much. Get everything he has done before this, but skip the new one cause it is average at best.	-1
What's here is fine but how can any Cream compilation exclude Spoonful from their first album?? Perhaps their finest moment nowhere to be found. Its a crime! I know there is an ok live version here but it is inexcusable not to include the studio version. Who is the idiot who puts together these ridiculous compilations anyway? Obviously not a Cream fan! Should be fired!!!!!!	-1
Well as much as I appreciate Jamie Foxx's comedic, acting and vocal abilities.  I am not impressed with this release.  I think when you portray an artist like Ray Charles in such a successful motion picture, it sends such a strong message that the public's expectation may supercede the actual artist.  Personally, this release was much more juvenile than I expected and even more so than his first release. The music and melody are somewhat forgetable and lack creativity.  I think most R&B artist today could take a few lessons from Musiq who music and message always so creative, different which is why he is so appealing.  THe voicebox has become so annoying and I truly think that Roger Trapman is the only one who could do it right.  I couldn't understand having another artist song remixed on your CD.  It is there song why bother, even if they are guest appearing.  Otherwise, it just plays and I wouldn't feel a need to play it again, which is my barameter as to how I rank a CD.	-1
I'm generally a Jamie Foxx, but this CD is disappointing. Jamie is 41 years old now, and maybe I expected songs that reflected his age. This CD makes Jamie come off like a immature boy, and not a man in his 40s.	-1
I had no idea who this chick was until I went to Rent-A-Center one day and her video was being played on the big screen TV. I was like, what? So I looked into her background, listened to this CD, and I have come to the conclusion that she is a sugar-free chocolate-covered Avril Lavigne. For someone who has been interested in punk/rock&roll music all their young life, I was expecting something astounding on this album, something that would make her stand out and have people take notice. There was none of that on here. Even though Fefe (Felicia) can carry a tune, every song on here was dull and forgettable. This album was void of bass, funk, melody, rock, roll, attitude, and, most importantly, soul. It's just generic pop music masked as rock& roll with a lot of noisy guitars. Fe Fe Foe Fum, this album turned out to be kind of dumb. Foo Foo Foe Fee, don't even bother wasting your money. Trust me on this one, FeFe's not doing any thing unique and you're not missing anything. Holla!	-1
Chase Cut: This album was a huge disappointment...  Fine Print: After hearing the pop-punk influenced single "take me away", I had to have this CD. So I went out, bought it, and quickly tried to sell it back. It was total crap, boring as hell and quickly forgetable. This IS NOT pop-punk...its soul rock, and man does that ever blow!!!!  1. Stupid Little Love Song...Just that, STUPID. Sure the guitar and drums SOUND like something by SR-71 or Blink, but the music IS FAR FROM PUNK 2/10  2. Bye Bye Boyfriend...I have a softspot for this song, don't ask me why, but i do 5/10  3. Take me Away...The first single, and very deceptive. None of the album sounds ANYTHING like this 7/10  4. Everything...BORING!!!!1/10  5. Rock It Till You Drop It...My least favorite, and that says a whole hell of alot -100000/10  6. Revolution Song...No need to read the lyric sheet. Its the the words "Na Na Na" over and over again for 5 f**kin minutes straight 0/10  7. Kiss me fool...More crap. Stupid lyrics and forgetable music make this one a big ZERO/10  8. Unforgiven...Another softspot song. Its actually pretty catchy, and its about the only one i actually like while listening to the album 8/10  9. We went for a ride...the melody is okay, but the song is just so boring its not worth my time 2/10  10. Give it up...The lyrics are stupid as hell, but the music is okay 2/10  11. Julia...Yuck! This one Sucks a** 0/10  12. 8x10...This one gives me a headache, seriously. 1/10  13. Rainbow...Boring, but luckily it brings this terrible album to a close in less than 2 minutes...	-1
First off, I don't know why most of the reviews (the positive AND the negative) are comparing Fefe Dobson to Avril Lavigne. Fefe and Avril's styles aren't even remotely related. But anyway, this debut album from Canadian-born Fefe Dobson had a lot of people talking, so I decided to check it out. And I really don't see what all the talk is about. The problem with this album mainly lies in the way she sings. This may be hard for some people to understand, but even if you're singing hard rock, you still have to have a good voice. The only times Fefe really delivers in this category are on "Take Me Away", "Everything" and the hidden bonus track. Most of the rest of the songs have her either singing without any effort or just talking in tune to the music (see "Bye Bye Boyfriend"). And that song is actually one of the worst songs on the album. There are also some other poor efforts, like "Give It Up" and the juvenile "Rock It Till You Drop It" featuring Tone Loc (probably because the music sounds a little like "Funky Col Medina"). And "Stupid Little Love Song" is just that. Even her lash-out at her father, "Unforgiven", comes out wrong. I tried to give this album a chance, but I just wasn't impressed with it. Maybe it's better suited for the junior high school crowd, as another reviewer said. Anthony Rupert P.S. In response to the reviewer that compared Fefe to Hole, Hole was the name of the group, not the lead singer (the lead singer's name was Courtney Love; I thought everybody knew that).	-1
Oh please, this girl is NOT rock.  If this WAS rock, I'd shoot myself. Lame, crap, garbage, total worthless piece of junk.  Disgusting.	-1
I want to like fe fe but her voice is so annoying and she can't write and her band is horrible. But not as horrible as her voice. She makes me want to get all those pop albums I regret buying and get hers and burn them together to a crisp.	-1
I like the concept but  Fefe Dobson sounds just like anyone else be it Avril or Alanis.alot of the material you can feel in the blank of where you heard it before. She still has time to Grow as a Artist but this Material is just there.	-1
So far I've heard two songs on this album and both of them are re-records. Not only is this one a re-record, but it's an AWFUL re-record. Eddy should have tuned his guitar before he recorded this one, because there are several times when the notes are so far off you'll actually jerk your head back and go, "What the hell was that?" Don't pay a dime for this thing; it will only encourage Amazon to keep stocking cheap re-records. .	-1
I never liked this song when it was popular, but I downloaded it because my kids wanted to know where Wierd Al Yankovich got the idea for Jurassic Park.	-1
I downloaded this song to put together a mix of the worst songs from the 80's for my fiance.  This song was prominent, for obvious reasons the minute you hear it.  Do I feel bad for supporting a band I know to be one of the worst bands in the history of bands?  Ehhh, sort of.  But I feel much better having put together the definitive list of all that was awful from the 80's.  Now, I can reproduce it for all, and no longer will there be lingering questions of culture in the realm of 80's music.  And that is a piece of mind this society needs desperately.	-1
there you have it, an overplayed song that mimics the style of pat benatar and bonnie tyler, but worse because it's a wanna-be version of the aforementioned artists, which were ok, but not great to begin with.	-1
Pauses a LOT during the song, can't really get into the music.  Im going to try and get my money back!	-1
Styx were famous for big, emotive ballads like "Babe" and "Lady" but this album doesn't deliver in terms of memorable songs. Show Me The Way is representative: a big number, but neither melodic nor emotional enough to stick in the mind.	-1

This is dr dre's worst album ever. It seems it was rushed and made in a day. All the songs are boring and the production sucks. I will try and forget that dre ever made this cd. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!	-1
The year was 1996. Dr. Dre had managed to disentangle himself from the talons of Suge Knight and Death Row Records. Dre had started his own label, Aftermath, and was ready to sit back, renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in. While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop's Doggfather album, Dre was poised to start a new rap empire. So out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation, and we didn't hear from him again for three years. The reason? The album more or less ... and Dre's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in. It's a shame, too, because the one Dre track on the album, "Been There, Done That," is really good. The production is smooth and silky, with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line, and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions. ("I've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea / It's worth eight, but I only paid 5.3.") An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof, but alas, he hadn't the creative energy for it. The other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs. KRS-One, Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with "East Coast / West Coast Killas," a Dre-produced track that picks up where "Natural Born Killas" left off. The vocal trade-offs are seamless, the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad@ss as ever. Mel-Man, who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001, gets his solo track in "Sh**tin' on the World," which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor, intentional and otherwise. (Mel's liner notes read, "I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin' the projects to the fullest!") The aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy, sultry groove "Got Me Open" with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era's "No Diggity." And RC (the only artist on the album with two songs) turns in a decent, funky remake of David Bowie's "Fame." Otherwise, the album is indistinct, passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da, Floyd Howard, Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher. There's a reason acts like Miscellaneous, King T, Nowl and Sharief never took off. As an intro record-label sampler, you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half-@ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under. Either way, it was a mistake.	-1
A no talent rapper, a worthless annoying beat, stupid lyrics, horrid vocals (talking), and to top it off a no talent worthless poser country bumpkin polished turd Tim McGrath.  The combo is pathetic garbage.  Nelly plus tim McGrath... its like puking on a pile of poo.  Just terrible.	-1
Good duet!	-1
I am too old for this type of ghetto music. It may appeal to the younger more ignorant crowd.	-1
too expensive	-1
Not sure what is going on here, but this is not the original version of the song. The original song starts off "I saw her standing in the rain...". The sample we get to listen to before purchasing doesn't play the beginning, so I had no way of knowing it had been butchered. This version starts off "I saw her sitting in the rain...". Is that a minor difference? No. I repeat...No. When you have listened to a song for more than forty years no change is minor. I can't believe they would do something like this, but sure enough they did. This was one of my ten favorite songs of all time but now I won't listen to it anymore. Thanks, Cowsills, for ruining something that was beautiful.	-1
Although the Amazon page touts this as the "single version" (they ought to try to get it right), it is the stereo album version.  The single was the sonically superior mono version.  Of course, some misguided souls think everything in stereo is better, but when it comes to this song, less is more.	-1
And it's so friggin overplayed too! yuck! time 2 pull out that dung laced vaporizer again! Imo, this was the beginning of the end for Styx, until  Roboto...	-1

It pauses a LOT, can't really get into it.  Wish and will try to get my money back!!!!  Don't buy!	-1
remember these cool a$$ 1 hit wonders?? ha ha...one cool thing they did is play one of these horrible MTV VMA things and ended their set by inducing this great feedback noise. I guess they knew that they'd lucked out getting a song on the God forsaken FM playlist	-1

Bought this for a work function, not for me. I am sorry that I could not give a more in-depth review.	-1
The sample made this song sound pretty good. It wasn't until I heard the entire song (after purchase) that I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong here.. the sound quality is very good, as well as the tempo (if you like Alternative/Indie Rock). It steers to religion and its not on my preference list	-1
i played it one time and gave it away to a true GaGa fan, she didn't like it much either. i suppose every label has to put out so-so albums	-1
this is where alanis was made herself no longer valid in the good music industry.	-1
After her twqo drug influenced cds Jagged Little Pill(a lot of drug abusers are hooked on pills these days, look at winona rider) and Supposed Former Junkie (a junkie is someone addicted to heroin), aalanias has swept her druggy past under the rug.  As a result the music suffers.  this is stillted and boring.  Not that people need drugs to be creative, but some people, like alaanias do.  skip this one.	-1
I really really liked Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Infuaktion Junkie was even better in my opinion. I was excited when this cd came out and thought it would be great. I was wrong. The fact is that it took her more than 3 years to release this shows us perhaps Alanid should try out other things then making albums. She get rids of Glen Ballard and writes and produced the album on her own which of course nothing wrong with that. But it shows she is new at this when listening to the album. The album lacks in brilliant hooks and good melodies and lyrically it is far from being amazing. She obviously has nothing more to say and repeats what she was singing about on her previous LP's which was slef - discovery and her bad luck with Men. This album is about finding men and love and it makes you think after listening to this album perhaps Alanis may have been a bit unfair to the guy she sang You Oughta Know about. When I come to think about it she is not a girl that I would like to date. Nice try Alanis but better luck next time. Hey wasn't she supposed to release two albums in 2002 but only released one. What happened to the other one Alanis. Anyway a total disapointmentn and lets hope that Alanis gives us something to talk about next time.	-1
Alanis Morrisette's third studio effort opens with her essaying to us the twenty one things she wants from a lover--another in a long line of "overshares" this once compelling artist foists on her seemingly adoring fans.  As with her sophomore effort, only to a greater degree, Morrisette manages to bog down her potent melodies with cluttered, New Age garble--it's criminal that she has such a way with a hook, considering that she continues to betray her own best efforts with her overly verbose, undisciplined style of songwriting.  Tracks such as 'Hands Clean' and 'Surrendering' chug along with terrific urgency--until you attempt to listen to the lyrics.  In fact, about two minutes into each track, you'll be scratching your head wondering"When is THIS song going to end?"  It makes one long for the days when this screaming banshee was singing about going "down" on her lover in a theater.  Do yourself a favor, sweep this under the rug--and leave it there.	-1
Alanis Morissette is Arguably one of the Most Over-Hyped Acts over the Past Decade easily.when She first Arrived in Her Post Disco/Pop Era She seemed like something different."You Outta Know" was a catchy but in your face song.since then with&without Glenn Ballard She has came close to that Intensity&Almost matched it with various songs but this Album shows Why She still hasn't Surpased those Heights. She matches the Production but the songs themselves seem to Formula Driven to me.they are missing Drive&Depth. Vocally&Lyrically not much has changed. She can take a few years off if She keeps the Formula going.it's cool She has Label Mate or I should I Say Former Label Mate MeShall'Nede'ocello on it.it's cool to see Her still doing Her thing but this Album is another Easy Cash in overall.	-1
I just don't know what it is but I've never liked Alanis Morrisette! With the exception of "Ironic"-with it's sunny soft-rock melody and catchy chrous-I have not had that much love for Alanis's  music(in fact,I still find the fact that some 14 million Americans own "Jagged Little Pill"-his 1995 debut very suprising). I tried to give Alanis another chance though. BY checking out her third studio album,"Under Rug Swept".But...again,I just didn't well,dig,it. I found the songs soggy and 1995-sounding. Unlike some of her peers her music is just not that appealing to me. And I usually like the type of music that Alanis' music would be "catergorized" as but I'm sorry,it's just not that great! "Hands Clean":A "Jagged Little Pill" outake? No? My point exactly. I do give her credict though because she wrote and produced the album herself(instead of with veteran pop mastero Glen Ballard-who produced her last two multiplatinum efforts-whose worked with amongst many others Micheal Jackson,Wilson Phillips,Paula Abdul,No Doubt,and most recently Dave Matthews Band). BUT I'm sorry,this music is a bit sour. I know that I'm going to tick Alanis fans off and they going to give this review as many 'not-helpful' votes as possible but I just had to put my two cents in....hope you understand.	-1

I don't think I've given a Prince record one star in a long time, but this one was practically begging for it.  Prince treads old ground here for at least the fourth or fifth time, delivering a searingly bad message-laden effort accompanied by forgettable music.  At three discs you want to hope that there is something salvageable here, but it's a mash of throw-away tracks that sound like tracks he used to give to other, failed bands.  The "Lotus" record is an airy mess, filled with lazy writing and retread energy.  The "MPLSound" record has all of the funk that was missing on the "Lotus" disc but still fails to do more than frustrate.  Even the welcome return of his sonic palette (hello pitched tom toms!) only elevates these tracks to music I still won't be listening to a week from now.  Finally, there is the included "non-Prince" record, singer Bria Valente's "Elixer" (misspelled for no apparent reason), which is thoroughly produced by Prince.  Valente is not without merit as a vocalist, and of the three records in this set this is the one that doesn't sound like a complete throwaway.  At the same time, it's hardly inspiring.  It's worth noting that this record - not the two proper Prince albums - contains the sole song worth having out of this whole set: the title track "Elixer", which is a powerful slow-grind of a duet with Prince.  That's it: one track worthy of his genius.  I would challenge anyone to find a mere eight songs that would make one good album out of this material, but this 3-panel set doesn't have eight songs on it anyone will care about that isn't on the payroll.  If his vault is filled with 1000 songs of stuff that sounds like this, then someone should forget the combination.  A waste for anyone who isn't a completist or fanatic, who would even have to admit that at 25 albums deep, this one isn't even in the top 15.  If you bought this record AFTER having heard it, you're a very special person, a collector, or you're a person who just likes to collect Prince stuff whether it's good or not.	-1
So basically some of the arguements are that Prince does diverse stuff here. Ok, fine. But there's plenty of ecletic stuff. I believe people are becoming ever more schizoid, and you have all sorts of musical combinations from artists on myspace and elsewhere, people who mix jazz with death metal, reggae with metal, no exaggeration.  But is this inspired? uh... not neccessarily. Maybe to those who lack imagination. It's great as a display of instrumental ability, but it's otherwise cold.	-1
Basically this cd is not good to me. I rank this cd with some of his worse efforts. The guitar playing is very good though and showcases itself perhaps more than any other Prince cd with consistent solos.  It is obvious Prince had an after party mentality for funk on this cd, but somehow he missed the mark.  It is not a horrible cd it just does not make you ever feel like dancing or caring to play that one song over and over.  Some of the guitar rifts are excellent though. Okay after two weeks of listening to the cd I can ease up a bit and say here are the best songs on the albums to me rated 1-10. Here- I give a number 7.  I really liked this song but it took a while to grow on me. It really wasn't till I listened to the lyrics clearly. I listened to this song more than any other.  It has a carousel feel to it sorta of like Dionne from The Truth Cd's but in lyrics it's more reminiscent to The Dance on 3121 and Strange Relationship from SOTT) Dance For Me-I give a number 6(Reminiscent of 319 off Gold but a little better b/c).  His voice sticks in your head and I like the beat. This is a good Prince song. U're Gonna C Me- I say it's a 9 but we've already heard this so I give it a 7.6.  (I have to lower the number for remixes b/c imagine anyone else redoing a song of their own and putting it on an album) Chocolate Box-I give a 5.  I would give a 6 but it sounds like it should be played in a gay bar and I'm a man so I can only dig it but so far. His voice sticks in your head with this song. If he came out with this in the 80's it woulda been a hit but it's 2009. Crimson and Clover-I give a 4 just because I can and if you're Prince and you're gonna do a cover song it has to be great, but that guitar rift bumps it up to a 5. $- I give a 5.  Definitely reminiscent of MovieStar off Crystal Ball. 77 Beverly Park- I give an eight.  It's only an instrumental though, but it's probably the best song on the 2 cd's. Colonized Mind-I give a 4 compared to Money Don't Matter, SOTT,  When Will We Be Paid, Avalanche,Planet Earth, and his other political songs. He does have a couple lines in this song worth being heard though and the comparisons of a child with no mother equals a man with no feeling make you think. Overall this cd is okay.  Even with his funny electro voice it just didn't do it. Like everyone we all expect a lot out of Prince while at the same time trying to lower our expectations, but this cd is just okay.  I can think of too many of his other cd's that are far better but he does have a couple songs that are catchy.  He definitely caught a vibe on this cd, it's just I didn't catch it.  Like I said, it sounds like takes from an afterparty or a B-sides cd. It did not feel like an album.  By this I mean think Dave Chappelle's sketches compared to his stand up or a television show compared to a movie.  I feel like he wanted to be funky on this cd and it came across but it just wasn't stankonia.	-1
I wouldn't download this piece of dung if they were giving away free digital downloads of it! Always hated this song...the other day, it was being played at work and I felt like jumping out the window or at least leaving the building for a breath of fresh air.	-1
This album recycles some good riffs from the 80's but you can tell these guys are right out of high school by reading their lyrics - the English class PC brainwashing hasn't quite worn off. They also use the thesaurus a little too loosely: "Wed-locked a prison Of antiquation" Good lord who wrote that? Their music may be copped from Metallica but the lyrics are something you would expect from Natalie Merchant (for you younger people she was the singer of 10,000 Maniacs in the 80's - a favorite of unpopular drama club girls who blamed all of their personal insecurities on society, patriarchy, sexism, homophobia and Ronald Reagan).	-1
With the surprise success of Slumdog Millionaire winning Best Picture at the Oscars, there always can be a sense of overexposure with a song from a film that can be a dereailment. That is said strongly with this remade version of Jai Ho! as a single from The Pussycat Dolls. I found this song to lack the appeal and feeling of the song than what really was strong from the movie. It feels like The Pussycat Dolls have made the feeling of the song lose its original luster. I really didn't find this song to be at all appealing. I really think it is absolutely sad that the days from the strength of the song from a movie has lost its ways than the last decade where the song and its soundtrack were just as mighty. I hope that there can be a better mix the next time I hear a movie song.  Song: D	-1

There is honestly no doubt about the fact that there are very few artists that feel like they can hit the right nail on the head. But for Kelly Clarkson, she honestly hasn't been able to make music sound all her own so well. That actually is proof of her latest single, Already Gone, the 3rd single from her latest album All I Ever Wanted isn't really a song that feels like it is original. Actually, if you honestly get a closer listen to the song, it actually sounds a bit too similar in its melody like Beyonce's recent song Halo. I really am not that fully impressed with Kelly's latest, not only that, but it also is a bit dissapointing. It doesn't bring out the heart on other recent songs, like Whitney Houston's elequent I Look To You. I really definitely think Kelly Clarkson should try and find better songs to make her own, than feeling like she is copying someone else.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
Can't hold a candle to the original. That cast didn't need wigs, didn't have to act a whole lot, they were the real thing, they were the hippies of Hair. This is just too cute and wrong. Not even good as a period piece. No talent-director Diane Paulus ruined this as she would Porgy and Bess.  Not even as good as the all-star concert recording of a couple of years ago. Saw Good Morning Starshine performed by the Muppets some years back, and that was more effective than this tripe. The original still holds up terrifically, get that, skip this.	-1
I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.	-1
Hey I got a song for ya Randy. Maybe this one will hit home with ya,since you like to judge everybody with your song thats on this album...."If you walk into a store drunk and naked,then demand cigarettes from the cashier,you ain't right. If you get into a fight with your girlfriend's ex boyfriend in a church parking lot,and he kicks your ass...you ain't right. Then you look like a dork with a black eye and cuts all over your face in your mugshot...you ain't right. If you are found drunk and in your birthday suit,then the cops come to arrest you,and you threaten their lives...you ain't right."  Overall,if you're a hypocrite like Randy Travis,who likes to preach to people in your music,then you go out and do the things you say are wrong....you ain't right.	-1
Randy Travis is an upstanding Republican and friend of the Bush family.  Got a joke for you.  Who wrecks their car while apparently drunk, goes to a convenience store necked to buy a pack of cigarettes (oops no cash!), and then lays necked in the middle of the road waiting for the cops, who he then reportedly threatens to kill.  Answer: Randy Travis!  Awe those Republicans!	-1
I went through days of singing this over and over....	-1
There is no doubt about when a song gets sampled by another artist, most of the time, it feels like it has been a waste on the ears. That has been said for rapper Flo Rida, and his recent song Right Round, which took a sampling on 80's electronica acts Dead Or Alive's You Spin Me. I really wasn't at all impressed with the song from beginning to end. In fact, it felt like to me nothing more than a complete waste of time. He really was not able to deliver heart and soul on the song, but he made the song feel like a piece of junk. I really felt like I was choking on a tuna sandwich. I really would rather recommend hearing Kanye West's Heartless over this anyday of the week.  Song: F	-1
This song is pretty horrible. Ripped off the ol Dead Or Alive tune. This song is the aural equivalent of when you eat hot wings and then go have a bowel movement that hurts yer butt	-1
There are honestly times were a duet feels like it is a waste on the ears, heart and soul. That sadly has been the case with Ciara. Her recent collaborations for Fantasy Ride have felt more like a waste on the mind, and lagging behind chemistry. That showed with Never Ever with Young Jeezy, and here with Justin Timberlake on Love Sex Magic. The third single from Fantasy Ride feels like it is honestly a flavor of the moment, and doesn't spark for anything beyond magic. I really wasn't impressed with the song at all. I think that Ciara really as well as Justin Timberlake needs to find better songs to collaborate to. For Justin, this ranks well behind the other collaborations from a few years ago. As for Ciara, none of the songs worked for Fantasy Ride at all. Lets hope the next album shines better than a soul of ecstasy.  Song: D-	-1
the video's okay only ciara acts like eartha kitt on acid other than that this sounds like one of jt's leftovers.	-1
When it has come down to collaborations recently, there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like Lucky for Jason Mraz & Colbie Calliat. But for Justin timberlake, his recent collaborations have been a bit weak heart and soul than what was honestly expected from the man who wanted to bring sexy back. Well that is strained from his recent duets with Rihanna on Rehab and Madonna on 4 Minutes. For Ciara, that strain is also felt too on their collaboration, Love Sex & Magic, the third single from Ciara's upcoming Fantasy Ride album. I really didn't feel the chemistry bewtween the 2 singers heart and soul here. Ciara has had a few weak songs, but this one just didn't feel like it was sensual enough to say that you could believe in Love, Sex & Magic. Hopefully, the next time they collaborate on a song, it could feel a lot more driven.  Song: D 1/2+	-1
Not at all my type of music, so take my review from that Perspective. I do the occasional DJ party , and needed ( tripe like this to suit the younger crowd. Normally I wouldn't DARE, waste my money on this Juvenile, Pop, Garbage. But There MANY out there that Like it.	-1
When it has came down to it, there just honestly have been very few collaborations that struck the strength of the song. Sadly, that has not really been a good case this year, with so many poor collaborations this year like Ciara & Justin Timberlake's Love Sex Magic, there just honestly haven't been much to hear when 2 sing one. For newcomer Keri Hilson, she hasn't been able to score a real strong song since she came out late last year with her debut single Energy. That even has shown with her recent collaboration on Knock You Down with Ne-Yo and Kanye West, the 3rd single frm her debut album In A Perfect World. The song honestly has a fair rhythm that isn't that bad, but I honestly was hoping that there could've been more chemistry with the three of them singing on that track. Keri really could've brought in a bit more to the sound, but that didn't happen. Knock You Down sadly wasn't fully a K.O., but felt like a soft jab to the face. She needs to simply find better songs to make all her own.  Song: D+	-1
And no substance whatsoever. But is that a surprise? Nope.  There really isn't much to the song whatsoever. But I was nice with the rating because it's not the worst song I've ever heard.  But it could be sooooo much better. I'm not a Keri fan to begin with (and probably never will be) but at least her latest single (Making Love?) was a little better than THIS.  2 stars = D-  end note: Even one of my favorite contemporary R&B artists, Ne-Yo couldn't really breathe life into this dull song. I feel it's just another empty release.	-1
timbaland's beat is boring kanye did'nmt impress me neyo sucks like always keri's alright though swear all this neosoul is sounding more like techno.	-1
makes me wanna start moonwalking around the Christmas tree! ridiculously horrible, played out yuletide turd!	-1
It so played out on these so called 'classic rock' format FM stations. Another song that needs to be retired from all FM playlists. I've been grooving to the Bob Welch era live recording from '74. FM has such a rich catalog of killer songs and all the FM playlist ever include is this song, dreams, rhiannon, and don't stop	-1
I WOULD review this but I didn't get it-it would NOT download from Amazon to my puter, altho other music from Amazon has. It wasn't worth wasting my time demanding a refund for 99 cents, so let's say I've learned NEVER to attempt to download any music from Amazon ever again! A waste of time and what little $$$ I have!	-1
I bought this song and was deeply disappointed by the remastering that had been done.  You should listen to this version and compare it to the original.  You might prefer this version but I didn't.	-1
NOT my taste in music!!  Too "punk" type music!!  Very disappointing to me!!	-1
Was not impressed with the different groups that was in this C. D. was dissappointed. Todays groups just don't have what the older groups do.	-1
Boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different songs , it's a little different but it's okay	-1
I listened to the excerpt on amazon.com. I bought the mp3. I listened to the entire song. And then I deleted the entire song from my computer.	-1
Uninspiring vocals and instrumentation. Just kinda okay	-1
This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!	-1
This music sucks so bad it would make feces smell good.  Green Day suck and this song is possibly one of the worst, most annoying songs I've had the displeasure of hearing.  Die Green Day.	-1
I really like this song, but $1.29 is a THIRTY PERCENT increase in the price of music.  REFUSE TO PAY for these over-priced songs!  There are plenty still available at $0.99.  Tell the record companies WE WILL NOT PAY MORE!	-1
Wow, has anybody not noticed that this song sounds exactly like What I've Done, just in a different key? That other 1 star review put it correctly. I can't wait to see the new Transformers film, but I don't imagine this making a good theme song. Seriously, Michael Bay needs to stop kissing Linkin Park's arse. This song is very boring and sounds like everything on Minutes to Midnight, and it amazes me that people miss the fact that LP love to put out the same single every year and re-write the lyrics.	-1
i expected better	-1
So glad there not popular anymore. The song is cheesy and way overrated in the 90's. Mmmbop shouldn't be a hit , its more like mmmsuck!	-1

I like Adam, but seriously, he is just screaming throughout the entire song.  I know it's not a good song, or a song that is in the style that he likes, but he could have tried harder to give the song some feeling, and the sense of an actual melody.  I know he's a rocker, but rocker doesn't mean that you don't have to actually try to sing and sell a song.	-1
There is no doubt that the Black Eyed Peas really haven't been able to score the massive success they've had a few years ago with songs like Where Is The Love? and Don't Phunk With My Heart. It has been nearly harder for them since Fergie's solo success with The Duchess. For The Black Eyed Peas latest single, I've Gotta Feeling, the second single from their latest album The E.N.D., it simply shows the group trying to simply try for a much more mature, adult contemporary mix sound to their songs. But sadly, it just isn't a very exciting song, it just doesn't really score at all. I honestly think that Will. I.Am, and company really need to re-evaluate their songs and sounds, and then come back with something that should be more funky and driven, becuase they just don't have the feeling.  Song: D	-1
A couple of words, It's rubbish, totally rubbish, people should not buy this song, I'm warning you, don't waste your money.	-1
I bought it to DJ in a party. The song uses extensive use of Auto-Tune - which corrects sour notes and wrong notes sung but leaves those funny sounding artifacts. The weirder the artifact, the more off the note was sung. The singers must be terrible judging from the amount of Auto-Tune used. There are plenty of singers who can sing on-pitch, there is no need to make stars out of ones that can't. I'd give it a one-star review, but the people in the party liked it just fine and the girls got up and danced to it.	-1
My lovely children can be a bit sneaky. Either that or I just wasn't paying attention when they asked me for it. Probably the latter.	-1
Bought this for a work function, not for me. I am sorry that I could not give a more in-depth review.	-1
I don't get it. I just don't get it. I thought music had hit its low with BEP's musical brain aneurysm "Boom Boom Pow". I can autotune myself vomiting and that would be a better song. But then I heard this song.  I looked it up on a lyrics site and was startled at what I read- 12 people wrote this song. Actually I'm amazed. It took 12 people to write lyrics like:  "I've gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night that tonight's gonna be a good night that tonight's gonna be a good, good night" Which is repeated for roughly 90 seconds before the song even starts. How about:  "Tonight's the night, let's live it up I got my money, let's spend it up" (yeah, rhyming "Up" and "up")  "Monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, friday, saturday, saturday to sunday, Get get get get get with us, you know what we say-say, party every day pppparty every day" (We know what the days of the week are. Party every day???)  Or what about the fact that "That tonight's gonna be a good night" is repeated 18 times, "Do it" is repeated 31 times, or the random use of "Mazel tov" or "L'chiam" (Is this that movie "When The Wind Blows" on acid? "When the BEP Blows"?)???  Yeah the beat is pretty catchy, you gotta admit. Though it's catchy the first time you hear it, and then the next 500 times you hear it makes you wanna find the nearest object that can be used as a weapon, and find some way to use it as means of killing yourself. I'd say "Avoid" but since this drivel is played roughly every 10 minutes, it's really unavoidable.  Poor little state of music.	-1
this song cusses too much so it is not a good song i will not be listening to this song anymore	-1
My lovely children can be a bit sneaky. Either that or I just wasn't paying attention when they asked me for it. Probably the latter.	-1
More Fergie garbage.  This song has possibly the stupidest lyrics I've ever heard...how does manufactured, auto-tuned garbage like this get made? Pure pathetic trash.  I pity anyone who buys this.	-1
It makes no sense and it really is just no good.  I respect the Black Eyed Peas for making catchy songs that you can sing a long to sometimes but this one is just mechanical trash.  Don't bother putting this one on your iPod unless you like the crap that sells and plays on the radio these days.  *rolls eyes*  2 stars.	-1
I actually enjoy BEP..... and then I heard this horrible noise. Hopefully this isn't going to be the "best" song off an upcoming CD.... I can't say how much I hate this song.	-1
This was not as sample and a mistake.	-1
Somewhat annoying to me.  Turn off the bass and it is not bad.  Relaxation music that is a bit annoying will not be used here.	-1
Ok	-1
nick cannon is a punk he let eminem call him a fag and his wife a ho and he wanna say I pray for him man nick is a punk.	-1
When it has came down to Mariah Carey, she hasn't been able to strike that nail on the head with her music lately. The songs on her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel have been very weak, from start to finish, and haven't been able to click to fans as much as her prior records. Her first single from her album, Obsessed, feels a bit overdone. It honestly is a very weak and dormid song for Mariah, compared to her more upbeat R&B and Pop hits from her earlier records, like It's Like That and Honey. I wasn't as impressed at all. I think Mariah needs to find a better sound for herself as a whole for her next album, because it just isn't really the obsession her fans should've gotten. Hopefully, Mariah will do much better in Precious when it does come out next month.  Song: D+	-1
There honestly is no question about the lack of great songs on the radio out there. For Mariah Carey, she honestly has had a lot of lackluster songs that have really been in place on the radio. With the less-than-appealing scale of E=MC2, Mariah tries to deliver a darker song that loses its way heart and soul to the strength of what Mariah should honestly do. That is definitely the case with her latest single Obsessed, the first from her upcoming album Memoris Of An Imperfect Angel. The song is a far departure from the more upbeat and driven songs Mariah had been known for delivering. It really was made in regards against rapper Eminem for targeting Mariah and her husband Nick Cannon and their relationship. It honestly doesn't feel like a actual beef between the two of them, nor does Mariah score the way she used to. If you really must know, I enjoyed Whitney Houston's title track to her upcoming album I Look To You 10x more, and I absolutely recommend that as a must buy for your MP3 player over Obsessed. Mariah really needs to find better material for her music, otherwise she could windup having a huge flop on her hands. We'll see when Memoris Of An Imprefect Angel comes out in late September.

This might be a good song for some people but it wasn't what I thought it was.  I didn't like the beat, or the way it was sung.  I'm into gospel.  It's not a bad song, just not for me.	-1
I wasn't aware we had acquired this until asked to review it and just listened to it.  Despite some good lines in the lyrics, the instrumentation is often shrill and discordant.  It wasn't as bad as chalk screeching on the blackboard, but it is not something I would have deliberately.  The singers have good voices, and if I were more curious, I might try to find out why they chose to use the instruments the way they did.  To be fair, I do know people that would enjoy this, they like "experimental" music, but for me, it was like listening to the kind of jazz or classical music that only real aficionados can appreciate, where the nuances and subtleties go beyond the individual skills and into a realm of appreciation I simply lack.  I dislike reviewing music because tastes are so individual and I suggest  what I suggest to folks I take to a new restaurant.  Taste it, if you don't like it, don't finish it.  But I listened to the whole song.  If you know these folks, you probably already like them, if you don't, hit the 30 second sampler or go to youtube and listen to a video.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I gained the knowledge that Honest Face wasn't my kind of song, but I may give Finn and Jane another listen on their other songs before I make a decision on them.	-1

I think I hit the button by mistake this is totally not my kind of music. I listened a few times	-1

I never purchase this song i don't if no who this person i don't like listen to this type of music.	-1

Not my cup of tea and have deleted it.  Not sure how I even got this. Perhaps it was a freebee but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	-1
If this song is in my Amazon cloud collection, I am unaware of making this purchase.  If i in fact did make this purchase, I don't like this song at all.	-1
This must have been a freebie from Amazon because I didn't purchase it or pay for it, but it is in my account. Listened to it, and nope, I didn't like it at all. Spouse listened to it, and agreed with me.	-1
I do not know what song this one is, so I can not rate it in a fair way, honestly. Sorry about that	-1
this was a free song I had a choice of 3 to pick from on the bright side anytime I want people to leave my house I do put this song on	-1
i didn't care for it , sorry differeance strokes for differences folks . my likes someone else dislikes . sorry	-1
Liam not surprisingly is not living up to his debut, few do.  Perhaps one can consider this of historical interest, not too interesting.	-1

thought this was something else. boring song. thought this was something else. boring song. thought this was something else. boring song.	-1
Can't figure this one out.  I got it with something else but I never listen to it.  I wouldn't recommend it.	-1
Not my style of music i guess.  Every musician has its followers and I am definitely not a follower of this.	-1
I don't even know why this song downloaded on my account. Not my kind of music, and can't say I'd recommend.	-1
This was posted under recommendations for me through other music i had picked off amazon. I thought i liked the little sample of the song but when i downloaded it I wasn't pleased. I would not recommend this song to you. I didn't like it	-1
I got this song because it was free and I am not a fan of it.  Not worth spending money on.	-1
I never got the song to download in any condition that could be played. I'd like to think I'm an optimist because I keep trying to download music from Amazon. Actually I am beginning to believe that it is more stupidity than optimism.	-1
i got this song for free and can't say much about it besides i don't care much for a variety of music it may be worth listening to though.	-1
"Honest Face" by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.	-1
What a great artist. Great voice, great music, great all around. I love this artist and I the success continues.	-1
Poor 'Liam Finn + Eliza Jane', they will be forever known as the group Amazon forced upon us to much dismay. It automatically downloaded when I install some Amazon software. I struggled listening to the song the whole way through. Found no good part. Someone out there probably loves this song, I am definitely not that person.	-1
I really don't do drugs (other than legal ones like caffeine), but in listening to this song again, I can't understand why I downloaded it, except for the fact it is free; but if it isn't very good, why download it?  Anyway, after listening to it a couple of times (to make sure I wasn't missing anything), I feel the song is only worth two stars, and I am planning to delete it from my ipod.  I guess everyone makes mistakes; maybe it was a senior moment for me (since I am over 65).	-1
This song was not a bad, song, or one that would drive most people nuts...itwas nothing like that & maybe that is why I did not care for it.  All I can really say about it is, this song is just not my kind of music. I like REO Speedwagon, Journey, Elton John, traditional Irish Music & jigs, etc...this was none of that.  It was a very easy listening type of Music...elevator music if you will...I know that there are people that like that kind of music, and if you are one of them, then you will prolly like this...but it's just not my style of music.  I give it 2 stars...and I'm being generous.	-1
There really isn't anything here worth buying. The song is pretty much just a boring waste of time. It isn't the worst song ever, but the music is pretty lame, the vocals uninspired, the lyrics repetitive and passe. Nothing here i would go out of my way to listen to, and would definitely never pay money for it.	-1
I don't like writing bad reviews for anything, as peoples styles are as different as night and day.  But I am glad I did not pay for this one...	-1
Missed the boat on this one.  In all fairness, this was a free download to check my media player otherwise it would not be anything I would purchase.	-1
Why this was even on my list of items to review, I never downloaded it.	-1
I don't think I've ever posted a one-star review on Amazon, but when I heard this particular musical travesty, I knew I'd have to put everything else aside and write one immediately -- this "song" is a five-alarm pop-chart EMERGENCY.  After listening to the girl down the hall here in my apartment complex play this thing 38,957,991 times today, I can certify that this abortion of a song is perhaps the single worst piece of pop to ever find a place on Billboard's Hot 100. Owl City's Fireflies hits the nadir in every way that matters: the "vocalist" sings, in a cloyingly earnest and sincere manner, that, "I'd get a thousand hugs/from ten thousand lightning bugs/as they tried to teach me how to dance." Yeah, it's THAT bad. I'm not even kidding. It's like some art-school dropout decided to try his hand at poetry, and, upon realizing that he didn't have the first clue where to begin, went right ahead and stole all the stupid one-liners from a box of Hallmark Cards -- and then forced them all to rhyme together. The vocals are sickeningly-sweet HORRIBLE -- imagine a forced sincerity done in self-autotune (!); the lyrics are nothing but a poorly described bad acid trip -- and the whole stupid mess is placed over "music" that is probably a dumbed-down version of the theme from Sesame Street, but played slightly out-of-key and slowed-down to make it even more unappealing to anybody with ears.  Absolutely rancid.	-1
I abhor this song (look that word up, or just guess it's meaning). I also don't like Lil' Wayne's music either. However, there isn't one song by that rapper that I like less than this wretched song.  The writer (and composer!) needs to be given a good shake for composing such drivel.  Everything about it is just plain horrible!  1 star.	-1

Mariah, Vocally is awesome on this Foreigner cover. But she lyrically ruined it by skipping a whole verse.  I gotta take a little time, A little time to think things over I better read between the lines, In case I need it when I'm older  Now this mountain I must climb, Feels like a world upon my shoulders And through the clouds I see love shine It keeps me warm as life grows colder  In my life  She replaced older with colder to bypass verse 2, lyrically ruining the song. Her awesome vocals make a second star worthy. but the cover was lyrically ruined	-1
There has no been question about Mariah Carey. She has been under a lot of pressure to really deliver with a strong cover. She has had a lot of weak cover songs that she has done over the years, from a lackluster cover of Journey's Open Arms, to a mixed cover of Brenda K. Starr's I Still Believe. While her best cover was of The Jackson 5's I'll Be There, she still needs to really deliver. With her latest single, a cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, the second single from her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, she honestly has not done that. The song was absolutely a very weak and less than strong cover for a few reasons. One of them is that she missed recording an entire verse of the song from when Foreigner did it 25 years ago, and the second is that it missed the heart and soul that had been made from the song for years. Next to when Wynonna Judd covered the song a few years ago, this honestly has to be the least-enjoyed version of the Foreigner classic. I thought this was not a good idea for it to be a single from the album, and I was right. Better luck with Memoirs, Mariah. You really are going to need it, badly!!  Song: D 1/2-	-1
I've seen LLB 4 timed and really like them.  This EP is nowhere as good as their original material.  I recommend you pass on this one!	-1
This Christmas album is beyond painful, beyond wretched: it's simply and completely unlistenable. Providing saccharine settings for the gurgling croak and the gravelly wheeze of a lifelong smoker pretty much defines the word "ill-conceived." Since he's one of the greatest songwriters ever, and since he's donating his profits from this album to good causes, I may forgive Dylan someday, but first I'll have to somehow forget hearing Santa Claus dragged over the coals and the Little Drummer Boy strangled and the Herald Angels scream. Do you hear what I hear? Then plug your ears! What could they have been thinking when they recorded this disgraceful dreck?  I'll give this much to the CD: it's given Amazon reviewers the opportunity to sharpen their wit and lavish the music with the caustic comments it deserves. Allow me to quote a few of them: "He makes Tom Waits sound like Perry Como." "It's enough to make the most devout Christian consider atheism. Giving this two stars. One for each of Bob's tar-filled lungs." "If I were a little kid, I'd run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen. Actually, I may do that myself." "Perhaps a better name for the album would have been 'Your Crazy Uncle Gets Drunk at the Family Christmas Party and Starts Singing.'" "This collection of Christmas cacophony causes me to cringe. Forced to sit through it again I might very well have to hang myself by the chimney with care." "Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever." "Farcical at best and just plain creepy at worst."  Had enough? I think not. You may still be considering a purchase, so permit me to present a few more carefully chosen words of warning: "Just listening curdles my innards." "Possibly the worst album ever recorded." "Like being sucker punched at a birthday party." "An album of Christmas music that could be used to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay." "Jesus Christ, I feel like climbing up on a cross after one listen." "Everyone involved in performing, producing, and distributing this monstrosity should be jailed for assault." "Sounds like karaoke at a nursing home." "Sounds like a cross between Joe Cocker and a chainsaw." "Sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades." "Sounds like he's singing through a tracheotomy." "Sounds like Swamp Thing with a cold." "Dylan ruins Christmas."  Please, please, please: listen to a few of the flabbergasting, nausea-inducing audio clips before you buy. And then don't. Give all the money you would have spent on this abomination to charity and, if you're religious, pray that Bob doesn't make any more albums like this one.	-1
I've listened to this three times now, and I'm still scratching my head asking ''why?" Never the prettiest voice, Dylan now sounds like Louis Armstrong with a cold. The polka (!) 'Must Be Santa' is kind of fun, but is unfortunately the best thing on this poorly produced disc. Am I being too hard on the RnR Hall of Fame legend? Well let's just say: I can't think for you-you'll just have to decide. *	-1
That's all: YIKES! Want to disavow your kids of the notion of Santa Claus, here you go. For anyone still trying to recover from Dylan's take on the Irish tune "Arthur McBride", this entire album will leave you feeling like you got hit by a bus. I don't own this. I have a very sick and demented friend who loves pulling the mickey out of sacrosanct pedagogues. He played this for me. Dylan beat him to the punch with this nightmare. Imagine Mercedes McCambridge doing her devil's voice from the Exorcist warbling "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" and you've about got it. It's all in a good cause, but still, did we have to go here? I'm heading for the Scotch.	-1
I was appalled to hear how bad Bob Dylan's voice has gotten. I played it for several friends, many of whom weren't sure it even WAS Bob Dylan. Most commented that, if not for his past success, most any label (certainly not a major one) would have NEVER released such a dreadful series of tracks on CD or any other medium. Dylan is another reason that the tobacco drug must be banned now!	-1
Maybe I have been listening to many quality musicians recently and that's why this sounds so bad?!! I'm not sure where anyone involved in this project was going with this product, it seems rather comical. I admire Bob Dylans body of work though I never thought of him as a singer, but as an interpreter of his historic work. I hope the proceeds exceed to feeding the hungry because after hearing this, I feel like throwing up!	-1
Not what you would think.	-1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
I do not know who these performers are but they are not James Ingram and Linda Ronstadt.  i would not buy this.  i would buy the An American Tail Sound Track album.	-1
I deeply hate this guy. I hate every "Music Hit" he makes. I hate all the "funny" Covers he thinks he makes from well known music hits. Either considered as a Parody or not, his "Music" is awful. His voice is the WORST voice I've ever heard (even worse than my own, which is horrible).  I would give him -********** (MINUS ten stars) if such option would be available in Amazon.com.  If there's still anybody that thinks Weird Al Yankovic is an "Artist"... Well, maybe you could be very happy living with Bizarre Superman in planet XYZ. Not in this world.	-1
There does not need to be yet another Al greatest hits album.....just more of the same here, nothing new and it's not that great to begin with.	-1
I like TSS. I've seen Glen and Marketa in concert and they seem like pretty cool people. Their live performances are incredible. The soundtrack to "Once" is simply amazing, flawless even. That's why it's shocking to have heard this album and come away numb and bored. "Strict Joy" is a real disappointment. There isn't anything on it anywhere nearly as memorable as to be found on "Once". I will say that it's not completely unlistenable. It could sound ok as background, ambient music in a coffeehouse, but it's nothing that grabs your attention and has you coming back for more. I don't know what went wrong with this album, but it surprises me greatly to call it what it mostly is: dull.	-1
This is the first TSO purchase I wish I didn't make. I guess it's just different than what I was Hoping for.	-1
I thought it was a cute commercial song and found out that this particular song didn't cut the mustard for me. Sorry!	-1
Perhaps this wouldn't sound so bad if Carly's originals weren't so great. I don't own this disc, but the samples are unconvicingly bad. I respect those who like this, but to my ears she sounds worn out. Sorry Carly, I'm RUNNING back to the original versions.	-1
After listening to this recording, I was a bit a confused.  It was very repetitive and felt like a poor attempt at a rock opera.  I also heard hints of other songs throughout the recording.  Some were so blatantly similar I almost considered them a sample, but the liner notes didn't give credits to any song samples.  There were very few melodies that were truly noteworthy, but otherwise it was a tedious listen.  I think the main problem with this recording is it doesn't know what it wants to be or should be.  It doesn't really tell a story, it's not a rock opera, it's not two CDs chock full of various songs, it's not really anything...but many minutes of generalized music.  I have already relegated this CD pair to the "background music" portion of my collection.  At least I didn't have to pay an arm and leg for it.	-1
Old, but it is one of the originals and so it is good dance music as well as sing along.	-1
Let me put this straight: the Strokes were not that good and I did not like them. So if you don't agree with this, do not read any further. It is true that they appeared at a time which was a low ebb for rock in general. But it was mainly their looks and attitude that made the impact. Their recorded output has been pretty small and of irregular quality. Even Is This It is not a masterpiece. Their recorded output has been marred by a sloppy sludgy sound and missing bite iin thier attitude. This impression of boredom also permeates the first solo record by Julian Casablancas. The cover of the record is ultra-weird, with all these red colors additionally to the HMV dog (what's his name again) together with a phonograph: he is on EMI, get it? Julian Casablancas also stares blankly at us and the record conveys this blank impression. As I wrote the production is not good and the sound really muddy. He has added keyboards this time (on french TV he had a pretty keyboard player at least) but they can barely be hard to great effect. Also there are no real tunes and he sounds bored. At least Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers knew how to be bores but still have that added "je ne sais quoi" that made them great:now there was a great NY rock band. This is the cheap version. Even Television was better. While 11th dimension is clearly the best song, it is not great: it starts really well but then instead of winding up it suddenly gets caught in a boring groove. Sad to say guys but this is not a good record.	-1
I agree with other reviewers who write that Stills has lost his voice, and it seems his energy.  Don't know why Rhino felt this needed to be recorded and released.  I was about half way through "Rock and Roll Woman" and switched over to the Buffalo Springfield version.  Thousand times better.  Sure, that was like in '67, but if you can't live up to the high standards you set in the first place, then don't try to reprise these classics.  Find some more old blues tunes that you can still play well on the guitar, and for wich a whispering/growling vocal can work.  It is sad to see a great artist become diminished, but aren't we all as we grow older?	-1
I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.  He needs Young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and Crosby/Nash to step up his vocals.  I was disappointed with this CD/DVD and will probably  put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while (maybe).	-1
Overprocessed pap garbage, like so much of what is released as an excuse for "music" these days.  Back to Joe Bonamassa, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and other TALENTED artists!	-1
It was not the clean version.	-1
Illuminati puppet! Wake up and open your eyes people.	-1
A sad and pathetic display of pure ego, some of the worst junk I've ever had to sit and listen to. When are these contemporary artists going to stop writing music that might as well have come from the '50s and '60s?  Rock is DEAD, vocals and lyrics are DEAD, the guitar as the featured instrument is DONE.  Rock song structure is so boring because we've had to listen to it our whole lives.  People need to wake up and find that there's a whole nation of artists out there making great music that's called "post rock," without vocals and lyrics, without a dominating guitar, without that awful, repetitive rock song structure.  We are in the post-Christian, postmodern era;  WAKE UP PEOPLE!	-1
Same garbage every record company is pumping out just with more annoying (sniffing own farts) cover art, they guy looks/sounds like a total joke.	-1
Ok, this smells like "Desperate Measures" but taken literally.  Most bands will NOT make a live album or DVD after ONE release.  Not saying HU made a terrible choice, but it sounds like Swan Songs didn't go as far as they wanted it to.  I absolutely love HU, but this was not a smooth choice.  Linkin Park and Mudvayne made the same mistake but luckily they redeemed themselves.  HU just seemed desperate for money with this release.	-1
Hollywood Undead is about ten years too late with there gimmick. While I do enjoy there first album, it kicks off strong with Undead but after that it's basically the same song over and over again with different lyrics. Desperate Measures is a stop gap album (an album released between studio releases to keep fans happy) and it shows. Ive seen this band live and I don't remember it being bad but nothing i'd run and go tell everyone about. The cover songs are pretty bad as well. I wouldnt recommend this cd to anyone, although I do know there is some hardcore Hollywood Undead fans out there, and just wait for there new album which should be released.	-1
This bands sucks, cannot sing, have crap beats, butcher good songs from Zeppelin & the Crue and just sound like ten year olds trying to be no talent rappers.  I hope Zeppelin and the Crue have these no talent losers killed after they hear the total mockery of their timeless hits.	-1
I got this album, and it was my favorite cd that I had. Ok I looked up the lyrics, and I was surprised!!! Why??? Because all of the songs talked about God. I belive in God, but I don't like listening to stuff like this. I felt like I was associating with demons or something. My beliefs are not the same as theirs.  I will throw it away. The songs sound good, but they're just too bad to listen to. I would have given this no stars, if it would've let me. Anyway this cd honestly in my opinion is 0/5!  Please sing about something else, Flyleaf. I will no longer get their albums until they don't have any more songs about religion.	-1
I was supposed to get 50 pieces of music but only got 2.  Only the first 2.  What a ripoff.	-1
This U2/coldplay ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a Target commercial. That's all this crappy song is good for, a crappy Target commercial!	-1
When it has deeply came right down to Beyonce', she has honestly been one of the most overexposed artists in music history. Not only with I Am Sasha Fierce, but when you release too many singles from an album, it gets kind of annoying and you want to go to somewhere else. Her lastest single Why Don't You Love Me from the extended version of I Am Sahsa Fierce isn't honestly a very strong song at all. When I truthfully saw the video, I thought it was weak as a mouse. But the song really isn't Beyonce' at her best nor is it a good song. I think she should truthfully take a break, find a new creative source for her music and her sound and come back in a while to find something better to give to her fans. Why Don't You Love Me, the answer is very simple. It is a bit of overexposure to what Beyonce' has given. She really didn't give her best this time around.  Song: D	-1
. . .and it was called "La Isla Bonita" by Madonna and "Don't Turn Around" by Ace of Base. I have both songs on MP3 as well as "Alejandro." So I guess this is the new thing now: combine 2 or more songs from back in the day, add your own insipid lyrics to it, and -Wala!- a "new" "original" hit song! Why would I pay any money for that? What a rip off!	-1
There is no question that sometimes there can be too much exposure of an artist, that it does honestly feel like it can be more tiresome and bothered than it really was before. That honestly is the case with Lady Gaga. She has had so much overexposure, that it feels like the organic appeal of her songs has honestly lost their welcome. That honestly is the case with her latest song Alejandro, from The Fame Monster. I really didn't find the some to be anything really special nor strong. It really felt like she was taking the page from Madonna with Gag's take on style of La Isla Bonita. Sadly for Lady Gaga, the song really isn't a definitive song for her. I think she really should try and give her fans absolutely something new, and go away for awhile. Alejandro didn't have the spanish guitar worth singing to.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to Lady Gaga, it seems as if she is trying to get the overexposure that a lot of the younger wannabe acts have had like Rihanna and Beyonce'. Unfortunately for her, that shows absolutely less-enthustiatic and poor chemistry that she and Beyonce' have shown with their collaboration, Telephone from Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster. I really wasn't very impressed that she would honestly take the same kind of page that Beyonce' had brought out last year with Video Phone from Beyonce's extended version of I Am Sasha Fierce, where she made a simple song, and turned it into a made-up collaboration with absolutely no chemistry. I think Lady Gaga really should and try to know when to hole it and fold it, because it definitely wasn't fully shown here. Maybe her next single will be better than just getting a dial tone, and nobody will answer on the other side.  Song: D	-1
DID NOT LIKE THIS SONG IT WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL  DONT KNOW ABOUT THE ALBUM	-1
Honestly, when I heard Rihanna's latest album, I really didn't feel any bit of the energy she seemed to have poured out from Good Girl Gone Bad. I wasn't very surprised about that at all. That definitely didn't seem to shine for one single bit from her latest album Rated R, and her 4th single from that album, Rude Boy. I really wasn't very impressed with the song at all. She brought in more of a Reggae feeling to the song that seemed like it was trying to score points from her Pon De Replay days. Unfortunately, it really didn't show at all. Honestly, she should try to do more for her songs, but that may've been because of what she went through last year in her personal life. But honestly, she should definitely do better for her next single, and for Rihanna's next album in whole.  Song: D	-1
here's a song about how much Rihanna loves to get banged. just what people want their pre pubescent kids listening 2 on tha radio-lol	-1
I am in no way a fan of katy's musical output but these songs sound dumb unplugged, if they were rock songs or guitar songs then yes unplugged would work but pop dance songs like kissed a girl and hot n cold are bad and is and far worse acoustic.  Is this a joke?	-1
The orchestral pieces have a lot of white noise in the background and many songs cut off half way through.	-1
Huge comics fan, especially DC.  The animated movies are really a Trademark to movie making without a doubt! Wow I really wanted to like this but it was barely watchable!  Unfortunately the director didn't think highly of jonah Hex.	-1
This was quite terrible and you could tell whenever it came out it was quite the afterthought. Great idea but the execution wasn't there	-1
Just wanted to vote the one star to bring the rating down. This movie betrays the titular character. That's all.	-1
I thought it notable that Josh Brolin was embarrassed by this movie, and he is the star. It is more of an eye candy flick, with enough violence and shots of prostitute playing Megan Fox, but other than that, the movie was lackluster at best. This was not the best effort from Malcovich, who is really a fine actor in most movies i've seen him in, IMO. The action seemed a bit too contrived, the humor forced, the story gutted. Not at all the way to pay homage to the comic book series.	-1
Well I went into this movie not knowing anything about the comic book character of Jonah Hex.  In fact I had no idea it even *was* a comic book character.  The description for the movie sounded appealing to me, so I made the horrendous decision to watch it assuming I was going to be impresed by an action flick but.. wow does it ever seriously unquestionably STINK!  Good luck trying to follow along to any kind of storyline.  The pacing of the film mainly focuses around cheesy explosions coming out of nowhere, a woman who works as a prostitute and her daily struggles dealing with men who want to kill her, and people lying dead in the ground coming back to life for a few minutes to reveal important information before quickly slipping back into death again.  I really don't get any of this of course.  Just keep in mind that you probably need to understand the comic book character of Jonah Hex in order to grasp the storyline.  Otherwise you'll be left sitting there totally confused and uninterested in just about everything taking place on screen.  Even without understanding any of the storyline segments, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to realize the acting is terrible all around.  I'm disappointed because the description said absolutely *nothing* about this movie being based on a comic book because if it had, I surely wouldn't have bothered watching it.	-1
I like steampunk. I like Weird West. I like comic book adaptations. I like movies that bust out of the usual genre cliches.  But it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for "Jonah Hex" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of "Wild Wild West" and "Van Helsing," with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.  Jonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.  Then the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building "the weapon" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).  I wish I could give a better summary of the plot in "Jonah Hex," but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.  Basically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden ("Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead"), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for "the weapon," it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?  I'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.  "Jonah Hex" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of "Mystery Science Theater 3000." Give it a pass.	-1
I don't know about anyone else, but for a die-hard comic geek like me, seeing a Jonah Hex movie is a bit of a strange thing.  Regardless, here we are with Josh Brolin no less playing the scarred bounty hunter, and John Malkovich playing his nemesis Turnbull.  The surprising production values and the even more surprisingly noteworthy cast of actors could have really combined to make Jonah Hex a worthwhile comic adaptation, but sadly, the end result isn't anything really worth writing home about, albeit the film itself is not nearly as terrible as early teasers and its poor box office had suggested.  Hex is on Turnbull's tail as the villain plans to watch America burn in flames during its centennial event, with Hex's partner being that of a prostitute (Megan Fox, because they figured eye candy would be better than Hex's male comic ally Batlash).  A majority of the action scenes are shallow, not to mention the violence of which and authenticity of the old west are just watered down to comply with the PG-13 rating.  Still, Brolin is decent enough as Hex (and the prosthetic makeup isn't bad either), Malkovich mails it in, Fox's brief role is nothing more than said eye-candy, and even other actors such as Will Arnett, Aidan Quinn, Lance Reddick, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in an uncredited cameo don't seem to have too much interest in the proceedings.  Michael Fassbender (Inglourious Basterds and soon to be seen as the young Magneto in the X-Men prequel) isn't bad as Turnbull's irish, tattooed henchman, but that's pretty much it.  All in all, Jonah Hex is a brisk endeavor that isn't nearly as bad as one would think, but as said before, there isn't a whole lot to admire here either.	-1

A total waste of two great acting talents, Josh Brolin and John Malkovich, Jonah Hex gets mired in an awkward mess of a script, CGI over-dependence and a plot that feels more like an episode of The X-Files meets Wild Wild West than "Revenge Gets Ugly," the movie's tag line.  When Dr Loveless...I mean Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich) decides he wants to find the "Nation Killer" weapon to nuke President Grant in some sort of Confederate Resurrection plot, the man Turnbull tortured and forced to watch the murder of his wife and child, Confederate Soldier Hex (Brolin) out of 'retirement' to track his old nemesis down. However, Hex has an extra talent via the Crow Indians who brought him most of the way back from the dead; he can talk to corpses once he touches them. If Hex can stop the plot, he will be a free man and forgiven his Confederate and murderous bounty hunter sins. So, OK, a pretty good premise.  But the movie is paced so choppily that its very tough to follow. Both Hex and Turnbull are played in a dry and droll manner, leaving Michael Fassbender to pick up the slack as the sole character to show any sparks. There are some interesting cast members here (Aidan Quinn as President Grant, and both Will Arnett and Tom Wopat are involved), but again, the convoluted script leaves little room for characther development. Megan Fox is here, playing a monochromatic prostitute with a soft spot for Hex. After watching this stillborn mess of a movie, she's probably the only one left who does.	-1
How can you give this movie anything but a 1 star? I would give it less if I could. This is not a place to review the comic (DC) or what he had on his belt. It is a review of the movie. And most of the reviewers have not seen the movie, and I do not think most people will see it, WITH GOOD REASON! Its total box office in its first weekend was a whopping $5,085,000. That is pathetic! They were hoping to cash in on Megan Fox. It did not work. It is a rehash, redone to death, shooter film. Its jokes are old, its plot line is old, and its action is old (oooo big bang, big explosion, big guns)  If you have nothing to do, and I mean nothing, including watching paint dry, go see this movie and waste your money and time.  0 out of 5 Stars.	-1
I bought this because I liked one of the songs I heard on the radio.  Unfortunately it is the only song on the CD I actually like.  I wouldn't say the others are bad, just mediocre.	-1
I have seen LA on TV and liked what i heard so i bought this cd and was not that pleased felt the production was lacking i did borrow there first cd from my library and was really pleased with what i heard so this one is not a winner in my book .	-1
What is it with country music? It is SO predictable, all sounds the same, and the voices do too. I thought I would give this album a chance since the title track was covered by Shakira and Keith Urban on American Idol in recent times. I have listened to the album 5 times and it is so boring. Not one track stands out as an amazing composition. In fact it sounds like Taylor Swift at times. It sounds like other country singers too. Why do people like this sort of music? Country music is almost as bad as listening to rap.	-1
My mom made me order this crap	-1
I am thoroughly disappointed with this album. Lady Antebellum seem energetic on TV but half the songs featured here are sooooo boring; they lack real energy and fervor and are too soppy for my liking. The best song on here is the gorgeous and uptempo "Run to You", which ironically is a bonus track! What a disappointment!	-1
This song becomes more and more depressing as time goes along so I deleted it.	-1
I love the song. However it NEVER downloaded and therefore I have paid for nothing. I don't like beimg ripped off. There is nowhere to lodge a complaint so I'm  doing it here.	-1
i used to like this song a little bit, but then it got really overplayed and it got really annoying.	-1
I don't like this artist very much or this song really. I'm not sure what else to say about this.	-1
Little more than uninspired fan exploitation, this is the electronic pioneers weakest link, hardly even disguised in sexed-up production as usual (though there are enough studio "tricks" utilized to keep things above zombified).	-1
When it has came down to pop music right now, it has definitely gone to be pretty bland lately for so many younger female acts. With lackluster songs from Katy Perry, Rihanna and now with Ke$ha, there just hasn't been a lot to really go around. Ke$ha's latest single, Your Love Is My Drug isn't really anything different from what has been shown by the poor stamina of Blah, Blah, Blah. I really wasn't at all very impressed nor driven into the song. I Think she needs to fine tune her own signature sound, and make the next single something to say her love can be better than her drug.  Song: D	-1
There are sometimes newer artists that can be strong, but others that cna make music that feels like it is mediocre, and that is honestly the case with newcomer Ke$ha. While she does have might feel like she have a domiant vibe with younger audiences, she unfortunately doesn't have a strong appeal. Her second single from her debut album Animat, Blah Blah, Blah feels like a waste on the ears. While the beat isn't very strong, the feeling of her voice and the lyrics to the sound is absolutely horrible. I wasn't very amused with the single, and I felt it was not a good song. If she really is going to deliver, she should try harder with a better song that is all her own.  Song: D 1/2-	-1
I love the ORIGINAL SONG. It does not say someone changed it and added a rap to it. Thats not what I wanted and looking at the ORIGINAL album cover, thats not what was on the song.  Annoyed I paid for a something I didn't want. I have to see if I can find the original. Hey Amazon, when you change a song, let the customer know!	-1
After his 2006 album "Release Therapy", Ludacris seemed to get a lot of criticism for a deeply personal album that wasn't really that bad. He bounced back with his best effort to date- 2008's "Theater Of The Mind" and things seemed to be going well- at least that's how Ludacris tells it. He talked about a concept album called "Battle Of The Sexes"- a duet album between himself and Shawnna (best known for appearing on his song "What's Your Fantasy" and her hit "Gettin' Some"). Unfortunately, Shawnna abandoned the project midway through completion, and rather than shelve the album, Ludacris soldiered on with the project. The end result is Shawnna appearing only on three songs- "I Do It All Night", "B.O.T.S. Radio" and the phone sex inspired "Feelin' So Sexy".  There are other guests who fill the absence left by Shawnna. Nicki Minaj steps in for the song "My Chick Bad", Ne-Yo appears on the Swizz Beatz produced "Tell Me A Secret", and Trey Songz makes a cameo on the rather dull "Sex Room". The songs "Everybody Drunk" and "Party No Mo'" are horribly out of place on this album. In fact, the only song that actually is in line with the concept of the album is "B.O.T.S. Radio". Things come to a close with the final track, The Neptunes produced "Sexting" which makes light of the Tiger Woods scandal. The problem with this album- aside from the production- is the album overall is misleading regarding the concept of "Battle Of The Sexes". The album title should have been "Pandering To The Sexes" being that is what's done on the entire album. If you're a Ludacris fan, you may want to sit this one out.	-1
I will cut straight to the chase with this review. This album while better than Chicken N Beer is still suspect. The problem with it is that Ludacris is trying too hard to pander to the ladies instead of being that gifted MC we all know he's capable of being. This album sounds like the wack albums that LL Cool J has been recording after The G.O.A.T. Before I get to what makes this album bad I will talk about the good.  Hey Ho feat Lil Kim and Lil Fate is not bad. B.O.T.S. Radio feat I.20 and Shawnna is cool too. The Intro fools you because it causes you to believe that this album is going to be hot which you will hear later on is not. My Chick Bad feat the extremely overrated Nicki Minaj and the remix feat Eve, Diamond and Trina might get some rotation. Tell Me A Secret with Ne-Yo gets a pass too. That is where it stops.  The Bad: How Low is perhaps the most boring club record in recent memory. I don't care how many times the radio tries to beat that song into your subconscious, the track sucks! Equally boring tracks would follow in the form Cant Live With You feat Monica(which is a waste of her talent and your time), Party No Mo feat Gucci Mane and Everybody Drunk feat Lil Scrappy. I Know You Got A Man must be the most painfully bad song for the ladies that I've heard next to Ja Rule's Mesmerized feat Ashanti. I hope I'm not the only one that thinks that Sexting is corny as hell and should have never made it to disc and listen to this cheesy hook while you're at it  "So I'm just sitting in this rehab class/ trying to get myself unhooked on a**/ so then my teacher asked me a question/ Like Ludacris are you over there sexting/ Ha ha OMG/ Lol KIT/ Smiling faces / X and O/ LMFAO"(??????!!!!???).  In short this album is a mess. I know people love Ludacris and thinks he is a tight lyricist but don't use that as an excuse to see past this album's glaring flaws. I love Ludacris and think he's a tight MC too. I thought Theater Of The Mind was an excellent album but Battle Of The Sexes SUCKS! This album sounds like something LL Cool J would make(thats why I gave my review that title). You don't believe me? Listen to Cant Live With You, Sex Room, I Do It All Night, I Know You Got A Man, Feelin So Sexy and Tell Me A Secret and imagine LL Cool J's rhymes about women over those tracks. Now you see what Im talking about. thumbs down.  Standouts: B.O.T.S. RADIO, HEY HO, TELL ME A SECRET, MY CHICK BAD(original and remix).	-1

this is a bad remake you have akon, lil wayne, and t pain in one song and they're all using autotune come on and oh yeah you got ll cool j, busta rhymes, and swizz beats rapping in it yes put these lame clowns in it make sure the kids dig it we'll add hip hop and autotune and put usher in it you know girls love usher add celine dion, and jennifer hudson you know she was on dreamgirls guess wyclef and lionel richie couldn't afford beyonce or was she and sasha fierce too high and mighty to participate or was she and her hubby jayhova god somewhere on the fake elysian fields pretending their zeus and hera. anyway pink's and I think miley cyrus in it withn the jonas brothers but still I prefer the old version and oh yeah for a special treat they added mj's vocals from the old 1 to make sure he didn't miss out yeah we really need this.	-1
The comparisons to Macy Gray, Adele, Angela McCluskey and Amy Winehouse are so painfully obvious you initially wonder if this is parody. Can't fault her too much for having great influences. Gin Wigmore's performance outshines the material with more misses than hits here. Her voice is compelling but with few exceptions, most of this has already been done better by the aforementioned. Standout track- "Hey No".  [..]	-1
HERE I AM!!! IS THE BEST THING ON HERE,also, if You Were My Man!!!.Everything else was wacc even that weak sample of "Silly".Shout's ta Lady Dee Dub,also checc out "Free",It's Gonna Take..., & That Family Ties Theme Song.	-1
Monica has a lovely voice, but her music has never matched the caliber of her instrument. "Still Standing" is a typical r&b CD loaded with generic fillers and sampled classics. I listened to this CD and was highly disappointed. It's another boring CD that I will put in a corner and watch it collect dust.	-1
i can not rate this as i never ordered it and can h=only hope that i didn't have to pay for it	-1
I have to start off by saying that "Naturally" and "100 Days, 100 Nights" were absolutely superb. I have listened to those albums several times over.  So when I put this new disc on, I was initially surprised...at how mediocre it is. I didn't think I'd be writing that, but it's the truth. The songs just aren't strong. As I listened to each cut, I wasn't feeling it. I kept waiting for that quality to kick in, but this album is a misfire. I listened to it only a couple of times, then put it away. I won't be playing it again anytime soon. Unlike their previous albums, this one just doesn't demand repeat listening.  It strikes out, but I have no doubt the talent is still there to comeback with something on par with "Naturally" and "100 Days, 100 Nights" again.	-1
I've read a lot of positive reviews of this album, claiming that Coheed had ripped off Rush and Iron Maiden in their previous records, and that this may be the most "them" album yet. If that's the case, then I think Coheed should go back to ripping off Rush and Iron Maiden.  Coheed are very talented, and frustratingly so. If anything, the first two albums are two of the greatest achievements in Prog Rock if you ask me. Then their third album came ad it was somewhat quite middling. A lot of good on there, a lot of decent, a lot of bad. Then the fourth, No World For Tomorrow... I don't think there were any memorable tunes on that disc. OK, I Liked the title track and Gravediggers and Gunslingers. And On The Brink was good too.  Well, with this album, Josh is gone. In comes Chris Pennie, an extraordinarily talented drummer. A nice bloke too, I met him back in October. Also returning is the lack of any memorable songs. None of the tunes on this disc would rate above a 2/5.  I actually don't like any of the songs of this disc. As I stated, the highest I can give any of the songs is a 2/5. Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it. The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live, and even that track sounds out of place, like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed. The best tune on the album, This Shattered Symphony, Has an amazing opening and chorus, but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus. Same thing with Guns of Summer, despite the awesome drumming. The Broken starts off awesome but quickly falls flat on it's face. World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying, and threw them into one song.  I can't even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut, with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy. The intro to In The Flame of Error and the chorus rule but everything else is ruined by what ruins the whole album- Coheed having interesting parts of songs, then suddenly going off into a wild tangent. Hence the "pretentious" part. They're trying too hard.  Then of course, what should be The highlight ofthe album is actually their worst song EVER, and may even be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It is essentially just noodling around for 7 minutes. Not even the bizarre and creepy coda at the end could redeem it. Here's the thing guys. I love heavy metal. I love electronica. I love Prog. I don't love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once, thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.  Also, the lyrics are disastrous. I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating. Here they've clearly taken a step back in that department. "Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!" ugh, seriously? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.  Look, Coheed are much better than this. They have TALENT. They can actually write tunes. They can explore their creativity in ways no other modern band can. But this album just bores me. I sincerely hope they can make a comeback with their next disc.	-1
The first album grew on me for a short time but it got tired like AC/DC real quick.  Bullet are way better than this outfit.	-1
What Airbourne needs are some serious lyrics. If these guys cant write songs buyem or get someone to write them  for you! The music potential is certainly there but gives nothing without some rocking lyrics. I going to go way out  on a limb and predict that the best of Airbourne is out there in the future. I love the ACDC style but the lyrics  just make me wanna sit them down and have a good heart to heart. Come on guys write us some good songs slow it down  just a dash and power rock the hades out of it. Maybe oneday Airbourne will be Shock and Awe ! Sorry but Im the  TNROCKDOC and these guys could take some lessons from lets say Krokus... yeah that would do it.	-1
Meh, was hoping for something else...but got this. I think I'll keep this "in the cellar"	-1
This is not the original Fallin' In Love we remember from Frank & Hamilton!  Do some research and bring back the recording done in the mid-70s!	-1
I'm sure everyone was curious to hear this album with "Ordinary World."  This song debuted in the late 90's.  Beforehand, all their stuff was from the 80's.  "...ours is just a little trouble at all..." I'm sure is a fav lyric by most of their fans. It's not your traditional slow song.  You will also like "Come Undone."  I also have the trance version of "Ordinary  World."	-1
Yeah, I'm a Dixie Chicks fan, and they've been kind of dormant for a few years now, so I was a bit excited regarding two-thirds of the group putting out a "side project", the Court Yard Hounds with their self-titled disk.d  Side project is in quotes because only part of me believes the Chicks will record again and that this is really the new full-tine gig of sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire.  While talented in their own right - both sisters are very accomplished multi-instrumentalists and songwriters - they do lack a certain spark that Natalie Maines brought to the trio as their vocalist.  And overall, I'm being nice.  CYH is kind of snooze of an album.  It has all the right intentions and a lot of talent, but like I said, no spark.  With all due respect to the sisters, they were wise to hire a lead singer of Maines' capabilities.  There is a reason the sisters sing harmony and backing vocals.  While fully capable singers, there is nothing distinctive about what they do here.  There are hundreds of female vocalists already out there who sing with mediocrity ("April's Love", "Skyline", "Fear of Wasted Time", "Well Behaved", etc).  Too add insult to injury, they pick the least charismatic collaborator when having Jakob Dylan duet on one song.  He doesn't even compliment the lead vocal.  There are a few songs that have the right idea, but aren't quite there - like "Delight (Something New Under the Sun)", that you can't think if Maines were taking the lead vocals, it would work.  And then there are ones that are a slight notch above that where they make an attempt for something above a pulse, or a chart position: "The Coast", "I Miss You".  I do like "Ain't No Son". The CHY finally kick it up, but you can't help but wonder how out of the park it could/would have been with Maines singing this.  Still, had more of the disk been like this song, it would have been a worthy purchase.  I wasn't expecting a Dixie Chicks disk, but I was expecting something more creative and not so bland.	-1
I don't know who this is, but remove it from my "orders"  I am going to the bank to refute these false orders.	-1
I love the original version of this song. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to this version before purchasing it. When I did listen to it, it was so drawn out,  that I stopped it before it even ended. Wish I would have listed to it before buying it. Bummer.	-1
This a poor effort for real bluegrass, I can think of so many bands that have made better bluegrass CDs this year, Josh Williams, The Grascals, Audie Blaylock to start with. This will work on CMT , but not up on the ridge.   His voice cracks alot on some songs,it sounds gravelly. The sound of the instruments are all washed out in reverb, YEEEEha!!	-1

I think is time to Korn retire from the music industry...The last 2 or 3 Korn albuns are not good, Take a look mirror and See the other side got each one 2 or 3 good tracks...REMENBER WHO YOU ARE maybe got 1 decent song, POP A PILL...Korn just can't record decent albuns in more than a decade now...It's time to quit, KORN...	-1
Every song on this album sounds the same.  When the first song sucks and all the rest sound just like it.....you have an album that sucks.	-1
I been a fan of Korn since Issues came out in 1999 its the first CD of Korn I purchased. Korn III: Remember Who You Are is really a disappointed in an album from Korn, it reminds me alot of their 2003 album "Take A Look In The Mirror" which featured the original lineup before Brian "Head" Welch and David Salvia left the band. I will give Munky, Fieldy, Jonathan Davis, and Ray Luzier create for trying make the sound of the earlier albums along with Ross Robinson returning to produce the album after being gone since the bands Life is Peachy album which is the last album he produced with the band. It is no way a return to the earlier sound of Korn though in a few tracks you can hear a few nods to Korn's earlier albums. I think alot of songs could use more work in them as I came away kinds not impressed with the album. I am not a huge fan of Korn by the way kinda of a follower of Korn but not a die hard fan. Issues got me into them and I avoided their recent albums Untitled and See You On The Other Side after Brian left the band. I really think the band should continue if that what makes them happy though most will say that the band is done with. They really could build on the sound of Korn for the next album if they chose to. Not a bad album by any means just not what die hard fans would want in a Korn album. If you want the older sound then listen to Issues, Life is Peachy, Korn, etc. Or listen to Heads album Save Me From Myself if you want the missing sound of Korn. Also Jonathan's whinny sound needs to stop, i know its what fans love but its way overdone and Korn should probably go in a different direction. It was great 15 years and I understand is but fans love about Korn but I really don't need it now when the guys are in their 40's with families and really successful in life.	-1
I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea. Ever since 'Untouchables', there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of Korn albums, and for those of you who think I'm dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of Head, both 'Untouchables' and 'Take a Look in the Mirror' featured Head as the lead guitar. 'Untouchables' was a good album, not great. 'Mirror' was still decent, and I'll admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both 'See You on the Other Side' and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album. However, a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album.  I think its safe to say the the "Korn sound" was lost after 'Issues', and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album. When you listen to their early work, the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from "Daddy" on their debut album to "Somebody Someone" off of 'Issues.' With the release of 'Untouchables', the Korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the 1950s. With each track, it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a 'catchy' chorus. This is not to say the albums released since 2000 have been bad, they just aren't worthy of a 5-star rating.  This new release sounds closer to "Mirror" than the last two, but it lacks the creativity that really separated Korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio waves. Does Jon Davis sound angrier on this album than the last two? Yes. Does he growl more? Sure. Are the lyrics memorable. No. Does the music stand out? Not really. I sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because I've been starved for new material, but lately I've been taking the time to really listen before I judge, and I ask myself if I'll feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road. In 6 months, listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and they'll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the CD or turned it on via an MP3 player. They'll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isn't that great.  I don't want to rip the band because they're still one of my favorites, but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression. Either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul. The album is not terrible, but it's unremarkable and candidly, it's also forgettable. My $.02	-1
While technically competent - the Randolph Family Band cannot in any way, shape or form come close to the magnificent, ethereal recordings of Blind Willie Johnson and the other sanctified singers from the 20s. What all the fuss is about is beyond me - competent but no SOOOOOOUUUUUULLL! Music by robots.	-1
Although Sweat was never one of my favorites, I think that there was something truly unique about his vocal delivery, making him a standout among his peers.  This new release has the singer sounding different from his former self, so much so that he sounds like a new artist...and that is the album's weakness.  He sounds too much like any one of the cookie-cutter singers that fill the so-called "hip-hop/R & B" charts today.  He's trying too hard to appeal to a younger audience, and in the process, he may be alienating his fan base.  The songs on "Ridin' Solo" just don't work because of their over-attention to an electronically-altered Sweat, too similar to the "tricks" used by the much younger Jamie Fox or T-pain.  Former GAP Band front man and solo artist Charlie Wilson is appealing to the young crown while maintaining his legion of older fans because he has not quite "sold out" his integrity and voice, balancing the two camps that are fans of his sound/style.  Keith, you need to give Uncle C a call.	-1

There is no question about Eminem, and the way he has grown noblely into his music with his last single. Not afraid really set a strong tone for his Recovery record, and delivered very well. But for his latest single, Love The Way You Lie, he chooses to turn it into a collaboration with Rihanna. Sadly, the two of them don't have a lot of strong chemistry together. Rihanna has mainly put herself to the side, while Eminem steals the spotlight on the song. I really didn't feel the chemistry on the song. She could've also brought more of her voice into the song just like she could've when she teamed up on Run This Town with Kanye West and Jay-Z. While Eminem handles well, I just feel that Rihanna could've brought more of her A-Game into this collaboration. Don't really love the way this lies. Overall, stick with Eminem's Not Afraid alone.

When it has came down to Eminem, he definitely has shown a strike of better craft on his own with his last single from Recovery, Not Afraid. Unfortunately, when there is always a great song coming alive, there can always be a poor song as well. That is honestly the case with Love The Way You Lie with Rihanna, the second single from his Recovery record. I really didn't honestly feel any of the chemistry that the two of them brought down on the song. Eminem delivered as if he was stealing the show well on the track, while Rihanna doesn't feel like she is delivering at a strong strike. It honestly felt much weaker than her last collaboration with Jay-Z and Kanye West on Run This Town last year. Hopefully, the next time Eminem does a collaboration, he can pick someone he has a lot more in common to deliver with.  Song: D	-1

When buying this song "Everytime We Touch" by Cascada listen to the top three tunes. The third one down or the one that is the slowest version is the most beautiful and romantic. She lets herself flow into the song when it is slower. The faster version feels likes she's trying to race to get to the end of the song. Do not recommend the fast version at all. Yanou's Candlelight Mix CD of this song with Cascada is supreme and melts your soul and heart.  jk	-1
Yeeeesh! Why on earth the hottest woman in rock ever is slumming with this lot is anybody's guess. It's not that the tunes are bad - they're alright - but the minute JP opens his trailer infused yap, it all goes right to the field septic system. As a band, let's just say they'll never be confused with the Pretenders. She should have kept this mob locked in the motel and got on with her own strengths, which are poorly served on this calamity. Skip this.	-1
I have been a fan of Chrissie Hynde and the various incarnations of the Pretenders since day one. I understand this is not the Pretenders and as an artist Hyndes has to experiment and expand her horizons. Hyndes voice is as strong and clear as ever on this collection. This is not the case with her collaborator. For some reason the hostility I feel towards JP is overwhelming. His vocals just irritate me to no end. Listening to Hyndes is always a treat for the ears, but when this hack JP sings it ruins the angelic pipes of Ms. Hyndes. A majority of the tunes have a good melody and are catchy. The problem is we have Ms. Hyndes beautiful God given talent singing in key and giving a heartfelt performance and then you have to hear this Tom Waits wanna be chiming in. It just doesnt work.	-1
Chrissie Hynde is a rock goddess. I think if I saw her in a bar, I'd saunter up to her, too. Which is what happened to JP Jones, a singer of unknown repute until this CD. Seems he and Chrissie had a fling and, once it became apparent that their near 30 year age difference wasn't going to work, they broke it off. But they also decided to make an album about it.  And that album is "Fidelity." It is, believe it or not, the first album Chrissie Hynde has ever released that wasn't under The Pretenders banner. I hate to say this, but it's pretty awful. The soulful, husky voice of Chrissie remains a universal wonder, and when she sings, she still sounds great. JP, on the other hand, has a range of about five notes, and has a problem hitting most of them. When Chrissie opens "Fidelity" with the lament that "I found my perfect lover, but he's only half my age," you can feel that she's still got it as she nears 60. That talent is even more emphasized as soon as JP opens is mouth. He begins interjecting observations into "Perfect Lover" that sound like some joker prank calling the studio and getting caught on-mike.  Which pretty much sums up this album. There are some pretty good songs here just aching to get out ("Your Fairground," "Courage," "Misty Valleys"), but they crash to the dirt every time JP's carny barker donkey-bray hits the speakers. Next to Rufus Wainwright's "All Days are Nights/Songs for Lulu," this album is one of the year's biggest disappointments. Mark JP Jones in your trivia book now.	-1
When it has honestly came down to Enrique Iglesias lately, his songs just haven't deeply strongly showed what he has been able to prove back nearly a decade ago. His songs like Hero and Could I Have This Kiss Forever with Whitney Houston, really were driven and had strong chemistry with his fans. But that strength has been weakened with his latest single which also was featured on the likeness from the Jersey Shore fan base with I Like It, from his latest album Euphoria. I really felt that it just was him trying to prove his dance beats to a new generation of fans was one step too far. It just was just as lackluster as his last album, 7 had shown in his voice. I honestly think Enrique should take a deep look at himself and see what he should do next for his next single, and even for his choice of finding better material for his next record. No, Enrique I Don't like it.  Song: D-	-1

I love the Arcade Fire. They're an interesting band with a style that's hard to define, and a great first 2 albums. I think I may have been 14 when I heard "The Funeral", and it was unlike anything I've heard. I was excited when The Neon Bible came out, and when I heard it, I was on the floor.  Unfortunately The Suburbs is boring and uninspired in comparison here. There's about maybe 3 songs on here that of worthy of listening to over and over, and the rest is all repetitive. I swear after track 2 I was wondering if my vinyl copy was broken/problematic, because it's so damned repetitive. Almost all the tracks have the same pattern of "start off slow/start music about a minute in/delay vocals 30 seconds after/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus/verse/chorus/long end". That, plus Butler's whining is becoming just plain annoying to the point where I wanna superglue his lips together to make sure he doesn't make that grating noise, ever.  We Used To Wait, Empty Room and Suburban war are the 3 tracks that are worthy of listening to, and the rest is boring and repetitive doss. A major disappointment.	-1
Katy Perry is really starting to become annoying. Her mediocre songs and terrible attempts at making music are evident. She needs to give it up already. She is terribly over-rated and I don't know why everyone likes her. Likely cause of her looks, like most artists. No talent and all her songs sound the same. The only sound she ever makes in all her songs is ooooooohhhh	-1

Parents do NOT let your children listen to this! This is NOT a song for children! The lyrics are highly sexual and children under 13 should NOT listen to this! The lyrics melt your popsicle means to make a guy wet with excitement. And seriously the song has "all the ass hanging out" and talking about showing their sexual assets to get guys attention. Parents, STOP being stupid. STOP letting your children listen to sex! Just because you don't physically see the sex does not mean the sex is not there! STOP letting your children listen to this!!! BE a GOOD parent for once!	-1
There is no question that when it has came down to Katy Perry, she has shown that there can sometimes be too much of a sex kitten to make music for. It can be good for some, but in her case it is a bunch of junk. Her latest single, E.T., the 4th single from her sophmore album Teenage Dream isn't really a driven song. She feels more like she is trying so much to be like the music that Lady Gaga. I really didn't like the song at all. It really is even worse than her California Gurls had showed last summer. The single version with Kanye West is also just as bad. I would definitely pass this song up, and go for someone who has a real voice, and not a E.T.  Song: D-	-1

There is no question that there is a lack of really striking music out there. With Katy Perry, she hasn't really grown into her music, and brought out a real feeling of strength where her songs really are delivering. With the title track for her sophmore album, Teenage Dream, I really didn't feel any chemistry she brought out into the song that really was strong. She really could be more grown into her voice, than just being another pretty face next door. I wish her all the best with her marriage to Russell Brand, but I honestly think she needs to grow much more as a singer to be more appealing.  Song: D	-1

this song is generic overproduced garbage. plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there, judging by the five star reviews. i have heard @ least two or three songs out there that sound identical to this piece of dog poopy	-1
The song is awful. The lyrics are horrendous and about pointless sex, encouraging people to have sex just because they feel like it, not because it is right. The vocals are dreadful, the beat is obnoxious, really horrible song and way overplayed. Anyone with any musical taste would never approve of this song. Katy Perry is one of the worst "singers" in history.	-1

NOT for children. Parents do NOT buy or let your children listen to this song. It has the c word in it MULTIPLE times...I have counted how many times but it is at least 20 to 40 times the c word is said in the song. Every time "peacock" is said she means the word without the "pea" in front of it. I repeat do NOT let your children listen to this! The song is about a woman who craves a man's private parts and is mesmerized by the size of it. DO NOT let your children listen to this! This song is in the movie Katy Perry Part of Me DO NOT let your children watch that movie! The C word is said multiple times since part of this song is in the movie! It has a fake PG review since the person who rated the movie clearly did not pay attention to the movie, the movie is actually rated R. And do NOT let your children watch R rated movies.	-1

"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag/drifting through the wind wanting to start again"? I'm sorry what? I don't know what DRUGS she was on when she wrote this song but I'm pretty sure most human beings have never felt like a plastic bag... And what? Plastic bags are inanimate objects - they can't "start" or "stop." She is a joke of a songwriter, and nowhere is this more evident than in the music video. This is supposed to be an empowering anthem, yet she's shooting fireworks out of her boobs? Say what? That's her idea of empowerment? Using sex to sell? Yea count me out.	-1
The beauty in this song is unmatched Katy Perry shows why she is a #1 hit making machine with gorgeous powerful vocals that make you feel something every time she opens her mouth and unleashes a rainbow of beautiful unmatched vocals. This is easily the best song of 2010 and quite possibly the best song of the decade!	-1

This song is so annoying. At first I liked it but it was so over-played and just has become annoying and over-rated, just like the artist who sings it.	-1
This CD lacks effort.  Only one or two decent tracks, the rest of the tracks leave a lot to be desired.  A real downer.	-1
while Brian Mcknight knows what His Zodiac Sign is&the Month He was born in,musically He is truly suffering from idenity Loss. somewhere between the early 80's till early 90's is where Mcknight is swimming in. while He is a Very talented vocalist,Multi Instrumentalist&songwriter it's been quite a while since He has left a mark.on this set He can't make up his mind if He wants to Be R.kelly,Ronald Isley,Prince,&Others.as long as Brian Mcknight has Been around you would think He wouldn't still be trying to find His Own Musical Idenity but going by this Album he truly is spinning in Music Circles&no direction appears in sight. this Cat should be alot further in His Career than he is.	-1
Being a fan of Kiske for a number of years I listen to this album just for the fact that Kiske sings on it.  I was very dissapointed, his voice was as always perfect but the songs and the female vocals were horrid poppy garbage.  This album would be better if Kiske was singing and all the music/female vocals were removed, thats how bad it got....oh and if there was some actual songwrighting would have helped too instead of this emotional style trainwreck.	-1
I choose this rating because it is a ok song. They have done songs that I like better then this one.	-1
I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort...I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted...I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers...but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.  Brandon you should recall this album and act as if it never happened.  I hope the next Killers album sounds NOTHING like this or I will be disappointed.	-1
I grew up listening to this song it's akin to "Take my breath away," Drive" by the cars, and probably the guy that sings "Lady in red," and maybe Deon Estus "Heaven help me."  "Raise your hands to heaven and pray, that we'll be back together,"  "tonight I need your sweet caress, hold me in the darkness," I wanna say I would actually think about being with my husband, but when this song debuted, I was only about what, 8 years-old?  I think I would think about it subconsciously, without the husband part.	-1
I really love Bad Religion. I saw them in Calgary in 2009 and was third from the front. Greg Graffin pointed at me several times. I remember during American Jesus, the guy next to me put his arm around me as we shouted the lyrics out. That was a seriously amazing time.  2010 would have been an awesome music year. Iron Maiden, my favorite band, put out their best album yet: The Final Frontier. In other news, Avenged Sevenfold released the half-assed Nightmare, Linkin Park continued their downfall with A Thousand Suns, and then this. Now I'll admit I did half expect this from Bad Religion- Everything after The Gray Race disappointed me (minus The Process of Belief and a few tracks from Empire).  The Day The Earth Stalled is a nice, fast paced opener, although it could have been longer. 3/5  Only Rain is easily the best track off the album and the closest to the Bad Religion I love. Great lyrics too. 5/5  Resist Stance is reminiscent of Suffer, so I like it a lot, plus Greg sounds awesome! 4/5  Won't Somebody- OK now this is where the album takes a nosedive. This could have been in a Tim Horton's commercial, it is that bland. 2/5  The Devil in Stitches- Boring. 1/5  Pride and the Pallor- Ditto.  Wrong Way Kids has a catchy chorus and that's about it. 2/5  Meeting of the Minds is a song that had potential to be great- they were going in the right direction when the did it, but they got to the chorus... what a disappointment. 3/5  Someone to Believe- OK seriously this is ridiculous. I cant believe Bad Religion did this. This sounds like post Nimrod Green Day (and I don't mean that in a good way) 0/5.  Avalon- HELL YES!!!!!!!!! FINALLY beneath the grime is a kickass face melter. Seriously this is why I listen to Bad Religion 5/5.  Cyanide is just as good as Avalon. 5/5  Turn Your Back On Me, Ad Hominem (yuck) and the last 2 tacks are all boring and bland ways to o out.  In short this album is a disappointment. It's about time they hung it up.	-1
I don't get this band or this album. They possess none of the swagger, anger or danger that makes the best punk bands interesting. Rather they started fairly slick and have gotten progressively more commercial with every album since 1988, mining the same limited song writing style to the point where they are musically indistinguishable from any number of vapid pop/punk bands polluting the world today. The lyrics may address more than the usual boy/girl pop nonsense but so what? There's nothing new, emotionally cathartic, or of genuine musical interest in any song on the cd, just lots of LA studio perfection and showbiz professionalism. These guys display little imagination, and no real heart, I'm afraid all that's left is workmanlike and bland craft: the Toto of punk rock.	-1
I don't remember purchasing it maybe it was a request for a song that I had to have for a party	-1
Mediocre voice.  But, if you like country-pop with an attempt at some humor, this might be for you.  Not to be considered a classic.	-1
This is not a good record. It is a blatant attempt to produce hit singles and follow a manufactured sound. This is forgettable country music. Please listen to someone worthy of your time and not this nonsense.	-1
I am a big Donell Jones fan and was glad to see him back.  However, it seems he is trying something different and mixing some hip hop in.  Don't get me wrong that may work for some but it doesn't mix well on this CD. Donell has had some excellent CDs in the past but this one veers from his soulful sound and ends up sounding contrived.  Hopefully on his next CD he will return to the soul sound that made me love his music.	-1
Quite boring.  Weak songs... lacking any sort of groove, power, or upbeat melodic nature.  If you are a fan because of their famous hits, chances are this will be underwhelming.  This is a "must preview first" album... be sure you try it before you buy it.  I am sure many will like it, just as I am positive many will not.  I wish they would do more music in the style that made them famous. I do not enjoy giving negative reviews, but if it is what I feel I think it is essential feedback to warn those others who will feel the same.	-1
J. Walsh said what I thought about this album.  Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.  Huey please try to do another rock album before retiring, I think you can still do it.	-1
This is it for me.  Rod this stuff just gets more and more lame as it goes.  The first few were o.k., but this is it, songs just lag never really pick up any sort of pace. For being a Rod Stewart completeist, this won't hit my CD player anymore.  I think I'll pick up the real thing, Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennett.  Oh by the way, I think I'll fly myself to the moon to getaway from this terrible stuff!	-1
ok	-1
An earlier reviewer writes "I was very fortunate to see and hear Rod sing his entire new album ...live from the audience of Home Shopping Network."  That says it all, doesn't it? The man who used to rock out with one of the gravelly, bluesy voices in all of rock is now modeling himself, not as a second-rate Sinatra, but as a third-rate Michael Buble (who is himself, a second rate Sinatra)  I know he's got to do it to keep his career alive (hence the second star) but this is a very, very sad affair indeed. Particularly since its been stretched out to this FIFTH volume.  Keep these performances on the Home Shopping Network, Rod. It perfectly captures your current fan base demographic.	-1
In the words of Elton John, "karaoke albums don't count."  Ever since he started recording these abysmal theme records nearly a decade ago, Rod Stewart has been more about surface appearance than sound. His album covers from this period make that evident. Unfortunately, donning a snazzy suit and singing chestnuts does not make one Tony Bennett any more than tossing on a leather jacket and ripped jeans makes one Joey Ramone or sporting a soulful swoon makes one Al Green.  In the world of Rod Stewart image is consistently at the forefront, especially on this disc, where he sounds in perpetual need of a throat lozenge. While his voice has coolly mellowed, not every show biz veteran emanates nostalgic gold on cue.  This music is as much about marketing and product-placement as the drivel being spilled out by acts such as Katy Perry or Ke$ha, with little to no soul, substance or artistry behind it. The only difference is the demographic being aimed at - here, baby boomers with only a minimal amount of sophistication or taste (if that) who know this material is "good for them" but do not have the energy, drive or impetus to locate performances of these songs from better, more suitable vocal interpreters. "Rod Stewart" is therefore more a brand and familiar face in this context.  The arrangements are textured and nicely orchestrated, and Stewart usually sounds like he is supplying differing emotions as he moves in and out of the tracks - and these are, after all, some of the best songs ever written. Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of "What a Difference a Day Makes" and "I've Got the World on a String" sound fine.  Stewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer, so it all does sound "fine" - not transcendent, not brilliant, not particularly soulful, rich or stirring - in other words, not good enough.  In an era where we, by some wonderful luck, still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls, unmiked, with his rendition of Bart Howard's "Fly Me to the Moon," there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it. It is redundant, reductive, excessive and unwholesome all at once, much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit and tie. Mimicry is not art.  Go to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you. Order a cocktail and sit down. You are guaranteed to have a more genuine experience than you would have playing this CD or seeing one of Mr. Stewart's overpriced concerts.  And if that's out of reach, try any album by Madeleine Peyroux.	-1
The true masters of the American pop song must be turning in their graves. While I can't question the success of this series, I cannot understand what the appeal is other than it being Rod Stewart on the tracks. His voice is simply not suited to this type of music. Give me Buble, Sinatra, Martin, Bennett, or Lee over this. This is part five of a sonic atrocity!	-1
Oh, Rod Stewart, what's happened to you? I miss the Rod Stewart of yesteryear - the rocker, party-animal and bad boy who gave us such hits as "Hot Legs", "Rhythm of my Heart", "Forever Young", and "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy." Now we're left with a cover artist who's traded in everything that made him a star and appealing who churns out albums full of cover songs of old American classics. "Fly Me to the Moon ... The Great American Songbook Volume V" is really not that different from the first four albums of the American Songbook series. For one album, the one where he covered classic rock songs, there was a hint of the old Rod Stewart but now we're back to this crooner imitation that Stewart's been playing with for the past few years.  In listening to this album, I wanted to break down this review by tracks. Then I realized that there really was nothing great to say about the individual tracks on this album. I will start off by saying one good thing: thank goodness the music of this release is more upbeat and overall happier than the tracks chosen for the other songbook volumes. That simple change of going for the most swing/upbeat orchestral arrangement of the songs makes "Fly Me to the Moon" stand out in the series.  Now, for the bad news. My problem with "Fly Me to the Moon" and the other four volumes of this American Songbook series is that it is really lacking in Rod Stewart. I'll explain. I get it - as artists get older, they want to change or do something differently musically. This thing of covering old American classics, however, has been dragged out entirely too long in my opinion and is truly killing the musical legacy Rod Stewart made. These tracks are nothing more than high profile karaoke. Where's the feeling? Where's the emotion, the spark that makes you nod your head in appreciation of the sentiment and emotion; the unique spin that makes you feel like you're listening to Rod Stewart? This album, and the others of this American Songbook series are pretty annoying and disappointing because every track is sung almost entirely the same as the next. There's no real emotional exploration going on or personalization happening. To me, the tracks sound very similar and therefore feel uninteresting because it feels like Rod Stewart or his record company realize they'll make money with him being a cover artist either way and he's grown very comfortable not investing himself into the music or songs because they're already familiar to most of his audience.  This feels like a lazy effort from Rod Stewart with no real creativity or talent being exhibited. There are a few tracks worth listening to: "Moon River," "Sunny Side of the Street", "Fly Me to the Moon" have traces of the old Rod Stewart but still, I find it hard to believe that the once rocker Stewart who in interviews likes to to point out how he doesn't feel old or irrelevant has gone from being such a stand out artist to being nothing more than a good cover artist. I'd like to have heard a few original tracks mixed into this album; we haven't been treated to truly new, original content from Rod Stewart in years and I believe all of this covering of the American classics he's done over the years has made him a bit weak as an artist because he's singing every song with the same emotion and tone and is showing little range. I say skip this. It's really not anything new or anything unique worth throwing your money at.  Listen to These: "Fly Me to the Moon," "Sunny Side of the Street," "Moon River."	-1

Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre, some time the results are successful, such  as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous  the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank's second album . Last spring  rising hip hop artist  B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B., Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire. On the heels of a possible jail sentence, we now have Bruno Mars debut album. Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot. 1. Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally. Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ. *** out of **** 2. Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop. I'm a grown man so this song didn't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good. *** out of **** 3. Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD. The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do. **** out of ****. 4. Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song, I knew I wouldn't like it. Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999. * out of ****. 5. The Lazy Song - Listening to this track, I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc. Just as the title implies this is a lazy song. ** out of ****. 6. Marry You - I'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence. *** out of **** 7. Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time. I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one. 8. Liquor Store Blues (Feat. Damian Marley) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it. *** out of ****. 9. Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be. If he doesn't go to jail and with a great band backing him, this song will sound great live. **** 10. The Other Side (Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o. B) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing. *** out of ****  Overall this isn't a horrible debut album, it is a mediocre album.  I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production, instead he's given us a Jason Marz sounding album.  Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he couldn't handle to other falsetto's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant, the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps. Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he didn't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg's.	-1

The music is great. Let's get that out of the way, right off. Tim McGraw is an amazing singer who has put out some great music. And "Felt Good On My Lips" is an amazing song.  That's what makes it so difficult to give this CD only one star.  But the fault of that lies with Curb, not with McGraw.  Curb, desperate to milk Tim for everything has now released the following Greatest Hits Packages from Tim McGraw: Greatest Hits (completely legitimate) Reflected: Greatest Hits 2 (completely legitimate) Greatest Hits Volume 3 (It had material 1&2 didn't have, so it was worth the price, plus it had "Find Out Who Your Friends Are" and "Nine Lives" - still shady on Curb's part since Tim had only released one album since, but, eh)  Then, Curb got greedy "Greatest Hits 1 and 2" double pack Greatest Hits 1-3 And NOW #1 Hits. AGAIN after only one new record.  No wonder McGraw is in such a hurry to ditch Curb and find a new label. They keep rereleasing everything simply to make a few extra bucks.  Download "Felt Good On My Lips" for 99 cents and send a message to Curb that this rereleasing isn't going to make them any money.  Can't wait for some new music from Tim McGraw.	-1

For Ke$ha, she just hasn't been able to deliver solid music, yet let enough alone really show she is able to sing. For her latest single We R Who We R, the leading single from her album Cannibal, it really is just another waste upon the ears. I really wasn't very impressed with the song. It really was just absolutely awful. I think Ke$ha should really try and take her time for finding better material to call upon her own, than wasting her time to find another Tik Tok in her words. It really shows that she has absolutely not as much growth in her music. Hopefully, if she does try harder, she can come out with something that makes a bit more sense, just like her voice.  Song: D-	-1
There is no question that the past year in music really brought in a lot of wasted talent on songs, and artists as well. That has definitely came the case from joke songs like Rihanna, the trashed and smashed Lady Gaga, and also Ke$ha. The feeling of her music is definitely one not to come by. That has came the case with her debut album Animal, and instead of trying to do something new, to make a better sound for herself, she instead chose to start all over again with We R WHo We R, the lead single from her sophmore album Cannibal. I really wasn't very impressed with the song at all. It really was just a waste of the ears from start to finish. Instead of trying to do what feels like another Tik Tok, I think she needs to find a better arrangement of songs to call her own. That would be a better love than her drugs.  Song: D-	-1

There really isn't much new here, other than maybe trying to pass off covers of Crowded House's 'Don't Dream it's Over' or Lou Reed's 'Perfect Day' as Holiday music. (I guess we can blame Simon Cowell, who picked the songs.) Vocals are perfect-- maybe a little too much so-- but lack of guests and lack of variety in the delivery along with poor song selection knock it down as a whole.	-1
On her debut, Susan came out as a surprise big voiced, no face winner and the beginning of a promising career. On this, her second official release, she delivers a Christmas(?) CD. I know a lot of artists these days try to stretch the Christmas a little far by adding Children's songs like When You Wish Upon A Star or even Over The Rainbow. Susan takes a Lou Reed song, Perfect Day and turns it into...? It IS nice and certainly does not remind me of baking cookies for Christmas. It reminds me of the sarcasm and wit of Lou Reed being reinvented by a Mary Tyler Moore meets Carol Burnett. 6 out of 10 songs can certainly claim their stake as holiday classics, however, Don't Dream It's Over remake does not! It's odd that she would put Silent Night on her annual CD and not a Christmas CD? Oh well...NEXT! Next...Susan Boyle Love CD for Valentines Day featuring Danny Boy and I'm Getting Nothing For Christmas!  lol	-1
I ADORE THIS SONG.  But this download is NOT THE EXPLICIT VERSION.  I can't seem to find it here on Amazon, but I'll look again.  Also, when purchasing the mp3 it indicates there is a video included, but this is not true. At least not as far as I can find it.	-1
I don't have any idea about this. I don't even know who this is. so I cant rate it. sorry.	-1

The Song is great. The post production mixdown is horrible. There's is a hi pitch shrill in his voice during certain parts of the song that is aggravating. I have software that may help dampen the sound. But I am going to request a new download first to see if it was only a fluke. I know it's not my system.	-1
There is no reason for this. It's actually insulting when you factor in his other hits collections. He has 3 volumes, so why is it compressed to one disc? You know how many hits are missing. A lot. The remastering is nice though, but still, this is not necessary. He deserves a 3 disc best of. Nothing less	-1
How many minutes will the "casual fan" take before realizing that "The Hits" has left off "Just the Way You Are" and "Uptown Girl"?  Or "An Innocent Man" and "She's Always a Woman"?  Or "Honesty" and "Modern Woman"...oh wait, EVERY BJ hits disc has left off "Modern Woman."  There is one devious little drawing card here...this seems to be the first collection to include the live, hit version of "Say Goodbye To Hollywood" without the applause tracking into the next song as it does on "Songs in the Attic."  I am also curious as to whether this version of "The Entertainer" is actually the 3:05 single edit still unavailable on CD...both because the lyrics actually (and cleverly) cite 3:05 as the timing of the song (kind of) and because the single leaves the (kind of) tacky lyric "I've laid all kinds of girls."  I don't blame Billy Joel.  I'm not even sure I blame Sony.  But I can't say the world needs this odd, half-assed grouping of Joelsongs either.  Wow.	-1
Jay, Joe Don and Gary it's time for a break. (7th studio album since 2000).  These songs are starting to sound the same from album to album.  Just my opinion, but Rascal Flatts need to change their musicial approach next time out if they want me to keep following their career. After 37 hits Rascal Flatts must be going for 50, so they can put out the big 50 CD, but you gotta release better stuff than this.  Sending this back to the used record store already.	-1
I am giving it two stars because it isn't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in South Florida. It seems like there's an accordion in the song that remind me of Mexican music like LOS BUKIS(although my wife tells me it's Portuguese). BTW, trust me, this isn't the best representation of Brazilian music out there(check out Jobim or Os Mutantes). I always pictured a bunch of Mexicans singing it and dancing around to it~lol	-1

I was out christmas shopping today and the store I was in was playing this cd in the background.  When I went to purchase my item I heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me.  The manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded "the new Jessica Simpson Christmas cd".  I heard the manager then reply "can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business."  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.  I went online later and listened to "Happy Christmas" and found out myself why.  It was truely awful.  I'm sorry I don't want to hear Jessica Simpson singing christmas carols when it sounds like she needed to blow her nose every song.  Jessica Simpson is just a strange creature.  Why does she continue to make music?  It really tells me something when there is only 12 reviews on here.  Plus she dates athletes.  Creepy.	-1
If I wanted all of these songs,I would have just bought all of his albums. Which I already own. But even if I didin't,I would still buy them over this collection. Just like George Strait,Alan Jackson needs to release a CD...or maybe CD set,of a handful of outtakes that he has in his vault. Just imagine all the great songs that he has recorded throughout the years,that never made their way on any of his albums. I don't know about you...but I would LOVE to hear 'em. Garth Brooks did this with his "Lost Sessions" album,and it was awesome. Although,I thought there should have been more outtakes on that collection. Well,now it's time for country artists like Alan Jackson and George Strait to show us what kind of unreleased material that they've got stashed away. As a TRUE fan of country music and of Alan Jackson...that would make my day a whole lot brighter :-)	-1
I tend to avoid albums like this, generally because by the time they are released, the tracks on them have appeared on up to half a dozen greatest hits sets already. For the life of me, I can't see any reason for albums like this, other than greed & the lust to milk the cash cow even further. It's a bit like DVD's where you get the original release, then the "special edition", then the 2-disc set with extra bits not seen in the theatre release, then the director's cut, then the "ultimate edition" and so on, ad nauseum. Lets get real here, the record companies are not stupid; they see a way to leech more money out of the die-hard fans, & they will. It's as simple as that! And sadly, none of the artists have the ethical conscience to say to the companies, "hey, haven't we already released greatest hits albums?" Why do we have to re-release them under a new cover, & call it a new release? It's all about the mighty dollar, baby, and they all do it. Now, having said that (& got my feelings of disgust for record companies of my back), this album has one (yes, just one) positive - it has one of the best cover versions of "Ring of Fire" that I have ever heard. Great vocals from Alan, great production, & great instrumental backing. Now this is the kind of number I'd like to hear Alan doing in future. Put "Freight Train" behind him (every artist is allowed to make one disaster in their career), and look to churning out numbers that have some life in them. Alan, go back to your roots, check out your first 3 or 4 albums, and start again. Lets have more of the kind of songs that put you on the map as a genuine country singer, and put an end to the lame & tame rubbish like "Freight Train".	-1
It honestly doesn't really seem to amaze me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year, and with so many lackluster singers making really bad music that is worth going back to your own record collection. Ke$ha is unfortunately one of those artists whom really has shown that she absolutely doesn't know how to make a tune to call her own. That is sadly the case with nothing but gibberish from her voice. Her latest song, Blow, the second single from the wasted Cannibal, is absolutely worse than her last song We R Who We R. I really was absolutely not impressed with the song. It just was a waste of time, and Ke$ha is truthfully a real waste of a good artist. She really needs to grow up and find better songs to call her own. Her love is really just drugs and not good music.  Song: D	-1
Energetic song but I don't think the lyrics are appropriate for mixed audiences. You can look them up and decide for yourself. I was unpleasantly surprised, and won't be playing this one. Call me a prude if you like, but I would not want my kids talking like this.	-1
Not the quality of production we're accustomed to from Josh.  There is nothing even close to memorable in this compilation and the vocals are way too out front relative to the orchestration.  The voice sounds forced and uneven.  I will remain hopeful that Josh's next offerings will be higher quality.	-1
This album sucks!  I could blather on about how great Josh's voice is, how heartfelt and profound his compositions are, the angst of finding love and still could not come up with a decent enough excuse for this turd of a CD.  The Grobanites posting the orgasmic reviews of this CD are either doing so out of misguided love and loyalty for their curly haired cutie pie or they are simply deaf.  I'm not one to expect any artist to sing the same old stuff album after album.  Josh definitely stretched his singing chops with the work he did with Lady Blacksmith Mambazo and the cool, hip, jazz piece "Machine" all from Closer.  Now that was cool.  It wasn't the same old Power Ballads that made him famous or the Foster Sugar Schlock.  But Illuminations makes it difficult to believe that Josh spent five years slaving over musical compositions and arrangements and the best he could come up with was this piece of crap.  What's even more ballsy is the price of the "Internet Edition" he's selling on his exclusive fan club.  $39.99 for this plus two additional digital downloads.  And why not?  The four to five star reviews posted just here proves that he can clear his throat and his devoted Grobanites will applaud him.  What this album sounds like is that Josh goofed off for five years and told his fans he was slaving over the bestest-ever-in-the-world-CD-just-for-them and he knows they're stupid enough to believe him.  At the last minute, he moves to New York, putters about and then pukes up some whining, whinging, angst-ridden, lonely-in-New-York-looking-for-love pabulum that only Grobanites find palatable.  Groban is better than this.	-1
After his phenomenal second album, I expected an album of the same quality, with feeling and very good songs, but not so. It has good songs like 2 SIDES OF ME, LIFE, WAKING UP THE DEVIL ... but the best of these songs can not compare to the best of his album TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT as USE ME ,LOADED AND ALONE,HEAVEN SENT or LOST IN THE SUN. It also has songs to fill the cd as HEY HO, WHAT YA GONNA DO or PUT THAT RECORD ON, that even a rock tribute, but can not be compared with STEREOSIDE does on his album SO LONG with the song ON OUR WAY. It is a CD that's fine but do not meet expectations.	-1
The CD was whack  but the videos were really good but imna major big fan of neyo	-1
What happened Ne-Yo? Everything he touched before this album turned to gold...But as soon as he disappeared for a brief period of time, it seems like he might have lost his touch a bit. I have always been at least a modest fan of Ne-Yo, more so when he first came out, his first two albums were great but as of lately he has wandered to far into the pop genre for me to tolerate. He still has all the talent in the world, and he still is a phenomenal song writer, but his style has changed a lot since he first came out, and Libra Scale is the first album of his that I would say was a definite miss. His last album (2008's Year of The Gentleman) was extremely successful despite being just an average album, but Libra Scale is lacking in both areas. It flopped and was his worst album by far. The production was weak (I don't recognize hardly any names on this album), the songwriting was bland, and just the overall vibe of the album was boring. There were a few standout cuts, the mellow baby maker "Telekinesis" and the mid tempo banger "Makin a Movie" both make lasting impressions, as do the singles "Champagne Life" and "One in a Million", but other than that the rest of the album is filler in my opinion. That was the biggest problem with this album, was there was a severe lack of standout material on the album, and it just didn't sound focused at all, kind of coming off half assed. I mean it's not the worst album i have ever heard by any means, if your a huge Ne-Yo fan you will still get a decent amount of enjoyment out of the album most likely, but as whole the album is definitely lacking, especially compared to some of his better work...Better luck next time Ne-Yo, i know the talent is still there, but this album just didn't display it like some of his other work...	-1
