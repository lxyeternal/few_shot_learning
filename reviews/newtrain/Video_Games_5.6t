I love the game, nice graphics and loads of fun. I had the original C & C but this one's much better	1
it is one of my favorite games of all time, if you like conquering your enemies while building huge bases that are impenetrable, then this is the game for you. it's controls are super easy and simple to learn. get this game and command your army to victory.	1
This game never fades!!!	1
I have 5 computers up and runing for the kids on the block out of all the games thay love RA2,I have played it for years and build maps and mods and the fun just keeps on comming. I know it is an old game but the kids still thinks is the best. So battle on Command & Conquer Red Alert 2.	1
Just out of curiousity I pulled Red Alert 2 out of mothballs. Especially in light of Generals, does RA2 still hold up? The answer, surprisingly enough, is yes!  The two big attractions for Red Alert 2 are its unique units and its unashamedly B-Grade Movie Acting cheese factor. Firstly - to the units. Because RA2 isn't based on any real-life scenarios (Soviet Union invades America? Please.), this gives the developers creative freedom to create the craziest units imaginable. So we have soldiers with rocket packs (Rocketeers), Tanks that can camouflage themselves (Mirage tanks), and shock troopers that fire lightning bolts (Tesla Troopers). To this very day, the units in Red Alert 2 are still my favourites of all time.  The second big attraction is how RA2 revels in its B-Grade movie roots. It was a huge surprise because so many game developers take the "grim and gritty" route. Red Alert 2 wallows unashamedly in its own cheesiness. It also introduced some very memorable characters. Udo Kier is suitably very creepy (in a cheesy way) as the Pscyhic Yuri. Tanya (played by Kari Wuhrer) - in addition to being a useful unit in the game, she's played with real charm and feistiness. There's Ray Wise as the US President, who's clearly sending up Bill Clinton. And finally, one of my favourite game characters of all time - General Carville, played brilliantly by Barry Corbin. He gets some great lines - one of my favourites is "I'm sick and tired of living in Canada. Get me my office back!". And his delivery really fires you up and makes you want to kick some Soviet [...].  That (to me) is what separates Red Alert 2 from any other game before or since. It flatly refuses to take itself seriously and invites the player to have a lot of fun. The graphics may not be as advanced as Generals, but the gameplay and memorable characters more than make up for it.	1
This game came out 5 years ago, but I still play it. That is a testament to how great this game is. Not many old and NEW RTS games can match up to this one. The gameplay, graphics, sound, cheesy cut scenes, and replay value all get 5 stars from me.	1
This is probably the classic strategy game on a pc.  My son loves this game, and so do I.  While it has lots of options for each nation you can play, there are not too many options like in Yuri's Revenge.  Some maps are excellent.  And you can create your own maps pretty easily with a free online program called Final Alert 2.  It seems that RA2 crashes a lot from internal errors and that no one has published a way to solve this problem.  Even so, the game is dangerously addicting because it is so fun to play.  Probably the best war game we own on any system.  If you have more than one pc that can go online via your ISP simultaneously, you might want a second copy so you can play with someone you know...that's even more fun.	1
I played this game about 2 years ago and I have to say that it's really a brilliant Real Time Strategy Game. I've been a fan of RTS games since I was 8 years old and "Red Alert" was the firts RTS that I ever played. It was the most memorable one too, so when "Red Alert 2" came out, I was thrilled to re-live my childhood conquests. Well, sorta...  Many years after the War with Stalin, Russia has re-built her mighty army and has invaded the United States of America and Europe. In response to this invasion, The U.S has re-formed it's old alliances with Europe and launched a counter-offensive on the invading forces. In the middle of this epic struggle for World Domination is...you. You can either play as a Commander on the Soviets side or as one on the Allies. So what's your choice? Do you aid the Might Soviet Union in their quest for World Dominance? Or will you help the Allies push back the Russian scum? The storyline is not highly inventive, but is believable and interesting nonetheless. 9/10 for the storyline.  If you're looking for a game with stunning graphics, "Red Alert 2" is not your answer. But it still looks sleek and the units are well defined and recognisable. But the graphics are pretty simple and there aren't too many visual effects, so 7/10 for "Red Alert 2" graphics-wise. In terms of gameplay however, this game is fantastic. The action is fast, furious and realistic and there are plenty of units and features to keep you busy for ages! 10/10 for gameplay. Soundwise the game's good, but I wouldn't say it's anything fantastic. You can hear sound effects and unit speech, but there could be more environmental noises. So "Red Alert 2" gets 7/10 for sound.  There are plenty of units to keep you entertained. From the Allies highly-trained G.I's to their Aircraft Carriers and Chronospheres; and the Soviets Conscripts to their mighty Tanks and Atomic Bombs; the weapons and units will definitely not disappoint you. And the new option of Garrisoning buildings introduces Urban Warfare to the RTS experience. 10/10 for unit variety and features.  In terms of difficulty, "Red Alert 2" can get pretty intense in some spots. I didn't find it quite as hard as the first game, but it was challenging in any case. I recommend those who are just starting RTS play the "Normal" difficulty on this game. But those who are seasoned commanders and generals are obligated to play it on the "Hard" setting. So "Red Alert 2" gets 4/10 for the "Easy" Difficulty, 6/10 for "Normal" and 8/10 for "Hard." So enjoy.  Overall the game is fantastic. It has the option of playing skirmishes too, not to mention a multiplayer option. So it really is a sweet deal. "Red Alert 2" gets 10/10 overall for it's sheer fun-factor, lastabiliy and engaging gameplay. So go ahead, buy it, rent it, borrow it...but please, play it!	1
This game has two disc's one is blue that the ally if you put that one in you'll be the American's fighting the Russions. The other is the red disc that's the enemy you can choose to fight against your own country. The Russions tanks are bigger and stronger but not as fast as the American's special agent Tanya for a woman is the baddest U.S. solider she can swim shoot very fast and plant bombs. The Russions dogs are white they are mean looking as well. The Soviet Union have a big nuclear missle silo.	1
well the tilte is kind of misleading.it played the game months after it.well the real strategy really begins to creep up when u play it in the hardest level.the last level is extremely difficult,so be prepared to give it a day.oh i am talking bout the american side, gives me kind of a high to thump the bad guys.lets see any bad things about the games.first of all cheesy videos.and i don't find anything else bad in this one.	1
This has to be one of my favorite PC games.  Despite the cheesy cutscenes and lame actors, the game does a good job of what its supposed to do: have battle sims.  The story doesn't seem as cheesy to me as others say it is, and the skirmish is the most fun ive ever had on the computer(if you don't like the game, then blowing apart the enemy with 36+ fighter planes is something you should try!)  Also, the demolition trucks and terrorists are pretty fun to just line up in an empty space and mass destroy(take that bin Laden ;) ) All in all, aside from cheesy cutscenes and [poor] acting, this game is top quality.	1
Great game, lots of fun.	1
I remember playing Pikmin when I was younger and absolutely loving it.  It is just as fun, and challenging, to me now as it was when I was younger.  In fact, as with other games, I sometimes struggle to see how I was so good at games when I was younger and not good at them now.  Pikmin is a real-time strategy game in which the player takes the role of Captain Olimar.  After crash-landing his rocket on a strange planet, Olimar finds himself trapped.  With only 30 days before he can no longer survive, the player must help Olimar find the broken pieces of his ship so that he can put it back together and leave the planet.  While on the planet, Captain Olimar finds Pikmin, creatures which he yanks out of the ground and then follow him around.  They look a bit like radishes and come in different colors.  The Pikmin help Olimar transport his ship parts back to the ship and assemble them, and also help him with the environment.  It is a symbiotic relationship; Olimar helps the Pikmin develop and survive, and they help get him to where he needs to go and fight dangerous beasts along the way.  It is somewhat of a challenge to figure out where to go, what the Pikmin can and cannot handle, and how to fight the various beasts within the game.  However, in time, Pikmin becomes a fun and intriguing game to play.  I recommend it to those young and those not so young; I think you will enjoy it.  Pikmin's popularity spawned two other Pikmin games as well.	1
awesome game	1
I didn't really like this game. It really wasn't that fun for me. I used to really like the C&C games, but now they aren't that fun for me. One thing that I hate is that there are no cheats. I hate this. I really hate games with no cheats. I think games are more fun with cheats. I don't realy reccomend this game, but it's okay for the first couple of days you have it.	-1
I've been an avid Warcraft fan for years.  I bought War3 but actually don't play it because I don't have the time to master the aggressive AI, and hence went back to War2.  This game provides many more units and buildings than War2, with several options to configure the difficulty - number of players, whether they fight each other (free for all) and the difficulty level of each computer player.  You can play a quick skirmish against a single easy player in 10 minutes or spend 2 hours against several more advanced. This is definitely my new game of choice.	1
This game is definatly a step in the right direction for future RTS games.  Certainly, it's better than C&C:TS.  It's about on par with the original RA, and has many creative and different units.  Unlike most other RTS games i've played, there are major differances between the armies, even down to the foot solder, where the allies domminate.  except in the Navy, where they preatty much are the same.  that kinda makes me sad, since the allies used to really kick in the water.  One advancement in t his game is that they replaced those pop-up in-mission game hints with video and audio cutsceanes.  While the acting is really bad, I expect to see that again in the future.  (Did this game come before or after Starcraft?)  While this game is without perfection, it is very entertaining, and anyone who is into RTS games should consider it, specially if you like the C&C universe.	1
Red Alert 2 has everyting that everyone wanted in Red Alert 1. It has better grapics, a better story, and fresh units. Both the Soviet and Allied single player mission are great and fun with interesting twists. As usual Westwood Studios has given us a great game with a good backstory and bad cinemas (but since most people don't even watch them it doesn't really matter.) Yet there is one problem with this great game, it's too easy. If you start the single player missions on normal it can be  challenging to beginners yet after a while it can get dull even on hard. Yet Westwood puts in a solution to that too. Since the game features single player skirmish battle and a wide array of multi-player games. It's one of the best RTS games I've ever played. If you're into RTS games this is a must have.	1
A bit expensive but understandable since it isn't in production anymore, besides, it's in excellent condition. Gameplay is kept within a time parameter, (they made it part of the challenge of the game as a whole), so expect to be done with it in quantifiable short time.	1
Pleased Will order again	1
My son loves this game and it is suitable for his age so I am happy!  Cute game.	1
Kids asked me to order this older game...they still love it!	1
Pros: Their are several pros to this game.  The engine itself is pretty good.  If you played any of the other C&C games, you'll know exactly how to play this one.  The game also doesn't have some of the problems that Tiberian Sun Possessed.  In TS, the AI would just send a thousand sacrificial Engineers to your camp, you kill 999 of them, but one of them always made it through and took over your construction yard.  RA2 has sacrificial engineers coming your way but they are balanced enough that they rarely ever make it through your front lines.  The cinematics are great.  Full Screen.  What could be more fun then watching a terrorist with a bomb strapped to his chest and blow up a general. Cons:  These are my personal feelings.  The game has a CD-key.  I hate CD-Keys just because you can't just put the CD in a CD carry case and let it be.  Also, the disk is protected by SafeDisc(like all new Westwood games.)  It is pretty easy to get around if you know how.  I'm not going to tell you how but it makes it an annoyance if  you want to make a backup copy for archival purposes. The game itself has little cons.  It is just fun.  It'll give you 20 hours or so of solid game play.	1
thanks	1
son really likes this game	1
The most fun, innovative game ive ever played!	1
Fun game, quick delivery!	1
great item	1
It is better than Red alert 1 and that is a very easy mission to accomplice. The good part in this game is that you can put soldiers inside buildings. But the first game in this series is the best one. Buy it, i'm not stopping you.	1
I am a tough person to please with games and I had not been able to get into anyother strategy game.  But this game changed it all!  This game is really worth your money It is the best strategy game on the market!  Red Alert 2 leaves all the other games in the dust from its easy controls, cool vehicles, maps, to the multi-play online.  Plus the graphics are outstanding! This is a game that any guy or gal into war and commanding troops would love.  If YOU are looking for a game to get your kid YOU found it! ENJOY!	1
I've never played any of the original Command and Conquer games before, but picked up a copy of Red Alert 2 due to good remarks from gamers. Even on my dull computer:An Activa K6-2 500 MhZ, 152 RAM, and a Voodoo 4 PCI video card that never seems to run good, the game was smooth, with very little slow down, even with hundreds of units on screen. Speaking of units, both the Allies and Russians are well balanced, with one unit beating out the others and so forth. The campaigns are fun and a great challenge, but the cut scenes in between missions is laughable. Overall, this game is a great buy, and one hell of a blast.	1
First off, this is the second review I've written for this game...I guess Amazon deleted all the reviews or something. Oh well, on to the review! Many people were turned off to the CC series with Tiberian Sun. "It was too slow, too boring!" they said. Fear not, for RA2 brings the fun back to this legendary series. At first glance, the game units and graphics almost look like they were taken straight out of a cartoon compared to past CC games. But you'll soon come to appriciate the graphics and the visuals. The units are fairly large; no more losing units in the background. Both the Soviets and the Allies have some impressive new units and some good ole' renditions from the old RA game. The Tesla Coil is back, and now, the Tesla trooper is a mainstay. The allies have some beefed up troops, who can deploy into stationary gunners that can be the bane of advancing Soviet troops. And let's not forget Professor Einstein and all his wonderful creations that he's going to cook up for the allies. Yes, the Soviets are not as technically advanced, but you'll love the brute force that they possess. You'll know no horror like when you're playing the allies and you suddenly see 10 Zepplins heading straight for your base. Ouch time. The cinimatics are better than most game movies, but they are fairly cheesy in some points (like the end movie for the allies). We finally get to see a living and breathing Eva and Tanya, and they're not to be taken lightly. And, they look good too (well, do you really think that EA and Westwood would choose Rosanne Barr to play Tanya?!?!). Overall, this is a very good game that could have been made a little better by having a few more single player missions. The game pace is frantic, fun, fast-paced, and exciting. You'll never be bored while playing this. It is a must-own for all strategy fans, and most computer game fans the world over.	1
I actually had Pikmin 2, years before I even played the first Pikmin and I sold it before I got this game. Seeing that this game is from 2001 and it's currently 2012, I'm not going to knock the graphics at all. Put it this way, if I had bought this game right when it came out, I would have said that the graphics were amazing. Pikmin is an innovative and seriously charming RTS (Real-time strategy) game, where you harvest (or pull, rather) little carrot-shaped living plants out of the ground and have them do your bidding for you; Pikmin can assist in taking down enemies, gathering seeds (so you can produce more Pikmin creatures for you), and are essential for carrying back parts of your spaceship that you lost on the planet. This game has really stood the test of time and is still highly enjoyable, inventive, and challenging, even today. The only real downside to Pikmin, as opposed to Pikmin 2, is that you only have 30 days to find all of Olimar's Spaceship parts.	1
Pikmin just screams original game. I've never seen a new concept be designed so well. Pikmin did everything right.  The premise of the game is that your space ship has crashed on a planet filled with pikmin which resemble seeds of trees. The pikmin agree to help captain olimer(you) out on your journey of getting your space ship to work again so that you can go home. This puzzle/action game is a lot of fun but can be difficult at times. The time limit made me feel rushed, but it might be fun for other people.  The music is really enjoyable and the graphics are similar to a lot of other gamecube games, but still looks really well done.  I haven't played pikmin 2, but I can say for certainty that Pikmin is really limited in what the pikmin do. There are the red, blue, and yellow pikmin, all of which have their own unique traits. I never reached the end of Pikmin because of the repetitiveness of the game.  Each stage you have to find your ship parts and return to your base before night falls which at points is really difficult.  It's a good game to have in your collection, but it might get stale after a while (at least it did for me).	1
This game is so much fun to play. There is no game like it and you have to try it. Played again and again many times.	1
I have played this game before once and I did beat it it took about a week and a half so lots of playing time. it's a pretty fun game that will give anyone for ages 6 to 100.  Controls: The controls are pretty easy to use once you use them once or twice. Moving is even easier like in a lot of games. All you have to do is move the left control stick on the game cube romote and thats it.  Graphics: the graphics are a little rough but they are pretty good over all for the game. The only flaw in them is that you can't really see whats water and whats dirt so you sometimes drown a pikmin or two. T_T  Gameplay: The game has a good story *a fast over view* you crash land on a planet and you have to find enough parts in 30 day while taking care of your pikmin.  Monsters: okay this is one of the places where the game, graphics and controls shine. As for graphics on the monsters it's really good lots of details in the eyes body and actions. As for the controls they are fun and help thumb mussels. The different types of monsters is amazing each one being different and being cooler then the last.  Pikmin: The pikmin are so cute and are amazing. Some can breath in water while others can run around in fire while even more can throw bombs at things. 0.o Also the graphics on them are amazing.  Pros: Has cute pikmin and monsters, is something new and fun to play, has fun mind busters to solve and makes for a small challange for people.  Cons: You only have 30 days to finish, can't really see the water, some of the monsters are kind of hard and it takes forever to pick the pikmin out of the ground.  Over all it's a really good game for anyone.	1
Pikmin is one of the first games that came out for Nintendo Gamecube. I remember playing it at my neighbor's house and it was instantly one of my favorite games.  It is about seven years later, and owning only a Sega Genesis and an Xbox, I decided that I had to own the Cube. The first game I bought was Pikmin!  In Pikmin you play as a very small man named Captain Olimar. His ship crash lands on a planet (Earth, which is never exactly stated but is pretty obvious for numerous reasons). Olimar figures he will die there because important parts to his ship were scattered everywhere and he only has 30 days before his space suit fails and the poisonous oxygen that permeates the planet kills him. Just when it looks like all hope is lost, he stumbles upon a red object that, once he approached, appeared to come alive.  The red object he deems an Onion, and out of this onion comes a seed that implants itself into the ground where seconds after a small sprout shoots up. Olimar picks the sprout and that is where the first Pikmin is discovered. It isn't long before Olimar realizes these Pikmin could help him search and gather up the pieces of his ship, and the hunting begins!  There are three different kinds of Pikmin and a huge load of enemies looking to eat them. The red Pikmin, the very first Pikmin you acquire, is the strongest out of the three and they are immune to fire. The yellow Pikmin can be thrown very high and far and they can use bomb rocks, which can be found inside tin cans or skulls, to defeat enemies or to knock down rock walls. Last, the blue Pikmin, can go in water without dying.  Pikmin is a great game to play and I will continue to enjoy it's awesomeness.	1
This game is stupid and childish If your like Michael Heim Grow up nintendo is for babys and mommas boys get the PS2 or Xbox Those have better games. P.S don't you notice how 99.9% of all the games for the GCN are rated E and only one good game is rated M get the picture boys grow up.	-1
The first thing I would like to say is that if you plan to buy this, you should get the accompanying strategy guide. If you don't, you'll find this frustrating. With the help of a guide, though, the game becomes charming and challenging.  First, the game is gorgeous for being released so early in the GameCube's life cycle. Sparkling lakes, peaceful meadows, and charred fire-pits all have a realistic, but still "painted" look to them. The music fits the environments perfectly, too; it makes you feel happy and sunny at times, cautious and aware at others.  The controls work very well, and generally you won't have trouble controlling your Pikmin (if you're not familiar with the concept here, it's that you have to control your Pikmin so that they can gather items for you within a time limit). You can separate them, clump them together, or throw them individually at the touch of a button. Most everything--unrolling bridges, attacking enemies, carrying items, etc.--can be done with a few simple commands.  Nintendo is indeed the master of the sense of accomplishment, and every time you grab an item, you'll feel proud of yourself, even if you used a guide like I did. You collect spaceship parts, and with every one you get, the spaceship will change in appearance. It starts out looking like a piece of junk, but as you proceed, it transforms into a top-of-the-line machine. You really feel like you're getting somewhere. The parts themselves are all interesting, from the practical (the geiger counter), to the whimsical (a giant piggy bank).  Enemies are simultaneously scary and silly. They're funny-looking, and include giant ladybug-like things and huge frogs; but the second you hear your Pikmin scream and see hundreds of little Pikmin ghosts rise into the air, you'll fear them. Not only do you need lots of Pikmin if you want to complete the game (and harvesting more takes precious time), but you get emotionally attached to them, making every battle tense.  Overall, this game is great fun. Grabbing the spaceship parts, defeating the enemies, and doing all the other necessary things to complete the game (harvesting more Pikmin, blowing up walls, walking through fire plumes, and such), is an engrossing challenge, and makes you feel "smart". It has something for everyone; tough strategy, intense action, and beautiful, whimsical environments to explore. I would reccomend it for anyone. This, people, is the Nintendo difference.	1
Pikmin. This game is a nintendo classic. Pure genius and quite original. You basicly build an army kill things to build a bigger army to help you get the parts back for your broken ship.  Watch out though cause time is of the essence. The animation and graphics are beautiful and the gmaeplay is easy for even the newest gamer.  This is quite the game.	1
Pikmin is a great game! You get to control 3 different types of pikmin. Red, Yellow, and Blue.  (SPOILER ALERT!!!!)  Red can walk through fire, blue can walk through water, and yellow can jump higher and carry bombrocks.  It is a great game and is very challenging and puzzling.  I hope you enjoy it!	1
Shigeru Miyamoto is the owner of a fertile imagination. Very few who know his name will argue that point, and fewer still will argue the quality of his work. As perhaps the greatest asset still under Nintendo's grasp, his fame is surprisingly low-key. Little more than the most hard-core gamers know of his existence, but everyone who's ever seen a joystick has a pretty extensive knowledge of his creations. Super Mario Brothers. Donkey Kong. The Legend of Zelda. Mario Kart. F-Zero. Starfox. Super Smash Brothers. It reads like a top ten list of Nintendo's greatest achievements, and it all stems back to one man. So, naturally, when this guy's motivated to flesh out a new idea it's a pretty newsworthy event. Such was the circumstance when Pikmin was revealed to the world near the launch of the GameCube in late 2001. It was promoted as the system's "must-have" launch title, a role in which any of the famed creator's previous titles would have soared. Unfortunately, Pikmin isn't a game I'd classify as a cornerstone in any sense of the word, which is what Nintendo desperately needed at that point in time. Every bit of the Miyamoto-trademarked addictive gameplay, uncensored originality and effortless simplicity is here in full force, but the game never took off because of the way it was marketed. As an understated, unheralded underground success released a year or two after the first-wave launch titles, this game would have taken the gaming world by storm. As the central focus of a next-gen console, it was horribly misplaced and, along with Nintendo itself, quickly lost in the shuffle. Which is a shame, because this is a really enjoyable little package. It tackles a number of cliches that have plagued the gaming scene for years, gathers several completely unrelated genres and produces a game that you've never seen anything even remotely like. It successfully proves that higher framerates, larger numbers of polygons and faster processors haven't completely eliminated the kind of light hearted, inexplicably believable experience that used to fill every game on the old NES and Atari. This isn't the best looking game on the market, nor does it need to be. The real magic of Pikmin is in its simplicity, which is something that's wisely protected by keeping the game's environments understated and clean. It is a little disconcerting to see how flat some of the textures are upon close inspection, but since the majority of the game is played from a distant overhead perspective, this is a minor qualm at best. The Pikmin, Olimar and the enemies, however, skirt this issue as they're all composed of flat colors with little noticeable detailing at all. And though that sounds like a blatant red flag, it's done consistently enough to ward off any presumptions that this might have been done as a last second method of cutting corners. This is a title that appears exactly as it was meant to, with the tiny, brightly colored creatures appearing eerily at home amongst the familiar, photorealistic blades of grass, twigs and soil. It's funny, the graphics of Pikmin fluctuate so easily between distinct realism and blatant oversimplification that the lines themselves start to blur. It becomes the meeting point between detail and simplicity, with an end product that's all the more believable because of that. Upon his discovery of the Pikmin, Olimar also discovers their undying need to follow his direction. Unless he tells them otherwise, nearby Pikmin will follow our central character around the world. They'll put their lives on the line to defend him from much larger adversaries. They'll build bridges for him, or carry enormous objects with the proportionate strength of an ant if it'll aid his journeys. That the game's writers chose not to elaborate on these tiny creatures' undying love for the title's main character makes it all the more interesting and open for interpretation. Whether they fall into the river and drown, attempt to run through a fountain of fire or stupidly assault the largest enemy in the forest on their lonesome, you WILL lose Pikmin in the field on a regular basis, which becomes a point of agony as the game progresses. It's strange to imagine, but after spending the time to create, uproot and command these little creatures, you develop a sort of parental attachment to them, which eventually becomes the real attraction as the hours go on. It's truly disturbing to watch a large forest creature devour a handful of them in one fell swoop, and that's an emotion I don't usually get from playing a video game. It's this element of survival, mixed with a brief, thirty day timeframe (a game day lasts about half an hour) and a series of mind-teasing, difficult puzzles that really gives Pikmin its substantial appeal. There's a definite Lemmings vibe to some of the levels, both with their simplicity and their nerve-wracking addictive nature. You'll spend hours upon hours trying to sort your way through a particularly difficult puzzle, only to discover the answer was right in front of your face the whole time. Everything is arranged to follow a blatant learning curve, but it never really seems to get in the way or detract from the overall picture. As I said before, Pikmin would've made a great second or third year addition to the GameCube's lineup. It's a much deeper game than the simplified graphics of the front cover would lead you to believe, always there to inspire thought rather than to sate your appetite for gratuitous violence. It straddles the action / adventure, strategy and puzzle genres, and stands head and shoulders above the leading titles in each category today. It's a deceptively addicting little package, and though it lacks a bit in length and replay value, it's more than worth the current asking price. There's a very solid concept here, which I hope to see fleshed out a little further in the forthcoming sequel.	1
Pick this up. I JUST got this game and I'm regretting I didn't pick it up sooner. Now I can't wait for the second one. They need some more difficult enemies and more variety of pikmin but other than that this game is great. This should be a first buy for anyone with a gamecube, highly recommended just because it's so different from everything else.	1
This is one of the only 2 games my daughter REALLY wanted for Christmas.  She played it straight for 3 days, I had to hide the console.  She still plays it like mad 4 months later.	1
I found myself writing a review for Star Fox Adventures earlier today because I saw so many five star reviews for a game that is simply not fun.  Writing that review got me to thinking about how well designed and fun Pikmin is.  People spend a lot of time discussing graphics and technichal achievements in games and sometimes forget that we play them for fun.  Pikmin was created by Nintendo's head genius Shigeru Miyamoto, and it's fun.  It's not the longest game ever, but it's so well designed that I guarantee you will beat it at least twice.  If you are looking for an adventure or puzzle game that won't frustrate or bore you, this is a great choice.	1
I find the concept of having little plant-things following you around all the time is just awesome.  Add great music, graphics, plot and lots of replay value and then you have pikmin.  Some of the graphics can be jaw dropping, and the music really sets a great story up.  Overall anyone that owns a Gamecube should definatly own Pikmin!	1
My friend got this game for his birthday. I played it at his house for no less than six to eight hours. I was absolutely obsessed. It was so fun and addictive, challenging and puzzling, and so much. All the stuff you can expect from my buddy Miyamoto...oh...except for the fact that I so exitedly bought a GCube, Pikmin, and Luigi's Mansion, and strategy guides for each the next day. Which is good, but I completely beat the game in a day. Buy the game! It's great! But be reasonable and don't play it too much.	1
If you are a GameCube owner, chances are you chose your console partly because of the innovations usually found in titles produced by Nintendo itself.  Nintendo's track record for first party titles is virtually untainted and is completely un-challenged.  While owners of Nintendo's consoles may have less titles to choose from than competitors, the percentage of garbage titles to appear on other consoles far outstrips that of Nintendo's systems.  That being said, Pikmin is an innovative masterpiece that should not be over looked.  The gameplay is fantastic and very addictive.  I read many reviews referring to the game as being short.  While I cannot say the game is long, I must admit that it wasn't as short as I thought it would be, based on other's feedback.  It incorporates two genres (platform and strategy) successfully into what is really a unique new play experience.  You do have to think about how you will go about several tasks, or you won't be able to complete them.  Pikmin's graphics are wonderful as well.  It is a game that makes me smile rather than feeling down after playing.  Many thanks to Nintendo for not re-hashing the same stuff over and over again as competitors do. Just when I think innovation in the game market is becoming dull, a title like Pikmin, or Animal Crossing, or Metroid Prime comes along to challenge this notion.  I only hope there is a sequel.  Until then, lets hope the Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker delivers.	1
GAMEPLAY 5:   Sure it may be innovative and fun at first but that's just it, it's only fun at first. Very innovative though. This game is like nothing else I've ever seen. You collect these little guys that hatch out of a thing called an onion and use them to help fight big monster things while look for parts to your ship. There are 30 parts and you have 27 days (I think). Different colored pikmin have different powers and the such making you have to think for a second (and only a second). STORY 2:   Very, uh, different story. I'm pretty sure that no other game has used this story. You crashon aplanet that is inhabited by little things called Pikmin that come out of things called onions. You have to find the parts of your ship and the Pikmin help you. That's about it. Intriguing isn't it? GRAPHICS 4:   The Pikmin are plain looking and have no detail. Just plain 3D barely better then N64 graphics. REPLAY VALUE 1:   I played through it within the first 3 days of my rent and didn't touch it again after. That's about it...	-1
My word. Originality. I thought I remembered that from the pre-Sony days. It's amazing the games that came to mind when I tried to think of how to describe this one. Others will find better comparisons, but I'm thinking of it currently as a cross between "ToeJam & Earl", "Pokemon" and even "Age of Empires". (Well, you can command a big army with different types of soldier, and have to use varying strategies against particular kinds of enemies.) I applaud Shiggy and his cohorts for this truly original and fun game. (Please ignore the one-star review below me: I'm fairly certain "Miyamoto's Curse" only applies to those who were expecting "Mario Brothers 374: Mario Takes Three Steps To The Right") Yeah, it's a bit short when you get right down to it, which is why I only give it four stars. But still, you'll have to expend some serious brain matter to finish this one. (Either that, or the money for a guide-book.) Still, there's the Challenge Mode to keep you entertained long after you've finished the game proper. Games like this are the reason I took up with the GameCube after the demise of Sega: Nintendo and Shiggy still appear to care about the _games_, as opposed to the money, and surely that's what video games _should_ be all about, isn't it?	1
A fun and original game that will supply fun for hours.  Pikmin is about an astronaut who crash lands on a strange planet and must rebuild his ship with the help of some weird creatures he calls pikmin.  He only has about a month to find all the lost parts before his life support system runs out.  This game is fun and the strategie is challenging.  The only thing I don't like is having a time limit, though then again, it would stink without one.  Overall if you like strategie games and don't feel pressured by timelimits this is the game for you.	1
Puzzle games exercise your mind without splattering blood all over the screen. Pikmin is a great game that emphasizes cooperation over gore! The concept and plot are fun and child-suitable. A space explorer, Olimar, has crash-landed on a planet. He only has 30 days of "air" to fix his spaceship, and he's missing 30 parts. Luckily, he doesn't have to find them alone. He has up to 100 little flower-like Pikmin to help him out! They're cute and cuddly, and different pikmin have different skills. Some swim. Some are resistant to fire. Each one alone isn't very strong, so sometimes you need multiple of them to do something. The game becomes a logic puzzle - how do you get to a spaceship part if it's guarded by a series of obstacles? It's very rewarding when you figure each puzzle out. The time limit is both good and bad. On the good side, it keeps the game challenging and means that the overall game is relatively short to play. On the down side, if you have trouble with something (or if a younger child is playing) it can get very frustrating. So the game might be far too short for you (compared to something like Final Fantasy X that you play for months) or it might be impossible because of the time limit. Still, practice makes perfect, and most players will be sure to enjoy this one's puzzles as a fun challenge!	1
Pikmin..One of the most unique games that I have ever played. Very original. Truthfully, it doesn't sound neither appealing or interesting. Although the gameplay is incredible. Whenever I would walk into a store and play a demo of it, I would always think that it was somewhat, boring. But when I got the game, I realized that as soon as you get past the first day or two, it is extremely addictive. The whole objective is to get all 30 peices within 30 days. And its very fun getting larger quantities of pikmin so you can do more things at one time. And all the kinds of pikmin have their own unique strengths (example: yellow-throwing molten rocks & jumping higher. blue-is able to swim in water. red-is able to with-stand any fire and/or fire attacks by enemies). This is definetly a challenging game, and it isn't one that you can beat over night. It truly is a great strategic game that keeps you thinking..... I hope this review was helpful to you if you are looking for a video game. Thankyou, *Vapor*	1
This game is so much fun! It's really easy to get into, then you're totally addicted. This game has awesome replay value. When you beat this game you can play it over and over again, and not get bored. This is a fun game for anyone.	1
Pikmin is finally here. The breath of fresh air that was supposedly going to change the way we look at strategy games is in stores as I type this. Everyone always asks, "What is Pikmin about, anyway?" Yet, no one seems to know. So, by reading this review, you will not only find out what the hell it's about, but you will also receive the green light to go pick up this awesome game.   Pikmin is about a strange, size-of-a-Quarter alien-creature named Captain Olimar. The good ol' Captain seems to live a normal human life, as we are told throughout his adventure on this even more strange planet than his. He has a family, and is apparently a Spaceman. He's also a very intelligent being. A meteor hit the Dolphin, which is Captain Olimar's trusty rocket, thus destroying the poor guy's spaceship. Once he lands on this odd planet, he has noticed that he only has 30 Days to stay on this planet, as the air is highly polluted, and his fresh air system will fail in that amount of time. The Captain is also missing 30 Pieces of his Spaceship, the Dolphin. He finds a contraption that sprouts seeds, which he names an "Onion." The seeds, you ask? They are called "Pikmin." These Pikmin are half animal-half plant creatures that will help Mr. Olimar find his ship pieces, and return him home safely.   Well, now that we got that out of the way, let's cut into the beefy center of the game... Pikmin is a strategy game that will control your boredom hours for several days. If you actually have a life, then it will control your boredom hours for several weeks. It's about 12 Hours long, so it's not as short as Luigi's Mansion, but it could be a lot longer. Nonetheless, the game is a MUST OWN if you have a GameCube, and gets my vote for GameCube Game of The Year, without a doubt.   Okay, so now that I've given you the story and the green light to buy this bad boy, I guess you want details, eh? Okay. You can have up to 100 Pikmin on the screen and under your control at once. Pretty nifty, huh? This will come in handy for boss battles. Certain monsters are tiny, some are huge, some roam the land, some swim in shallow water, and some like to fly. What you will have to do is send a pack of 60 or more Pikmin to defeat huge monsters, as they can become a pain in small numbers, and kill most of your poor, innocent little Pikmin. There is nothing more frustrating than planting 60 seeds and having 70 dead Pikmin in return. Tsk, tsk.   Speaking of seeds, once you kill enemies, drag their dead, lifeless bodies back to your "Onion" to sprout more Pikmin! That's right, not only will you get parts to your ship for defeating bosses, but if you have enough Pikmin to carry parts and carcasses, then send one pack of Pikmin for a part, and one pack for the seeds.   There are three types of Pikmin; Red Pikmin, which are land animals! They can defeat enemies in a jiffy without dying as much as the blue or yellow, and they are immune to fire. Blue Pikmin, which can swim without a problem, but die easier than the rest, and Yellow Pikmin, who are known for their incredible strength to lift Bombs! How do you get different seeds, you ask? Whichever color Pikmin lifts an object to get de-seeded, that is the color of Pikmin you will get out of that object.   Enough of the mushy-stuff. The real fun lies in Pikmin's amazing perspective on making you think before you do anything. If there is a piece of the Dolphin on a ledge that Captain Olimar cannot get to, throw some Pikmin on top of the ledge, and guide them from there! I would explain more of this incredible feature that makes you use your brain like no game has in years, but that would spoil the fun for you, and why would I want to do that?   You have a clock in the game, and the Pikmin can only be outside from Sunrise to Sundown, as the planet isn't very lit up. So each day, you have around 14 hours to roam around and collect parts. However, these 14 hours go by very fast, and you will find yourself on the next day in no time. Just ask anybody that played Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. They will tell you how fast the time goes. Make sure you have collected all of your Pikmin before time runs out, or the loose Pikmin will become Ladybug-Food. Worried about the time limit? Don't worry! It's what makes the game fun, and this is coming from me, who disliked Majora's Mask because of the same problem.   If you own a GameCube, you must own this game. It's too short, and that is my only complaint. It's still longer than, let's say, Resident Evil, so don't worry on the length of the game. The game also has tons of replay value, and it's so charming, that you will be playing this one for years to come. The game also has that classic Miyamoto "charm" in it's writing and feel. The best game on the GameCube. Period.	1
Pikmin is a fun game if you like Strategy, Action, Adventure, etc games. Heres the deal, your a space traveler names Captian Olimar that was on vacation and was hit by a meteor. He crash lands on a planet and has to find 30 ship parts before he runs out of air. You only get 30 days (each is about 15 minutes(accept the first)). But you find an "Onion" which is the pikmin's nest thing.  The small pikmin help you fight enemies and get your ship back to 1 piece. Its a very good game however it ends kinda quick. But hey all get games have to have some downsides. If your not sure rent it first	1
This game is very addicting. Once you start you have to beat your records. There is a start mode (other words adventure mode) or a challenge mode. In the adventure mode you look for parts of your ship. In the challenge mode you see how many pikmin you can get in one day (pikmin days not real days). You get more guys by killing these bug looking guys and taking them back to the pikmins onions. Or by doing other things. This game is the best because it is so addicting. This is a must for people who like adventures and have a gamecube. Try it you will simplie love it period.	1
DONT get this game its very boreing and slow its inovative but just not goot at all thank god i rented this game its not worth 50 bucks go get luigis mansion Pikmin is not worth renting 2 times	-1
Shigeru Miyamoto continues to solidify his status as the Beethoven of video games.  Pikmin is pure genius.  I only have two complaints with my pikmin experience.  1.  It was over too soon and 2.  Now I have to go back to playing lesser games until Mario Sunshine comes out. What sets Pikmin apart from so many other games is little touches like Pikmins digging up nectar under the grass and getting so drunk off it they want even look at you.  There is also a huge array of other little critters that will manage to frustrate and challenge even good gamers. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a break from the typical shootemups that are so popular right now.	1
This game is one of the best games on Nintendo Gamecube. Help the little Captain guy build his ship by using Pikmin to help you. Also grow new Pikmin and fight the monsters that eat them. Don't judge this game by its appearance, it's really very good and challenging, as you do have a time limit to get the whole ship intact. It may get somewhat repetitive at times, but don't give up. You will become hooked on Pikmin farming! Those little buggers are just SO adorable!!!	1
A great game the first time around, but it begins to lose it's replay value after a couple of plays. It's a great game, however, and I'd recommend at least renting it. It's a good buy too.	1
Too hard sometimes but is very fun espesially battles.  They needed more different kinds of pikmin though like largr ones that battle and muscley small ones that carry stuff.  There also should have ben levels that you fly you space ship thogh the clods, forests and asteroids. Graphics:***** Replay:**** Story:*** Fun:***** Overall:*****	1
if you like puzle based games then you will love this game.	1
This game is SERIOUSLY addicting!!! If you don't have alot of time on your hands then don't start playing, I play this game only like twice a week cause everytime I pop it in and start playing the challenge part, where you try and grow as many little guys as you can, I get wrapped up in trying to figure out how to get 300 on the The Forest Navel... and next thing I know I have been playing for like 6 hours and I have accomplished nothing all day!!! But hey the game is great and it has immense replay value, little kids and grown ups alike will enjoy!!!	1
The ingenuity of this game is amazing. You control little creatures called Pikmin. There are several types of Pikmin that you will meet throughout the game. The first type you will encounter is the Red. They are the best fighters, and are fire resistant. They drown when they are put in water (I learned this the hard way. THe second type is yellow. They have large ears and can fly higher than other Pikmin. They also can handle bomb rocks, which are used to knock down stone walls. The third kind are the blue Pikmin. They have gills and are water resistant. You start off with one type of each pikmin, then as you beat creatures,they drop pellets, which are made of nutrients from the things the creatures consume. The pikmin then team up to lift the carcass and pellets back to their onion, or  nest. Here, the objects are regenerated into Pikmin sprouts. If you let the seeds stay in the ground, they will grow into a bud and eventually a flower. When they have been grown fully, they are more efficient. There are 5 beautifully designed stages where the parts have been scattered. Which leads us to our plot. As the miniscule Olimar, you, along with the help of Pikmin, have to get to the rocket parts. You have 30 days to do this. You will see the sun move across the top of the screen, simulating time passing. Overall, the visuals are stunning, the creativity is unequaled, and the plot is great. The only thing that could have been better is the replay value, however challenge mode and the high scores may keep you in check for an extra week.	1
... I rented this game because of other reviews but the graphics aren't that great. The graphics are like Super Mario 64. The buttons are so darn confusing. Once I tried to seperate my pikmin in colours and they all ran away. The Game is to short it's a game that most people would beat in one day. The story line is Your rocket gets hit by an asteroid and you land on a weird planet. Your oxygen supplie will only last you 30 pikmin days. You lost thirty parts of your ship that spread out all over the pikmin world. One pikmin day is like 15 minutes so that means you only get 450 minutes of gameplay! One other thing If you use all 30 days and you've only found 29 or less parts you die and have to start a new game. You don't even fight you don't controll the pikmin. You just stand there while they kill the bad guy ( boring ). If you don't believe me still don't buy the game just rent it you'll see.	-1
Over the years Shigeru Miyamoto has brought us many good and innovative  games, from Mario to Zelda. But his newest creation may be his most creative and  unique looking franchise as of yet. What is this new innovative and unique game?  Why it's Pikmin for the GameCube, of course. It was first shown off as a huge  surprise at E3 2001 in May. The game(play) is a real time strategy game simplified more, which in ways  makes the game much more fun, as it is not as complicated, and has a very small  learning curve. In Pikmin you are a Spaceman (Capt. Olimar)  who's ship collides  with an asteroid and forces you to land on a strange new planet.  Here you'll find  the strange Pikmin, along with many other dangerous creatures looking to make a  meal out of the little plant like Pikmin. The Pikmin are more then willing to help you  in your quest to find the 30 missing parts to your spaceship, before you run out of  oxygen in 30 days. But you will have to help the Pikmin with there problems as well.  And boy do they have problems, it seems that the neighboring critters have  developed at appetite for these little creatures. Well with some of them it's not so  much an appetite as it is just spitting boulders at them, smashing them, or  drowning them. So as you can see you've got some work ahead. Fortunately when  you kill these enemies little seeds appear in there place ranging in size, and with  different numbers on them. The higher the number, the more seeds you get. Also, if  the color of the seed is the same as the Pikmin (i.e.: Blue to Blue) then you get  even more. Once you defeat an enemy have some Pikmin take them back to the  strange looking nests (see to the right) it sucks up the seed and more Pikmin will  begin shooting out and plopping down into the soil where soon you, the spaceman,  will be able to pluck them from the ground and use them. Many times you will need  many Pikmin to defeat certain enemies... Controlling the Pikmin is a breeze... One thing  that is near perfect is the camera system... The only  problem I found was in the rotating of the camera, and how you must be facing the  direction you want the camera to face... Graphically speaking Pikmin looks amazing! The Miyamoto touch is very  clear in Pikmin, the detail of everything in the game is very high, and the textures  look so real you'd swear your watching a Nature Show...  The way the environment interacts with the Pikmin and the Spaceman is very good  as well. If they brush up against an object such as a leaf or branch it sways, or how  a trail of dust follows, but can stop depending on the terrain. The Sound of Pikmin is quite impressive. With a custom soundtrack  composed by Hajime Wakai, creator of the Star Fox soundtrack, each area has  it's own song. And the music can change depending on the mood... The sound effects are also way above average. From water splashing  against the shore to the sound of the little Pikmins' feet running through it.  Capt.  Olimar's feet sound great running across surface, and can even vary on the surface  he's running on. Overall, Pikmin is a pretty fun and interesting little game, but the fact of the  matter it is a little game. It will only last from around 12-15 hours... My Comments:  "Pikmin was the first game that I played for the  GameCube last year at the Cube Club, so it  automaticly holds a special place in my eye.  Never the less, it's still one terrific game, that  you at least owe a rent, despite it's length."  MY RATING:  9.0	1
You'd think a game like Pikmin would only be for some sweet little five year olds.  But it's not.  Pikmin involves strategic desciscions. Your ship has just crashed.  And your name is captain olimar.  You land on a mysterious island where you find creatures that you later name pikmin.  As the game goes on you'll meet different kinds of Pikmin. (red,yellow, and blue) They do things for you. Such as there is a huge wall so you tell 20 of your pikmin to break it down.  You can also fight lady bugs with your pikmin.  The point of killing the ladybugs is to bring them back to a ship your pikmin go in and then a certain amount of pikmin come out.  You can also get more pikmin from finding blocks having a number on it.  When you bring those to the pikmins spacecraft it sprouts you whatever the number was on the block.  Don't worry that it takes a million years to sprout because it doesn't.  It actually takes around five seconds. Oh yeah i forgot that the whole meaning of this game is find and repair your ship by going to different islands to find pieces to your ship.  In all you begin without 30 pieces that you need to find in thirty days.	1
First off, I would like to say I give this game a 2 1/2 (Not a 2 You can't choose 1/2's on ratings) Second off, before you even you read my review, I just want to make one thing clear: Don't BUY this game. Let me emphesis BUY. I mean do not purchase this game for keeps. I would reccomend renting it, or possibly playing it at some other kids house. This concept of "Pikmin" is amazing. It's a cross between Warcraft and Kirby 64. You control an army of tiny little red, blue, and yellow creatures, while you lead them across vast and magical places. You're ship has crashed, and with the help of your pikmin to find missing parts, you can come home again. What's so horrible about this game? It has every element of difficulty. You are timed, and to make matters worse you must do entire missions over if you don't succeed. Once it has been 12 hours (which is more like 5 mins in pikmin land) you must get all of your pikmin back in the spaceship. If you don't, you lose them. Your pikmin are S-T-U-P...um...oh yeah...I-D. This one time I had a Grub Dog (A monster in the pikmin world) eat 40 of my pikmin. I told them to get a part, so they did. Then on the way back, they walked right into a grub dog. I could've named at least 4 alternate routes! He woke up and started eating all the pikmin. They didn't fight back right away and I had to tell them too! Second, red and yellow pikmin (who cannot swim, only blue can) will constantly fall into the water. It's almost funny how dumb they are when you watch them just walk in the water. Your Pikmin don't exactly follow orders. I will by walking along, and all of a sudden they will decide they'll going to attack a flower that hasn't bloomed. (Which works againts you because bloomed flowers provide more pikmin) Or once I saw 3 of them run off to attack a baby grub dog, who were all immediatly killed. Replay .... WRONG! Once you played it, you played it. I wouldn't spend hours playing the exact same thing i played before, would you? Lastly, By the third level the enemies are 10x stronger! They will things on fire and the mindless pikmin will just go into it. Renting it: fine. Go ahead. You'll some fun. Buying: Only if you plan you get rid of it in a week.	-1
Pikmin for the Nintendo GameCube is an excellent real time strategy game (RTSG).  Created by Nintendo's star programmer Shigeru Miyamoto (Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong), Pikmin is a franchise that everyone will be playing for quite some time.  The basic story behind the game, is that a little guy named Captain Olimar was driving his spaceship through space when it was hit by a mediator that sends him spinning out of control onto an unknown planet.  During the freefall, Olimar's ship gets broken up into 30 different parts that Olimar has to find within 30 days before his oxygen tanks run out.  The rest of the game basically involves doing this exact thing.  There are 5 different areas in the game that have Olimar's parts spread out all over them.  Throughout the game, Olimar encounters 3 different color Pikmin that all have different attributes that assist him in his attempt to gather up the 30 parts.  Each day in the game lasts about 13 minutes so the overall length of the game is not that long, but since the game take multiple attempts to master, has 3 different endings, has an added Challenge mode which allows players to duke it out for high scores, Pikmin is a top notch game that is definitely a must have to anyone's GameCube library.	1
Pikmin is a game that is mostly organizing and strategy.  The game takes no skill really because you just need to push A a lot in order to attack someone with those little guys.  This game is very challenging becuase you are timed 30 days and have to do as much as you can in one day.  I really suggest this game to anyone who wants a game thats challenging and long.  There might be only 5 levels, but you goto to them over and over again to do different things.  The controls of this are really simple and comfortable to handle.  The game clearly explains the controls a lot so you don't forget.  So once again Pikmin is one of the most innovative game out there!	1
First of all, this game is FUN. Collecting three colors of little alien pikmin to kill enemies and get ship parts is FUN. But, there are a few problems. First of all, only 15 minutes a day? Yes. There is only 15 minutes each day and only 30 days. Why? It made me more hesistent to play this game. It was as if 1 wrong move and it was the end. Be prepared to repeat days LOT. Other than that, it is pretty good.	1
Well, this game was a lot better than I expected.  It is (thankfully) not related to Pokemon in anyway.  The Pikmin actually perform useful tasks, such as carrying the missing rocket parts, building bridges, bombing or tearing down gates and walls, and killing enemies who would rather eat Captain Olimar and the Pikmin.  Despite it's kiddie sort of charm (the Pikmin are kind of cute little buggers) little kids would probably be upset playing this.  It's not pleasant watching dozens of your Pikmin getting eaten, or blown up, or drowning.  Anyway, this is really a lot of fun.  For most of the rocket parts you need to find, you have to solve some kind of puzzle, like what color Pikmin to use, while others are lying out in the open, or in the bellies of particularly tough enemies (the Emperor Bulblax is one of the biggest and weirdest boss on the gamecube so far)  The game seems to be over too quick, but it's a lot of fun while it lasts.  Buy it, and you'll be satisfied.	1
The creator of Mario has done it again with a game that is sure to sell plenty of Gamecubes over the next few months.  This game is beautiful and very technically impressive, but at the same time leaves you begging for more. You are marooned on a planet and need to find 30 different parts for your space ship, but with only a limited time to do so.  You have 30 "days" in the game that are really 15 minute segments in real-time.  You use small, mindless creatures called "Pikmin" that each have seperate qualities and abilities, who aid you in your quest. The best part of this game is the difficulty.  The game is never too hard or really stumps you, but it also never gets too easy or repetitive.  It has the perfect mix of strategy and action, all doused in gorgeous graphics and control. Overall, I would suggest this game for anyone who has a good 7 hours to blow with their shiny new Gamecube.  Who wouldn't trust the creator of Mario?	1
Let me start off by saying that Pikmin is not only for little kids.  It is directed towards kids, but can be fun for anyone who likes strategy games.  The object of the game is to find all 30 parts of your battered spaceship within a 30 day (each day is roughly 15 minutres long) time limit.  You must use each pikmin's abilities to their fullest to do this such as using yellow pikmin to reach really high places and red pikmin to carry parts over flames.  While it seems simple enough, it can be quite challenging to get all 30 parts.  The enemies of the levels can completely devastate your pikmin population if you send them into dangerous situations without orders.  This game uses a new approach to strategy, and it is by far one of the best games on the gamecube. NOTE: this game needs 19 blocks of memory to save	1
Pikmin has got to be the wierdest game I have ever played. I love it! Only a true game master such as Shigeru Miyamoto could have possibly dreamed up a game as original and innovative as this. The main theme of the game for those of you who don't know what its al about... Captin Olimar, a great space traveler, has crashed-landed on a strange planet after his ship collided with a meteor. After a prilimanary examination of his surroundings, he has looked over his beloved ship, The Dolphin(anyone recognize the code name for Gamecube?). He has discovered that his ship is missing 30 parts apon crash-landing, and if he ever wishes to return to Planet Hoctate where his wife and two children are, he must recover his lost parts. And to make matters worse, he has detected the poisinous gas oxegen in the planets atmosphere, and his life-support will be able to hold out for only 30 more days. Then as he is beginning to explore, he finds a strange plant that spouts a single seed upon his arrival. After a short time, the seed grows into a sprout that waves back and forth. Olimar aproches the sprout and picks it, only to find not a plant but a living creature! The creature, bearing a resemblance to a minature carrot on his planet called a Pikpik, simply stands there looking as Olimar, as if waiting for his orders. He decides he will call this strange species a Pikmin, and must enlist the help of more Pikmin to help him recover his missing ship parts. The game, while challenging but rewarding, is great fun to play, and with time, the Pikmin grow to be not your slaves working for you, but your friends trying to help you, and every time you lose one, its not just another Pikmin gone, its a comrade you have lost in battle. The attitude seemes to be light and happy throghout, but really in firece battles it is quite intense. And although it is a charming game and the Pikmin themselves are cute little critters, don't let that trick you into thinking this is a child's game, because I think it is games like this and Super Monkey Ball(also a great game) that cause people who aren't fans of nintendo to think that its a childish system , but if they actually sat down and played them for a few minutes, they would relize that it is really a very challenging game that is not at all childish. Pikmin is up there with Super Smash Brothers Melee at the top of the list of my favorite Gamecube games, and anyone who dismisses it as a kiddie game will be missing out on one of the very best Gamecube games out there.	1
For two decades, Nintendo's master game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, has been entertaining the world with his artistic approach to video game design. He is responsible for inventing industry icons such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda, and many, many more. Mr. Miyamoto's success lies in his creative ability to intertwine solid game play mechanics, interesting characters and engrossing story lines. Simply put, Shigeru Miyamoto knows how to make games that are just fun to play. His latest creation is Pikmin, a genre-breaking masterpiece available exclusively for Nintendo GameCube. For those who don't know, Miyamoto's main babies are: Donkey Kong (arcade) Super Mario Bros. (NES) Star Fox (SNES) Super Mario 64 (N64) Yoshi's Story (N64) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (N64) Pikmin (GC) This is beginning to drag on, so I'll start reviewing AND talking. Pikmin, put simply, is a spastic venture through imagination. As aforementioned, Shigeru Miyamoto, Mr. Nintendo, the bigwig, designed this game. Her created the concepts, he made the changes. He made the reason you should buy this system. Okay, here's the story: You are Captain Olimar. You are on vacation and heading for a vacation planet in your spaceship, the Dolphin. Accordingly, a meteor changes that vacation. One collides with your ship. It enter's another planet's atmosphere, where it breaks into 30 pieces which scatter throughout the planet. After you regain consciousness, you find a machine called an Onion. It shoots out a lone seed. It blooms quickly, and you pick it. It is...an animal. One cute enough to make Hello Kitty throw up. Summarizing, you have 30 days to recover 18 parts using your little Pikmin. Now for the review. At a graphical standpoint, Pikmin is extraordinary. While the graphics are cute and playful, they are EXTREMELY realistic. The water looks real enough to drink it, the dirt under your feet kicks up when you walk, and the grass looks like you could mow it from your controller. I've probably run on too long now, so I give Pikmin a 5/5 for graphics. As for the sound, I must say it's just as good. The Pikmin make the cutest little noises. Their feet pitter-patter as they walk, as yours clump along. The enemy creatures scream in agony as you beat them up with your Pikmin. Your rocket makes a roaring noise as it takes off. If that isn't enough, then the best sound thing in the game is when the little Pikmin comes on at the beginning and says "Nintendo." It is the cutest thing you will ever hear. 5/5 for sound. As for its ingenuity, where else can you order around little plant-like creatures on an alien planet for thirty days? This game breaks all genres, creating its own. 5/5 for ingenuity to the max. The game sinks its claws into you and doesn't let go. It's nearly impossible to put down. There are no special features or anything to unlock, but the game has an amazing story line. 5/5 for replay value. This game will have you cheering on your Pikmin, screaming at the bad ones, and crying over your lost ones, all while playing. It's the most consuming game on Earth. This game is the one true reason to buy the system, not Star Wars. Miyamoto has done it again, and he'll keep on going. Graphics: 5/5 Sound: 5/5 Ingenuity: 5/5 Replay: 5/5 TOTAL: 5/5	1
A cool game about little thingys named pikmin with leaves on there head(and the grodog*or whatever it's called*is a freaky forest dog thingimagigy)Okay,you look at the box and think"this game is WAY to kiddy! Look,cute little creatures and just the name"well,your thinking wrong! It's a great single player game with good sounds,great graphics and a puzzling challenge for young and old! The point of it is you are a spaceguy who crashed into the pikmins planet. His whole ship falls apart! He starts looking for the pieces but on the way,leafs stick out of the ground. He picks them up and(pop)a pikmin! The pikmins help you find all the pieces before 30 days are up:)	1
I just got Pikmin yesterday, but I already love it! The story line (Captain Olimar is hit by a meteor and lands on the Pikmin planet and his rocket ship falls apart) is a little dumb, but it doesn't really matter to me. I think the backyard music sounds very good, and even the Pikmin have sound! Gameplay is super. Tell the Pikmin what to do, and they will do it. Some Pikmin can do tasks that other Pikmin can't, based on their color. But the general thing Pikmin need to do is bring back parts of your ship, while avoiding danger. There is a very reasonable amount of controls. You can round Pikmin up with a whistle or dismiss them for a little bit. All the graphics are amazing. The plants and grass look so real, and all the characters look perfect. Although the game is short, the thing I really like about Pikmin is that there is no right or wrong way to do things. You can experiment and have fun. If you think this is "kidde" then you are judging a book by it's cover. This game is *both* kidde and mature at the same time, because strategy and cartoon action are combined. A 5 out of 5!!!	1
I just got his game, but I can conlude that it is a very nice game. This is fun because: You get the little pikmen with items brought to your item. (which is fun to watch the pikmen bring the item they have to carry it to the onion) The boss fights are real cool to watch, as your pikmen get killed. The pikmen are very loyal. They will carry any item, get thrown, and more. They will even line up by color.  This is my second favorite game for gamecube. Only Super Smash Bros. is beter. I think SSB. is better, because of all the fun, and features in it. Pikmen, though, is probably for younger kids. 13 or under, since it is sort of a non violent game.	1
Pikmin is a new type of game coming straight out of Nintendo. Legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto designed this game. And he known for making great games. The game revolves around Captain Olimar and his little Pikmin friends. Captain Olimar has crashed landed on a planet and has to get off the planet in 30 days due to a poisonous gas called oxygen. He finds little creatures called Pikmin. And the adventure begins... The graphics in this game are amazing. The worlds look photo-realistic. Don't let the appearance of the characters fool you into thinking this is a kid game. This game can be enjoyed be just about everyone. The game is quite a challenge. But it's not too hard nor is it too easy. It's quite funny watching the Pikmin run into battle. Truly a great game! Hang in there little guys.	1
Pikmin was created from Zelda's daddy, Shigeru Miyameto. Pikmin is about a guy from Earth who accidently crash-landed on a very strange and unusual planet filled with alien creatures that view the guy nothing less than breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, dessert, or a midnight snack. But later on when you look around, you find the "Pikmin", little alien creatures that are attracted to anything that pulls them out from the ground. The Pikmin are as loyal as dogs and will do whatever you order them to do. For example, if you tell them to kill a huge mushroom monster, they'll do it without complaining even if killing it means to get eaten themselves. You must repair your spaceship because the atmosphore is toxic to your little character. The game is intruging and innoventive from the start. People may say it's too kiddy but the game is meant to be played by all generations. (...) So in conclusion, Pikmin proves that Shigeru Miyameto is a mastermind at making video games.	1
Charming is probably the best word to describe Pikmin, and not just because of the doe eyed title critters. The gameplay, a puzzle based real time strategy hybrid of sorts, is as unique as it is captivating with great controls outside of a small probble. Anyone can pick up Pikmin right away, but with time you realize just how many different ways you could play through it. It's one of those games i often paused and just sat with, considering m next move. You really want to be careful because cute little items, or the tiny trumpet that sounds as they march, quickly trick you into loving the lil [critters]. So much viciously tearing it apart from all sides like a pack of crazed hyena, becomes a strangely proud moment. The nice variety of bad guys has a weakness to dis that, like Luigi's Mansion, Pikmin ends right as it's find all 30 pieces, plus there are tons of reasons for replay. But just as the complexity of the puzzles is reaching that sweet spot, where you see all the possibilities and the true beauty of this game, it's over. A few more areas like the last level could have made this great game much better.	1
What happens when gaming guru, Shigeru  Miyamoto, is oppressed with the role as the integral man for masterminding the next Zelda and Metriod titles?  From the production of Pikmin, it seems as if he seizes a deep, consoling breath and rips open a bag full of relaxation.  Ah, finally all that dreadful anxiety and flagrant expectations from gaming fans everywhere wash away.  His sheer brilliance veers into a jaunty, animated dream world.  Conclusively, he creates a bizarre game where players are ferried  onto a planet where replicas of giant onions come alive and spawn multicolored, cutesy creatures called Pikmin.  Perhaps Miyamoto's latest game is a minor escape from the daunting task of transcending the GameCube into unreachable stratum?  Whatever the case, Pikmin is not what would we ordinarily expect as a first-class launch title, but it doesn't even fall short to deliver one addictive gem.  The player assumes the responsibility of Captain Orima who looks like a freshly baked character from Cartoon Network.  With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.   Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic. The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front. The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game. Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.	1
I'm sick and tired of (people) writing these bad reviews about Pikmin when they have not even played the damn game. The game is very fun and everyone of all ages will love it, I promise. Adults and kids alike will enjoy this game and it is addictive. (...) I love it and I bet you you will too.	1
Pikmin has got to be the most original and addictive game I've played in a really long time. Nintendo has another winner on its hands, and I just hope people look past the "cute" look of this game and see how truly fun it is. Yes, the Pikmin look sorta cutesy, but if you try this game, you'll find that this game's kiddie looks evaporate about 5 seconds after you see a dozen or so of them get stomped on and gobbled up by a giant frog. A previous reviewer mentioned that this "series" should have died out long ago, but I don't know what he's talking about. Pikmin isn't a series and this is the first game of its kind. He must be thinking of Pokemon, which is a totally different style of game.	1
This game puts you right in the middle of the action. Really. The sound effects and graphics are incredible. I just bought a new computer and I've spent up to 8 hours or more playing this and Beachead 2002. If you want to have fun and a challange, this game is definitely for you. One drawback or negative and it's a big one... The turret or machine gun continually moves and it's annoying as hell... If you try to take aim on an oncoming tank, the barrel continues to move and you have to battle the movement continuously... Aside from that, it's a fantastic amount of fun!	1
I once worked in quality assurance (AKA: Testing) for a video card company. As a result, I play lots and lots of games. When I came across Beachhead 2000 here on amazon and saw that it had 4 stars, I almost swallowed my tongue.  Now you don't have to take my word for this. Just about all the PC Game magazines out there had a unanimous verdict on this game. Which pretty much boiled down to "um... this sucks."  The game is completely arcade styled. This is not a bad thing on its own. However the bad guys you have to shoot down stay pretty much the same throughout the entire game... just more of them moving faster. Anyone who claims that this is in any way representative of any conflict, anywhere - on a beach, in the air or on a city street should seek medical attention immediately.  While ($) does seem like a great price for software, keep in mind that the old saying "You get what you pay for" is not only true... but at ($)you are STILL being overcharged for what this pile of digital doodoo has to offer.  You want your moneys worth for ($)? Shop around for a copy of "Half-Life". The game as it comes is worth many times the price and once your done with the game that comes in the box, you can download a wide variety of add-on material that gets you a whole new game. Did I mention you can download all these add-ons FOR FREE?  That really is about it. Run, don't walk, away from this product... save yourself.	-1
I came across Beach Head 2000 and decided to give it a shot, wanting a diversion from writing code.  Unfortunately, it isn't anything like the five star reviewers suggest. This game would be perfect for children (who aren't technically sophisticated) to keep them occupied for about half a day (maybe more for children that are "special").  After that, it's more an exercise in repetition than entertainment.  Another plus is that the graphics are mediocre, so no expensive graphics card (or fast CPU) is required.  Adults will be bored within 30 minutes if even that long. So, I have to agree with the one star reviewers on this one.  The game is reminiscent of the arcade games in the 80's, where you do the same thing again, and again, only faster.  It gets boring quickly. If you run out of ammunition (and you will), you can't do anything except wait to be killed. It is a one star game, but I gave it two stars because grandparents can use it to distract their grandchildren for an hour or two, on an underpowered PC.	-1
NHL Hitz is a great game that is just like Blitz for hockey. I think all hockey, blitz and sports lovers will love this game and I think everyone should get this wonderful game.	1
This game rocks! You can make your own team,players can have shark heads,gladiator heads,alien heads,knight heads,and more! You can also play on the moon,in a castle,in a gladiator arena,in shark tank,on a frozen pond,on a pirate ship,and more. You can also check guys through the glass. This is the best hockey game I have ever played!	1
If I told you about a game where you hit people with sticks, throw your full body force into players, and be able to punch, grab, and headbutt opponents, you'd think I was talking about Ready to Rumble, or something! I'm NOT! It's NHL Hitz 20-02. The best Hockey game I have ever played since Sega... well... maybe not, but still. NHL 20-02 is probably the best Sports game for G-Cube, even better than Madden 2002! (Which I gave a 93.67/100) When you think about Hockey, you know violence is involved. Players don't where layers of padding for nothing! But NHL does more than that. Not many Hockey games are this aggressive. Players literacy trip others with their sticks when attempting to steal the puck. When you check, you check hard. You will sometimes push, shove with your shoulder, or hold your stick horizontally and smash your opponent. OUCH! There are a bunch of teams. When selecting a team, it will show their stats for Defense, Offense, and Speed, which can be 1-20, the higher the better. On the ice is great. You select a center, a winger, and a man on defense. The Goalie is a selected player. The Goalie can be the CPU or the User, you select. Not to mention after each game, you get awarded a certain # of credits. You receive 100/150/200 for playing in Rookie/Pro/All-star mode and get 30/60/90 points for answering an easy/medium/hard question after the game is done. You can then go to the sports shop and purchase New jerseys, (100c) New teams, (500-1000c) New Arenas, (500c) or New heads for create-a-player. (300-700c) With your choice on Franchise/Exhibition/Championship/Create-a-player (or team)/Skills, NHL 20-02 gets a 10/10 for gameplay. It finally happened! I have waited so long for someone to say "Hey, here's an Idea, lets have the audience in 3D!" In every sports game I've seen, the Audience are cardboard figures, with choppy movement of them throwing a hand in the air and then to their side. Thank you Blackbox! The Audience reacts with great effects. The on-ice is also great. Each team player has amazing details. When getting different levels, the puck is different! On a moon rink, the puck is a moon-rock. On the Disco rink, the puck is mirror-ball. It's hilarious! When you look at the Goalie, is padding is spectacular. With Phenomenal 3D enriched environment, NHL Hitz gets a 10/10 for graphics. And don't forget the jerseys, all of them have the logo on them. There's not much to say about the sound. You just hear the clashing of sticks, the stick breaking the sound barrier, and the crowd cheering (or booing!) at players.  The announcers aren't that spectacular. Unlike Madden, where the commentators explain about what's going on, what's happened last season, what they should do, and reaction to plays, NHL Hitz has people who say "[Insert name of player here] just took a shot!" "Blocked by [Insert name of player here]" "Puck stolen from [Insert name of player here] by [Insert name of player here]." It's rather boring, so I think I can safely sleep at night without felling too bad by giving the sound an 8.5/10 Now, when I say speed, I don't mean how fast Wayne Gretzky and glide down the rink, I mean loading time. Again, contrary to madden, the loading time is exceptionally fast. The only tiny problem is it takes about a quarter of a second for the players faces to load when selecting your team. What's even better, is you can set the speed of the game! If things are too fast for you on the ice, just crank down the speed a notch. Call me crazy, but Speed gets an 11/10. Controlling the players is no fun. It's watching the expression on your friends face and you juke his opponent, fake shot and pass it, move the puck to the side of you as he attempts to stick slap you, watch your CPU character bash him out of the rink, breaking the glass, and doing a slap-shot right into the net as you win the game. Now, do you know how hard that scenario would be? You don't, BECAUSE IT'S NOT! Look, to do this, I would press Y, X, Hold B and press A, the CPU would "press" y, and then I would Hold B to my liking to choose how hard I should hit it. The longer you hold, the harder you hit. With simple controls like A to pass, B to shoot, X to guard puck, and Y to spin, and on defense, a to switch players, B to stick-slap and attempt to steal, Y to do a check, and X to do... well I don't think it does anything. Then by pressing R or L to go into the Patented "Turbo" mode, the controlling makes the grade with a 10/10. Replay ... well DUH! I'm not going to buy a Hockey game and play it once. All sport games have to get a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, obviously, NHL Hitz 20-02 gets a 10/10 for Replay. Without a doubt, if you ever feel like a Hockey game, just pick up NHL Hitz. Let's review: Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Sound: 8.5/10 Speed: 11/10 Controls: 10/10 Replay value: 10/10 Total: 59.5/60 giving NHL Hitz 20-02 a 99.16. CHEATS Well, like most Midway Sports games, there's that thing where you select a variety of 3 pictures, then press up/down/left/right. NHL has that, and the codes are great. There's Snow mode, Big head mode, and first person to 7 wins mode. With no generosity, I'll give it a +2 for codes, because it's hard to enter more than one code at once, and sometimes you can't even enter one. NHL Hitz 20-02's new score is  an 101.16. MY FIRST GRADE OVER 100! Now even I know it's good!	1
You've gotta love watching a little sorty fatass beat the hell out of some huge buff 7'0" guy...especially when shorty has a donkey head.  HA! A good hockey game, but gets it's stars from it's comedy.	1
As a die hard hockey fan, I eagerly awaited this game. I was not disappointed. Midway has kept true to its style of pro sports games. Having the GameCube as a system to work with, Midway excelled in all areas! The graphics are excellent for a hockey game(only NHL2K for Dreamcast is better). Game play is intense! Fast, furious and nonstop! Although you can control the speed of the game in the options screen and slow things down, but why would you? Control of the skaters is a bit awkward and difficult at first, but is easily overcome with practice. Smooth player movements and precise commentary add to the game. Options, and many of them!! Choose your favorite NHL team, one of Midway's "special teams" or create your own. Choose your teams colors, jerseys, logos, your teams stadium and yes, even nicknames that the announcers will say during the game! And plenty more options to choose from! Trade players, fights, and even trivia questions that can earn you points to increase your players skills. There is even a "Skills" game that helps you increase your hockey skills to be a better opponent for the computer! This game has more features and options than I have mentioned here. Bottom line is this, NHL Hitz is the best 3 on 3 hockey game for any game system! This is a MUST for any video game player, even if are not a hockey fan! Go Avalanche!!	1
I was going to the video store one weekend (actually, my dad went for me), and I wanted to rent a game. Our video store has a large selection of GCN games. I couldn't seem to make up my mind (but I'm sure that you have probably already igured out what game I rented). So I picked NHL Hitz 20-02.   I was a bit skeptical about the game at first. I mean, I've got the 'awsome, eyecandy' of a hockey game called NHL 2002 by EA Sports for my computer, so I didn't really know if I was gonna like this. I tried it out a little...and...GUESS WHAT!?!?!? I fell in love with this game. It's NHL hockey as it was MEAN'T to be; Big Hits (and I mean BIG HITS!!!), dramatic goals, HUGE FIGHTS, and CHEAT CODES! ;)   This game is the NHL version of the Midway classic known as NFL Blitz (which also had sequels each year for roster updates, graphics improvment, and more features). You start the game off with 3 gameplay modes: Exhibition, Season, and Franchise. And there is also some extras like: the Hockey Store, and Create-a-Team feature.   Exhibition is the basic mode of the game if you want some classic fun (and you can also play this mode multiplayer with up to 3 other people). You pick your team from a colection of ALL the NHL teams in the league (but I am sorry to say: NO international teams). You can also buy more teams at the hockey shop. Once your done picking your teams, you pick three players (from a list of six) for your team to have as your line for the first period. After that you will procede to the section where you have 5 seconds to type in cheat codes (like bigger hits, huge heads, tennis ball puck, ect.) Once your done picking your hockey dudes and doing cheats, you will go to a cool, and somethimes comical, Pre-game show.   There are NO penalties in this game; the only way for your player to be kicked out of a game is...LOSE a FIGHT!!! If you lose a fight, the player that lost the fight is out of the game. The fights are awsome: VERY DRAMATIC.   In season mode, it is basically that same as most hockey games: you go through the season and try to win the STANLEY CUP.   In franchise mode, you try to make your created team better (as you get more points to improve created players with each franchise win). You try to win the MIDWAY CUP.   At the Hockey Shop, you can buy various nostalgic jerseys, new arenas, new teams, and special heads for created players. You earn points for playing exhibition games and season games, and you use these points for the hockey shop.   It create-a-team mode, you can create a team by customizing your jersey logo, jersey color scheme, and team name. You can create six players and one goalie for your team. You start out with a limited amount of points to make your player attributes. BUT that is what franchise mode is for: yo earn points to make your players better. You can chose different faces for your player. You also custumize your player's body size and stuff: the players can look any way you want.   There are also alot of options to customize like game speed and music style. The Graphics are a bit on the weak side (as they could have been better). The sound is awesome. The commentator is pretty funny. Also, the controls are pretty easy to learn.   If you are looking for adrenaline pumping hockey action, NHL Hitz is for you. It's no were near a hockey sim, but that's WHY it's fun. If you want a hockey sim, I suggest buying NHL 2002 by EA Sports for PS2, X-Box, or computer...or you can wait till fall of 2002 till the SEGA NHL 2K3 comes out for the GCN. But if you want a FUN, arcade style hockey game, this game is for you.   I also have one more thing to say: GO WINGS!!!!!!! ;)	1
I do not yet own this game but i have rented it.  If you guys like NFL Blitz, this is the hockey version of it.  The game is totally addictive so be prepared for late night playing hours.  I was surprised at how fun this game was and how cool it was.  The stadiums that you can buy are awsome.  The pucks for the stadium are somewhat related to the environment that you are playing in.  The teams that you can make or buy are awsome.  But someone should really buy this game.  You will be impressed.	1
NHL HITZ is by far the most addicting game I have ever played. I am a huge hockey fan and love the rougher side of the game (ie fighting, checking). This game does not disappoint. It is basically NFL BLITZ for hockey. You play 3 on 3 with a goalie and a couple of players on the bench. Some of the cooler parts game are: 1. the SPEED - speed is amazing, your fingers never stop moving, you are always trying to catch up with the action 2. the CHECKING - some of the best checks EVER, you can send guys through the glass and into the crowd! 3. the FIGHTING - there's plenty fighting and it's easy to win 4. PLAYER SELECTION - you can change your 3 man lineup between each period. This is the best hockey game since NHL Hockey for Sega Genesis, do not hesitate for one second......BUY IT NOW!	1
This is a game that is like N.F.L. Blitz, just hockey. Because of how it is very unrealistic. There are 3 players on the ice. Codes for using a hockey ball, or tennis ball. Goalies get checked, and can check. Players become on fire. You can be aliens, soldiers, poneys, totempoles, and about 20 others. There also are no penalties. This, though, is a fun game.	1
Ever since I got this game I could not put it down. My favorite part of the game is the records page in which me and my brother continually compete for the top spot. The fast pace makes this game incredible with never a dull moment. Another amazing component of this game is the interactive crowd. Instead of the dull blur of the crowd in other games, this game features an interactive crowd that has seperate animations for each situation in the game. (such as a big hit a a goal score) This is the 1st game ever for this feature. The fast pace and exciting games make this game a winner. Being a hockey fan myself helped me love this game. GO STARS!! Pros: * Awesome Graphics * Fast Pace * Game you'll play over and over again * Well worth your money Cons: * Extremely Addictive * You Will Find Better Games on the Gamecube	1
While priced low, don't be fooled into thinking this is a budget title. It's not. This is a first-rate game at a bargain price. It is a WW II mission-based game in which you control a squad of men into Germany. You can switch at ANY time from first to third person. You can also switch bodies with any of your men at any time, which is really cool. You can command your men to hold position, attack, or follow in a variety of formations. You can commandeer vehicles. The sniper rifle has always been my favorite gun in any game that offers them, and I was delighted to see one here, and it works fine. You must sneak and strategize to survive. When starting the game you pick your squad from 12 available men with different skills. Then you outfit them however you like. This is a nice feature and is more involving than other shooters, but it is very easy to do. There are rain effects, and the grass even blows in the wind. The graphics are great, and I was amazed to find that the game ran smoothly (640 x 480) on my ageing PII 450 with an NVidia TNT 1 video card. I'm running 256 MB ram and 16 MB video ram. I'm running it with high detail. I imagine if your video card is 32 MB, you could crank the resolution higher and still get good framerates. This game even comes with a small manual, which contains most everything you'll need to know to play the game. Others have mentioned a few graphical glitches, but I have seen none of those on my system, and I suspect video card driver problems with those who have had those problems. Bottom line: This would be a great game even if it was full-priced. This is the best money I've spent all year, and I can only hope this low pricing is the start of a trend.	1
This game has great graphics, (provided you have a good graphics card) excellent shadows and light, textures, etc.  The gameplay is fairly basic, not too complicated like many new war games. This game is better than some games that I have paid twice as much for.  I have so far only played one other squad based game that I like more than this...	1
Madden 2002 is a great game.  This game has great graphics and it has more than most basic football games. Franchise is fun to play with all real NFL Players. Making a team is great, fantastic, and amazingly new. Buy this game now. I MEAN NOW!!!!!! Never buy the wrong football game.	1
This is the best football game ever.it has good graphics good sound and good controlls. don't listen to any of the low rating people, they haven't even played the game as ussual they rate it low because its on gamecube. but the truth is this game is best played on gamecube since it has better framerate and all that.   this game is also more realistic than Blitz.  you can also create your own team design their uniform and logo then you can play them against other teams. The only bad thing is you need a new memory card if you want to save everything in the game, but you don't necessarily need it to play it so it isn,t that bad you can still save. Be sure your not wasting your money on this game. If your still not sure just count how many have rated them hi against the ones that rated them low.	1
We all know the 2 kinds of football games. Theres NFL Blitz where players fly across the field, beat [each other up], and the football is the size of there heads, then theres Madden. The great thing about madden is that it's simply realistic. Real physics, real penaltys, a player can get injured. Plus, get this, you can challenge calls. I have never used this option before. It's great! What makes Madden unbeleivble is it's awesome "Instant Replay" option. You can see the entire field, with the abilility to move, turn and zoom freely. You can choose EAsy mode (Get it, EAsy for EA sports. Heh, heh) and Normal. Also you may select Madden Cards (Which is cool feature) or training. During the game you can get points for completing certain goals (i.e, making a 30 yard pass, intercepting, sacking the QB making 3 tackels with one player, a 30 yard field goal, etc) Not to forget the ability to turn penalties on, or decrease there size. With a create-a-team option or God-like players (On the Ecko team) Gameplay gets 10/10. The graphics don't get much better. With details on every player, coach and referee, it's amazing. Instant Replay's aren't grainy or choppy, they look perfect. There is absolutly nothing wrong with the graphics. It gets a perfect 10/10. Because it's EA you know that the commentary will be great. John Madden cracks me up with his little sayings he quotes. Not to mention you can hear the announcer say funny phrases. Such as, once, I cleary heard him say "Would the owner of a blue jeep cherokee, liscene 767-EXE please report to the parking lot? You're vehicle is on fire." What's wrong with it? Well, either i'm havinh Deja Vu, or the people say the same things maybe 3 times per game. After a while it gets boring because the don't say new things. With a small subtraction because of repetition, the sound receives a 8/10. Speed? Well, let me just say I wasn't happy. Unlike other Gamecube games, which load within 5 or 10 seconds, Madden takes 30-35 seconds. It's worth it in the end though! Unfortunatly, I have to nail the speed by giving it a harsh 7/10. Controls are amazing. It just makes perfect sense! When the ball is snapped, you will see an A,B,X,R or L over certain players heads. (During Normal mode you must press "A" first) Just press the corresponding button and the QB will pass. X is spin. Y is jump. C-stick in stiff arms. B is dive. It just makes perfect sense. A 10/10 is definitly fair for this element. Replay ... well DUH! I'm not going to buy a Football game and play it once. I think all sports game need to have a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, of course, Madden 2002 gets a 10/10 As you can see, if you're going to get a Football game, get Madden. Let's review: Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Sound: 8/10 Speed: 7/10 Controls: 10/10 Replay value: 10/10 Total: 55/60 giving Madden 2002 a 91.67 Cheats There are no real cheats. Some Easter Eggs, like special Holiday Commentary, and a few cheats, like maximum player stat points, add to the game. I'll give it a +2 Madden 2002's new score is a 93.67	1
I had never played a great football game until early January 2002. I thought I did, but I didn't. Nope, Madden 2002 beats all of them by quite a bit. Graphics: 10/10 Okay, so I admit it, these graphics are the best. They beat plenty of other Gamecube games. Controls: 10/10 Here, I can find problems with Madden 2002 for many systems. XBOX: White button? Why not the left trigger. PS2: The controller is pretty bad at this. PS: Same as PS2 N64: Not too many here but, it's not as good as the Cubes. GAMECUBE: NO PROBLEMS! Speed: 8/10 The only Gamecube game I have played with loading times. (They are short.) Oh well. Sound: 9/10 The music is awesome, but those announcers (esspecially the lady) can get annoying. Gameplay 10/10 This is what it comes down to. Is it fun? Yes. It has tons of amazing modes plus great football you won't find in Blitz or QB Club. Get it... NOW!	1
I got my Gamecube for Christmas, and I went out two days later to get Madden 2002. After I brought it home and put it in, I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are incredibly realistic, but the sounds are awesome... You can really hit people hard in this game, and when you do, boy, do you hear it! To add to the fray, John Madden and Pat Summerall do a great commentary after each play, and they talk about individual players as well. But after you're done hearing that "the owner of the red sports car has left your lights on," you want great gameplay, and Madden delivers. You can just play single games, or you can do an entire season. But if you want more, you can even run a franchise through 30 seasons drafting players and building superstars over the years. Another dimension of the game is the Madden Cards. By practicing in the two-minute drills or doing things like throwing a 30-yard pass in the games, you earn tokens that can be used to buy Madden Cards. These cards boost your players' abilities during games and can be traded with other people. I do have to give you three words of warning, however. The first is that you need to make sure you memorize all the controls so your players actually do what they're supposed to. Second, you have to save everything yourself, it doesn't do that for you... And finally, to save a season, you need an *entire* memory card.... This is a great Gamecube game, though, and a must-have for anyone who likes playing football on their TV!	1
I bought this game on a whim and have been quite delighted with it. It's very simplistic, you're not getting a lot of strategy play or shoot 'em up stuff (like in CIV III, Warcraft or Empire Earth), but at the same time it's highly addictive. Perhaps its simplicity is the key. That, and the delightful narrator who sounds suspiciously like Sean Connery. The premise is that you get an area map of the kingdom with all kinds of quests or challenges that you must complete -- from wiping out the monsters, to reclaiming your crown, seeking the holy chalice, to rescuing your son who's been kidnapped by evil elves. The beginner levels will get you into the game and understand how it works; it's fairly intuitive and a fast learn. The advanced levels offer some challenge; some more difficult than others, and will test your ability to logically figure out solutions. I've yet to get to the expert levels. While there is fighting in this game, once you build your "army" (consisting of necromancers, wizards, warriors, rogues and explorers), they automatically fight any enemy that enters your domain. They will also go off and fight enemies at greater distances. You can set reward flags up to have your army target and destroy one enemy camp over another. Another great aspect of this game is that you get to build up your little kingdom. You place your wizards' guild, your rogues' guild, your warriors' guild and then magically houses begin to sprout up and pad out your town. You also upgrade your levels with gold, research new attack methods with a library or through the guilds, and create marketplaces and blacksmith's shops. Upgrading will get you new types of buildings (like temples) and you can watch your castle grow along with your kingdom. You get, in this package, not only the original game, but the second release add on of the game for further adventures and quests. It's a fun, addictive game. The quests can be short or long, not requiring a high demand on time that some games do, and is fairly straight-forward to play. I could see both children and adults enjoying this game (there's no vulgarity, but there are some jokes and humor with dialogue). Enjoy the game. I have.	1
I was really happy to be able to download this older game, and wish there were more such games I could download. The CD/DVD ROM in my computer will not recognize anything which requires the CD be in the ROM drive in order to use it, so such programs work well for me. I also prefer most of the older programs to the newer ones, since these do not require 3rd party vendors, internet connections, etc., in order to be able to load and use. I will not use any game which requires a mandatory 3rd party vendor or internet connection in order to utilize it. The older games do not always have the super graphics and some other things found on the newer ones. However, I tend to like the older games far better for their simplicity in use and the fact they are not saddled with some of the things I have mentioned above.	1
Amature graphics...nowhere near as good as Age of Empires...	-1
awesome game	1
This Game works on widows7 and its a fun fantasy game where you build your kingdom and defend it from enemy's	1
I really enjoyed this game when it first came out, so I got it for nostalgia sake.  The gameplay is fairly unique and I find it challenging.  All told it is fun and a great value.	1
I remember playing this game as a teenager, and it was fantastic! I recently have been trying to find old games that I loved playing on the computer, and this one was one that came to mind. I have Windows 8 and was afraid this was not going to work, but it does! Without a problem!  The price I got it for was wonderful, and the gameplay is just the same as it was before. The Gold Edition has additional objectives to play, and they are all just as good as the original ones. I would recommend this to anyone who likes role playing games, and the great games they had in the late 90s early 00s.	1
This is like Civilization game but cuter. Graphics are detailed and the game mechanics work well. Good game from the past and fun to play on a rainy day. PC requirements are low. The game is "PG" with no cussing, sex, or drinking. Animated violence only.	1
I purchased the game, it loaded but does not play.  Re-loaded, to no avail.  I recommend looking for another game for entertainment.  A six pack of beer will give you more entertainment for your buck.	-1
Great game, it's fun, and very addicting, I can't walk away from it. I remeber playing this game as a kid and its still fun.	1
This game takes everything good about Civilization and Packages it with everything good about a Fantasy RPG!  I've played this game for hundreds of hours and the heros you 'control' have so much personality and randomness and depth that you almost never get tired.  This must be what God Jesus felt like during the middle-ages.	1
My husband got addicted to Majesty on Android after Amazon had it as a app of the day download. He didn't realize that there was an entire PC game! We bought this right away. It downloaded quickly, and installed perfectly on our Windows 7 Machine.	1
This is a very fun game to play, it is also aggravating, complex and hard as heck in a couple of places if you don't cheat (Glares at cheaters) but it is a blast to play and really fun of course if the rogues let a troll kill off my tax collector one more time because i haven't placed a bounty on it yet i will level their guildhall...	1
First off, this game ran just fine on Windows 7 64bit without having to mess around with compatibility mode or anything like that. I just installed, clicked the exe, and had some fun.  The funny thing about this game is the fact that even after 10 or so years, there has yet to be an RTS that is so refreshing in gameplay. I'm not saying this is the best RTS, I'm just saying it is a refreshing change from what we gamers have gotten use to. Just in case you didn't know, in Majesty you have no direct control over your units. You can build buildings, do research to upgrade items or abilities, and even cast mighty spells throughout the map, but the one thing you can't do is control those who follow you. You can entice your units with gold, but in the end they do what they want to do.  This type of gameplay gives the game a special charm. Each hero, or heroine, is born into the world with their own randomly generated name, which allows you to distinguish the brave ones from the cowards, and the foolish ones from the wise. They also seem to have a personality of there own (I could just be imagining it though). For example, I'll have a level 9 knight who always goes head on into danger, while I'll have a level 12 knight who always plays it smart, and flees if he thinks he is in over his head. This type of gameplay allows you to get attached to certain heroes. You'll get so attached that you'll find yourself spending money to cast your healing spell on that level 21 paladin who you've watched get out of tougher scrapes (than going toe toe with two vampires and werewolf), but who just ran out of healing potions and is about to bite the dust.  Yes the game shows it age (especially on my 23in monitor), but it is still a very special RTS with its own charm. I would caution gamers to not buy this oldie if your expecting a traditional StarCraft or Red Alert gameplay, but if you want something new to the old hashed out RTS theme then this game is well worth your while.  On a personal note, the charm of this gameplay makes me wonder if Majesty is wrongly labeled a RTS. Actually its more like a Dungeon and Dragons meets SimCity with RTS throw in there. I don't really know what to label Majesty, but I know it'll be on my hard drive for years to come.  My Rig: AMD Phenom II X4 955 4GB of DDR3 ram Geforce GTS250  UPDATE 01/10/11 I downloaded this game and played it on my wife's laptop. She has a Toshiba Satellite running Vista with a 1.8 Ghz Intel core duo, 2Gb of ram, and a integrated GMA 950 video card. The game installed and ran fine, but it would only play in a 800 x 600 resolution box (with a black frame around the box). On my bigger computer, the game played at the same resolution, but stretched to fit my 23 in monitor.  Also, I don't know why others are having so much trouble. In my experience this game has worked on both a Vista and Windows 7 machine.	1
This review was written by my son, James Shea  The basic concept behind Majesty is that the player is a king or queen in a medieval fantasy country called Ardania. This kingdom is inhabited by all the adventurers and monsters one would expect from such a setting. As monarch, the player cannot directly intervene in most cases; compare this to, say, Warcraft, where everyone is under the player's direct control. The monarch in Majesty can place building plans (which peasants will automatically redirect towards constructing), cast spells (if the appropriate facilities are constructed), hire heroes, purchase upgrades to buildings and place reward flags. This is the extent of your power; you cannot directly tell a warrior to go destroy a troll attacking your town, but you can place a bounty on its head so that heroes will want to go get it. This is the key difference from Warcraft; the game is half about strategy and half about convincing your kingdom's heroes that they should help you.  The main focus of the game is the heroes, of course; by building various types of guilds, you can recruit a certain number of heroes (usually four per guild). These guilds include warrior's guilds, ranger's guilds, wizard's guilds, and temples of various gods and goddesses. Different heroes have different temperaments and abilities. Rogues are greedy and will pilfer from enemy buildings and lairs more than they'll destroy them, but are easily influenced by reward flags. Rangers spend most of their time exploring, and act as the eyes and ears of the sovereign. Wizards can cast powerful spells, but are fragile. Gnomes aren't good fighters, but are cheap and will help the peasants build things around the settlement. Certain groups (priests and non-human races, primarily) do not like certain other groups. Elves, gnomes, and dwarves all dislike each other, so you can only have one group in your kingdom at a time. Temples have rivalries and friends - the temples of Law and Good like each other, but dislike Chaos and Evil (and vice versa). The same goes for the temples of the Sun and Moon Gods - you can only have one of either at a time.  Other buildings are usually meant to either defend your settlement (namely, the guardhouses that are staffed by city watchmen and can shoot arrows at enemies) or support your hero population. Of the second group, there are blacksmiths (that upgrade weapons), marketplaces (that sell various magic items), tournament grounds (for training), and various types of inns and relaxation areas. Heroes earn money through adventuring or by collecting the bounties you set for them; they spend this money on upgrades for themselves. The hero AI is pretty smart, and heroes most of the time will know when to purchase new things, when to use their special abilities, when to use healing potions, and when to flee from battle. Heroes also level up through combat, so it's to your benefit to try to keep your heroes alive (so that they can deal with the stronger threats plaguing your kingdom). Enemies also come in various sizes, as well, from the low-level giant rats to various types of goblins and ratmen to stronger foes like medusas and hydras. Their level belies their rarity; rats will come through sewer vents to attack your town and cannot be stopped (the sewer is a necessary part for a growing city) but medusas will only come into your kingdom once in a rare while.  The graphics in this game - done in a 2D cartoonish style without being weirdly proportioned - still look pretty good today. Unlike a lot of old games, it looks like "well-drawn 2d" instead of "blocky 3d", which works to its advantage. Heroes and monsters all have portraits (one per class or monster type, not individual portraits) that are well illustrated. The music is good, though the same music gets used a lot. The voice acting is extensive, with a different voice for every type of hero, and a quip for every situation (the things they say are helpful with running the kingdom, to serve as a quick indication of what they're doing). There is also a royal advisor who assists you during play who has a fairly humorous Sean Connery accent.  Even though this game is old, it runs fine on Vista when acquired through GamersGate. The gold edition also includes the expansion, which adds some new buildings and many new missions. This is one game that is still just as good now as it was when it came out.  Rating: 9/10.	1
I've always been attracted to sim games, but I inevitably get bored with them -- as neat as "SimCity" is, there's really no POINT. It's like a digital aquarium, really: Get the system stable and thriving and then ... watch it. "Majesty," though, solves that problem. Sure, it's a sim, a medieval fantasy version of "SimCity" by way of "Dungeons & Dragons." In addition to creating rogues guilds, dwarven settlements, blacksmithies and the like, "Majesty" is based around "epic quest" scenarios wherein you're challenged to defeat some evil facing the land, send your heroes on a quest for some fabled artifact, rescue a hostage taken by villains and so on. Just as in "SimCity," you don't control your wizards, warriors, rogues, elves, dwarves, gnomes, thieves and so on. Instead, you have to do what any good monarch does in a fantasy game: Put prices on monsters' heads and offer rewards for heroes willing to explore unknown (and almost certainly hostile) territory. "Majesty" is a hoot, and a massive timesink: You'll lose whole nights and weekends to it without realizing it, and love every minute of trying to squeeze a bit more service out of heroes who'd rather laze about the inn than go study new spells or visit an elven hut-of-ill-repute than go fight the troll heading for the kingdom's market. The epic quests included with on the original disk are fun, and an additional one is available from on the official Web site. But while there's a large jump from the beginner to advanced quests and then another more moderate jump from advanced to expert quests, they ultimately don't prove too challenging overall. Expect to finish most of the quests with a week or two of nightly play (less if you've got more time to devote to the game). The good news is that this edition includes "The Northern Expansion," and suddenly, the game jumps up a fair bit in difficulty -- although not beyond that which most players can handle, if they've played through the original missions -- and the difficulty scales up nicely from there. The expansion otherwise adds new buildings and monsters, but while these are nice, the real value of it is in having more (and more difficult) adventures. An excellent game for sim fans who, like me, want a bit more direction and focus to their gaming experience. While it's worth the price -- it really is a unique and entertaining game -- it's not one you're likely to spend playing for months and months to come. Even now, years after having purchased the original game, I still pull this game out periodically, something only Sid Meier's "Pirates" is otherwise able to do. A true classic and a great addition to the library of any RPG or RTS or Sim player.	1
Majesty entered a world where RTSes had been solidly institutionalized for over five years (the four Xes, eXplore, eXploit, eXpand and eXterminate) and put a genuinely new twist on things. In Majesty, you don't waste your time mining and directing minions to go hither and yon. You build your castle, your kingdom's amenities and, as you can afford themn, hero guilds. Each hero guild can support a certain number of heroes (usually 4), although you'll usually have to buy heroes. But fret not, because each hero will pay you back many times over by visiting your marketplaces, blacksmiths, inns, and son on. In addition, each guild generates a bit of money on its own, and some provide extra services which can generate revenue. Your tax collectors will walk from building to building collecting gold, ultimately returning it to your castle or nearby guard houses, while your heroes do whatever they do best. (Rangers explore, rogues steal, and so on.) The more you build, the more support buildings (peasant huts) will pop up, themselves generating some revenue. Other side effects of urban life (like sewer drains) will appear, too. The lands are always plagued with some menace or other, however, and its your job as king to make the world safe for--well, your taxpayers. Majesty, however, unlike most other RTSes, gives you no means to directly manipulate your subjects. If you want a monster dead, then, you must place a bounty on it. If you're trying to destroy the evil crypt generating vampires, you must place a bounty on that. If you want to explore a dark area of the map, you can place an explore flag and try to draw heroes there--for a price. All-in-all, this formula works, though it's not yet perfected. The balance between building facilities (like the marketplace) and building the guilds/generating heroes that you need to protect your kingdom is very well done. The heroes autonomy is good: Sometimes the destruction of a certain target will result in a greater evil being released, so you'll want to delay that--but your Paladins will have other ideas. On the other hand, your heroes can be so aggressive on their own that they win the game for you while you're not even aware of it. If you've built a solid infrastructure for your city, you know you've won. The difference between a beginner's game and an expert's game becomes whether you can survive the opening minutes, and occasionally how well you prepare for the trigger event (the accomplishing of one goal that results in a rush of monsters). So, if the game has a fault, it's that it's too easy. I don't mind; I enjoyed all the scenarios and liked that I could finish them. Majesty Gold includes the Northern Expansion, an add-on of modest proportions with some tweaks to the rules to make the game harder. The add-on parts, with the tougher, winter-oriented monsters, are quite cool. The tweaks to the game rules, on the other hand, show the game's relative newness. They do make the game harder, but only by way of making it somewhat more frantic in those opening minutes: Even with the tweaks, it's an easy game. But that's to be expected: The designers can't directly borrow from Starcraft (and clones) to get ideas. They have a new framework to figure out. Majesty 2 is not a shoo-in at this point, but let's hope the developers get a chance to do it. This is an interesting new direction that should be explored. Meanwhile, we have this game, with solid gameplay, great artwork from industry stalwart Cyberlore, and remarkably few bugs.	1
Once upon a time in China two warriors, Liu Bei and Cao Cao, made a pact to take down the evil Han empire. Unfortunately, C. Cao went all Dark Side on Liu and the two ended up fighting each other. Their epic struggle is the stuff of Chinese legend and is recorded in a famous tome called Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Veteran strategy gamers know that Koei and RTK are practically joined at the hip. So it's no surprise that after launching Kessen last year with an ancient Japanese scenario, Koei's returned to familiar territory for Kessen II. This historical PlayStation 2 strategy game's more show than go...but what a show! Kessen II's visuals are primarily a spectacular display of computer-generated cinematics. You witness titanic clashes between armies, awesome elemental magic attacks, stunning ninja fights, and ingenious Asian instruments of war. It's like watching the trailer for some awesome anime DVD! However, things trail off dramatically once you get into the gameplay. The workmanlike controls don't ask you to do much, but they enable you to adequately oversee 30 campaigns. You can easily select battle units and painstakingly move them into position with the overhead view contour map. The pacing here is very slow as you select and then move multiple units. It also takes several minutes for units to reach their positions, but at least you can watch some great movies as they charge forward. Battles are mostly won and lost from this vantage point. You spend a lot of time just watching, but you also have the option of affecting the outcome by quickly zooming in on a particular battle to control an individual commander. A few simple button presses enable you to bust magic attacks and you can jam buttons to fight with weapons, but moving around with the joysticks is slow and imprecise. Kessen II gets pop from nicely synched music and dramatic dialogue that you must hear to advance through the game. However, since it's translated from Japanese and is so movie-like in its presentation, it occasionally suffers from stereotypically wacky dubbing. Some dialogue doesn't match lip movement and a few voices don't fit the look and feel of the characters-you hear ancient Chinese warriors talk with the hint of irritating Valley girl accent or a little stoner dude drawl. It's humorous and entertaining but probably unintentionally so. This campaign comes off as unbalanced. It's a decent battlefield challenge that marches steadily along surrounded by major cinematic fireworks. But the difference between the sheer energy in the cinemas and the painstaking gameplay is so striking that it feels like you're fighting battles less to win them than to see the next visual treat.	1
But for a game of this technical and imaginative level, I say "who cares?!"  Sure, the gameplay is definately imperfect, but ask yourself this: how many RTS games on a console have played anywhere as nicely as this one?  Answer: none.  Starcraft 64, eat your heart out. Firstly, the game utalizes simple commands to execute larger-scale movements.  When forces are in thousands of soldiers in size, in real life you'd probably lose immediate and fast control over them all pretty quickly too....this game as such seemed to be more realistic in that fashion.  There're really only three unrealistic aspects to the gameplay: 1) you can command a force that's miles away from you instantly; 2) there is lots of sorcery; and 3) how do you get so many legions of men to fight the corrupt? Secondly, the graphics are amazing.  Full of color and activity.  Seeing 500 troops with only partial slowdown is very nice, and the fact that you can control an officer to get involved in the combat to see it up close.  When you're not in control, an automatic camera changes perspective of your troops, be they running or battling (something the original Kessen lacked graphically, putting me to sleep, personally).  The game is also full of great special effects (and I'm not even brushing upon the SFX in the FMV, or the FMV itself yet!).  When dueling, sparks fly, and energy is shot out from these heroes' combatting, and the spell effects are simply huge in scale, and destruction. Thirdly, the music is worthy of purchasing the soundtrack even if you haven't played the game.  It's fully symphonized, somewhat catchy, easy to listen to, and full of emotion.  True, the voice work here and there cries out: "I'm a good actor, but I don't know what I'm doing!"  However, they still tell the story well enough for the most part...good during the important moments at least. Finally, cinematically and emotionally, this game is incredible.  FMV drives the story like one would not believe.  Kessen II truly has about 3x as much FMV as Final Fantasy X, and for a game only about 8 hours long, that's far beyond amazing!!  I sometimes still watch the FMV at the begining because it's so amazingly full of emotion, and beautifully photographed; being a film major, the lighting, scenery, item placement and art direction is important to me greatly, and I am fully satisfied here!  When people tell me that games like this and Final Fantasy X and Xenosaga are too cinematic, frankly I get very aggrivated...instead I ask: "why can't all movies be as deep and engaging as these games?"  GAMES!!  Why is Hollywood, save a few nice epics, falling behind what was once Pong?! All in all, if you like epic stories with high production values, and also like to play the head of war, then you need to get this game!  Just expect a bunch of historical references, rather than any kind of historical lessons...whatsoever.	1
I had to write a review because of the undeserved negative reviews of this game.  I noticed that one reviewer claimed that the game does not work on Windows XP.  I am playing it on Windows XP and there are no problems.  Maybe this person does not have the minimum requirements to play video games on his or her system.  I really love this game and enjoy throwing it in whenever I feel the need for an hour or so of mindless puzzle action.  It is better than the old Tetris.  If you like old drabby graphics then by all means stick to the old Tetris.  If you like more vibrant colors and cool music background and sound effects then check out Tetris Worlds.  I highly recommend this game to everyone of all ages.	1
I don't know what the other reviewers were playing because this game is just fun.  I found that I couldn't stop playing it.  It is highly addicting.  One reviewer complained that you have to insert the disc in order top play it.  But what pc game does not require you to insert the disc?  I highly recommend this game to all puzzle freaks and those who loved the old Tetris.  The old tetris was great.  But it needed some sound and graphic upgrade and this is just what it is.	1
There just have been so many games that are just so nostalgic, they keep coming back better and better. There are times where it either keeps getting better, or just keeps losing ground. That has happened with so many different classic games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and it has happened again with the most classic addictive puzzle game of all time, Tetris. Since this game originated from Russia in the 80's, it has taken on the world by storm, and just keeps surprising so many different gamers of all ages. Yet, while so many just variations lose ground from Tetris, others just come out swinging.  Tetris Worlds is a collection of six different variations of Tetris that really are just amazing. There is the classic Tetris, as well other recognized, new variations of the game including Hot-Line Tetris, the learning game Learning Tetris, which is more like a basic instruction game that teaches people how to play Tetris, Fusion Tetris, Sticky Tetris, and Square Tetris. The graphics are just gorgeous and the gameplay is very simple to operate, with the push of a button on the keyboard. There are also the 2 classic modes from Tetris for all these games such as the story mode, and the arcade mode, where you have to beat the clock to try to clear as many lines as possible.  While you look at so many games that depend on out of the ordinary graphics, it is sometimes so easy to forget about classic games like Tetris. If you have played the game before, Tetris Worlds is a well worth buy for the computer. If you haven't played this puzzled legend before, it is definitely worth the try. Don't be boxed in, without trying this great, delightful game.  Graphics: B+  Sound: B-  Control: A-  Fun & Enjoyment: B+  Overall: B 1/2+	1
All i have to say is this game is much better then da one on PS2!!	1
THPS3 for GC is pretty much the same thing as the PS2 version except the fact that there is no online mode, but to make up for that the graphics are slightly better (but not much) and the framerate is higher. That's the way it is for a lot of ports on the GC, they'll just make the framerate higher on the game than it was on the original system it came out for. So if you don't care about online play, you'll be getting a special treat with the GC version with better graphics and framerate.	1
Best Tony Hawk out there.  If you have a Cube, Xbox or PS2, this is an essential part of your game collection.  Local split-screen multiplayer with a bro is awesome fun for hours.  At around $6 shipped, there are not very many reasons to not get this game, unless you need to pay off some old bills, which still did not stop me :P	1
As a newbie to the Tony hawk series I seriously loved the hell out of this game. Its somewhat hard to describe but the game is just fun! Pulling off that sweet 900 feels uber satisfying, and the whole game just has a very polished and nice flow to it. THe game is difficult but that was half of the fun of it. Plus some of the goals like getting chuck unstuck, grinding the lava bucket and stopping thieves were just way too much fun. Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone.	1
I haven't really touched the Tony Hawk franchise until now, because A)I'm not a fan of extreme skateboarding in real life and B)there have been so many iterations that I didn't know what version to start with. But I grabbed Tony Hawk 1 for the N64, and was instantly hooked. Tony Hawk 3 continues that fun experience.  When you get down to it, the differences between the first three versions at least are minimal. You have a large arena to skate in, and must complete certain objectives (nabbing a high score, helping people collect items, finding a secret tape, etc). The thing is the controls are so well-realized and the levels so varied that you'll always want to come back for another round, until you've spent hours trying to rack up that last high score. Each level has easy and hard objectives, and completing them in ascending order of difficulty really gives the player a sense of accomplishment.  The graphics are average with some good skater animations. This isn't a huge leap from N64 to Gamecube, but its a noticible one that the later versions continued to build from. Tony Hawk 3 also comes with another selection of songs for your pleasure, and as usual theres something for everyone. If you haven't played any of the Tony Hawk series, start from the N64/PSX games and work your way up. If you're wondering what versions to get, they're all so well-executed and cheap now that it might be worth your money to try them all.	1
you can buy this game for 10 bucks!!! somwhere else. i forgot where.	1
This game was ok but there isn't really anything new compared to the earlier ones.  Except for that there is a skateboard shop and a bunch of new stuff but the gameplay is still the same.  tony Hawk 4 is the best one though.	-1
This is a good game, but I personally have had enough grinding and flipping on a skateboard. This game features new skaters, new courses, new boards FOR your skaters, and an updated make-a-course feature. This game is definately worth buying, but the series might die down after number four. You should probably rent this one before you buy.	1
While it's the weakest THPS3, it's still great.  If you have an Xbox or a PS2, get it on one of those.  If you only have a Cube, it's still a solid title to add to your collection.	1
I've played a lot of games, and for my money, there's nothing more fun out there right now than the Tony Hawk series.  These games are truly original -- which you can tell because, since Tony Hawk 1 first came out, there've been a million imitators.  But as always, nothing beats the original. If you've played either of the previous THPS games, you know the drill.  You can pick from a number of customizable professional skaters and skate through a variety of unique environments where you'll find lots of places to do your tricks. Even if, like me, you have no interest in actual real-life skateboarding, this game is a blast.  The two-player modes are fun, but the game's signature is "Career Mode", where you're given a number of goals to complete in each environment before you can "unlock" the next world.  This is great because it keeps the game from being overwhelming.  You can learn the massive number of tricks gradually and feel a sense of accomplishment at every step of the way as you check another task off your to-do list.  (Some are very easy, but others can be tricky.) A couple of caveats: one is that, while the environments in this game are more fun and more vividly realized than in THPS2, I found the gameplay to be somewhat easier this time around.  I ran through the level goals pretty quickly -- even the secret tapes were much easier to find. The other caveat: for parents of young kids, the game can be a little bloody.  On the one hand, it enhances the realism of the game, but only to a limited extent considering that the beaten-up characters always get right up and start skating again immediately after each bloodbath.  It's a little gruesome, but if your kids can handle it without freaking out, they'll probably love the goriness. Great soundtrack, too -- but my two favorite songs, "Blitzkreig Bop" and "Fight Like a Brave" are near the end of the rotation!  How about letting us customize the song order next time?	1
Tony hawk is back in his 3rd video game! Tony Hawk's Proskater 3! I have number #1 and #2 and compared to #3, the other ones are nothing. With more playable characters and levels than ever available, be prepared to sit on your floor(couch) playing this until it's beaten! (and there is also some really cool secret characters including,: Darth Maul, Wolverine, Officer Dick, Private Carrera, Ollie the Magic Bum, Kelly Slater, Demoness & The Neversoft Eyeball Guy!; type in code, FREAKSHOW to get them all) Interactive civilians and pedestrians walk around you and go on with their life, which is rather fun to watch. Large Levels which are seemingly never ending! and much, much more! The graphics on this game are incredible, the sound is great, the soundtrack is pretty good, the wide variety of customizations in Create-a-skater mode is incredible! And all in all I rate this game a 5-Star! I hope you would feel the same way about this game :) Thankyou for Reading. *Vapor*	1
tony hawk 3 is a great game its worth all the money ur paying and im sure u will think that if u play it stop wasting time and buy it	1
Fan of skating or not, you will love Tony Hawk. Whether you've played the games in the past or are just picking it up for the first time, this is definitely one of the most addicting games to play. Skate your way thru different atmospheres while performing in your face, mind numbing tricks and completing wild tasks. Play as one of many given skaters or create your own...there are many tricks, specials, secrets, etc to be explored. This game will keep anyone, child-teen-adult, playing for hours upon hours. The music could have been a little better, but who cares...the tricks and combinations are wicked. The controls for the game can be some what a task to learn at first, but like every other game there is a practice area where they take you step by step through the basics to the advanced. Dont forget the create-a-skate park feature!	1
Unfortunately, I was one of those idiots who bought Gamecube over PS2. I bought SSB:M, Rogue Leader, THPS3, Spy Hunter, and Cel Damage. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is my target now. This game is patheticly easy. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 is harder than this trash. THPS3 has a horrible soundtrack too (THPS2's is the best). The game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X for Xbox is much better. The graphics of this Tony Hawk are incredible though. The levels are quite detailed too. THPS1 had its way of not telling you all the specials and moves like this one does. This game has moves where you go underground. Wait a second! How in the world do you skateboard underground?!?!?!? I have one question for Neversoft; Why do you still call it Tony Hawk's? Nobody even plays as Tony Hawk! This is a waste of money unless you only care about the graphics. If you don't have a N64 then get one and get THPS1 and you will know what I mean by the skill level difference.	-1
Not being a fan of extreme sports, I did not think I would enjoy the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series.  However, a friend of mine got me hooked on Tony Hawk 2 for the Playstation and I was surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed it.  So, once I got my GameCube, Tony Hawk 3 was the second game I bought (after Rogue Leader, obviously!!).  I can say, unequivocally, that THPS 3 far surpasses its predecessors.  Not only are levels and gameplay more appealing rewardingly challening, this game also benefits tremendously from being on the GameCube platform.  I have played this game on PS2, as well, and it is a great deal more frustrating.  The key to what makes the GameCube version of THPS 3 so much better is how it takes advantage of the asymmetrical control pad.  Unlike the Playstation systems, GameCube's control buttons are set up in a manner where you do not need to be nearly as conscious of the buttons you are pressing, thereby freeing the player to focus more on what is happening on the screen (thus being more effective).  The buttons on the GameCube control have different sizes, shapes and placements on the pad which allows the player to know which button does which simply by feel, as opposed to the Playstation buttons which are all the same except for the design on each of them (forcing the player to be conscious of what buttons he or she is pressing).  Control issues aside, though, this game is fabulous.  It's just challenging enough without being frustrating.  I was personally able to accomplish 49 out of the 54 goals and got silver medals on the three competition levels before I had to resort to the cheats.  Games like this (along with Rogue Leader), in my estimation, give GameCube the early leg up in the Next Generation system wars with X-Box and PS2.	1
This is definately the most kick...Tony Hawk game to date.  As the THPS debut on NGC, it is definately living up to THPS tradition.  It brings in new skaters, including MTV's Jackass's Bam Margera.  The create-a-skater feature is even better than in THPS2.  The game improves on everything you saw in the previous games, and brings more.  Don't pass on this one.	1
This is of course one of the best games available on any console, and a substantial improvement over TH2, but I have to say that the gamecube version is not perfect.  The Nintendo controller is part of the problem; the D-pad is really too small, as are the X & Y buttons.  But for me the biggest flaw is that the framerate is very erratic in places, especially in the LA level.  As the game tends to require precise timing, the occasional stuttering is annoying.  Not annoying enough to make anyone regret the purchase, but enough to recommend the PS2 or XBox version if you own multiple consoles.	1
When I played THPS 2 for the Nintendo 64, I was blown away! The graphics and all the moves stunned me. I thought I was in heaven. Oh, how I was wrong. THPS 3 is THPS 2 to the 10th power. Every element of THPS 2 has been taken and supersized. With over 50 more tricks, all new levels, it can't get much better. What makes the new Tony Hawk Skater game so awesome is it's increased gameplay features. In 1P mode, you can choose from: Single session Play any levels unlocked in career mode or any park you have created you self in the "Park Editor" mode. This allows you to get a taste of what career mode will be like without effecting your score. Career mode Play levels one at a time. After a certain number of goals are completed, a new level will unlock. In order, the levels are Foundry, (a construction place) Canada, (lots of snow, lots of rails) Rio, (A skating contest. If you get enough points and come in 3rd place a new level will be unlocked) Suburbia, (a quiet town) Airport, (Not the outside, just the inside) skaters island, (another skating contest) Los Angeles, then Tokyo. (The final skating contest.) And, once you complete 35 goals you unlock a special level where you are a cruise-ship (SWEEEEET!) Free skate Unlimited time. Just skate in any park created or level unlocked. Tutorial Learn some basics of the game. It's hosted by Tony Hawk himself. In multiplayer (Only 2P maximum, which is still a downside) you can choose from games or just free skate. The games are: Graffiti By doing a trick off a certain object (Halfpipe, bench, trailer, ANYTHING!) it will turn to your color. If your opponent does a trick off the same object, but receives a higher score, it will turn to his/her color. The person with the most "tagged" objects after 1-10 minutes (depending on what you selected) wins. Trick attack Free for all. Choose any place. Rack up as much points as possible. Person with the most points at the end of the game wins. Horse You can select any word you want. (Horse, Skate, Loser, Superman, television...) A player goes first. He/she will do a trick, and, if landed, will receive a certain amount of points. If the next player can match or get more points than the other one, the other person has to match or get higher, etc, etc, until someone pulls off a score and the opponent fails to beat the score, or bails. After the person fails the same number of times are there are letters in the word, that person loses. Slap Anyplace, anywhere. When 2 skaters collide, the person with the faster skater knocks the slower one down and gets a point. The person with the most points at the end of the game, wins. King of the hill There's a crown out there somewhere, and the 1st person to find it becomes king. While you're the king, your time will start counting down. (From whatever time you selected) To make things fair, you skate slower while wearing the crown. If your opponent is faster than you and collides into you, he/she is now the king, and your clock has stopped and there's has started up. Basically, it's amazing. However, the still only limited 2-person multiplayer bugs me. I'll give it a 9/10, which is still very, very, good. Graphics? You want Graphics? I'll show you graphics.  THPS 3 is amazing with every detail in the visual. The levels look amazingly 3D, along with every player. Every move has made it to look real and stunning. I couldn't make it better. With not a single 2D image, there is no way I can't give it less than a 10/10. This is skating we're talking about. You'd think all you hear is a WHACK when the skateboard lands. As the grinch would say: Wrongo! There are about 7 different sounds the game will make when a player lands the board. When a player bails, the sound of the board flying away and hitting something is heard. When a cool trick is performed, another SFX occurs. It's great. With GRRRRRREAT music to go along with it, sound gets 10/10 Speed is an important element in THPS 3. I'm not talking about how fast you can travel; I'm talking about loading the game. I can't say I love it when it takes about 10-15 seconds to start a level, or to go to the park editor, or to save, or to go to the skateshop. Other GCube games don't take as long, so I'm going to stick with an 8/10 on speed. Sorry Tony! If you ever played Tony Hawk 2 for the N64, you know how annoying the controls where. With the design of the controller, you where stuck with sloppy movement. This is a BIG improvement. The revolutionized GCube controller makes THPS 3 a breeze. Every move can be executed with ease, and grinding is the Y button, which is very close to your fingers. I must say I'm much better at 3 than 2. 10/10 is awarded to the controlling. Replay ... Obviously! I'm not going to buy a skateboard game and play it once! I think all sports game need to have a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, of course, Tony Hawk gets a 10/10. As you can see, if you're going to get a skateboarding game, get Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Cheats? Well, lemme tell you, it's pretty great. Just enter in 2 codes to unlock all the cheats and secret characters. With cheats on, during any gameplay you can press START, then turn any code you want on or off. With this great cheat element, I'll give it's score a +5 Let's review: Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Speed: 8/10 Controls: 10/10 Replay value: 10/10 Total: 57/60 giving Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 a 95. Bonus: With the +5 in cheats, Tony Hawk Pro skaters gets a perfect 100! (Wow, my 1st 100 given to a game. Now I'm even more convinced this a great game)	1
There's just no getting around it these days. Any of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games and especially this last installment deserve your money and attention NOW! For those of you new to the concept crawl out from the rock you've been hiding under for the past 3+ years! For those familiar with the platform here's what's new: new tricks, special tricks, more skaters, better more skatable environments, a park editor that lets you create your own park, harder more challenging goals. There are also some cool hidden characters like DARTH MAUL, WOLVERINE, OFFICER DICK, etc. This is definitely a game that will keep you occupied for a long period of time (unless you use the cheats) and always fun to play no matter how many times you've solved it. All of these things= best game on Gamecube system so far! Buy it now!	1
Pro Skater 3 is on a higher platform, but its still the same great skateboarding game that it has always been. You can play as one of 13 pro skaters in skate parks located around the world, such as Japan, Canada and a cruise ship. Not much has improved, except for the graphics, and the fact that people can now be found in the skate parks! There are however new challenges, other than scoring points and jumping gaps. Now you can impress people to earn cash! Rather than buying stats like in Pro Skater 2, you now must earn them! There are also more advanced create a skater and park editors with different ramps, hazards and schemes like a beach! After all of that has been said, because I have played and beaten the past two games, this game offered only a week's worth of challenge. There is now smearing blood in the game.	1
This is a fun game! I am not sure there is much higher praise that you could give a game nowadays. That's what really matters when we are playing, is if we are having fun and enjoying ourselves. Sure the graphics matter too, and they are quite impressive in this game. When I first started I was pleasantly impressed by the sharpness and how good it really looked. But my last experience with a Tony Hawk game was briefly playing THPS2 on the PS1. I did get to see THPS2 on the Dreamcast and I was impressed with the graphics on that game, but I personally had not played a THPS for a good length of time since the first one on the PS1. And just like the first one, this one is fun yet challenging. Tony Hawk games never seem to be easy, but they don't seem to be overly difficult either to where you just get frustrated and quit. There is a nice blend with fun and difficulty. One thing that I really like about THPS3 is the varying missions that each level presents. They are creative, and some are humorous. This seemed to start in THPS2, but again I really didn't play that game much. For Tony Hawk fans I need offer no recommendation for this game, you already know how fun these game can be. But for those that own and GameCube and are unsure about this game, this is one that I feel is worth giving a chance. I do not feel that I have wasted my money, and I am more of an RPG, Resident Evil, Legacy of Kain kind of games fan. So this game really isn't in what you might consider "my type of games". It is however fun, and again, that's what matters.	1
I love this game, i got it the day after christmas and i haven't been able to sleep cause of it. Buy this game if u have gamecube. it is awsome. each time you beat the game, you get something new. I Completed the game on 1/21/02 and i got it on 12/26/01.  i reccomend this game or super smach bros: melee This game is awsome. every character is great in their own way.	1
For those of you unfamiliar with the long running Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, you control one of many proffesional skateboarders (or one of your own creation) around various locales trying to complete goals. These goals include scores, collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, finding a hidden tape, or finishing some randomized goals for each level. You can grind, grab or flip just about anything you see, and the controls for these tricks are mapped perfectly onto the GameCube controller, the only problem being the slightly too small B (flip) button. The newly added revert trick allows you to continue combinations out of vert tricks, letting you score a great deal higher than in the older games in the series. The only noticeable problem in the game is that the vert ramps are few and far between, so you are going to have to learn a whole new set of grinding skills if you want to have a chance of getting the high score on the levels. Very highly recommended for players of all ages, although parents may want to watch out for the lyrics of the songs and the blood that appears after a nasty spill.	1
THPS3 is one heck of a game. The controls are easy to learn,there's a cool soundtrack, and the pedestrians scattered throughout each level make a better, more innovative game. This game is recommended to any GameCube owner.	1
Here's are some tantalizing tidbits from the THPS3 review at Nintendorks. Enjoy! "My first experience with a Tony Hawk title came at a friend's house after the release of the original on Playstation. Within an hour I knew exactly how addictive this game was, even though I knew almost nothing about skateboarding in general. And that right there is an important feature of the Tony Hawk series: it's so good, that you don't even have to own a skateboard, know how to use a skateboard, or even to have a desire to do these things to be hooked on this game. Any sports game that can pull you in and not let go even if you have merely a passing interest in the sport itself goes beyond the genre which seems mainly for enthusiasts and diehards and becomes quite simply, but all the more impressive, 'just a game.' Yes, it may seem like a derogatory thing to say, but Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 is one of those games that defies its supposed genre and target audience and becomes something universal. This game is quite possibly one of the most replayable titles for launch, and probably will remain up there into next year. Even without online play, the multiplayer is outstanding, featuring a large and diverse number of modes to compete in. Graffiti is an addictive matchup that will allow for less experienced players to still have a shot at taking on even the most experienced player since often times victory goes to one with the opposite mantra of both Nintendo and the Iron Chef: 'quantity, not quality.' Yes, pulling off huge combos is always a good way to win, but I don't know how many times I've personally lost to people at this mode simply because they performed smaller point tricks on more places further out in the course. Horse is back and still exciting, as is the simple joy of Trick Attack. Oh yes, and let's not forget Slap! Yes, Slap! is one of the craziest modes, because you are attempting to build up your special meter and then run head-on into your opponent to score points. This mode is almost as addictive as the Battle mode in Mario Kart. Is this game worth adding to your GameCube collection? Yes. By all means. There are not words of proper caliber to express how addictive this game is. And if, by some bizarre act of psychosis, you get tired of the courses available, you have the option of making your own with the well constructed create-a-park feature. It takes awhile to create a worthy course, but once you do, you'll find yourself endlessly entertained by the fact that you're tricking off ramps you placed. In fact, that's a main theme in this game: self-satisfaction. Level goals and beating your friends can only go so far for entertainment value, but this game goes that extra mile and allows you to play simply for the sheer value of saying 'look what I can do,' and bringing a childlike enthusiasm to even the oldest gamer. If you're willing to put in the time, no matter who you are, you will grow to love this game."	1
THere are a lot of things y ps2's version is better. Thhe framework for Gamecube is really slow and I did not like this edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. But do me a favor. Write something in that box I will put below.   Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 has excellent_________-   thanks alan Y.	-1
I liked all Tony Hawk games. This is the best one (of course) The only problem is that it gets boring after playing it.  I would suggest this for Playstaion instead of gamecube. Other then that there are alot of charactors, and it's a cool game.	1
Other reviews have gone into what a great game THPS3 is, I think it is too, so I'll let them tell you how great it is, I'm going to compare the two major versions available (PC & PSX versions excluded) I bought THPS3 for GameCube as a test: The next time a game comes out for both PS2 and GameCube, which one do I buy?  The answer: It depends. The most noticable difference between the PS2 and the GameCue version of this game is that there is no online play for the GameCube version, but it isn't like that matters since neither system has released their online adaptors yet.  So until Sony and Nintendo have their network adaptors (who cares about dial-up) on store shelves (or in my case, in Amazon warehouses) it is a moot point. GameCube advantages: Faster Framerate (for smoother motions) slightly better graphics (nothing to really scream about though), and it also wins out in the same battle N64 won over PSX... better 3-D environment.  In other words you don't end up seeing through sections of walls, or having it appear that the camera is now located inside of your character revealing the empty reverse of his hollow body.  Sure, this does not occur nearly as much as it did in PSX games, but it still happens. PS2 advantages: well, there is only one that I have found.  Lip balances!  On occasion with the GameCube version, when you try to grind on a surface you may instead end up doing some anti-gravitational lip balance.  Now this wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't for the fact that when it happens, the camera angle tends to shake (jitter) uncontrolably.  This may just be a bug in the game, hopefully it is not a GameCube thing that is going to occur in other games. Me, I'm keeping my GameCube version and selling the PS2 version to a friend, but that does not mean that I am going to buy a GameCube version over a PS2 version.  If a PS2 version comes out with better options, I'm getting the PS2 version.	1
Another excellent Tony Hawk game from Neversoft. They've made considerable improvements, especially the revert landing trick which enables you to link up all your tricks, this can lead to some crazy long sequences and a ton of points. There are also interactive people in the levels, you can hit them, they hit you, talk trash, etc. Each level is designed well, they're really big and interactive. The graphics have also been improved and polished nicely. The soundtrack isn't bad, but the songs get repetitive after playing for hours on end (which is inevitable with Tony Hawk games). All-in-all this game really delivers with enough significant improvements to keep the Tony Hawk franchise on top. By the way - there really isn't much difference between the GameCube and PS2 version. The GameCube does offer slightly improved graphics, but nothing major. It's worth your money to buy this game for either console.	1
I was not sure which system i was going to buy gamecube or Xbox. I was not sure because xbox had halo and gamecube had tony hawk 3. Well guess what Halo is nothing to Tony hawk 3. The game is the same thing as the past tony hawks except with new moves and new levels and a new character. The new character is Bam Margera from the show Jackass and some of the new levels are the factory and others. It was good that activision added the new revert move because it was stupid that you could not keep stringing together combos after a halfpipe, but now you can.   P.S. Bob burnquist is not in the game anymore, rumors say ever since he won the x games he decided to make his own game. His game is supposed to be better then Tony Hawk but i don't see that happening.	1
Tony Hawk's PS 3 for Gamecube has better graphics and frame rate thanthe PS2. You actually skate around in real environments, there are pedestrians, cars, and streetlightsthat respond to you. People will try to knock you off your board while you're riding around, and when you cross the street, the streetlights will turn red. This game has it all, even if you're nota big skateboarding fan. Everyone of all ages can play this game and enjoy it. Tony Hawk's PS 3 has a high replay value because you neverdo the same things over and over. If I had to pick a first game for the Gamecube, it would be Tony Hawk's PS 3. I highly recommend this game! God Bless America.	1
I, for one, like the mission-oriented approach of this snowboarding game.  The storyline is good if not remarkable, and it makes the gameplay very enjoyable.  You are not just going for pure speed for 30 minutes of gameplay, but have tons of features to explore. Game graphics is decent but unfortunately does not show off Xbox's capabilities.  (C'mon, Microsoft, help Xbox developers do a better job!)	1
This game is fun for everyone, gives you more vehicles than the first edition, and more than one terrain to play in.  Great game for a through back.	1
The police vehicles are not nearly as obnoxious as in the first game. Much better vehicles all around this time. Hours of fun to be had here. My six year old and eight year old love it, too.	1
For all of you gamers out there who loved Smuggler's Run as much as I did, you are in for a treat. Rockstar did it again with an all new adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as cursing the levels that require playing numerous tims to pass, only to fel like a god when you do accomplish that task. Smuggler's Run 2 Hostile Territory is just that. Hostile Territory sums this game up to a T. The police, border control, and armed services are even more hardcore than on the original Smuggler's Run so for those of you who had gotten frustrated by the first Smuggler's Run because of the security than maybe this game isn't for you. However...For the rest of you, I highly recommend getting SR2, You WON'T regret it. I PROMISE!!!!!	1
I was really disapointed with this game. The graphics are nice. Not great by any means. The objectives are too basic & simple. I thought you had to pick up certain drugs & deliver then to a certain spot. Taking long journeys avoiding rivals & cops. This was not the case. Basically, you run back & forth. The fun level is minimal. Common rockstar. You can do much better then this..	-1
One of the most well balanced games I've seen. If you have a GameCube, get Smuggler's Run on it, because it's just an improved verson of this game. The only thing I don't like about this game is how they still took out the animals and pedestrians when you play the game multi player. What else are 2 people gonna do on "Free Run" mode. Come on Rockstar.	1
This game has better graphics and handling than the original, but the sequel to the original has raised the annoyance level bar several levels.  First, the cops are way too good for this game, even better than the first.  This makes the game way too difficult. Next, the unlocking of all the cars and their countermeasures should have been done early in the game, because the cops have way better cars than the player has.  Furthermore, what is with the additional cop cars that get resurrected?  Lastly, you should have the ability to request a team accompany you, rather than alone.  True, some of the missions you do receive a team, but not often.  I mean, they should permit the player to choose if he or she wants a team or not to accompany them on the mission.  The developers could reduce the point levels and such, if you request a team, but at least have the option out there. Overall, rent this game before you buy.  This is not a keeper.	-1
This was the sixth title I've gotten for my PS2 and I'm happy to say, it's awesome.  The gameplay is fun and frantic and the graphics are pretty impressive.  My favorite part of the game, aside from it's challenging missions, are the go-anywhere levels and the sense of speed you can get from a 4-wheeler.  It's just an all-out blast, whether you're plowing through the swamps, or tearing across the desert. My only complaint about the game isn't a real biggy, but I really feel that we could have done without the EXTREMELY tacky FMV.  It makes me feel like I'm watching one of those movies that the USA network only airs early in the AM.  They're pretty bad, and the acting is worse.  It's also kinda distracting, but not enough to take away from the fun of the game.  Luckily, we have the option of skipping through this mess.  FMV was cool when the first playstation came out.  Not anymore. Anyway, the Hostile Territory is a load of fun and the reply value will make you glad that you bought it.  If you're looking for a game with some variety that will keep you busy well into the year, look no further.  enjoy. You may also wanna check out Grand Theft Auto 3, if you already haven't.	1
NOLF is probably one of the top 3 or 4 1st person games out there, superb graphics, great variety of weapons and gadgets and a very authentic 60's soundtrack make this spy game a must have. I am still playing it and loving every minute of it. The AI also sparkles on this game. I really hope they make a second one in the series.	1
No One Lives Forever - This game blew me away. It not only had fun gameplay, sound effects, music, and graphics; it had the stylish "Austin Powers" meets "James Bond" story that was well deserving of an applause. The story is serious and well scripted, the artificial intelligence of the game is well beyond belief. If your character accidently makes a noise in a certain corner or runs with loud pounding of her footsteps, the enemy will begin to wonder where the noise came from and start searching for the heroine. The game is quite comical in some of the character designs and in almost all of the conversations by guards or civilian bystanders. The weapons and gadgets are too much in quality and quantity to even begin to list. I do however, remember the perfume sleep-gas bottle that Agent Archer will spray at guards to knock them into deep sleep temporarily. Some scenes in this game really caught my attention. Certain scenes were beautifully though up - such as jumping out of a plane without a parachute while shooting out parachuting guards in absolute freefall and timing the seconds just enough to catch the last guard and steal his parachute. Other action sequences throughout the game that seperated this game from other games included - riding a motorcycle "Mission Impossible 2" style while dodging bullets and running over henchmen and a "James Bond" type deep sea scuba dive for a ship's manifest and captain's log all while your heroine battles scuba-diving enemies and outswims Great White Sharks. This game is a must buy! Gameplay = 9/10 Graphics = 9/10 Sound = 10/10 Value = 10/10	1
No One Lives Forever is the best action game i have played since Half-Life, It deserves more than 5 stars. I have been a big fan of monolith production since thier super hit game Blood. Nolf is one of the most well desinged game ever, Set in the 60's you play Cate Archer a femal secret agent in an agency called Unity and your goal is to take over an evil organisation called Harm. Nolf is a very well desinged story driven game, It is very well written, voice acted and there a loads of scriped sences through out the game. Load times are quite long but the levels are very big. The graphics are not that eye candy, The humans look and move very real but close-ups of their faces look very ugly and the 60's setting make them more uglier. The graphics may not be eye candy but the art direction makes the game look very real, The world looks real and the atmosphere is superb. The sound effects are very good and the music is fantastic, expecially in the action sences. There are a lot of scripted sences too and sometimes you get to say what cate archer says. Nolf is a very long game, It is twice the size of a normal fps game. The level design is simply fantastic, The game takes place in almost every possible place, On a train, plane, underwater, space station, snow, rocky mountains and even in mid Air. The selection of weapons and inventory items are fanstastic, The weapon effects and sound are superb. The enemy AI is superb, The charecters act very real, It surely has the best enemy AI in a fps game. With great weapons, level design and enemy AI the action is superb, The gun fights are great. Besides the Action there are loads of sneaking to do also, In some missions you need to sneak in undetected, solve the mission without killing anyone and in the most missions you are not allowed to kill innocent bystanders. Nolf is a very funny game, there are lots of funny lines, The interview with the baron with cate undercover as a reporter is very hillarious. The only bad things is it is quite hard as Archer cannot take much damage, she depends on body aurmor to protect herself and once that is gone it is pretty much over, she cannot take much falling damage also. Nolf is one of the best fps game i have ever played, It is the must buy if you like first person shooters.	1
What are you doing?  Stop reading and order both of the No One Lives Forever games before they're no longer in print.  I'm serious.  These games have a great story, great humor and awesome action.  You play a 60's era spy on the trail of evil masterminds.  No One Lives Forever has it all... great music, graphics (for its time), cool weapons, stealth if you want and long hours of gaming goodness.  You'll find yourself laughing at the story and dialogue and you'll catch the evildoers in some funny conversations.  This is one of the best FPS series ever made.  To let it pass you buy is a crying shame.  Buy both games today.  They're cheap and they're well worth the bargain bin price.  The Game of the Year edition contains an extra level.  Just when you thought the trouble was over, you go on vacation and find your vacation spot is a front for an evil organization!	1
This remains my favorite game ever, even if other games had better graphics even when it came out.  Not only do you play an interesting character and you have a great story, the enemy aren't complete idiots. Best of all, the game makes you laugh. I can't count the times, I stopped to listen to a side conversation and was laughing to hard to avoid getting shot.  Valve updated the graphics for Half-Life; I wish Sierra would do the same for No One Lives Forever.	1
I decided to buy this game after hearing some good reviews for it, and seeing as how I could get it for 15 bucks as a game of the year edition.  I played this game nonstop for about 5 days till I finally beat it.  This game would only have been a 3 - 4 without its humor though... humor, not a challenge for killing the oafs of HARM makes this game great.  Thats not to say that using a silenced parabellum and sneaking into an area giving large unsuspecting quantities of HARM agents head shots isn't a blast.  I believe that this game wouldnt be near as fun if you just played it like Quake or Doom, getting your baddest weapon out and mowing down hoards of them.  I think that my goals of maybe getting detected once made the game much more enjoyable. Buy this game while it lasts, the Game of the Year Edition truly is worth it, the extra level was a blast and among the most humorous of levels.	1
Don't let the girl on the cover sway you, this is well worth its money. Besides being an absolute fun shooter, it's also full of hilarious conversations and phrases. The missions will keep you going for some time, and when you finally beat it (WITHOUT CHEATS!), you can go online and show what you've got. Join a clan and get your rank up! One word of advice, when you go online and think you know it all, think again. These guys online know exactly how to beat your sorry butt in about 3 seconds. You will learn the tricks and secrets soon enough young grasshopper. :-)	1
I ordered this game after completing NOLF2, so I'm kinda going backwards here. I enjoyed the sequal so much, I just had to get the first one as well. I was impressed by the low price, but I had no idea what I would get for it. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box: not only was there a Prima Official Strategy Guide inside, but a NOLF soundtrack CD as well! How is that for a deal?! Of course, then I installed the game, and the game is great as well. I just love Cate Archer; I'm so sick of James Bond that a female spy is more than welcome. The levels are very interesting (a lot of it in the beginning is training), so far my favorite (which is actually quite difficult) is the level where Cate jumps out of a plane without a parachute and must eliminate the shooting enemies falling with her, all the while trying to reach the man below her who DOES have a parachute, then take it. I'd say this level is equivelent with the Ohio level in the sequel. The graphics are great, and the game is very colorful - after all, it does take place in the groovy 60s. If you haven't played this game yet, and are a FPS fan, you've got to get this game. Even when you aren't spying or killing, you are still entertained by the conversations of the surrounding people. So if you want a great deal on a great game, get this one now. You will not be disappointed.	1
This game is the best fps i've played, better than jedi knight: jedi outcast, half-life, and any other. Although I have put less time into this game then those games but this game is the most gripping game of them all. The mission design is some of the best of i've seen, from jumping out of airplane (the best action sequence in any game EVER you acually get to play it) to escaping from a exploding space station.  This game is pretty long, but it only took me 4 days to finish it (man I played 8 hours a day) on normal difficulty level. It is a shame that this game didn't sell well. Anybody who loves the fps genre should buy it now, and then buy the sequel.	1
Tested on 1GHz P3 with 256Mb RAM and ATI Rage 128 running Windows 2000 Pro, DirectX 8.1, latest video drivers from ATI. I got the demo from PC Gamer magazine and had a lot of fun with it. I noticed the price of the full game was [the right amount of money] so decided to buy it. What a waste! The same installs with no errors. However, when I try to run it all I get is an hourglass for a few seconds then nothing. When I run TaskManager I can see nolf.exe in the process list but there is no corresponding window. Fox Interactive's idea of techinical support is a peer-to-peer discussion forum. There is no way to get any support from the company. Reading the discussion forum gives you an idea of the huge number of problems this game has. ...	-1
I call this kind of game a 'scripted first person shooter'. The gameplay is fun, but linear, leading you down a path with very little open-endedness. It's a bit like playing a character in a movie, where you must follow the script. Other good scripted FPS games are 'Half Life' and 'Medal of Honor'. No One Lives Forever is one of the best of this type game. It is a very long game, so you get your money's worth, and it never gets old, with a great variety of locations and a good story. The Game Of The Year edition also includes 4 new levels in a volcano at the end, source code and editing tools to create your own levels and mods, the 'In The Lounge' music CD (an EXCELLENT music CD on its own, but I think this also came in the original packaged version, so it's not really fair to say it's a bonus with the game of the year edition) and a free strategy guide. The only major problem I had with this game (and the reason I deducted a star) is the 'stealth' aspect. To me, the greatest stealth game ever made was 'Thief: The Dark Project', and NOLF comes nowhere near the excellent stealth missions found in 'Thief'. In NOLF, you must be stealthy in certain areas, but there is generally only one way to sneak past these areas, not allowing you to get creative with how you approach these areas. If you want the apex of stealth, try 'Thief' or 'Thief 2' instead. That said, however, all other aspects of NOLF are excellent. Visuals, sound quality, and weapons are all very well done. And the story is great (though the cut scenes tend to go on a bit too long). And you won't find a funnier FPS around. I laughed out loud at several points listening to the other characters talk, and there are several sight gags also. I wasn't expecting these, so it was a nice touch. The scenery looks great, with wonderful atmosphere and a good sense of place. Obviously, this game was made with a great attention to detail and love of the material by the designers. And since it's a couple years old, it runs nice on older computers. It ran perfectly on my Pentium II 450 with a 16 meg video card. It is definitely a classic, and a must-have for any serious game player or FPS fan. Get it while you can!	1
Like they say No One Lives Forever! Step into the fearless and brave shoes of Cate Archer, and fight HARM and other evil plus save the world from evil as UNITY! GRAPHICS:funSOUND:above averageMUSIC:fun! OVERALL:FUNNY, and fun! Besides the point, if you are a kind of person that likes funny first person shooters, agent type games, this is your game!	1
I'd purchased this game several months ago and it only saw about 20 minutes of playing time. I've been burned out on just about all games for quite a while now. I decided to give NLF another chance and I'm glad I did. This is the first game I've finished in about two years. None of the others recently have been able to hold my attention. NLF did in spades. The levels are desinged very well and none of them too complicated or too large. It's nice to be able to play for only 30-45 minutes and still make some head way. Granted if you have the time to do marathon sessions, NLF can definately keep you occupied. You don't have to lose contact with all your friends and family while you try to finish it though ( unless of course you want to ). The graphics are very good and I've played on a few different systems. Granted a Celeron 400 w/ a TNT can't swing 1280 x 1024 and won't play any game at the resolution at an acceptable rate but even on a 400 640 x 480 and even 800 x 600 were playable. The game looks awesome at the higher resolutions if you have the hardware to run it. I don't often comment on music in a game but in this case I will. I'd compare it to SSX for the playstaion 2. Besides sounding very very good, the music is dynamic. When you round a corner and get into a shootout with some gaurds, the music reflects this. The tempo becomes a bit faster and the horns sound more on edge. The music adds a lot to the game. Over all this is a very good game. I was reminded a lot of half-life. There wasn't anything in the game that was stolen from half-life. I was reminded of half-life due to the very solid game play. I'd call this half-life with more personality and not so hard puzzles. Had this game come out 2 years ago this would be a "break through 5 star you life will never be the same unless you own it game." Considering what's out ther today I'd call it a very solid game that has a lot of character and feels refreshing even though there isn't anything really new. Of all the games out there right now, I can't think of a better game than NLF to spend an evening playing.	1
NOLF(the orginal game) was great. By now you know why it is so great. so if you don't mind I'll skip that... The GOTY(Game of the year) edition features one new singleplayer level, and several new MP maps. The MP in the original game was good... nothing too special... but its still very fun. Single Player: 9.5 out of 10. (Graphics are a bit dated but are still great!) Multi-Player: 8 out of 10. (Nothing special or inovaded, unlike the SP. Still fun to massacre your friends of the net.) Overall: 9 out of 10. Best game I've ever played! I don't think anything will ever surpass this game in inovation/ creativity. Oh and one more thing- Whats with the Mature rating? the original box was Teen... I couldn't see any differences...	1
Love this. Seperate ratings AHOY: Gameplay: Lotsa fun! The levels are professional-looking and pretty realistic. There's plenty of things to interact with. 5/5 Engine: Perfect. I love the drivable vehicles (Though, after Tribes 2, I wish they went a little faster) and the elevators DONT bounce you up and down or splat you like in Half-Life. 4/5 Humor: WOOHOO! I LOVE the conversations. "Do you like my monkey?" "I SPIT on your monkey!" "I think the monkey's kinda cute..." "Oh shut up, you." And gotta love the HARM guys o nthe plane: "This food is terrible!" "Oh, try the potato salad." "That's not potato salad! IT'S COTTAGE CHEESE!" 5/5 Graphics: Fairly good. They could be a little better, but i don't care. Nice and colorful: i'm a little sick of the commonplace industrial textures. 4/5 Music: RIGHT ON! 5/5 Ok, this might be a little incomplete but i'm being distracted trying to fix Empire Earth which is flipping out and roffleownzing me so I'm gonna wrap this up. Great game, multiplayer could use a teeny bit more balance i think, because sometimes I can unload 3 clips into a guy's back and he's still standing, and I think they need to fix the camping problem on H.A.R.M vs UNITY levels. I mean, people crouch in the corner of the intelligence item room with the sunglasses out and photograph it whenever it spawns. Over and over again... I LOVE the gadgets. Here's a summary of what I have so far: The barette can be used to pick locks or stab enemies, the sunglasses can photograph itnelligence items, (they can be used as infra-red and mine detectors, too, but i haven't gotten that yet) a lighter, which can be used to chop doors open, light ciggarettes, and set things on fire. The lipstick bombs are funny. There's perfume sleeping gas, and...let's see, that seems to be all i have. I'm hooked. kthxbye	1
I've been playing this game for about three weeks now... I'm still having a blast with it. Sure, I managed to beat it fairly short order, but I was a little obsessed with it! I didn't sleep for three days. The cut-scenes are awesome, and where-as some of the plot is a little contrived, it is still very cool. Cate Archer is sarcastic as anything and the conversation you pick up from the enemy is so politically correct, it's funny. This game is kind of a cross between Austin Powers and James Bond. Serious, but humorous... bloody but comical. I also like the way the controls are set up and the mouse-aiming is very well designed (especially with sniper-rifles and other scoped weapons). The weapons were what make this game the most fun. Sure, you can grab a ton of gear in games like "Unreal" and have fun blowing everyone to shreds... but this game has several types of bullets, silencers, scopes, explosives, and little tools that rival "Q-branch" from the 007 series. Sneaking around with a silenced pistol and offing unsuspecting bad guys is kind of fun too! An awesome game, I haven't had this much fun in awhile!	1
Moon Tycoon looked like an awesome game when I carefully examined the box.  I bought it and it is cool!  I do admit the fully 3D interface is tricky to get used to esp. after games like Simcity and Roller Coaster Tycoon.  But with a little time I liked it.  The graphics are really good with a highly textured lunar surface and fairly well rendered buildings.  The map is quite big allowing for a large colony with plenty of room for expansion.  You first need to build a control center then "inflatable homes" for your colonists.  You also construct oxygen plants and power production plants.  Everything is connected via either above, or below ground tunnels.  As you progress thru the game more buildings become available due to "research", a common feature of games such as Starcraft and Roller Coaster Tycoon.  You make money thru mining and exporting as well as tourists.  You can trade goods with Earth or aliens (yes aliens).  The game takes place in 2021 and Earth is in crisis as it runs out of natural resources.  The game is refreshingly original and I recommend it to any sim fan!  Check it out!	1
This is my favorite game. Here is what I like about it: -Create the first colony ever on the moon, OR an asteroid -Choose the amount of money you want for your construction -build hotels, condos, or small residential houses -build shopping malls, research centers, warehouses,golf courses, amusement parks, aquariums, and MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE!!!!! -hire mining probes to collect resources and burn the resources for money -discover extra terrestrial life by finding alien artifacts, and aliens themselves!! -create a city on the moon, and a colony!! -instead of streets, you use metal tubes to walk through These are the things I don't like about it: -Screen is EXTREMELY dark, and is difficult to see what is going on - even if system requirements are met or beaten, screen is choppy, or runs in frames,or is split or chopped up -game is rated "E", but even adults have trouble with the financial stuff, and morale. -helpers bug you with facts that don't have anything to do with the game, such as,"the moon's surface is 40% oxygen trapped inside the rocks."Getting back to the thing I said about the system requirements,my best friend has a PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR,1.7 GHz,512MB RAM,A 128 MB AGP VIDEO CARD,AND WINDOWS ME, and the game runs horrible when lots of stuff is built. But, all in all it is a great game, and I would reccomend it to anyone. Have Fun!	1
I have been playing SWAT3 for ever and this version is better than any othe fps even r6.  In this game the single player is OK but hte multiplayer IS COOL hardly any loading and 1000s of mods.  Want a paintball game? download zpaintball mod to get a paintball game or perhaps a r6 remake no problemo!  (...) theres like 100s of players online and an easy to use multiplayer lounge.  This game is so cool! in single player ther is anout 20 levels and 3 weapons but in multiplayer thers 500 downloadable missions and over 900 guns.  This is cool!	1
SWAT 3 is flat out one of the best games there is for computers. It's easy to learn to play, the missions are great, the weapons are great. It's full of strategy and full of good solid action. If your looking for a game to get involved with for more than a couple days, this is for you. It's worth every dollar. Every time you beat a mission, your going to be diving into the next one. It's a non stop action game that really gets you involved. I HIGHLY reccomend this game to all your serious gamers.	1
The realism of this game is unmatched and for all I know will continue to be so.  The game put you at the head of four swat team members split up into two group red team and blue team.  It is your teams job to go into different situations and tatically take down terrorists and save hostages by using as little force as neccesary.  So if a bad buy isn't pointing his gun at your character then you should try to get him to drop it but as soon as he lifts his gun drop him.  I've had the game for probably two years maybe less but it still hasn't gotten old.  It's fun and always will be.	1
I hate this game! It's not worth the [money] that went down the toilet when I bought this, it's a horrible game, even worst than Iwo Jima, and that's pretty bad.   The graphics suck, the gameplay is horrible, if you shoot a bad guy, you're kicked out of the SWAT organiztion, oh, yeah, and one shot kills, which really blows. The AI is the worst from ANY game, and that's as low as you can go, if I tell a team member to pick a lock, it takes him five minutes to do so, the controls are horrible, worst than Max Payne, and those are pretty bad. Take my advice, don't buy this, don't even waste five bucks on renting it, if a unfortunate freind bought this, don't even borrow his. It's just not worth installing it.   Minus zero stars.   Don't buy this, Iwo Jima's even a better pick.   Hope this warning helped, only get it if you're a SWAT member, it's just too hard, too complicated with horrible graphics and gameplay.	-1
Alien vs Predator 2 creates an unbelievable environment which emulates that of two of the best Sci-Fi movies, Alien and Predator.  The attention to detail and the flickering lights in the dark settings really draw you in and give you an exceptional feeling of being there (especially in a dimly lit room).  From what I've been able to determine from some of the game sites is this game will draw you in further with its intermingled story much like Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift did only this game has all three storys in a single install.  You'll get to play the part of the Marine, Alien and Predator in a story that will certainly cross paths.  The demo only allows you to play the part of the Marine, and he's neatly equipped with a knife, handgun, machine gun (a shotgun only once you find it) and a nifty hacker device.  This game looks to be all its cracked up to be and a little more. I'll give this one two thumbs up and that's based on the demo.  Wow.	1
Wow... AvP2. And what great timing. We all know that Alien is the best sci-fi movie ever right. Well, actually, most people think it is Aliens, the sequel to Alien [I still think Alien is the best]. Anyways if you are a fan of sci-fi, espically Alien, buy this game. It will scare you to no end. Playing the demo in a dark room, with headphones [or an a sweet soundsystem] will make you scream as soon as something happens [either on screen or off]. The suspense is almost too much. But then the game does have its problems. If you have an ATI card, the game doesn't run like it will on an NVIDIA [they say it is resolved in the full version, but I still see some traces of it]. The second is the Alien animations. Ugh... not as good as the original if you ask me. But problems aside, this game rocks. Simply excellent. If you are a fan of Aliens- buy it. If you love sci-fi- buy it. If you like bursting out of people's chests [?]- buy it. No game has given me the sense of suspense like this.	1
Demo: After playing the Marine Demo, I see that Sierra has tried to follow Fox Interactive's initiative with a sequel to the game. The alien, the predator, and the marine are all there, with MORE. But when they added more they also took away. In AvP, when you were one of the species, the other species looked like they were made of similar graphics. In sierra's version, the marine was in full detail, complete with hacker's tool and shoulder lamp (which I like), but the aliens were weird little moving things and not as good as the original AvP, where the Alien looked like it was out of the movie. This game is from the creators of half-life and all those, so go figure. _______________________________________________________  Update: Full Game:  But, it is a fun game, and long game-play due viewing the different storylines of 3 different playable species.  The Predator: most fun of the 3 species to play, plenty of weapons, can jump really high (just like the movie, this was missing in Fox's version). Definitely gooood fun getting trophies, etc.  Alien: very fast gameplay, and a lot of sneaking around and weird camera angles due to climbing all over the walls.  Marine: very fun due to the weapons and tools and trying to help your buddies.  The game saves as you go along, but you can also save whenever you want. (Kinda helps if there are facehuggers around). A def. positive of this game is the facehuggers don't spook the hell out of you by disappearing then wrapping around the monitor screen like in Fox's version. In this one you'll see/hear it leap towards your face.  Definitely try this game out if you're an AvP fan. It stays true to the series/movies. Also try Primal Hunt for some more fun, it's a Mission Pack add-on that gives 3 more angles to the story. (Mercenary, Ancient Predator, Pred-Alien)	-1
The BEST alien game out there.  This one is spooky like all the Alien vs Predator.  Enjoyed it very much.	1
this is an outdated game but in the day it rocked	1
After years of loving the Aliens franchise and seeing only lackluster games featuring the iconic xenomorphs, I was quite skeptical of this game. Made in 2001, this PC exclusive was squandered my titles such as Halo Combat Evolved and forgotten by many. However, just because it's not popular doesn't mean it's not a great game.  GRAPHICS As is expected, the graphics are incredibly outdated. However, the environments are absolutely incredible. Whether you be fighting your way through a Weylad Yutani base or fighting through the eerie xenomorph hives, the environments are original and have a great amount of range. However, the game is by no means good visually. If graphics is what makes the game for you, then steer clear of Aliens VS Predator 2.  STORY Boasting three campaigns, this is much like a three games in one. I began my experience with the marine storyline, believing it to be closer to what I'm used to when it comes to military FPS. From what I've noticed so far, the story is paper-thin and all-too predictable. There is literally no character personalities, and all of the characters seem to be faceless and linear. The alien story is little more than you running around killing everything that isn't a xenomorph, and the Predator story is all about proving yourself by, surprise surprise, killing everyone that isn't a Predator. Storywise, the game is quite weak, though all three campaigns are very fun.  GAMEPLAY The gameplay is quite solid in this title. Not dissimilar to the combat of games like Halo and Quake, the gameplay is robust and doesn't feel too clunky, and functions such as the weapon and body sway can be taken out via the options menu. There are, however, several glaringly obvious problems with this game. With no directional arrows or waypoints present, the player is forced to wander about, sometimes for hours, trying to find a computer to hack into that just happens to be at the other end of the level. There was a point in the first mission where I spent almost two hours wandering the mountains of the LV 1201 trying to find a facility that was crucial to completing the mission. The next problem is the worthless motion tracker. In games such as Aliens: Colonial Marines, using your motion tracker is crucial to knowing the position of your enemy. In AVP2, the motion tracker hardly picks up enemies at all, and when it does (which is rare) their signatures on the tracker aren't relative to the enemies' actual positions. The game uses a unique style of health and armor in the combat, but as unique as it is, this all screws the player over. I can't even begin to count how many deaths were caused when I was at 2% health dealing with a room filled with xenomorphs, holding them off with a simple pistol. These are functions that led me to increased frustration throughout the game until I was so fed up that I decided to play something else.  SOUND The best part of the game is the stellar sound design. From the cracking gunfire of the iconic pulse rifle to the guttural shrieks of the xenomorphs, the sound design is what incites the best terror in the game. Several of the best jump scares in the game are derived from the player rounding a dark corner and seeing a xenomorph leap from behind a crate, screaming as it attacks the player with unrelenting ferocity.  VERICT Despite the downfalls of the game's gameplay, story and graphics, this is very good game overall. With great combat and original environments, the game can incite hundreds of hours of dedicated gameplay (although fighting Weyland Yutani soldiers in the marine campaign is quite boring and linear). Make no mistake: this is a game that I would strongly suggest people try.	1
I have every Aliens, AVP game made that has been on the computer including colonial marines. This by far is the best. NO the graphics are not great when you compared them to todays next gen graphics but they are still good. And the game play is freaking awesome.  Very close to the movies and comics. There is also a very very large community that make maps and other mods for the game. I think have 6gbs of just mods and maps and that isn't everything. People have made maps from Star Trek to Star Wars. Even with out the mods you have a lot of maps, characters, modes to choose from. If you would like to see a review of this game i have done one on youtube under the screen name MonkFuYing	1
Aliens vs Predator 2 is one of the best aliens games ive played, since there aren't many out there that isn't saying much though, very fun game though.	1
First I've gotta say I love most games made with the LithTech engines. It really says a good game engine with good build tools makes for a better game I think.  The engine here is top notch, the game uses the LithTech Talon engine which is the 6th iteration of that engine. Its stunning. You would never believe that this game is from 2001. The textures are all high rez, the models are pretty high rez, and the engine can handle large outdoor areas as well as corridors. The engine can also handle having a high number of enemies on screen at once which makes for some interesting battles.  Enough about the engine. The tech aspects are only half of why this is one of my favorite games...  Gameplay. Its scary! It'll scare the poo out of me over and over. Some of the tricks and gags get reused but even at half way through the marine campaign they still use some new stuff. It makes me jump.  The combat is really great too. Aliens use all their abilities to get at you, such as running on the ceiling, and walls, slashing at you while they die, getting you with acid, and coming at you in sheer numbers when you least expect it.  The art in this game is stunning. I love the sci-fi textures, its all very good. The sounds make me feel like I"m watching an Alien movie, all very authentic and high quality.  Lastly, watching the plot and story go through is almost as good as watching a real movie. The animation, the lip sync, the high quality character models, the great audio, and good voice acting (for a game) all comes together to make you interested in seeing the next in game cut scene.	1
AVP 2 is a timeless classic based on the movies and comics and it is essentially an action packed first person shooter with detailed levels, a good and interesting storyline and characters and plenty of enemies and weapons based on the franchise i.e. the movies and comics of the same name.  All the weapons from the movies (namely Aliens) are in the game including the pulse rifle, flamethrower, smartgun and grenade launcher for the marine, netgun, spear, disc and laser gun for the Predator and claws, tail and headbite for the Alien.  You start out when playing the Alien as a facehugger, then advance or move on to chestbuster then a regular Alien.  The levels are creepy, claustrophobic, atmospheric and well detailed. The music is moody as well and changes when enemies are nearby.  I have not tried multiplayer yet, but the single player game is great.  All in all a great game based on the movies.	1
Being a huge fan of the AVP graphic novels, as well as reading some of the comics, I can say (and I believe everyone will agree with me on this issue) is that "AvP 2" is one of the best horror/survival games ever made, i'd say it's equally matched to the awesomeness of the original "Doom" games.  However, it is a shame that how the storyline for the original game and this one (and to an extent, "AvP 2010") can respect the earlier "Alien" and "Predator" films, while the current 2 film adaptations actually angered many fans worldwide.  But back on topic, this has loads and loads of replayability, and the cutscenes themselves is like watching a short movie in between missions.  So if anyone would like a game that'll scare the pants off of anyone, i'd highly recommend getting this!!!	1
Aliens vs. Predator 2 is a very very good game, but it could use some improvements. First off the graphics could be better, I know it's made in 2001 but it could have been better. Second, I should have been longer. Each campaign was 7 levels long and it could have at least 10-12 levels long. ENTERTAINMENT 10/10 STORY 7/10 GAMPLAY 10/10 CONTROLS 10/10 GRAPHICS 6/10 SOUND 9/10 OVERALL 8.5/10 You can find me on YouTube if you want to see game-play, Subscribe! [...]	1
If you've ever wanted to play as a predator or a alien than this is the game for you. There are 3 campaigns The marine, the alien, and the predator. The graphics aren't great but there ok.  This game also has one of the best multiplayer. However people that use AIMBOTs or wall hacks can really ruin the experience which is why I usally only play with my friends	1
Ok, Excellent game, you know the story and you can live it as a a human, alien or predator.....and the stories are well connected....outstanding graphics, sound, did not notice errors in the software.  Have to admit I only jumped out of my seat once at a alien attack....but...I was distracted!  Great feature is you can customize the controls on the keyboard or mouse...I am waiting for Alien versus Predator 3.	1
Fans of the movies should love this game. Fans of games like Halo and Doom should enjoy it as well. The single player offers the opportunity to play human, predator, or alien. All great fun to try. The alien being the toughest to get the hang of controlling, but a blast none the less. Once you learn how to wait to see your teeth extend when above a victim and do a headbite you will be proud of your ability.  Once you get the hang of running these three you will want to jump on one of the many multiplayer servers that are free. You can play corporate in addition to the three I mentioned above. I often host games for a group of my friends. We have a blast fighting each other and trying our hand at each of the races. We find that each of us are better at certain types. My stepson Jason scares me regularly running the Alien. I highly recommend this game. I recently picked up a copy at a local store for under ten dollars. Get it while it lasts.	1
This game is definitely an upgrade from the original Aliens vs Predator PC game. I'm not talking just graphics, game engine, sound, etc, I'm also talking plot, atmosphere, action. The game has cutscenes, dialogues that can be overheard, all these help contour the scenario. There's even a few interesting twists in the plot along the way.  This game is definitely worth buying.	1
This game is simply amazing, i don't know how I ever got along without it! It's a first person shooter game but unlike other games of the same genre, you can be the aliens and the predators, rather then just a human (which u can also play as)! The game is amazing with just its 1 player mode, but then you get great internet play as the icing on the cake!  The first player gameplay is superior to other games of this genre because of its suspensful atmosphere, well developed-interlocking storyplots, music always playing and a realistic damage ratio. Unlike other first person shooter games, you don't take 10 bullets to the head and keep going! Some people don't like this idea because if you're killed so easily, then you'll have to start the whole missionover again and again until you have the entire game memorized right? WRONG! Aliens vs Predator 2 allows you to save your gameplay at any given time! So all you have to do is save frequantly and if you die, you can load up ur saved game without doing over the mission. Of course you don't even have to do that if you don't want to, you can just use codes if you think you die to fast. Even if you get lost codes can help you, just clip through the level to get your berrings, you can even fly with the clipping mode in case your stuck in a pit or something!  But lets not forget what truly makes this game the best, its Aliens vs Predator! You get to be any one of the species each with their own special weapons and abilities. -Marines have the largest arsinal of weapons, with the knife, the pistol, the shotgun, the pulse rifle, the grenade launcher (with 4 different types of mines), the flamer, the smartgun, the missile launcher, the minigun and the sniper rifle (most of these weapons have an alternate fire)! *Stop to catch breath* you also get the torch cutter, hacking device, flares, flood light, night vision, and the motion tracker! You can also fight in an exo suit (which have a flamer/laser gun and a mingun/missile launcher). -Predators have the a weapons arsinal that is almost as big with creative foreign weapons including the wrist blades, the combistick spear, the pred pistol, the speargun, the shoulder cannon (with laser sight), the smart disk, the net gun and the pred mines (most of these weapons have an alternate fire aswell)! You can also heal yourself at any time with you medical kit, and replenish your energy at anytime with you energy shifter, you also have a predator hacker device, the ability to zoom in and out with your vision, 4 different vision modes that allow you to see all three species with ease, and of course the greatest ability of all, the ability to turn invisible! You can even collect skulls, this game leaves nothing out! -Aliens (my personal favourite) do not need to collect weapons because they have their claw slash attack, poison tail whip, pounce, and head bite (which will give you health, as well as slashing the corpses). Aliens also have the advantage of seeing its enemies pheremones, so no one, not even predators can hide from you! Aliens also have a second night vision, they can climb on walls whenever you want to, and of course they are the only ones with the lifecycle! You can start as a facehugger and pounce apon the face of your enemy to implant them and then...you can burst out of your victims chest!!! Like I said, this game leaves nothing out!  The multiplayer is just as entertaining, so you'll continue to play this game even after you've gotten bored of the 1 player missions (I'm still not even bored of them). The multiplayer allows you to host your own server or join one that suits you, there are tons to choose from. The multiplayer allows you to choose from 4 different marine characters (who can start with different weapons if you choose), 4 different Corporate characters (another human side so its like your playing with 4 species), 4 different predator classes, and 4 different types of aliens (including the drone, the runner, the predalien, and the preatorian-each alien is slightly different). Humans can use exo suits and aliens can molt into queens if they kill enough people and you can turn lyfecycle on and off in deathmatch and team deathmatch. There are also multiplayer modes like evac, overrun, hunt and survivor. You can even change the damage ratio if you think the characters die to quickly or slowly. Don't worry too much about cheap kills, most of the servers boot people who kill cheaply just ask the server nicley if you think someone should be kicked from the server with your chat. You also have team chat, and can chat with a specific person. Most people get good at the multiplayer once they've gotten enough experience, you'll also get used to the slang gamers use and you get to meet and befriend with so many people from around the world. Many people also like to join clans and be part of a certain circle of friends. The multiplayer on Aliens vs Predator is amazing and is only topped by the multiplayer on Aliens vs Predator: Primal Hunt (the expansion pack)  If you haven't already, I advise you to buy this game as soon as you can if you are an alien or predator fan, or just a fan of shooting games. This game is deffinetly worth its price, but don't take my word for it, judge for yourself!	1
If you've read any of my other reviews, you'd know that I'm an old fogey that pines for the good ol' days of first-person shooters.  I "grew up" on a fattening diet of Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, and Nitemare 3D.  Upon adolescence, I was playing games like Quake II and the ultimate PC game, Unreal.  Ever since my gaming childhood I've been looking for a way to relive those experiences with a more recent, technically advanced game. Aliens Versus Predator II fulfills many of my hopes.  It looks great and the developers obviously went out of their way to make good use of graphics cards.  Many parts of the game are dark, and you need to use special equipment or abilities to see in the dark and to see particular enemies.  For example, when you play as the predator you use a "normal" vision mode to see the details of the level you're on, a reddish vision mode to see aliens, and a bluish mode to see human marines.  Not only do these modes look cool but they also enhance game play. In addition to the predator, you also play as a marine or an alien.  You have lots of fun as either one, and, like the predator, you experience unique abilities and limitations as each character.  It all works very well, and all three characters you play let you see the same world and story from a unique perspective.  Very well done! Perhaps the best part of this game is the atmosphere.  It does a good job of making you feel that you're on a spooky alien world, and danger is never far away.  The AI is good, and it lends the impression that your enemies truly hate you.  The levels are well designed allowing you to interact in a rather realistic way.  Just be ready to be startled!  I jumped quite a few times playing this game. So why only four stars?  It's because of the bugs.  Most of the game is pretty stable, but I ran into a bug playing as the Marine in which I was unable to "hack" making it impossible to get some ammunition I needed.  In another level I was unable to open a hatch as a result of a bug.  Nevertheless, I got through these levels using cheat codes, so all was not lost. Aliens Versus Predator II is a really cool, well designed game that takes you away, so to speak.  It includes innovations that work very well and make the game fun to play.  If you're a shooter fan--especially a fan of the science-fiction themed shooters--then give this game a try.	1
In AvP2, you play your choice of Alien warrior, marine or Predator in a single plot that unifies all three.  If you've read any of the "Dark Horse" Alien comics, the plot won't surprise you - a covert corporate (talk about redundancy) conspiracy on a remote and hostile looking planet is breeding "xenomorphs" (the aliens) for research purposes.  The planet is also home to artifacts related to "Navigator" civilization (the long-dead alien creatures in whose derelict ship the alien eggs were discovered in the first and second movies) and apparently the hunting ground for Predators, the vicious race of aliens who live for the hunt.  Something of course goes wrong, and contact between Earth and the planet is cut.  A squad of undermanned and under armed colonial marines is dispatched to investigate.  As the lowly Harrison, you are assigned to a squad, but keep getting cut off or otherwise sent alone (you wanna stick around and guard the dropship while I grab the glory?  Be my guest!) as you land on LV-1201.  Instead of something simple like a downed transmitter, you find the planet and its research center crawling with aliens and prowled by something else (the Predator kills people and blasts things near you early on the game, but doesn't really put in an appearance; those who've seen his movies will recognize the sounds he makes throughout the game).  Surviving a few early missions in Alien-infested parts of the Weyland-Yutani research base, you link up with the researchers themselves - only to be betrayed by them.  In the best part of the game, you are trapped, alone and almost entirely defenseless inside of the WY base.  You wouldn't have a prayer, but you do get some surprising help.  The lesson of the game is simple - you can only survive as long as you can turn your enemies against each other, or otherwise exploit his gaps of attention (guards will overlook your presence - once they are stuck in a room full of hopping facehuggers; even Predators will cut you some slack...as long as there are Alien warriors aplenty). The game models the look and sound of "Aliens" very well, and fans of the colonial marines will rejoice at getting  chance to play with their gear - you've got semi-automatic pistols (surprisingly useful), pulse rifles, smart guns and sniper-rifles; you've got flamethrowers, multi-purpose grenade launchers and exo-mechanical powerloader suits.  (You've got everything that Bill Paxton had but the tactical nukes and "really big sticks").  If they tossed in James Horner's soundtrack, you'd swear you were in "Aliens".  (Some parts of the WY base are actually great renderings of "Nostromo" from the first "Alien" movie.)  This game is hard - Aliens are quick, they can run on walls and ceilings and typically attack in force.  You've got a motion tracker, but it typically won't pick up movement until it's almost too late.  Most of the time, you'll be "laying down a suppressing fire while egressing" - i.e. running backwards as possible only in FPS games while shooting madly at the mass of hostiles behind you.  The Aliens don't have it any easier - they have no stand-off weapons and have to wait for some unlucky sod to enter their darkened lair unawares (though they can get health power-ups whenever they want simply by chewing up their victims).  Ironically, your most relentless enemy isn't the Alien as much as LV-1201's ceaseless darkness.  Your equipped with either a helmet-mounted flashlight or night-vision goggles that sap your batteries dry (you'll spend a lot of time just waiting for them to recharge). That said, the game runs on a very tight storyline - it's the only way to keep the game from degenerating into a single, uninterrupted frag.  When you can't be sure what specific goals are, the game tends to lag.  Also, the stiff plot means that there's little point to really exploring AvP's rather well-rendered settings.  (forget about those ventilation shafts - just jump out that window - you don't know what's out there, but that window is there for some reason).  Also, because the game is difficult, you'll often have to replay the same stretch of a mission over and over.  Also, too many problems involve simple things like walking on top of some boxes or jumping from an elevator that's being overrun by aliens.  (while I probably wouldn't handle real aliens as well as the marines in this game, I'm pretty sure I could walk a ledge a lot better than my character does). I played this game on my WinXP P4 2GHz (GeForce3) and it ran smooth with no sound or graphics issues.  If you've conquered other FPS games and need a new challenge that doesn't involve multi-player death matches, this is your game. First, a couple of caveats - I never played the 1st AvP, and only really played the Marine portion of this one. (I started and plan to  get into the Aliens part but have no interest in Predator at all - I know I'm alone, but the Predator franchise wouldn't be able to hold a candle to any of the Aliens flicks if not for the vastly uninspired "Alien: Resurection" - and yes, I'm including "Alien3".  The respective themes of Alien and Predator don't match and putting the two together only blunts the nuance that the first 2 Alien movies for commercial purposes.  Also, monster team-ups have a proven trend of destroying great movie franchises - remember all of those "Frankenstein meets the Wolfman" movies?  We know what happened next - they all met Abbot and Costello, and that was the end of it.  What's next - "Aliens v. Predator v. Jim Carrey"?  But I digress).	1
This game is far more frightening and tense than most movies (at least playing as marines).  From the start of the game it scared the [] out of me.  There are tons of scripted events in teh begining all as frightening  as teh one before it.  You'll constantly be looking over your shoulder for more enemys.  However I have a small gripe about its "scariness" the first alien you encounter takes much of the fear away because they are extremly easy to kill taking away some of the atmosphere the movies created.  However the atmosphere itself is just plain down freaky. Each species (human alien and predator) have their own strenths and weaknesses, but I believe he human is the only really scary one which is what this game is about.  However each species is fun to play as.  Recommended for those that want scared or a different fps experience.	1
AVP2 is suspensful,adrenline flowing,and scary. The Aliens are alot of fun to be,the ability to walk on walls with the smaller more agile aliens is great. You can start as a crawler,snake,drone and moth all the way to a big bad black Queen! The Predator has several races to play also,and his vision modes,invisibility,and weaponry is just like in the movie. The Marines,has several class operators,and is my favorite role player. The amount and power of the weaponry is awesome. At my home,we play over LAN,next to Unreal Tournament 2003,this is the next greatest PC first person game. Better have atleast 32mb or 64mb video card. I had problems late in the game with my Prosavage S4 video card,I aftwards,purchased the Nvidia Geforce 4 64MB AGP video card,with s-video output,now the game plays flawlesly,and we can watch it on the 27" big screen TV. A bonus to the game,is the ability to play LAN or Internet servers,upgrade your game first,the first time you play,on the internet. I recommend that you also upgrade the game (free) over the internet at the official Sierra website for this game.	1
When the original AvP came out I quickly snapped up a copy, playing it only during daytime because it was too much on my heart. The graphics were really good and the game gave new meaning to the phrase "Adrenaline Overload".   Here's AvP2, and in almost every way it's an improvement over the original, which I didn't think was possible. Every species has been retooled and new weapons have been added making each character type you play very different from the next. And my God, it's even more heart stopping than the original!   The plot centers around a particular alien-infested planet. A research station run by Corporates has had something go awry so the Marines are sent in to figure out the goings on and fix it if possible. The Predator goes in to rack up points for his Hunt while searching ultimately for the Boss of the base, a kill that got away years before. And the Aliens, well...they're just out to kill.   The Marines are still my favorite. Heavily reliant on Pulse Rifles and Chainguns, the Marine campaign is nothing short of spectacular. From the word go you're immersed in what has to be simply put the best fusion of all the movies put together. Predictably after landing, your character is separated from his comrades and must rely on his minimal ammo load to make it from point A to B to C, fighting with Aliens the whole while. Hints that the Predator is around are seen everywhere by the numerous "skinned" bodies hanging upside down, and the telltale clicking noises he makes. The brilliant addition of a shoulder lamp helps enormously, making you less reliant on your finite source of flares. And to say this particular campaign will make you [appreciate it] is the understatement of the century. Even when you know that the dark and scary locale you're in is loaded with Aliens wanting to disembowel you is not enough to prevent even the most hardened gamer from screaming out loud at his or her computer in surprise.   The Predator portion is for the most part true to the movies. They've somewhat weakened this character from the first game, where the Predator was something of the uber class to play, mostly for multiplayer balance I would imagine. While the atmosphere is still eerie, knowing that you have auto-tracking weapons helps alleviate the shock of seeing an Alien running at you. A close eye must be kept on your energy bar as too many shots off of your Plasma Caster will deplete it rapidly.   But the real overhaul of the game, and by far the single biggest improvement is to the Alien. My God, this class has become so much fun! The original AvP had a very weak Single player story for the Alien, in my opinion. I must not have been alone in this way because the boys at Lithtech retooled the whole deal and made it very immersive. You start out as a simple facehugger...running from place to place looking for a victim to "impregnate". Playing cat and mouse with patrolling Corporate guards is something like having Thief crossed with Quake, and you'll want to avoid all contact for as long as possible. Once a suitable host is found, you spawn as a baby alien, even getting to *shudders* watch the chest-bursting act from a whole new perspective. This really adds to the entire experience and my hat's off to Sierra for making this happen.   Multiplayer is an absolute riot. You've got your standard array of maps and arenas, with the continued options such as "Deathmatch" and "Species Deathmatch", with the addition of notable scenarios like "Evac", where a group of Marines works together to escape a facility, while Aliens try to pick them off one by one. Get to the dropship on time and your team wins. Combat gets really hairy and confusing, and you'll never get used to crawling through airshafts that an Alien opponent is using to hunt you, reminding me of poor old Captain Dallas.   Buy this game. Play this game. And be prepared to be a stockholder in the Fruit of the Loom company, because you'll be changing your drawers hourly and often, especially in the Single Player Campaigns. Anyone up for a game of "Evac"? ;)	1
Ingredients: Large spoonful of slimey teeth Fresh smoke, steam and dripping water Pinch of Doom 2 Garnish liberally with terror As a big fan of the Alien films I've launched myself into a lot of the tie-in games that have been released over the years, including the genesis, super-nes, gameboy and playstation versions. Most of them,  including this latest incarnation follow the same basic plot:  government agents with machinations of global domination stumble on alien beasty, and take it home for show and tell.  Said alien escapes, and there follows much running and screaming in steam filled corridors.  However, this game sets itself apart from its long lineage with a truly immersive survival-horror experience.  Depending on how you look at it this game is best played on your own with the lights off and the sound up.  For better or for worse this game scared my panties off. You can play as three different species, each with its own weapons and characteristics and all with an intertwining plot.  Choose the alien, and you'll be running up vertical surfaces and biting people in the face.  With the predator you'll get to play with lots of shiny gadgets like heat-vision (yeah, like in the movies) and various stabby/choppy weapons for taking off heads (literally).  And, as the poor weedy human marine, its back to 3d shooter basics with pistol, shotgun, fast-but-weak machine guns and lots of sweat. Its the marine single player game that really shines, as you creep around lots of 'abandoned' military installations, movement tracker bleeping.  If you've watched the movies you'll know its only ever a matter of time before something with big teeth and an attitude problem jumps out of the ceiling at you, and man, does this game deliver.  Expect to jump frequently, firing blindly into the darkness at the very scarily accurate alien hordes.  Sometimes there will be as many as six or seven of the critters bearing down on you, and the crisp graphics really excel in bringing the movies to life. As far as the Alien and Predator games go the tension is somewhat diminished since, after all, you're the monster now.  Its initially very amusing to watch the AI controlled civilians quake and scream at your approach, and there's lots to be said for the Alien's acrobatic talents...you can leap huge distances, and explore airducts and sewer systems with ease. However, you'll probably find that sooner or later the Alien and Predator missions get fairly samey.  Still, there's lots of great graphical effects on show, with great smoke and lighting throughout all the missions.  Again, the sound is excellent, with distant screams and scuttling behind walls bringing everything to terrifying life. The online multiplayer game is also very well balanced, and features a nice variety of playing levels and game modes, with more downloadable from the official site.  In the long term this is where the game stands out, since beyond the marine missions the single player is really a one-off affair. Overall this is a good solid game, with some stand out moments in the single player, and lasting appeal in the multiplayer.  It is both violent and gory, so the sqeamish should probably shop elsewhere, and for obvious reasons if you didn't like the films this is probably a poor choice.  But, for both film and horror shooter fans alike Alien vs Predator 2 is a game to sink all four sets of teeth into.	1
First person shooter fans get a second dose of fun. Play as the chest-bursting aliens, the sci-fi-friendly Predator, or the poor marines stuck in the middle. This classic came out in 2001, so by now it's rather cheap compared to current releases. The gameplay is still great fun, though. There are three different single-player campaigns, each with storylines that weave in and out of each other. You can face-hug as an alien, stealth-attack as a Predator, or fight off the enemy as a marine. The graphics aren't top notch by today's standards, with faces looking painted on a balloon. Still, many of the scenes are rather impressive and keep you involved in the game. The sound really helps emphasize the trepidation and surprise that are involved in many of the scenarios. Where the game really shines is in multiplayer. Train yourself up through the campaigns, and then join a faction on line to see if you can compete against net players. You can have up to 16 people playing at a time, and it gets for pretty intricate strategies if you're good! Each character type has a wide variety of attacks to choose from, and its own strengths and weaknesses. Highly recommended for mature first-person-shooter fans. Might be a little much for younger players, between the body parts flying and death screams that sound pretty constantly as you prowl the halls.	1
I loved this game! It scared the heck out of me; severals times I jumped, severely, and then laughed at the greatness of that ability in a game! The graphics and music are really exceptional and creepy! Did I mention creepy! I don't even mind that the music picks up before you're about to be attacked because it makes it that much more suspenseful. If they didn't give you any warning, I think this game would be a little too scary! Definitely a sweaty palms kind of game. Also, this was the first time I was able to complete the Alien mission. In AVP, for some reason, there was too much wall walking and tunnel traveling for me to stand it to the end. In AVP2, starting as a face-hugger, then changing to a chest-buster really helped alleviate that constant swirling screen. Maybe I'm the only one afflicted by this phenom, but I was appreciative of that change. It also made it challenging, having to sneak around as a baby alien, hardly able to do much of anything...very interesting and creative, and truly alien to all of us gamers used to walking around on two legs toting letal hardware. I also found the gameplay improved from AVP. All of the best elements are there, but without some of the annoying things...like the talking guy on the monitor and not every single room is darker than dark...sometimes I like to see a little bit and they did well there. Adding the rechargable shoulder lamp instead of just having the image intensifier was a terrific addition. What I really love are the intersecting story lines...crossing the same territory as all 3 species was great! It also helps when you're playing the Alien if you've been in these areas before as a Marine or a Predator. There's a large array of weapons, but I found that some are unnecessary. Maybe that's because I haven't played the most difficult settings yet, and don't play Multiplayer, but in the single-player, regular settings, I didn't have to use most of my weapons, especially as a Marine. Since I don't play MP, I miss the Skirmish mode from AVP, where using the cheats you could have all the weapons and really learn how to use them best, but the rest of the game was so good, it doesn't bother me. I wouldn't like AVP without the Skirmish mode, but AVP2 is fine without it. I had no technical problems running this game, which is always nice. There were a few times when an Alien would kind of just sit there and claw at me, but not reach me, making it easy for me to blast it, but those times were few and far between. As always, playing a Marine or Alien and going up against the Predator is totally awesome! Fox Interactive really has something here and I hope they continue to team up these two great SCI-FI stories. Final Answer: Whether you have played AVP or not, you'll enjoy this game if you're into SCI-FI/Horror and FPS. This is what it's all about!	1
This game is probably by far one of the best FPS to come along in years! This game is soooo freaky, so don't consider playing it at night. This is one of those games where you stop playing it to give yourself a break, you just have to keep playing it to see what you have to do and what new things you can find and get. So, if you're waiting for the next DOOM or QUAKE game to come out, don't look any longer than this. I highly reccomend it!	1
I enjoyed the prequel to this game and went out on a 59$ limb to get this one.  It took me several painfully long tries to get this game to install.  It seemed to like to crash my computer.  After a successful installation, I tried playing the game.  The graphics were great, but the voice acting was ABOMINABLE!  I realied more on the subtitles than the poor acting in this game.  Anyway, the game was decent when it worked.  AvP2 crashed my computer every 5 minutes.  There were times when I could play for up to an hour before it crashed, but it always sent me to the blue screen of no return. In case you may be wondering, I meet or exceed the system requirments suggested by the manufacturer. I finally beat the game and was met with a frustratingly anti-climactic ending sequence that left me feeling like I wasted my money on a broken game.  It is possible that the game was defective, but I wasn't going to waste my time with it. I'm sure if you get a working or updated copy, you will be impressed with good graphics and gameplay.  I still feel like playing as the alien.	-1
Alien vs Predator II is a fps with an excellent single player gameplay, It is based on the six alien and predator movies and much better than the orginal game. Set in the future you get to play an alien, a marine and a predator in three different episodes but with the same plot. The storyline is very well written with perfect voice acting. The single player gameplay is excellent and well desinged, the level design is superb, very intresting and scary. Multiplayer gameplay is also available and it is great but not as good as the single player. Avp2 is built on the lithtech engine, The graphics and sound are excellent. I played it on the Direct3D hardware acceleration video mode and the game runs great. Avp2 is not to be missed game if you like fps.	1
You could not ask for a better game. It'll always keep you on the edge of your seat. Fast pace and great story. I just can't wait for the expansion pack for this one.	1
Overall this game is awesome.  Sound is soooo realistic.  In single player mode you can play as a Soldier, Predator, or Alien.  This game can scare the pants off you if you like thrillers.  You don't know whats around the next corner.  Multiplayer adds so much fun to the aspect of the game because you can play with up to 16 players on one server.  Best of all, for you 56K users out there, this game doesnt lag, and when it gets slow, you don't have to quit playing, frame rates don't slow and keep going.  A little graphically intense for younger audiences so I recommend it to 15+ year olds.	1
It makes u feel like u're in the movie ALIENS. A little bit more work on language and game is ready to get an oskar :))) Multiplayer is great. There are maps of NOSTROMO, SULAKO and AURIGA. BEST OF THE BEST	1
This game depends on a persons particular taste and whether or not they have a pace maker or not.  A love for a scrawny FPS will have you drawling at the screen as you back pedal down a vent shaft whilst spraying randomly into the face of the three aliens clawing there way along the ceiling totally intent on sucking out your brain.  And of course if you're an alien & predator fan, then you'll have the same kind of liking to the scary atmosphere of the alien series.  However, for those who like to be able to see what they're shooting at and like to stand and fight instead of leg it and shoot backwards, perhaps this is not for you. The game is clearly a scary thing to play - close the curtains and turn out the lights gives the ideal atmosphere and I suggest a good sound set up, and even better, headphones. You may have read other reviews that state how you can play as the Alien, Predator and Marine, and that is true, but I find playing as the human characters by far and away the most fun because there's nothing like pumping away with the shotgun at an alien with no legs left until it turns to liquid. Being serious though, the graphic content is excellent, the modals are well rendered (What you can see of them) and the lighting effects really make you wish the flashlight on your shoulder hadn't just run out of power. There is a massive array of weaponry with the marines and if you're the predator you have your nice long claws to enjoy and of course the famous shoulder cannon that the predator uses in the films.  When playing as the alien you start life as one of those worm things, and then you eventually grow up into a fully armoured acid licking killing machine that can walk on the ceiling and cut peoples heads off.  (Grose!) I often say to people when they say this movie is really scary that it's only a movie, how can it be scary? But I really can tell you, when playing on this game, you really will need a cloth to wipe the sweat off the mouse as you fight to stay alive. The scariest parts are when your walking into a semi lit room and you throw a flare in to see the room, but then as you carefully walk into the middle, you can hear the familiar ticking and scrapping sound, and then the radar starts beeping and before you know it you've turned around to locate the alien so many times you don't know where you are and all the time it's above you on the ceiling, and when you look up and see it looking at you, get that gun out! So as far as I can see, if it's scary games and FPS's your into, this is a good choice, of course there are others like Medal of honour and C&C renegade if you prefer a more skilled game more then the toilet treatment that goes on if you play AVP2. The multi-player is for on-line of LAN only, so there are no computer player options which I was a little disappointed in, because I like it when you can play infinitely against a computer especially in the hunt option where I could be a marine searching for a predator in the jungle. Never mind, the single player really makes up for that.  The game is however a bit too short.  Okay, it's still a big game, but to today's standards where anything under 20 hours of single player action is short, it has to be said it could be a little longer.  But even though I've completed it, believe me, you will want to do it again on a harder skill level.  And you can see why it's short compared to most, it's because of the details that's gone into making it, the levels are so big some of them, and some of the open spaces where you have to walk along this pipe over a 200 foot fall really make you see how long it must have taken to design this game. The levels are a little linear, but don't let that put you off because what true FPS isn't. All in all a great FPS which is the best scary game out at the moment in my opinion.  Worth owning.	1
Having unsuccessfully tried to play AvsP and AvsP Gold because of incompatibility issues, I took a chance and ordered AvsP 2. I gotta tell you it was worth it! I've had a riot with this one! I'm still playing it and it's a lot of fun. It takes too long to load after getting killed and sometimes you can hunt around for hours before learning how to move on, but all in all, it's really a lot of fun. If you have Windows XP Home Edition, this one will work!	1
I love this game but it wasn't always that way i had a bad time with the bugs but the patches came out and its great this game rocks a must buy it should be bug free now but you must play this game its creepy	1
THis is a fantastic game! ALien and predator is the best! Screw the marine, damnit, sure it's easier, but the alien and predator rock! get this game, it's more than worthit!	1
This is the best "First Person Shooter" I've purchased in quite a while. Singleplayer was rather enjoyable. Sound was nice and eerie. Graphics were rather good- even if they did reuse the scenery way too much. But what really makes this game shine is its actors. Whether you are playing as a Marine, a Predator, or an Alien- you really become that character! As a Marine, you are sent to investigate a colony that has been ravaged by aliens. Then you get separated from your squad and things start to go really bad. Its dark and scary, and as your little motion sensor beeps away you find yourself jumping at every turn. It feels exactly like the movies! They nailed the Predator too! All his famous abilities and weapons are at your disposal, which pretty much makes you one unstoppable killer. Turn yourself invisible. Switch to infravision. Jump from tree-limb to tree-limb. Then decimate your prey in any number of ways. You are a Predator, and the game captures that feeling perfectly!  Finally, it is the Aliens that truly make this game for me. They can walk on walls. They have acidic blood. A sharp sense of smell. Fierce claws and a whip-like tail. Sickest of all- They eat their victims to regain health! The aliens can be rather disorienting to control at first, but once you get the hang of it- you are sure to fall in love with the little critters! It really makes you think and play in a totally alien manner- very original! Singleplayer was a lot of fun, but Multiplayer really makes AVP II shine. Take the three species and throw them in an unforgiving arena, and see which is the fittest. It really is hectic, and quite a ride. However, there  is one aspect of multiplayer that really needs improvement. The "game launcher". When you go to find  an internet game to join, it lists all the servers along with the number of players, the ping, and the game types. You can then sort the game by any of these aspects to find just the game you want to play. It provides filters to make this even easier- but unfortunately, there is no way to save your filter preferences. Instead, you have to put them in every time you want to find a new game. This is really a nuisance! There is also no way to remove all the servers that require a password (would be nice), or download the map from the server if you don't have it (instead of getting kicked out). Maybe I'm asking too much, but other games (like Half-Life) have been able to solve these little inconveniences for years now! Maybe after a few more patches...? Either way, once you finally get into a good server, you are in for a real good time. Death Match doesn't get much more fun than this!	1
Like many I was first introduced to the concept of Aliens vs. Predator through the Dark Horse comics.  While I found the comics fair at best (movie to comics adaptions are rarely good) I am a huge fan of the Alien movies (except for the god-awful "Alien: Resurrestion") and to a lesser degree, the Predator movies.  The concept was awesome, but an Alien isn't an Alien unless it's screaming that high pitched Godzilla whine and a Predator isn't a Predator without those weird clicking growls.  There have been rumors of an Alien vs. Predator movie for as long as I can remember, but so far no cigar. When the first PC game came out I really looked forward to it. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into it.  I thought the plot was mindless the controls were wacky and the multiplayer was unbalanced.  The novelty of controling an Alien or Predator wore off pretty fast after a few frustrating minutes.  Once again, a great concept was put to waste. For the first time, we now have a quality product from the marriage of two great film creatures.  This game rocks.  The last shooter that I got this into was Clive Barkers Undying.  Before that it was System Shock 2 (a fantastic and highly underrated game).  They all have one thing in common: tha ability to scare the crap out of me.  The ambiance and tone of the game truly does the movies justice.  I can think of several instances were I thoguht I was going to jump out of my skin. This game has it all: great story, great graphics, great sound (I should put specific emphasis on this one.  I have surround speakers and the ambiance and sudden noises kept scaring the crap out of me) and a lot of action.  What's more, they manage to capture the tone of each individual race and balance some of the issues that AVP1 suffered from.  The Aliens were mincemeat in the first game, but they're much more frightening in this installment.  They're treated more like the Aliens in part 1 and part 3 than the cannon fodder of Aliens. Even if you're not a big fan of the movies or the comics, I encourage you to try this game.  It's rare for a franchise game to please more than just die-hard fans, but this is one of those games.  Not since "Jedi Knight" has a movie based game captured the essence of a film so perfectly.  If the single player games had been a little longer I'd probably give this game 5 stars.  Instead I can only hope that an expansion is in the works because I want more.	1
I had played the first one as well. Although AVP was a good game. It had no story what so ever and the gameplay is basically just running from point A to Point B. This game fixed all of that. It has a good story to it. The setting takes place in a Planet called LV-1201. Where "the Company" is doing research on alien Xenomorphs. But when an egg hatches in an unsecure location and impreginates an officer (who later dies during the embryo's birth). Everything goes out of control. The Graphics are astounding as always. But the sound has greatly improved. It sounds almost like the movies. The game play has also went up as well. The drawback however is that the game is short. Plus you should have a Pentium 3 at 700 Mhg+ and 256MB RAM+ for a smooth performance. Like the previous game you get to play the 3 charactors. THe Predator who has all the high tech gadgets from the plasma Shoulder cannon to the "Disc". He comes to the planet just to hunt. But when his friends are captured. He then tries to rescue them. Only to find out that he has some unfinished bussiness (of 20 years) to attend to. The Human you play is a Marine name Cpl. Harrison. He can have all the firepower a man would need plus all the gadgets to bypass computers and doors and to weld off locks. He is sent with a Platoon to rescue any survivors and to keep the place intact. Only to find out that "The Company" has other plans with the Marines. The Alien you play is the most interesting one of all. You start out as a Facehugger (a spiderlike creature) looking for a host. To a Baby alien looking for food, to an adult drone looking for the hive. He (or she) is the one who started the whole mess at LV-1201. The alien has no external weapons what so ever. All it hs is his tale and claws like hands. It can also climb on walls and ceilings.  THe story is interesting because the three charactors "bump" into each other during the game. you also get to observe people talking to each other (somtimes taking dialogue from the movies. That makes the game more alive. If you love the movies then get this game.	1
AvP2 is wonderful, in that "OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD", scared-witless sort of way.  You will find 3 seperate campaigns, one each for the Aliens, Predators, and Colonial Marines.  Each race plays totally different from the other - the Marine is closest to standard shoot-em up FPS and also the movies, the Predator has lots of stealth missions and jumping from tree to tree while on the hunt, and the Alien - well, I won't ruin it for you, but the Alien campaign is certainly the most creative I've seen since Half-life. The resemblance to the films is uncanny.  While AvP2's story doesn't much resemble anything from the movies, the developers have taken many themes, locations and situations from the films and plugged them into the game, so that you are often replaying a moment that will remind you of something.  The plot is wonderful, as each campaign, although self-contained, gives little details about the other two.  When you finally finish the game, you'll definitely want to play through again, just like watching Sixth Sense a 2nd time to catch all of the details. My only complaints are that the game is too linear and the enemies are too predicable on the second or third time through.  Also, the multiplayer code will greatly hurt the online games, so get this game just for the single player game.	1
This game is a vast improvement over the flawed original.  For one, the graphics are much better, though not as good as some of the newer games out there.  Still, they aren't bad and the atmosphere in the game is wonderful.  Where the original felt more like a run-of-the mill shooter wherein the player mowed down hordes of Aliens (or humans, if you played as the Alien or Predator), this one still has you facing hordes of enemies but does a much better job of emulating the movies' creepy feel.  As an example, the first level in the marine campaign has absolutely no enemies in it but it is, IMO, one of the best levels in the single player game.  Though there are no foes, scripted events abound as you, cut off from your team, try to make your way back to them.  As you go along you'll bump into a few survivors and, before you can do anything, see them slain by the Predator (with suitably tantalizing glimpses of the cloaked predator).  You'll find evidence of the Aliens' and Predators' handiwork all around, 'something' will rattle through a duct nearby, things will break or otherwise go haywire in such a way as to make you jump.  The atmosphere is pulled off quite well in the Predator and Alien campaigns as well, though they are not as creepy as the Marine campaign. Beyond that, the encounters for each race seem fitting and all of the races are fairly well balanced.  The Alien can't take a great deal of punishment but its fast and lethal if it gets in close quarters (and it can climb virtually any surface), the Marine isn't terribly durable either, but with his motion tracker and a devastating arsenal he can be a match for either of the other two races, the Predator is fairly tough and has some good weapons but not anything as purely destructive as some of the Marine weapons.  The Alien campaign also has one particularly cool feature in that you start it as a facehugger, your goal then is to avoid the humans until you can find a suitably isolated host.  Once thats done, you become the chestburster, the 'child' stage of the Alien, again you have to sneak around until you grow larger.  Once that has happened you become a full grown Alien and the flesh-rending fun begins :-). If I have any complaints its that the 'minimum requirements' for this game are a joke.  As with most graphically intensive games, your RAM and the quality of your 3d card are more important.  If you have a decent 3D card and 256 or more megs of RAM you should be okay, however, if you have only the 128 megs the box calls for, the game will stutter a lot even in the lower detail ranges. (...) That and you'll want to do a full install for maximum performance.  The nearly one and a half gigs that the full install eats up can be painful if you have a small hard drive :-(.  Though its a fun game at any detail level, being able to max the graphics out certainly helps :-). To sum it up, this game is definitely worth the money and a good follow up to the original, though you'll want to have a fairly beefy computer to run it well.	1
You've read the comics.  You've seen the movies.  You've played the first AvP.  Now be prepared to be blown away by the second installment of what may turn out to be a long-lived FPS series on the PC.  However, not all is gold and silver in this amazing package... The graphics, for one thing, are absolutely gorgeous.  The characters come to life seamlessly and behave realistically.  Going for more of a comic book theme, AvP2's graphics do not opt for the fleshy and realistic looking models and skins of the first game, but instead go for a more colored and polished look similair to what you will find in the classic Dark Horse comic book series.  And thats not a bad thing at all.  The characters all have personality and, contrary to the first game, there is a linear, actual STORY running continuous among all three races...so its not playing the same story with a different outcome, its playing the same story through the eyes of each different race as it unfolds.  What's that you ask?  Why did that guy suddenly disappear from the Marine campaign?  Well, once you're finished with that, you'll play the Pred or Alien campaign and find out.  Consistencies like that occur through all three viewpoints which adds alot to replay and overall fun value. These gorgeous graphics described mask a menace...bugs and lag.  Even on some of the most high end to mid-level computers, AvP2 has a tendency to be herky-jerky when there is alot of action on screen, particularly during mass Alien attacks.  The graphics manage to stay crisp but the high detail on the models still creates a problem.  Its ok...you can always turn down the display settings, but in such a great looking game like this, would you really want to? Crashes are abundant...its too bad really.  This is such a great game and yet there are so many wrongs that could have easily been overlooked by the development and play-test teams.  Crashes during in-game cutscenes(which are done rather well...conveying the story intelligently and clearly) happen often depending on whether or not your video drivers are up to date or if your hardware is compatible.  There are many technical issues with the game that can be easily and shuold be solved in a patch or two. The sound is great, but there are alot of sounds ripped directly from the movies that were included in AvP1 that were so great, and are now missing in AvP2.  One thing that many have wanted is the improved sound on the Predator's shoulder cannon...it sounds exactly as it did in the movies.  Other sounds have been pulled from the flicks and integrated, but many of the sounds have been changed.  In any case, the SFX are still great, and the music ranges from all out creepy to terrifying, especially in the marine campaign. The atmosphere is frightening...use of dark and light is great and keeps the mood forever tense.  There are tons of scripted events that will have your knees knocking from utter fear, especially in the marine missions! Multiplayer coding....it needs serious work.  There is a very highly argued balancing issue between the 4 sides you can choose (Alien, Predator, USCM, Corporate Mercs), each with 4 sub-classes.  Very buggy and unbalanced, the multiplayer game is fun but needs serious work.  There is no shortage of interesting modes however, and trying them all out will be a blast. All in all, a GREAT game with some moderate flaws.  Definitely pick it up if you are looking for a great single player experience, or are a fan of AvP!	1
I never played AVP, too much bad press, and I didn't really care when I found out this was coming out. My mind has been changed. Monolith is really turning into a great house. All the praise that has been heaped on this game is due, so I'll harp on the weaknesses. Too Damn Short! This is essentially a multiplayer game with three training missions. Highly entertaining missions, but very very very very short. Thought Max Payne was short? By the time you're breaking into the mansion in MP, you're done with AVP2. No Risks. I think this game sticks too closely to what has been laid out in the movies. The plot, while entertaining, was just a re-hash of A4 with an added Predator hunt.  There's so much room for creativity in this universe I'm a little peeved that Monolith (who did an amazing job with NOLF) didn't take advantage of it (unless Fox kept a clamp on what was going on). Balance. The predator is absolutely unstoppable. It's fun to play and there are certainly ways to get killed, but compared to the other 2 he's a juggernaut. These translate into minor points and don't impact playability so I don't want to give the impression that I think there's anything wrong with the game. For the most part, there just isn't enough. How about a sizable add-on pack Monolith?	1
This game rocks.  Talk about realism at it's best. If you think Counter Strike and all those games look good Check out this Gem.  Texture mapping is so clean you can see the hairs on the marine's arm move in the wind.  You can see your reflection in the aliens slimy dome just before it tears you appart.  This game is so fast past is keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you were a fan of the first one you NEED to get this.  It's got the same fst paced, high impact, scary as hell, nerve racking game play with a lot more plot and more abilities.   We got to see 5 different types of aliens in AvP and AvP Gold and were mad that we got to play as only one.  Hearing our Cries Fox has made this game to be perfect.  As an Alien you start out as a Face Hugger who must find it's host then break out as a chest burster and avoid everything until you grow into the menacing drone that roams around killing everything that we see in the movies.   As Predator you start out with a few things and as your skills improve you get better weapons and technologies.  We also get to use weapons seen in Predator 2.  The Spear and Net Gun(Got to Love that thing)   Marines have a few more added items such as a field lite, a hacing device, and fully automatic pistol, and ooooh knives.(great to run around with in Multy player when you need to hon your skills)   This game rules.  It makes the origional look like a low rate B budget game.  And we know that it wasn't that.	1
Aliens versus Predator 2 is actually a game that has really great graphics that is much comparable to that of No One Lives Forever. I really believed there would not be a game with the same fun, a.i intelligence, and gameplay w/ great graphics as No One Lives Forever, but I see that I was wrong. Aliens versus Predator 2 almost made me forget about all the other games I had on my PC (believe me - I have alot of PC games). The graphics are just so detailed and amazing - it just blows away the first Aliens versus Predator game. The sound is great, and the shrieking of the aliens when they are hurt sounds much like that of the aliens in the Aliens movie series. The game is very dark and the night vision and flashlight turn off because of battery drain after one minute. The game is not as scary as the first but it does have the feel and look of the Aliens and Predator movies. The marines do not really look like the same marines from the Aliens movies - they appear to look like the operatives in Half-Life that sport orange jump suits and goggles. The weapons are great - you have a sniper rifle now and the minigun can be used even when you are running. The only problem I had with this game was that it would crash the computer most of the time when you try to quit the game. This is one of the main reasons of why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5. I do not know why the crashes would happen - I tried it on 2 computer systems (A PC with Pentium 4 1.6 ghz, 512mb SDRAM, and a NVIDIA GEFORCE 3 64mb video card/ and a PC with Pentium II Dual 400 mhz processor, 1 gig SDRAM, and 3Dlabs Oxygen VX1 video card) Maybe the crash is a temporary bug that could be fixed by downloading new patches from SIERRA or Fox Interactive's gaming homepage. Even so, sometimes the graphics would get scrambled like for instances where you could see through the polygons. Other than these two problems that I have encountered, this game is a must buy! Gameplay = 8/10 Graphics = 8/10 Sound = 9/10 Value = 8/10	1
I had finally bought a Playstation2 a couple of days ago and Kinetica was the first game I had bought. This game is nothing but action. Picture yourself flying off of 40ft ramps at 300mph doing flips, spins, tripple axles, barrel roles, twists, and much much more. That's what Kinetica is, and more. You can choose one, from nine different kinetic suits. The kinetic suits have enhanced speed, agility, Acceleration, and everything else that goes with it. There are 13 anti-gravity tracks (where you can race on the walls, ceiling, etc...) to race on. Spread through out the tracks are powerups that raise your boost power. If you collect a certain number of power ups, you get a special move, like drafting, attacks, and super boost. You can also raise your boost meter by doing sweet stunts on the ground and in the air. Despite what other reviewers have said about on-screen slow downs, I have yet to have the game slow down, even with about 5 racers on the screen at once. And what some have said about moving so fast that you cant tell what's going on is also faulse. It's true that you race incredibly fast (I think I passed 400mph going down a large hill with super boost on once) but not too the extent where you can't tell what's going on. As for mastering the controls, I have yet to do that, but I'm starting to get good. The steering is pretty easy, actually it depends on which character you pick. All the woman, are much more maneuverable than the men, they have better grip, and they have better steering. The men seem faster, much stronger, and accelerate faster (mainly because their engines are much more powerful). I myself use the woman characters the most, since the tracks have many hard and short turns it seems they would be more usefull. That's only my opinion though. In some way Kinetica reminded me alot of a game that was for the ps1, called Hydro Thunder. In that game you also have to go out of your way to collect alot of turbo boost powerups. Plus, the handeling and steering in Kinetica felt exactly the same as Hydro Thunder's. Now the graphics. Compared too other ps2 games that Iv played at some friends, Kinetica's graphics are nothing special at all, but their not even close to being bad eather. The textures and designs on the tracks and the kinetic suits looked very nice I thought. This is a futuristic game so of course it plays techno music (which can get boring and old after a while). So that's about it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves action packed, incredibly fast racing games, or if you just like racing games none the less.	1
I first previewed this game on a demo disc I received in the mail.  At first I didn't pay all that much attention to it and wasn't big into racing games at the time.  Then a few weeks ago a friend of mine watched the demo and exclaimed, "Dude, you gotta get this game!"  I watched the incredible speeds reached and stunts performed and realized that Kinetica wasn't just another racer like Gran Turismo 3.  Since I'd be working this summer I decided to fork over the money and buy it.  I can honestly say it was my best purchase decision since Twisted Metal Black.  I picked up the controls and techniques within a matter of minutes and was well on my way to beating out the CPU.  Amazon's review states that you can't see very well and that the game slows down when the action heats up.  Both of these are false.  Maybe on a PS2 that was released prior to Fall, 2001 these complaints hold water.  On mine, there is no problem whatsoever.  As for the concern about the races being so blindingly fast that one can't concentrate on stunts, someone with quick fingers and a little practice can easily refute this.  And don't think the fun is over when you beat the game.  Unlocking all the bonus tracks and characters offers the player to couple his or her racing skills with an awesome new bike on past courses or against a friend.  Furious speeds, dazzling stunts, and flawless and intricate tracks: Kinetica is all this and more.	1
When I bought PlayStation 2, I also got a game called Kinectica. Kinetica is a game where you race in futuristic cars and tracks. The cars go about 200 MPH, which unfortnately may take some time to get used to. The graphics are decent and the game looks realistic. Overall if you want a good super-fast racing game, I'd buy Kinetica.	1
Kinetica is essentially SSX (or the upcoming SSX Tricky) using exotic futuristic locales.  The graphics are crisp, the worlds are massive, and the competition is fierce.  With nine potential racers of varying abilities and more than a dozen race circuits, the unlockable features ensure long-lasting playability.  The controls are easy to learn, but control is challenging to master. Interestingly, the Kinetica game manual is extremely well-designed, being both informative and beautiful to look at.  The racers and circuits are presented along the bottom of the pages across the entire manual, while the specific, easy-to-read details of the game (controls, options, etc.) are explained on specific pages.  An added bonus is "The Art of Kinetica," a small booklet presenting close-up images of the game's characters. Perhaps most impressive is the incredibly FAST load time for each race venue.  The expansive worlds and their glorious detail take almost no time at all to load; this is made to seem even shorter as the game screen offers a tip to improve a palyer's performance while the venue loads.  Another wonderful aspect is that the fast-paced gameplay is NOT interrupted by dropped frames :-) The only potential drawback is the lack of a specific stunt track and/or interactive stunt tutorial (such as is available in SSX).  This would be a great benefit to players as they first play the game, especially since stunts MUST be performed (almost continuously) to have a chance at winning.  Nonetheless, while this is not a Gran Turismo 3, Kinetica is definitely a wonderful game which should definitely be a part of every serious PS2 gamer's collection!!!!!	1
At first I did not like it but after the first few races it grew on me like a vine. This race is crazy zainy and just plane fun.	1
the first time playing kinetica a few years ago, i mus admit i didn't like it. Back then, i found it difficult, but i soon realized that the only reason i found it so difficult was because i had little to no expierience in racing games. I waited, i played the need for speed series, and i picked this game up again. Now that i have more expierience, this game is an adrenaline filled rollercoaster. The game feastures full body suits, that have wheels on the hand and feet, which race you through a futuristic worlds of ups and downs. Through the entire expierience, you are never completely sure which way is up, since you are constantly shooting up, and along side walls. The best feature of the game is the boost system, which ties directly to the trick system. Doing tricks is an amazong display of twists, turn and lights. You can do flips, spins, both at the same time, and many other arial acrobatic tricks. After preforming these great acrobatic feats, you earn boos which makes you move MUCH faster. So you may say, why not a four star rating. There is only one gripe i have about this game, and it is a problem that can be the ultimate downfall of many games. The game is just too short, iwas able to beat it in a solid two hours of gameplay, which is a less than inspiring statistic. If kinetica would have been made just a bit longer, i think it would have been a five star game. Thats not to say that the short time you are playing is not exciting quite the opposite actually. If you have a lot of freind who can't get enough racing games, then this is the perfect multiplayer delight, and the game is even fun repeating the career several times, well worth the measley 5 to 10 dollars for the speed nut!	1
This great PS2 game combines great music with finger-tapping fun. It might seem easy at first, but soon you're caught up in the musical action! There are other games out there that make you 'dance to the beat' or hit buttons in rhythm. Frequency takes this to a new level by breaking up real songs into their components - guitar, drum, synth, etc - and letting you play along with ANY of the parts. Get strings of hits done properly to gain points, and tag special sequences to get multipliers or other bonusses. Advance through levels to unlock secrets, and increase the difficulty level on any song to challenge yourself further. These aren't 'generic beats' you're playing along with. You get to choose from No Doubt, Fear Factory, Orbital, Paul Oakenfold, Curve, The Crystal Method, and many more. So not only is the gameplay great, but the music you get to listen to is great, too! Design your own mixes of the songs, or even better, play the game with friends! The game truly shines when you take it into multiplayer. You can do that with extra controllers, or the best way to play is on line with the PS2 Online setup. Get three other players from around the globe to join you, and together you can really get a song to shine. It's amazingly fun to go from your own simple bassline and to hear the other players chime in with their parts. It's an on line jam session! Highly recommended for any music fan, and even those not heavily into music but who enjoy games like tetris and bubbles will find it quite addicting.	1
This game is excellent - I bought it after playing the demo in the Summer Jampack.  The music rocks, too.  It is a beat game but there is some strategy involved as well.  As you play the music, you score points.  A perfect rendition of a few bars scores the points displayed.  If you then begin to lock multiple phrases (without messing up) the multiplier goes up. The best part about the game is the sheer length.  I have been playing it for probably 20 hours so far and have not lost interest or beat it.  The game has 4 levels with 4 songs each.  If you reach the target score on a level it unlocks another song for each level.  This has kept me replaying the game to try to get my score high enough to try all the songs. I can see that if you were not musically inclined you would be frustrated with this game.  But if you enjoy this type of games (others are PaRappa, Um Jammer Lammy, Space Channel 5, or Samba de Amigo) this is the one to get.	1
Boy,you have to get it or at least try it. The heck with Vista's Magnet program! This is better than a magnet program! It's all about the music. This game has 6 soncs to it that you can play or make a remix. But there may be more since I only have a demo. The beginning is good with the chanlengers and the Dj's. So far theirs 5 artists besides the beginning one. There's Funster De Lunge,DJ Qbert,Jungle Brothers,and Fear Factor. All the songs are of different types like rock,future type, and many others. Overall this is the best of the best music game and if you learned something from it then you might become a great and far out DJ or artist. It's a cool game and if you ever are in band you can learn about the instrutments faster. I hope this will make you want to get the game.	1
Frequency is a lot like Konami's Beatmania series. As markers drop toward the bottom of the screen, you hit a series of buttons to play the samples associated with each of the markers. In Frequency, the major difference is that each song is divided into 8 tracks, each of which occupies the inner face of a 3-D octagonal tunnel. As you complete two measures of a given track, it "locks" the track for the remainder of that segment of the song. This gives Frequency a lot more "Game" value than something like Beatmania - you need to know which tracks will maximize your points, and in complex levels, which tracks will simply get you through that segment. Add in bonus items like score multipliers, auto-complete powerups, and there's a lot of depth added above and beyond the basic Beatmaniaesque gameplay. The crux of a music game like Frequency is the music, and it definitely doesn't disappoint. The tracks range from casual hiphop, to almost '80sesque synth-pop. While there's something for everyone, the quality is uniformly high, and even songs not in one's favorite genre will be appreciated, simply because they're all catchy, interesting tunes. The multiplayer's fun, but lacks the chaoticness of the single player, since unless you hit an "autocatcher", the tracks never "lock". As a result, while the gameplay remains as fast and frenetic as the single player game (moreso, due to additional powerups, and ways to mess with your opponent), the audio component never reaches the sheer sonic density of the single player game. Overall, however, Frequency is a fantastic "remix" of the Beatmania concept. The simple yet enthralling visuals, and the additional gameplay elements create an experience that's both deeper and more interesting as Konami's DJ game, and just as fun to play.	1
I've never been a fan of rhythm type games but I checked this one out because I liked the music that came with it. It took about one hour for me to get used to the gameplay and objectives but since then I've been hooked. Graphics- The psychedelic background actually can get in the way of the gameplay because you get so distracted by it. Fortunately, there is a track without all the colorful shapes and images. Gameplay- There are three difficulty settings. Most people should not have any trouble with easy settings. It may take couple of hours to get the hang of normal setting. I have yet to start on expert mode. The challenge is to get the high score and unlock a new song for each round. Sound- Great. Most of the time, you're so focused on collecting the jewels that you won't realize what instrument you're on but everything sounds great.	1
graphics: nothing too special, what there is will mostly just keep the people watching entertained since the players will be transfixed by the game play.  Actually this is a game that is tough on the eyes of the players since blinking is actually difficult on many of the songs.  If you liked the graphics of whipeout or tempest these will be right up you alley. gameplay: you use the d-pad, 3 buttons and sometimes the left analog stick.  mostly you use 3 buttons to press in time with the beat.  by doing this you lay down one of 8 tracks (drum track, guitar track, vocal track for example).  Once you get it right for a while it continues to play without you freeing you to move on to the next track.  By completeing all the tracks you make the song sound how it was intended to.  It is very addictive and the quality of the music helps it be outstanding.  remix mode and multiplayer add to the replayability of the title.  It also scores high for originality since it IS different from anything else out there. Sound:  Id have to say this game has the best soundtrack of any game out at this point.  the entire game was built around the music and if you don't like the jungle brothers, no doubt, paul okenfeld, lo fidelity all stars, or powerman 3000 one of the other 12 or so artist will probably suit you fine. difficulty:  The game is actually pretty tough but has an excellent tutorial.  Id say it falls into the easy to learn hard to master area of games. Conclusion:  Buyers who enjoy puzzle games (this plays like one) or music, as well as those just looking for something different will be plenty impressed by this title.  Its only drawbacks are a tough difficulty level, and the whole dry eye problem.  This is a great leeper title that may get lost in the fray of metal gear solid and gran tourismo but it is a game that is worth adding to a collection and is easily the best music game for the ps2.	1
There aren't enough good things to say about this game. It's the video game equivalent of crack cocaine. In other words, you won't be able to stop playing it. The premise is simple (and isn't that the case with most great games?): you make your way down an octagonal tube. Each of the eight sides is a track of music. The 8 tracks together create a song in its totality. For example, track 1 is drums, 2 is bass, 3 is vocals etc etc. The goal is to set all tracks in motion to get the whole song playing. You do this by hitting buttons on the controller to match a sequence you see before you on the screen. Some are easy, some are very difficult and will require practice to perfect, but when you pull these off you'll come away with such a feeling of satisfaction. That's what makes great games great. The rewards. A music game is meaningless without great music, and this game has 25+ excellent tracks from real bands in many diverse types of music: Synthpop, Trance, Alt Rock, Prog Rock, Drum and Bass, Big Beat, Rap etc In addition to the main game I mentioned, it lets you manually recreate the tracks with your own bass lines, drum beats, synth stylings etc and then use them as in-game tracks. There's some really obvious and apparent blockbuster games out for the Playstation 2, but Frequency is what I'd classify as a sleeper hit. In other words its not a title you've probably heard much about, but what you have heard is more than likely great. Enjoy. I know I am.	1
This is a game to get! Graphics aren't really that great but the story line and the fact that you get to be all the people from show. Such as Moe Barney Grandpa Simpson people like that!!!  Buy this game its the BEST!!! Really if Im lieing Im dieing	1
What I meant by the title is that my little brother and I did not like this video game as much as Hit & Run. I give this 4 stars because the missions in Mission mode are too easy and there is only one music track in Sunday Drive mode. Sometimes I have problems with the controllers. I have to use controller 1 or controller 2...the game only accepts input from one controller at a time. However, in Road Rage mode, I do like the "safe trip" and "road rage" bonuses and how each character has his or her own unique vehicle. Overall, I think it was a pretty good video game and is sure to make a promising addition to your Simpsons collection.	1
Your favorite action hero is in his own video game! This game rules, I played it on a demonstrative center and its great. If you want a great beat'um up you'd better buy this game!	1
I received this game for Christmas, and it's one of the best games ever!! My family and I play this game all the time, the multiplayer is fun for the whole family! This game is very high in replay value, because you have to raise 1 million$ to buy back the bus system from Mr. Burns. Along the way, you'll be able to unlock new levels and cars. The city of Springfield is jam-packed with familiar locales, like The Simpsons house, Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Elementary, The Nuclear Power Plant, Springfield Mall, Krusty Burger, even Moe's ramshackled house, and many many many many more! You can fly through the streets, crashing cars and flipping them, drive off bridges and highways, run over pedestrians, smash through trees,mailboxes,playground equipment, even Groundskeeper Willy's shack, and practically anything you see. You can pick as your driver Homer,Marge,Bart,Lisa,Flanders,Moe,Snake,Rev. Lovejoy,Prof. Frink,Otto, and many more, who all have their signature cars, like Homer in the station wagon, Marge in the Canyonero, Otto in his bus, Snake in Lil' Bandit, Krusty in his clown car, Mr. Plow (Homer) in his snow plow, and Moe in his flower sedan. Everybody you see in the show is practically in the game, either as drivers, passengers, or pedestrians, and they all say hilarious phrases, like Homer saying "Did I do great or really great" or "D'oh!", Frink saying "There is so much driving, and crashing, and the hoy-glavin!" or "The collision! It hurts mee!"  and Moe saying "Hope you didn't puke" or "Ow! I sat on my 'roids!" which will keep you laughing the whole trip through town. This is immediatly worth buying, and no Gamecube owner should be without this game. BUY! IT! NOW!	1
Unless you're an abseloute die hard fan of the Simpsons, and you must have all the merchendise, skip this game.  There's nothing too special about it, and there are other games out there like it that are much better.  Even Crazy Taxi is better than this.  Not reccomended.	-1
Uh...Crazy Taxi? More like Lazy Taxi! Hahaha. Okay, that wasn't funny, but the game certainly is. Real character voices for everyone and the kind of thing you'd expect from the Simpsons. Some hings are just like the show. It's the kind of game that takes some time to beat, but lasts forever with a great two-player mode. And you've gotta love the other features, such as Sunday drive (playing for fun, not for points), and quick missions. Unquestionably the funniest video game ever.	1
Hi-Diddly-Ho There! Ned Flanders at your ser-viddly-ervice!!! The Game starts out with the Simpsons watching the news and they find out That Homer's boss, C. Montgomery Burns has bought the bus company and has made the buses radioactive. The citizens of Springfield won't stand for it. They are forced to turn their cars into cabs and boycott the buses, while collecting money to buy back the bus comnpany. This is one awesome game. If you're a big Simpsons fan, like me, you'll love this game. One strange thing about this game is that its just like Crazy Taxi in every way, except there is a primary objective that must be completed to beat the game, (collect a million dollars to buy back the bus company.) You can play with about eighteen characters and play on six levels. As far as game play goes, it is awesome. Graphics are phenominal and another cool thing is that the characters sound and look just as they do on the show. Here are the characters you can play with (their cars and best asset are also listed) Homer: Family Sedan  (All around) Marge: Convero  (All Turning) Bart: Soap Box Racer  (Acceleration) Lisa: Electric Car  (Acceleration) Grandpa: Go-Cart  (Speed) Professor Frink: Hover Car  (Best overall) (My Favorite!) Flanders: Station wagon  (All Around) Krusty the Clown: Clown Car  (Turning) Apu: Sports car  (Speed) Homer: Mr. Plow  (All Around) Snake:Lil' Bandit  (All Speed) Chief Wiggum: Cop Car  (Turning) Barney: Plow King  (All Power) Otto: School Bus  (Power) Moe: Sedan  (Turning) Groundskeeper Willie: Tractor  (Speed) Reverend Lovejoy: Book-Burning Mobile (Power) And Six Real Simpsons Boards: Evergreen Terrace  (Where The Simpsons live) Entertainment District(Where Moe's Tavern is) Springfield Dam Nuclear Power Plant  (Where Homer Works) Downtown Spring Field Montains There is only one flaw to this entire game, not all the characters in the Simpsons Show are involved in the game. other than that its perfect. So, what are you waiting for? Get it now! P.S. Vote Quimby!!!	1
this is a great game, it is fun and enjoyable to play, the gameplay and graphics are awesome, this is truley a great game	1
This game is actually fun. I've read the other reviews and I felt that I had to rebut them. If you like games like Grand Theft Auto Vice City, then this game would be below average. If you are looking for a game that is simple and fun, much like the old-school beat 'um ups, then this is a great game. There are no complex puzzles here. And there are no vast cities or levels here. It's just button-mashing like the good old days. So if you feel the urge to do some button-mashing to forget a stressful day at work then this one's for you. If you're a fan of Batman, then you should get this game. It is simple fun.	1
Batman Vengeance is a really good game, not great but really good.  However, the method for saving a game in progress is the worst.  You have to quit the game and then save it.  I have not played any game that had that kind of idiotic save method before.  No automatic saving in this game.  I had played this game the first day I got it for like six hours straight which is a lot for me because I am a busy man and it was extremely fun and exciting because of the great story, sound effects, and brilliant cutscenes.  If you are a fan of the animated batman series, then this game is for you.  A lot of interesting twists in story occur throughout this game, which I figured out from the beginning but still wanted to play through the game to see them unfold.  The battle against the joker is nothing short of spectacular even though it was quick and easy.  While Batman's skills in fisticuffs is okay and a bit sluggish at times and controls for cuffing people is somewhat troublesome and glitchy, the controls for using his weapons and utilities are quite good.  The fights are still fun and somewhat fun to watch, while jumping from rooftop to rooftop and down ladders is fantastic.  Note: I beat this game the third day I got it.  The only reason why it took three days is because of the bizarre save mechanism.  I had to play through the entire game all over on the third day for about 10-12 hours or so.  The way the joker behaves in this game is delightful because his behavior is a good match for him.  The cut scenes in this game are fantastic, but it is a short game with really close to nothing to replay it for except a second run through of the story.	1
Batman: Vengeance drops players into the universe from the popular animated shows. While this has been accepted as one of the better Batman-based video games, I found it a really frustrating experience. The game has its moments, but too many control issues killed the experience for me.  The main reason fans will want to pick this up is to hear the voice talent from the cartoon reprise their roles, including Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong, and Mark Hamil. The plot isn't terribly special - it tries to innovate in how it links all the villains together so that Batman can fight them, but it wouldn't be compelling without the voice cast backing it.  In fact, hearing the voice cast became my only incentive to get through the game. Batman is animated reasonably well, and Gotham is accurately (if blandly) modeled in 3D to match the look of the show. The combat system though, stinks. Batman has an arsenal of gadgets, but u have to switch into a clumsy first-person mode to use them. The c-stick isn't very good at precision aiming, making boss fights like Mr. Freeze and a helicoptor overly difficult. Batman is also rather easily beat up in a slugging match, despite his years of training. Thugs will often land the first punch, then punch you again as you get up, or corner you in a wall and keep you from retaliating. The constantly shifting camera doesn't help things either. Whats a good Batman game without a decent combat system?  In the end, I had much more fun with Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu, and even the much-hated Batman: Dark Tomorrow. Fans of the animated shows may want Vengeance just to hear the voice-acting. It's not really fun for anything else.	-1
Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. What a worthless game!  I totally love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. Batman: Vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. I really must stress how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color schemes fool you. I've seen better stuff on a Commodore 64.	-1
This is supposed to be the worst game of the year.  What a suprise.	-1
This game is great. Unlock missions and new characters and gain lots of money to buy back Springfield's transit system from ... Mr. Burns. You can also have a 2-player contest. The characters are hilarious. This game, like many, will entertain you for quite some time, but once you get everything done it will probably sit on your shelf.	1
this game is almost like crazy taxi. it is really fun and cool. this game is about the simpsons driving arond and picking people up and taking them to thier places. in the bengning bart is playing on video games. then homer comes in and says he wants to watch his tv. while there watching tv. a guy is saying that there are these buses that are killing everyone. so homer wants to do some thing about it. so you play chacters like bart,homer,lisa,marge,krusty,mr.plow,chief, and many others! so this game is really great.	1
This game is sooooooooo fun! You need to colect one million$ by delivering passengers to their locations. The money is to buy back Burns' flet of radioactive buses. It has 6 large neiborhoods, and there are at least 20 places in each level. The drivers are so funny. People say it is repetive. That is only if you use the same driver on the same level ever time. Chief Wiggum says "dont sit on my gun!" and "i'd tell you to buckle up, but someone stole the seat belts" There are tons of lines from every character and cool cars. I don't know if there are cheats or not, but after you beat all the missions, you get a special car made for Homer. There are seasonal characters, like new years Krusty and thanksgiving Marge. The game can be beaten in about a week, but is still loads of fun. The first 4 missions are so easy it is almost a joke. Missions # 8 and 10 are the only hard ones. The graphics are amazing, and the voices sound authentic. The whole game has that "cartoonie" look to it. You can make a lot more money on hard than easy. Unless you really, really hate the simpsons, get this game. I had never watched the simpsons before, and i loved this game. This game has some mild profanity, like "I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? " and "damn straight!". Grandpa says "where are you taking me, to hell?!" This just adds to the fun of the game. There are some shortcuts, and passageways to help you get there faster. The faster you get there, the bigger the tip. If there is at least 35% of the trip timer left when you arrive, you get a *fast* rating, 20-35% of the timer will get you a *average* rating, and less than 20% will give a *slow* rating. At the end of each Road Rage, you get a rating on how much money you earned the ratings go like this Loser:$0 Grandma:$1 to $999 Timid: $1000 to $2999  Destructive: $3000 to $4999 (if you get less than $5000 you need a lot of practice) Reckless:$5000 to $6999 Insane: $7000 to $9999 Speed Freak:$10,000 to 12,499 Gazelle:$12,500 to $14,999 Madman:$15,000+ There are also Road Rage trips, this is where a passenger tells you to run over so many things before you get them to their destination. If you succeed, you get a $1000 bonus plus the tip and earnings. Safe Trips is where a passenger tells you to not hit any more than 2 cars before you get them to their destination. You get a $250 bonus on these. Knocking over bus stops gives you an extra 2 seconds on your overall timer. there is also Head to Head.this is when 2 players face off in  one of the 4 districts. there is one passenger out at a time and the 2 players race to pick up the person. If player 1 has the passenger, player 2 can bump into the opponent to "steal" the passenger. the first player to get the person to the destination gets a $1000 fare. the first person to get 5, 10, or 15,000$ wins. its the most fun i ever had i would get the game for just this. No matter what system you own, this is a must-buy.	1
This game is the best batman game ever made. ive played it for ps2 but it is not the same as gamecubes version. This game played on Gamecube is hot it has really  good graphics, batman looks so real. this game is a good action and adventure. you should really buy if u don't u don't know what ur missing!!!!!!!	1
I just got a game cube for christmas in which case i got two games tony hawk's pro skater 3 and Luigies mansion. I found Tony Hawks 3 quite good and Luigies mansion OK. Then at the beggining of January I got Super Smash bros. Melee Which was like the best game ever in my opinion. At the end of January I got Simpsons Road rage. There are only 2 good things about this game. Nmb1. The Graphics are great like all gamecube games. Nbm2. It's a good Multyplayer game. Now I have 7 reasons not to buy the game Nmb1. There are only six levels. Nmb2. After you complete the game nothing happens. Nmb3. There's no story line. Nmb. 4 You can Only Play Up to 2 players. Nmb5. If it's basicly a remake of Crazy Taxi. Nmb6. I beat the game in 2 hours. Nmb7. After 2 days you'll just be trying to sell it.	-1
OK this game has one of the best licences out there. Most people love the Simpsons and it's great to see it in a game after a long absence. The game copies Crazy Taxi in every way but doesn't do it nearly as well. Springfield is reconstructed quite well but there just isn't enough variety in the locations at all. The first time u pick up a passenger u will enjoy the ride and the one-liners from the show but soon they will get annoying. The game just stays the same all the way: Pick up passenger and drop him/her off. There is no variety at all. And also the car handles a bit crap and it's not much fun driving around after a few days. Worth a rent only.	-1
This is a good game to start off with on Gamecube.  I just got my Gamecube and this is the first game I got.  I love it.  It helps that I am a Simpson's fan but I believe that everybody would like this game.  Even if you just watched maybe 2 or 3 episodes.  The main part of the game is Road Rage.  The goal is to get 1 million $'s.  It is really fun because everytime you hit a certain cash goal you win a prize, like a new character or a new starting location.  The cool thing is you pick.  The other cool part of this game is Mission Mode.  There are 10 in all and at the end you win a certain prize(I won't ruin it for u), basically there are different missions such as knocking all of the newspaper stands down and then on the 10th mission you meet Mr. Burns himself.  Personally, I like this game a lot.  It does have some similarities to Crazy Taxi but in Simpson's there is actually a way to beat the game(getting 1 million $.) In Crazy Taxi there was no way to beat the game.  Also, mission mode has almost nothing in common with Taxi.  The Head to Head Mode(multiplayer) is also really fun.  You can set the goal to 5K, 10k, or 15k.  For each person you drop off you get 1k.  One of the players picks the person up and tries to get the chararcter to it's destination while the other tries to follow the car and smash into it to steal the passenger.  It's very cool.  This game does have some bugs to work out like long loading times but it is all worth it.  That's why I give it a 4.  If I could have I would've put 4 and a half.	1
Batman Vengeance has made history. The best of all the Batman games put together! The second best superhero game next to Spider-Man and Spider-Man:Enter Electro. The plot twists in the game were very well put together. The only downside is the horrible control. For example, right when you're going to jump from a building to another is impossible. Than, of course, comes the satisfying KER-SPLAT when he comes face to concrect. The Joker (no surprise) is the head honco for the game. Hopefully, the next sequel will fix this problem and have another excellent plot along with the camera.	1
This game is not kiddy. It is full of action. Crime is everywhere in Gotham City and you have to use the Batmobile and an assortment of other machines and weapons to kick the criminals butt. Use hundreds of great moves to catch the bad guys. If your thinking "Oh great it's a kiddy game" no way. I personally love using high-tec machinery to kick some butt. I don't know many people who don't.	1
The title says it all. This game is a fun, action-packed adventure that brings the animated series to life on your tv. This game promises to look and play better on GameCube than on other systems, because it runs at a constant 60 fps (frames per second) which makes the animation appear smoother. The developers also added some extra graphics effects that weren't possible on Xbox or PS2, such as volumetric (more realistic) fog and smoke. This game will not disappoint Batman fans!	1
I love this game! It is so addictive and you can't get tired of it. I know I am probably the only gamer in America who has NEVER played Crazy Taxi, but I always hear people compraing The Simpsons Road Raget to it. I almost bought Crazy Taxi when it did come out for GameCube, but then I heard about this game. I am the biggest Simpsons fan in the world and when I heard people saying it was Crazy Taxi with a Simpsons twist, so I figured I could kill two birds with one stone. I am just absolutly addicted to this game. Huge environments, tons of Springfieldian drivers (not to mention the special ones that only appear for a holiday), and real Simpsons voices. Simply an awsome game. I guess I sould try Crazi Taxy some day. Some day...	1
I think the simpsons are awesome. I think Crazy Taxi is fun. Combine them and you get a good game. The storyline is good. The game is fun and has excellent replay value. The graphics are not so good. Don't listen to the reviews that say this game is horrible. For those who don't like Crazy Taxi just rent this game. As for those who enjoyed Crazy Taxi tis is a must buy.(...)	1
I own FIFA, and it is one of the best realistic sports game ive ever played. The game cube version has way better graphics than the ps2 version. There faces There faces looooook sooooo real in this game , an in the backround u can see the crowds getting crazy and they start singing . some times this game makes me laugh, when you make a goul the players jump in the air and do crazy stuff besides that. so u should really get this game youll have a blast if u dooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
This is the game that will change your opinion about soccer! This game has the best graphics ever made for a Fifa game! The game itself is amazing and its worth buying. If you are a Fifa fan this game is totally for you!	1
I found this game to be incredibly boring.	-1
Product as described, quick delivery!	1
Came in perfect condition, great game	1
Surprised to find this game brand NEW and in original packaging for this price... thought it was too good to be true but it plays terrific on my 10 year old PS2!	1
Super fun!	1
What an adventure. The nostalgia was overwhelming.	1
Note: This review was written as if it was just released  3D platformers are a relatively new gaming genre. Although it didn't start the actual genre, Super Mario 64 is considered the father of 3D platform games and started the craze that led to many imitations and several successful games. 3D platforming stemmed off from the extremely successful, arguably the most of any video game genre, 2D platform gameplay. However, it wasn't as easy as just switching to 3D. Several mechanics had to be changed, such as jumping. Characters didn't just jump straight; characters could jump in any direction. Super Mario 64 acknowledged these problems and worked around them to create one of the most popular and successful sub-genres in all of video game history. I am happy to say that Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy has come very close to perfecting this genre.  What This Game is All About:  The game is started out by having the player listen to what sounds like an older man questioning the world he lives in and how it came to be. He then starts to say that he feels that the answers are intertwined with a young boys destiny and how this boy is reckless (pfftteenagers). The boy, whose name is Jak, is with his friend Daxter on a boat. They are heading to an island that Daxter claims they weren't supposed to go to. Long story short, they go there, they run into trouble, Daxter gets turned into an Ottsel (a mix between an otter and weasel), they go back to their place, and they end up finding out that the only way to change Daxter back is to find a sage who lives far to the north. So, they begin their adventure.   The playable character is Jak, with Daxter sitting on his shoulder. In a brief training level, they find out about several items that they must collect: Power Cells, Precursor Orbs, and Scout Flies. Power Cells are the main collectible in the games, similar to the Stars in Super Mario 64. They get these for completing tasks, such as helping a farmer herd his Yakows into his fence to finding one in a secret room that can only accessed with the correct Eco (the games version of power-ups). There are about one-hundred Power Cells in the game. Precursor Orbs are far more abundant (there are two-thousand of these suckers) and are a currency used in the game to obtain Power Cells off of certain characters in the game. Scout Flies are artificial scouting creatures created by one of the protagonists who help them throughout the game. They have been trapped and there are exactly seven in each level; finding all seven will yield one of the many Power Cells. Basically, the characters use these Power Cells to power zoomers (similar to the ones in Return of the Jedi) and cross deadly lava pits or canyons. These are necessary to progress throughout the game. Those are the collectibles of the game, so lets get down to the gameplay.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is obviously one of the biggest reasons someone may want to play this game. Let me just say, it doesnt disappoint. Being a platforming game, one of the most important functions of the game is the ability to not only jump, but to be able to do it with ease and grace, while still making the player feel in control. It mostly succeeds in that goal. There were a few times when I felt I jumped correctly, but the landing wasn't where I expected it to be, however, those instances were rare and they don't detract from the game. Playing as Jak is also one of the smoothest game experiences ever; he moves so easily and stops as soon as I let go of the analog stick. The game has very responsive controls, to be blunt about it.   For the mission objectives, they are varied and done with style. One mission had me get ambushed by Lurkers, the main enemy group of the game, while another had me try to defeat a giant, evil plant. Those are the action goals. Others are more platforming focused, such as climbing a huge underground site, with several obstacles and poles to swing from. There are also several minigames, all of which are fun and engaging. One of these minigames had me catching two-hundred pounds of fish for a local fisherman, and it made me focus, but it wasn't frustrating. Another gameplay mechanic is the zoomer and Flut-Flut. The former is what it sounds like and it controls pretty well, but it isn't the best to handle, but that adds to the feel. The Flut-Flut, on the other hand, is a giant, bird-like creature that Jak rides in a similar manner to how Mario rides Yoshi; the bird even has a flutter jump. The bird is probably my favorite aspect of the game, gameplay-wise. It, like Jak, controls very well and it also isn't overused, so it was a treat for the few times I got to use it. Jak must, however, have to complete a certain mission before using it.   Eco is the games versions of power-ups. They grant Jak temporary powers that can be used to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and just be awesome. Green Eco heals Jak, Blue Eco gives him speed and access to open/activate certain areas of the game, Yellow Eco allows him to shoot fiery Eco blasts, and Red Eco makes Jak stronger. These different types of Eco are used throughout the game to help Jak on his quest and are really fun to use. As a side note, Dark Eco is bad.   Despite my almost-complete positive outlook on the gameplay so far, it isn't perfect. As stated above, the jumps don't quite work always, but I feel that way with all platformers, so that may be me and not the game. Also, the camera doesnt always line up correctly, so a few jumps may get missed due to that reason. This next reason isn't really a complaint, but just something that needs to be said: the game doesnt add much new to the platforming category, but just refines several of its attributes.   There are two ideas that were implemented into the game that, although not noticeable at first, make a huge difference when another game is played. The first idea is that there is almost zero loading. The game has very, very brief loading when the game data is saved and loaded, but that is it. There is no loading between levels, although there are a couple levels that are up a mountain or across water and requires slight waiting. Other than those couple instances, there is no loading. It is a beauty to be able to travel through a seamless, connected world. The game really is just one, big level. It may seem trivial, but the next time that another game is played, Ill remember. There are also warp gates to travel to a previous home-area (they have no enemies and are in the middle of the action levels, as I call them), so the player doesnt have to find a way all the way back.   The other idea is that when Jak dies, your Ottsel friend, Daxter, says a hilarious comment. These can range from How am I gonna get changed back now! to Hey, Jak! Can I have your insect collection? There are probably a good fifteen of these death scenes and they are extremely funny and can lighten the mood if it felt like a cheap death. Also, whenever Jak gets a Power Cell, Daxter does a funky dance and these are nice to see. There are probably fifteen of these, too.   Overall, the gameplay is exemplary and does a magnificent job of keeping true to the formula of 3D platformers. It may not be new, but the refinement level is top-notch.  Story:  The story doesnt get into much detail (most platformers dont), but it has hilarious moments thanks to the character interaction. Daxter is probably one of the funniest video game characters that I have ever seen, and most of the funny scenes involve him in some way. What the game doesnt have in story, it makes up for with witty character dialogue.  Design:  The worlds are designed in one the most amazing ways possible. This is a living, breathing world. It also shows what the PS2 is truly capable of doing with graphics. These are probably some of the best graphics out there on any video game console, as of 2001.  Sound:  The sound effects are pleasing to hear and the music is very well done. The music that plays when Jak receives a Power Cell lets the player know that he or she just accomplished something. The level music is also very relatable to the level itself. Im not a music expert, but when I see a green and brightly colored land, I think happy. The game executes music sounding like what a level looks like very well.  Difficulty:  One of the major qualms that some people may have with the game, is the difficulty. To most people, they would probably find it to be exceptionally easy, especially if they have played several 3D platformers and have become very adept. I didn't have a problem with it, because I felt it fit with the game. It is a very relaxing experience and although platformer masters may not find it appealing, they would be foolish to ignore the game because of that.  Replay Value:  This is the heart-breaker of the deal. The game is very short. The game could be beaten in less than six hours. I fully beat it in about ten hours and wasn't rushing nor taking in every little detail to the game. I do recommend replaying the game not only because it is great, but because I feel that it would be good for speed-runs, even if that wasn't an intention. It is easy enough for most gamers and could pose a challenge for masters who want extremely fast times. For those who aren't interested, it is still more than worthy for a single playthrough.  Final Judgment:  This game is RECOMMENDED. Although there are a few gameplay mechanics that irk me at times, they don't detract from the overall experience. It is a short game, but amusement can be found in replaying for speed runs or just because it is enjoyable and downright funny. At the very least, the game should be rented and played through once. Then, a decision can be made on whether it should be bought. I, personally, am happy that what feels like an end to the 3D platforming age is going out with a very high-quality game. FINAL SCORE= 9.25	1
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is brought to you by Naughty Dog, the same company that made Crash Bandicoot. I really loved Crash Bandicoot so I figured I'd purchase this game and try it out. Wow, there is a reason why this is a PS2 "Greatest Hits" game, it's lots of fun!  You play as the protagonist Jak, a teenage boy, who tries to help his friend Daxter after he transforms into an ottsel (a fictional hybrid of an otter and a weasel). The primary objective of the game is to stop Gol and Maia from flooding the world with Dark Eco while also trying to change Daxter back to his old self. The main objects in Jak and Daxter are Power Cells, which are used to energize machinery to reach new levels. They can be earned in many ways, such as fighting enemies or performing tasks for other characters. In the end you'll need to collect all 101 for a cutscene that ties into the sequel very nicely.  The controls are pretty intuitive and the game itself is pretty straight forward in communicating the mission objectives. It offers a large range of missions and minigames that the player must complete to proceed. The graphics are top notch, some of the best graphics I've seen on a PS2 game. Very clear with lots vibrant colors. The soundtrack wasn't bad either. Since I don't have a lot of free time it took me a while to finish the game. But hey, who wants a short game anyways?   Overall, I believe this is a must have game for the PS2. Highly recommended!	1
Great game. Shipped fast. Well worth buying.	1
I am really glad to see some great soccer on the Gamecube. Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 editions were not very good, so this is easily a pleasent surprise. The shoulder buttons and comfortable controller work great, making al controls work really well. The gameplay is alos excellent, and it gives the player full control of what is going on in the field. My only complaint is that it can get bland after playng it for a while, but it is the best soccer game excluding the upcoming 2002 Fifa World Cup.	1
FUN...FUN...FUN. A VERY NICE GAME, WITH A FUN RING TO IT. A SOCCER FAN WILL ENJOY IT, A SOCCER HATER WILL ENJOY IT,ANYBODY WILL. FUN GAME, BUY IT! GREAT GRAHICS AFTER A GOAL... TOMSHADY8	1
Played this game as a kid and now my nephew is loving it as much as I did! thank you.	1
I think I first played this game when I was twelve, and now, ten years later, it's still one of my favorites. The art is interesting and all of the Precursor equipment in particular has always fascinated me. You can play this game over and over because it's just that good. It's easy to learn, easy to play, and has quite a few memorable moments. There's just something about this game that will keep you entertained and then make you come back!	1
I love this game I played it in 2011 and my brother got this January 27 2004 and he played it. I like Jak's moves and I gives this a 6 stars out of 5 and I beat the game Monday.	1
SEGA SPORT NFL 2K2 is a excellent!!! football game on the game system I give it 5 Stars "Highly Recommended" to buy this game call SEGA SPORTS NFL 2K2 for the game system	1
NFL2K2 was a great game on the Dreamcast, and the Dreamcast is no where near as powerful as the Xbox will be. A great franchise, a great system, what could go wrong???	1
The first game I ever demoed on the Xbox was NFL Fever at one of those kiosks in Best Buy.  I thought NFL Fever was pretty cool but it didn't make me want to buy it that instant.  For months after Xbox was released, I read reviews, watched videos and looked at screenshots of Madden & NFL Fever, trying desperately to decide between the two.  Meanwhile, a third football game comes on the market.  They did  a decent job with 2K1, the videos looked tremendous, and people were pretty optimistic about 2K2.  This long time fan of EA Sports (NHL, FIFA, & Triple Play) decided to abandon Madden and give Sega a try. I am still blown away each time I play this game.  I am so glad I decided to wait.  I can't speak for Madden, but every aspect of 2K2 seems to be slightly to much better than NFL Fever.  The graphics are lifelike, commentary is colorful and insightful, and the gameplay is the best.  You can actually have a decent running game in NFL2K2, which has historically been tough to do in football games.  How about an example that illustrates just how awesome this game is?  I fumbled on the 20 yard line, picked up the fumble, and my running back takes it in to the end zone for a TD.  The announcers actually made JOKES about how this could have been a designed play.  I got a delay of game on the extra point because I sat there with my mouth agape.  Even the instant replays are better than any other game I've seen.  They swivel 360 degrees on catches and sometimes clip together several segments from different angles. I also wanted to take a sec to respond to a few of the negative reviews about this game.  Someone commented that it is a strange menu interface.  Different yes, strange no.  It isn't that hard to get used to.  It doesn't take any longer to cycle through menus than other games.  Regarding the other review listing a number of negative things... I question this person's authenticity, as they wrote their review well before the release date of this game.  Perhaps they are reviewing 2K1?  It is simply not true that there aren't big hit replays, but they must be on a big play (sacks, 4th down stops).  Players DO grip the ball well, the best I've seen to date.  And as far as the comment regarding no helmet popping hits... perhaps you need to learn where the turbo and tackle buttons are, because my controller rattles non-stop when I'm on D. Get this, and prepare to be blown away.  Now, my season calls...	1
I played 2k1 I enjoyed alot I felt there is more things to chouse form .In maden they made you chouse what type of of play you are going to do if what to chouse a diffent play There not be able to change or know to but I only 2player on maden .In 2k1 you can also make up your own plays .I don't think you can in maden .I feel there a lot more do in 2k2 than maden .I think the 2k sries invented realic foot ball video game .	1
This is a game on the PS2 that rivals other platforming greats like Mario and Sonic! Jak and Daxter The Precursor Legacy has some great platforming, as well as a fun story, good gameplay, great presentation, and generally good level design. Jak and Daxter has really simple, yet fun gameplay that is pretty unique. Jak and Daker both combine their personal skills to traverse their world, and it's really fun. There are many side quests involving getting power cells from NPC's, basically jiggies or stars from other platformers. It's pretty cool. Daxter is also a highlight, since he is just fricking hilarious. This game in total is just a fun time, that's great for all ages!	1
Description is very accurate, Shipping on time, love the product.	1
Love this good ol game	1
Jak and Daxter is a fun 3d platform game that harkens to some of the great well known 3d platformers such as Mario 64. The colors are vibrant, and the environments are eye catching. Jak is easy to control, although I can't say the same for his zoomer. Collecting the precursor orbs encourages you to explore the environment. You are not able to save any progress in your game, however, without collecting a power cell. Some power cells are easy to obtain, and some are a pain. You need to collect at least one hundred to have the good ending. You need to collect EVERYTHING to get the secret ending. I enjoyed this game so much, that I bought the Jak and Daxter sequels as well.	1
I finally got my hands on this game and I must say it was well worth the money. Recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the series.	1
C'mon. Explain to me how I'm supposed to say a word against this game. It's freakin' Castlevania.  As such, fans of the series have probably long since bought this and played it to death, so I would like to speak here to those of you who know not of the Castlevanias of old. If you can't be bothered to do the truly right thing, purchase a stack of orphaned systems and play the four or five Castlevanias every self-respecting gamer ought to have enjoyed, grab Chronicles at its bargain price and find out what you were missing while you were still belting your kindergarten classmates upside the head. Hopefully my optimism holds true, and a good game is indeed eternal.	1
The first Castlevania game I ever played was IV on the SNES back in 1992. I became a fan and even went as far as buying an old NES to just play the first three. As fun as the new Castlevania LOS and the 3D PS2 releases are, I'll always have a special affinity for the retro 2D classics. Castlevania Chronicles takes elements from I, III, and IV to present entertaining, albeit slightly outdated, gameplay, graphics and sound. I say outdated considering Castlevania IV came out in 1991 on the SNES with Simon able to whip in 8 directions and swing over chasms along with some very creative levels which utilized the SNES' scaling FX chip. Chronicles came out two years later in 1993, yet Simon can only whip in 5 directions (horizontal, down-horizontal, and straight down) and there is no swinging ability. The graphics also took a step backwards, yet nothing too drastic. Even with enhanced graphics via the arranged mode, IV looks and plays better. I figure it's due to Chronicles originally being released on a system that did not have the same capabilities as the SNES, so the discrepancies are forgivable. It's just too bad the Konami didn't beef it up with more than just a few improvements in the graphics and music for the PSX release in 2001. Still, this game should be a part of every Castlevania fan's library, if not of every retro gamer's. The graphics are not too much of an eyesore, the music is great, and the gameplay is fantastically fun. There is a great variety of enemies to battle and the levels have that classic Castlevania creativity. I've read some reviews that it is a more difficult game. But if you're a Castlevania vet, it's nothing you can't handle. Even in hard mode, I'd say it has about the same difficulty as Dracula X.	1
This game is the orginal Castlevania released in Japan only until now.  Rare and out of print, this edition bring to light the inspiration for the old 8-bit NES classic that we all grew to love.  Anyone who doesn't see this is too young to know that Castlevania and probably has no respect for that old 2-D game.  Anyone who loved it or grew up playing it will find the orginal Japanese and even the UPdated Arranged Mode (there are 2 versions on the CD) refreshing.  You get the oringal with all the orginal aspects and the updated with breathtaking opening and closing movies.  A true Gem for the Belmont in every True Castlevania fan.  Everyone else step aside and let the true gamers of the old school enjoy something grand.  [...]	1
The main issue people take with Castlevania Chronicles is that it's "old." Well, it's actually the newest CD-ROM format Castlevania game to date besides the Castlevania and Contra collection. Har har, very funny. Despite the new packaging, though, it is indeed a game released in 1993 for a system that very few people outside of Japan own, the Sharp x68000 series computer. It is not just any old game, though: it is generally acknowledged by gamers inside Japan as "Game of the Year" for that system. There are two basic modes for the game: Original and Advanced (nevermind that an interview with the developer, Igarashi, is included here in the US and European PAL version but not in the Japanese release from a short while before ours). Original is just what you expected it to be (until I change gears, assume I'm talking only about Original mode). The game plays just as it did on the original system, with the same graphics, three different MIDI soundtracks (each with their own, uh, style) and the same incredibly challenging difficulty. The difficulty in Original mode approaches or even surpasses that of Super Ghouls n' Ghosts...I haven't gotten past level 5 in the original game without some serious use of, ahem, some serious savestates. On the plus side, the game saves after each level so you don't have to go over it again. These graphics are extremely good for the era. The Sharp x68000 series had arcade-perfect translations of many classic arcade games from Alien Syndrome to Strider and beyond, so if you're a fan of that era's graphics you should certainly at least look up some screenshots. There is a good deal of original music here--a really funky remix of Castlevania's Stage 1 music (Vampire Killer) follows the great intro cutscene, "Something Loopy" as a great name entry tune, and then the new stuff. Completely new compositions mixed in with older tunes are found here: we see "Thrashard In the Cave" [seen as it was originally spelt, crazy people], a really moody piece, "Creatures in the Depth" for boss music, "Tower of Gears," "Moon Fight," "The Tower of Dolls," and "Etude for the Killer" are seen for the first time. It's not every day you get to see "Wiched Child" [again, sic] in the sound test, but be assured this is an excellent and moody rendition of the song. Now Arranged Mode improves dramatically on the music for the most part at the cost of introducing a lot of "noise." There is now an increased use of reverb and true instruments, but here we also see some excessive use of twinkly little sounds and other musical tomfoolery as well. The "noise" and sometimes overbearingly dramatic style of the remixes may drive you off at first. Overall, it's a lot less pleasant on the ears than the original MIDI music, but regardless of volume shifts you may get used to it. Make sure you get to the last level in Arrange mode, though! The final boss music is among the best reworking of an original Castlevania score seen yet. Getting there shouldn't be too hard either, thanks to the improved difficulty level and different difficulty levels. There ARE a couple dramatic reworkings of the game's design, however: The original game had a brown-shaded Simon in keeping with the visual style of the original game's, and Dracula looked right out of an old 1930's Universal picture. In THIS game, these character designs have been reworked by Castlevania's current character artist, Ayami Kojima--a bit too serious and odd looking for my taste, especially with Simon's apparently pink hair ingame (the cover art shows him with very red hair, as you see here in the game's icon--before he bleached it, apparently). Also, the original game was played on a square screen. When this is emulated, people seem to try to stretch it out to a rectangle--rather fat looking characters result. From the screenshots I've seen of Chronicles, this same problem is evident. That said, Chronicles originally was a steal. If you're into collecting, be assured that this game will eventually command high prices thanks to the limited run. If you just want to play one of the last old-school Castlevania games, I can't think of a better place to look. Yes, even with LoI out, I still say that.	1
I have been a castlevania chronicals fan from the beginning and I was very disappointed by this game. Past games - even on sega genesis - were better looking and more difficult to play. I was surprised that they would release a game these days which was such a poor quality of graphics and design. It looks more like a mock up of idea's for the castlevania SOTN rather than it's own game. Dont waste time with this one.	-1
Great game. Lots of fun to play. Brings back lots of memories.	1
MY CHILDHOOD IS COMPLETE ONCE MORE!! I loved this game and I had it back when I was what, 7-10? Im 20 now and I just found out they have a Jak and Daxter 2 and 3... Guess where my money is going!	1
ahhh memories.	1
This is a great classic game for the PS2 my opinion they don't make games from the game play perspective anymore like this.	1
great	1
I had to buy this game, since my bro let me have Jak 2 and 3 and since I beat them both, I wanted to know how did thks all started, so I bought it, played it, and loved it :D I got a 100% on the game and I hope Jak 4 comes out soon D:	1
Jak and Daxter the Precursor Legacy is the first game in the Jak Trilogy, I have already reviewed the 2nd and 3rd game, but now it's time to talk about the original. The story is a bit weak, but it doesn't need to be. Basically Jak and Daxter go to some Island and they aren't supposed to, so they get caught and Daxter falls into a vat of dark Eco, and he turns into a Orange Meer cat or something. So it's up to Jak and Daxter to figure out how to get him back to his usual self, but of course, theirs problems. I really can't get over the  character design looking at it over ten years later, but meh. The gameplay in the game is a lot like Mario, basically the stars in this game are called Power Cells, and to go to the next specific area you'll usually have to have a certain amount of power cells. There are 101 Power Cells in the game, and this and Sly Cooper and the Thevius Racconus are the only games I have 100% completion on. There are also eco's in the game, and there are Sages for each of those Eco's. The blue makes Jak go fast, The Red make you stronger, Green gives you health, and yellow allows you to shoot eco out of your fists. There are a load of mini games aswell. In this game Jak doesn't have a voice actor, he makes sounds when he gets hurt he does make sounds.   Overall I don't think I have any complaints with this game, it is a great classic game, the graphics are beautiful, it features day to night transition, there is no reason not to go get this right now if you own a PS2.	1
amazing find, great price... cute characters and story line.  Love easy controls and tutorial.  Fun for all ages.  cute storyline.	1
If you like Naughty Dog you will like this game. It has just the right amount of movie parts to gameplay. Its Jak And Daxter, need I say more?	1
Great!	1
This game is so much fun, theres lots to collect, tons to do, an interesting story, different gameplays, and an amazing world to explore. This just the beginning of a crazy story thats posed as a platformer, racer, and puzzle solving. The bosses are epic and powers are tricky. This game has it all or almost, but the sequels make up for anything missing. Must have to start of this epic tale	1
The start of an amazing video game series; if you like platform adventure games, Jak & Daxter is a no-brainer for you.	1
Start of great franchise and also in my opinion a great start point for any video game player who wants to improve their skills or who wants to begin to play well as this game to just complete requires aptitude with the controller. To get all of the power cells and precursor orbs requires a player with mastery of the controls, amazing reaction time, and the mind of a strategist. Ok exaggerating a little but it really is a good leaping point for those who want to become proficient in gaming.	1
I've nothing fancy to say other than my childhood is restored. And I apparently need nine more words. Banana Dinosaur.	1
I love this video game! It is one of the best quest games I have ever played in my life! It reminds me a lot of the Banjo- Kazooie games! I like the tropical first part of the land, the geography, the lurkers, even the comedy within the game! I wish there were more games like this! I do admit, I wish Jak would talk, and that the game were a little longer, but it is still a great quest game!	1
If I were still a kid, this game would be heaven. My adult self is very close to feeling that way. The game has a character who controls very well, a camera that rarely causes problems, practically no load times, and gameplay sequences that blend together very well. Naughty Dog slowly introduces the player to Jak and Daxter's world before increasing the challenge level, and even then the game is never frustrating. What the kid in me loves most of all is the smart-mouthed character, Daxter, who is just as loveable as similar characters such as Donkey in Shrek. Naughty Dog wisely includes elements that both children and adults will find appealing.  The game's world is pretty to look at and stretches as far as the horizon. Visually it is very nice to look at. The screenshots, of course, look great, but they're nothing compared to seeing the game in motion. Everything comes to life. To add to that, the game moves seamlessly due to the lack of load screens that generally bog down post-cartridge game consoles.  The game has a nice variety of gameplay styles. Along with the running and jumping that comes with the platformer genre, there are vehicular sections, some fun moments with the "eco" you can power yourself up with, some fishing, and more. Each section is well done. The eco is an important part of the game, and there are four types: green, blue, red, and yellow. Green refills your life, and in one section it plays another neat role. The blue increases your speed, triggers certain platforms, and also attracts collectible items to you. Red increases your strength and reaching distance, handy for situations with hard-to-hit little buggers. And yellow causes you to be able to fire out some yellow eco balls, and, of course, these sections are very fun and cool.  The main problem I have with Jak and Daxter is it's length. I like my adventure games to be of a good length of maybe, 20 or so hours. This cuts that in half, giving you a 10-hour adventure, which is a shame. I wish it was at least three times that long. My other real problem is the occasional annoying track on the soundtrack. In some areas, the music is a bit annoying. Otherwise, though, the music is superb.  This is a rare example of a game that is lots of fun without feeling the need to increase its challenge to such a high level that you're pulling your hair out. It takes some real skill to make a game like this, and I wish there were more like it. It's unfortunate that the later outings in the series turn into more serious ventures, becoming dark and broody games rather than bright and cheery ones like this. I guess that's what gamers are looking for nowadays.	1
You're going to want to buy this game! Hours upon hours of gameplay mix with fun characters,beautiful graphics an intricate world and clever missions to provide a legendary game. Jak and Daxter is a game for any gamer, from beginner to experienced, young to old, anybody would like this game. The gameplay is so varied that you never get bored, there is always something new and challenging to be done. The only problem with this game is that it can be TOO FUN and you might lose out on getting work accomplished or keeping up with the wife. =) Excellent game.	1
This is one of my favorite games of all time.  There's just so much I love about it, but let's start off with the story.  In this game, Jak and Daxter wander off to Misty Island, where Daxter falls into a pit of a dangerous substance called Dark Eco and gets turned into an ottsel (a weasel/otter).  They go to Samos the Sage for help, who tells them that another sage, Gol, is the only person who might be able to help.  But, he lives far away, so Jak and Daxter journey north to find him.  Along the way, they find out about an evil plot involving Lurkers, Dark Eco, and old Precursor technology...  This game is a lot of fun.  I've played it so many times, but I still can't get enough of it.  It's challenging, but not too hard.  And though it's not super long, there is a lot to do.  The game consists of exploring different areas, such as a jungle, a cave, or an underwater Precursor city and collecting Precursor Orbs and Power Cells.  Power Cells are used to progress in the game.  Much of the gameplay consists of exploring and platforming, but there are other things to make things more interesting.  For one thing, Jak can use different kinds of Eco.  Blue Eco makes him move fast and allows him to activate Precursor technology.  Yellow lets him shoots yellow balls to destroy stuff, and Red makes him extra strong.  There are also a couple places Jak can ride the A-GraV Zoomer (it's kind of like a floating motorcycle with a big propeller and no wheels), which I always found fun (and the rumble in the controller makes it feel more real).  The gameplay in this game is great, but a lot of games have fun gameplay.  It's a lot of extra stuff that makes this game so wonderful.  The plot's somewhat interesting, though I'll say no more so I don't spoil anything.  The levels look very nice and much of the character design is pretty good.  And the characters and the voice acting are great.  This game has some really fun characters and some very entertaining cut scenes.  I remember the first time I ever played this game, I was surprised at how fun even the minor characters were.  This game can just be hilarious at times (and anyone familiar with the series knows how fun Daxter can be, though he can also be a bit annoying at times).  I like the animation, as well.  The characters just seem to move in a more realistic way than I've seen in other games.  The way Jak moves is so fluid and natural, and the way he even keeps walking in place a short time after he stops running makes him seem more real.  I love extra details like that.  This game also has no loading.  It is one, huge world, and you can look into the distance and see places far away that you've been to earlier.  I love looking at the view as time changes from day to night and back again.  There are also, in a way, never walls or anything.  In essence, you can swim out into the ocean and never run into an invisible wall like in other games (well, because a Lurker shark will eat you before then).  All this combines to make a world that feels very real.  I've always felt so at home in it.  The music is also nice.  It can get forgotten a bit easier than the music of other games, but it also never gets in the way at all.  It complements the areas well without ever being distracting.  My main complaint with the game is the health.  Jak only has three units of health, and to restore a unit, he needs 50 little balls of Green Eco or one big one, so it can take a long time to restore his health.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, it is short.  While there are 101 Power Cells and 2000 Precursor Orbs, it can still be beaten 100% in about seven or eight hours.  I would highly recommend this game.  It's really wonderful.  It's a lot of fun while having some of the best cut scenes and characters (including the minor ones) I've ever seen.  It has a better story than many platformers, and maybe it's just me, but I feel this game manages to be both silly and beautiful at the same time, with funny characters, but at the same time, lovely locations and music, not to mention the mystery of the Precursors who left their technology and artifacts lying around.  I can't even fully describe how great this game is, but it is always a huge treat to play again.  So why not give it a try.  It could very well become one of your favorite games.	1
This is one of those super fun, light hearted, platformer type games. Lots of fun, and completely addicting if you're one of those types that has to find everything. Because there is lots to find to open things up. The camera angles can get a little irritating, but not enough to ruin the game at all. Its a great game for a reason. And pretty funny!	1
The best PS2 game ever! If you are looking for a hilarious, serious, and awesome game, buy this game! The HD Collection for PS3 is coming soon, and I'm very excited. For all those with a little time on your hands, give this game a spin!	1
One of the best ps2 games ever created. The graphics aren't too good but the adventure story is classic epic and thrilling!	1
My second favorite PS2 game (next only to Kingdom Hearts=])  This game is fun and interesting. It's not impossible, but it is a little bit of a challenge. I love physically moving around. All of the tasks in the game are fun and I LOVE the opening cut scene.  Recommend if you are a PS2 person.	1
This game was great for it's time, but we've kind of moved on since then.  It definitely feels like a game from the early days of the PS2.  The game play is very "retro".  To give you an example, you spend a lot of the time picking up precursor orbs, which are more or less the golden rings in Sonic or the golden coins in Super Mario.  You have to collect many, many, many of these to get power cells which then let you go to other parts of the map.  The attacks are rather simplistic and you don't have a wide variety.  That's not to say gameplay is not fun, but it relies a little too much on taking only a couple of hits or doing a speed run on a vehicle perfectly for my tastes.  A lot of time is spent memorizing obstacles, dying, starting up again, then getting further, dying, restarting, and finally succeeding.  I really enjoyed it, but I've liked more recent PS2 titles more.  The game's cheap now and if you're going to play the other Jak games you probably want to play this one just to see the start of the story.  Decent game.	1
This game got me hooked on the Jak and Daxter series. The controls were relatively simple to learn and it was fun to play. I was able to get 100% completion with no problem. The ending was left open for the next game and was a little disapointing because of that.	1
This game's 1 of the best they made for PS2 in my opinion. They made about 4 or 5 more after this & they're almost just as good. This & the Ratchet & Clank series of games are about the most fun 4 people who like games like this. 5 stars 4 all :)	1
Even though this is an old title, the graphics are very good for a PS2 game and the gameplay is solid. Don't have much to add since most other reviews state everything in detail so I would just recommend this to anyone who hasn't played it yet.	1
I absolutley adore the Jak and Daxter games. I recall, when I first got a PS2, which was years ago (I had the big, black, old one so you do the math), I would rent games for it in the movie store. I saw Jak and Daxter and it looked exactly like my type of game. And so, of course I loved it. This game is flawless, the graphics are awesome (I adore the cartoon type graphics, it suits it so well), and the characters are loveable. I fell in love with Jak when I started playing as him (yes I'm one of those weird girls who thinks that guy characters are hot). As a pair, Jak and Daxter are awesome. I never and will never know to this day if Jak was a mute or not in the first game. Sometimes he acted like he was about to talk when Daxter cut in instead. So, who knows. It makes it all the funnier. I could complain about how the game seems a bit short but in all honesty I think it's exactly the right length for an adventure game like this. It really wasn't too short nor too long. Right in the middle. And after you beat the game you can go back and collect the rest of any power cells that you missed, which if you get lets you see a secret scene for collecting them. It's nothing too long but it makes you want to grabe the second game to see what it is. Not my favorite game in the Jak and Daxter trilogy but I still love nonetheless! I consider the trilogy to be one my top five favorite games of all time. I count the series as a whole game. I love it!	1
You really can see the quality with Jak and Daxter:  it's fun to play, it's paced really well, and it allows you about as much freedom as a "quest-based" platforming game can.  I loved it from one end to the other, and even went out of my way to beat it completely.  You can see plenty of reviews that will give you the story--let's instead take a look at the gameplay.  Jak & Daxter is a "platformer", meaning you spend a lot of time jumping up and down on various stair-step parts of each level.  The monotony is broken up by side quests:  for example, helping a farmer herd cattle, or shooing pigeons away from a series of monuments.  There are also changes to gameplay:  "end bosses" that require you to crack the pattern to beat them.  There are "riding" stages where you're on a small skimmer, and even these have diversity:  sometimes you're racing some bad guys, sometimes you're racing the clock.  Last, you collect "Precursor Orbs" as you go, which you can trade for Power Cells, the core collectable of the game.  Precursor Orbs are hidden all over the place, as are Power Cells that don't need to be bartered for--they're just waiting to be discovered.  It's not easy, but the important part is, when you fail, you know why, and you feel driven to try again, just one more time.  A good game makes you really feel like you've earned something that's hard-to-get, not like you had to wrestle it out of the programmer's hands.  You don't have to collect every Precursor Orb, nor do you have to find every Power Cell...but if you do, you get a special ending to the game.  Probably the most important point to Jak and Daxter is that little "E" on the package: the game is rated "E" for "Everyone", and it truly does live up to that claim.  It's hard for me to find games that I can enjoy, and still share with my 8 year old daughter, but she loves this game, too.  It's unfortunate that the second game went in the "T" (Teen) direction--it just doesn't seem right for Jak to start using shotguns and rocket launchers--but at least we have this one, and I would recommend it for the whole family.  For the record, I played Jak & Daxter on a PS3.  It ran extremely well and has no glitches or hangups.	1
Jak and Daxter, back when Jak couldn't talk (a big reason why this game is rated E) and weapons, jetboards, and vehicles didn't exist.  Jak and Daxter shares almost no similarites with any of the other Jak games other than the main characters (although many more were added in Jak 2). Even though there are no weapons, jetboards, dark eco, or secrets (I guess in the 21st century violence is more important than gameplay), I still play Jak and Daxter all the time. The levels and missions are fun (you must go around the world searching for power cells in the quest to bring Daxter back to his natural form) and it never gets boring.  Although there are no missions, instead you have to do certain things to acquire power cells (findinc scout flies, opening eco vents, defeating plants). The levels range from the boggy swamp to the spider caves to the lost precursor temple. Each place is unique and has its own fun little areas to explore.  Even though I own all of the Jak games currently in existence, there's nothing like the classic Jak and Daxter.	1
From the creators of crash bandicoot comes Jak and daxter. The games overall feeling is a good one. With a very well designed environment it sucks you right in.  Jak, your quiet hero, player, and protagonist and his buddy daxter are quite the duo. When daxter falls into dark eco he is turned into a ottsel.  And from that point jak sets out to find the one person who can possibly turn his friend back into a human. Which basically covers the plot.  With many traps and puzzles this game requires thinking and strategy as well as fighting technique, which balances out very well.  Overall this game is entertaining for a while but will get old. Nevertheless, it is a great start to a great franchise. However The fact Jak doesnt talk can get annoying sometimes. But it is fixed in later games of course.  Great buy.	1
Sure, it may be little more than a hybrid of Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, but it has extremely polished gameplay and loveable characters: Jak, the mute, spiky-haired hero, Daxter, the motormouthed furball, Samos, the old and crotchety Yoda-esque sage, and his hot and intelligent daughter Kiera.  Much of the gameplay consists of "collect X number of bronze eggs/Power cells" with some hoverbike action and a few minigames in between but it's still darn fun.  All the levels consist of one giant, seamless world with gameplay ranging from the ridiculously easy (Senitel Beach, Geyser Rock) to the unbelievably challenging (Spider Cave, anyone?)  My favorite level is the Atlantis-esque Precursor City.  It's extremely fun to play, although the game could use a few more boss fights.  The only flaw in Jak and Daxter is the completely unoriginal plot.  It doesn't affect the gameplay, but it must have taken the guys at Naughty Dog about 5 minutes to come up with the story for J&D.  Here it is: J&D explore a forbidden island that must have been inspired by the elephant graveyard in The Lion King, and Daxter falls into a pit of dark evil stuff and is transformed into an otter-weasel hybrid: an "ottsel" (ooh, how original!)  The entire game revolves around the pair journeying north to find the only guy who can change Daxter back (who, of course, turns out to be a bad guy).  Along the way, they must fight off enemies called Lurkers (again, how original!) and interact with artifacts from a lost people called the Precursors (can't we be more creative than that?) But overall, J&D is an almost perfect platformer.  Jak 2 and 3 are superior and much more complex and adult-oriented, but that just makes Jak 1 that much more one-of-a-kind.	1
this game is borring its only for little kids i have all 3 jak games 2,and3 are good but this game is for little kids whoever likes this  game is stupid buthole	-1
I love this game!  I like it almost as much as Sly Cooper!  The characters are great, and i think Daxter is so funny!  Jak is great too.  It is really well done.  I hope to get 2 and 3 after completing this one.	1
this game should burn in hell. It was a waist of money i wanted to get the whole series but this is the worst. It has the worst storyline ever. I want my money back jak & daxter!!!!	-1
What kinda game is this?  I thought this would be an awsome game!  But no, its not that great.  At first you see the amazing landscape, fun fights, and different contraptions.  Then after a day.......... the game keeps repeating.  There is almost no new enemies.  COME ON LET ME FIGHT SOMETHING ELSE.  There is practicaly one boss, and jak can't jump.  He tries, but cant.  Hes almost as bad as the dude in kingdom hearts.  And what the heck is with this idiot Daxter?  Whats his point in the story?  The comic releif?  NO WAY.  He says idiotic things like LOOK OUT or AHHHHH or even don't die on me Jak, I need someone to feed me.  JEEZ WHAT THE CRAP IS THE POINT OF HIM.  He cant do anything, just flies around like a weirdo.  If your looking at good adventure games, look at Rachet and Clank, Kingdom Hearts, and Harry Potter.  Try to stay away from this game, or be prepared to throw it against the wall.	-1
My 3 year old got this game for Christmas and he loves it!!  So far he has made it through most of the levels on his own and only needed help with a few of them.  We are only about half way through the game now.  I must say I love the game as well, from what I have played so far it's a great game.  Definately worth the money.	1
I love platform games but not many are out there. I tried Crash Bandicoot and I just didn't like it. I'm not sure which one it was or anything... So, being a Spyro fan looking for a fun yet playable game, I rented this. It looks really good and it plays well, the characters are good (Dax is cute!), but I lost interest when I got stuck. Not having a strategy guide, I wandered and I think the problem is that it gave you TOO MUCH area to explore at once and that made it easy to get lost. I never bought it and I haven't tried the second one. It sounds less cute and more battle-like and hard. But, when I have some time, I might buy this game and play it through. A great step up for platform games though!	1
This game really wore on my nerves; on my last nerve, if the truth must be known. Fine, I will admit that the graphics are decent and the story so-so, but the game play--THE most important element of video games, people--is complete garbage. I haven't been this disappointed since playing Blood Omen 2. Camera angles are awful, tending to work against you (okay, in this respect, I'll try and be fair: when it comes to camera angles, most games, nowadays, could use some major improvements). In my defense, I've played enough platformers to know the difference between a challenge and a chore. This game was a hassle from start to finish, an absolute waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy either game from the Ratchet and Clank series. They are ten times more user friendly, and a hundred times more entertaining. Oh, yes, and just so you know, I beat this hunk of junk in a day.	-1
Hands down, this is the best platformer on any system. Buy it if you like the genre, rent it before buying it if you don't or are new to the genre. Gorgeous, funny, just right difficulty, and just right length. Recommended.	1
This game is fun for all ages and has excellent graphics! It has some funny characters (mainly Daxter) and is a "Greatest Hits" game. The game is about how Daxter transforms into a muskrat by falling into a pool filled with "Dark Eco." He decides to set off on a journey with Jak, in search of a cure for his transformation. The game is an action/adventure/platform type. You (Jak) must complete different tasks to receive Power Cells that help aid your quest. The moves that Jak can perform are pretty neat. There are the basic jumps, punches, kick spins...stuff like that, and then there are the uppercuts, rolling turbo jump, dive attack, and the aerial attack. I thought that the only bad thing about the game was that it was too short. I finished the game in about 1-2 weeks, couple hours a day. I just hope that the sequel will be much longer. Overall, I recommend this game to anyone that likes to play adventure/platform games.  =)	1
Good graphics, but....THE BOSSES REALLY STINK! Too easy, too repetitive, too well, just BLAH! If you want the worlds are too short, too easy, and they give you the answer to the missions! No secrets, all you do is jump, roll, and stare. The regular monsters don't have health, they just die instantly. Plus, the whole game is a waste! The plot doesn't even go the way it should! I guess if you want an easy, stupid-plotted game, pick this one, but if youwant serious game play, look away!	-1
Thinkin this game was gonna blow Major..., but when I played the demo, all of I sudden, I was like, WHAT IN THE BLUE HELL WAS I THINKIN??!!  This game is great, and when I picked it up, THANK GOD, it lived up to what I wanted it to be. Pros: Great Graphics Very good voice acting Gameplay has a ton of fun There's alot to do Daxter says pretty funny stuff at time This so far is my favorite platformer to hit the PS2(I haven't played Rachet and Clank yet, tho I want to) At [the price], it's a steal Cons: Pretty gosh darn short I busted my... to get all 101 powercells to get a cheap ... alternate ending Some of the powercell are frustrating(When I first played, and at times still are) To me I kept fellin this game reminded me of somethin, oh yeah Mario 64.  Tho it may feel like Mario 64, it will never be Mario 64.  This game left me mad when I open that stupid door with all 100 power cells(Well I grabbed the extra 1)  And they just stared at a door of light and the game ended.  I swear if I didn't know a sequel was comin out I woulda gave this game a 4.  But yet if u love games like Crash, Rayman, and Rachent and Clank, and never played Jak and Daxter yet, u should, cuz hey it's only 19 bux.	1
This is a great game and very addictive you play as Jak partnered up with his friend Daxter and go on a quest for power cells to power some useful craft and inventions and while finding Precurcer orbs with moves simalar to Crash Bandicoot or Mario its a truly fun game with amazing graphics it has extremly fun chaleging and unique goals price whise its 20 bucks how could you pass it up?	1
I had the demo and wasn't very fond of it.  I enjoyed ratchet and clank a million times more.  So I would say you should skip this one unless you really like platformers.	1
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is brought to you by the company that made Crash Bandicoot. It shows the same playful, all-ages fun adventure style. Definitely lots of fun! Your main characters are Jak, a teenage boy, and Daxter, his young friend who early on gets turned into a reddish weasel. You're told by the great sage that the only way to turn Daxter back into a human is to go on a quest to reach the other sages. There are of course many subquests along the way, some involving the sage's sexy daughter, Kira. You need to gather up 'orbs' which are sort of a currency for the land, and power cells, which let you power various devices. There is also 'eco', a form of power which comes in four colors. It allows you to heal, to run more quickly, to breathe fire, and do other special activities. The graphics are great, from running through water to climbing up mountains and walking through villages. The sounds work well too, with the wooden bridges and sandy beaches and ocean swims all seeming very realistic. The background music is catchy and fun. This isn't a dark, somber 'save the world against zombies' type of game. It's very lighthearted, with wisecracking and simple tasks. The tasks you perform make you feel like you're really helping people out, and the challenges are doable. The save system makes it easy to try again if you fail the first time. It's really a game that both adults and kids can play together and both enjoy. Highly recommended!	1
This is a great game and I reccomend it for any body!! I really had fun playing it! The graphics are awesome!!! Jak is cool! .....and so is Daxter. this is the best E rated game out there! See ya!	1
When I first played this game I knew that it was not an average Platformer title. It had good graphics, good controls, good gameplay and everything else was perfect about this title. The game makers paid a lot of attention to everything and you can see that in the game.  The game plays like the usual platformer, but its gameplay and side quests make it above average.   The only problem I had with this game was that it was to short.  I beat in about 5 hours with everything done.  Other than that the game is brilliant and suited for all ages.  Go out and buy.	1
This game was a lot of fun. It reminded me of Ratchet & Clank (amazing game) only without the guns and gadgets and set in a mystical world. The world is this huge multi level world and is really well put together. It could have done with more weapons though.	1
Believe it or not, this is one of the best games you can find. Naughty Dog, the company that made the Crash Bandicoot games, made this game, so you can expect it would be great. I will not tell you the plot because that might ruin the story. Graphics: Nine and a half stars: It's hard to find as colorful graphics as you find in Jak and Daxter. Sound: Ten stars: The sound is pretty fun and humorous at most times and with Daxter around, you could get some laughs. Replay Value: Eight and a half stars: Not the best of any game you could find, but enough to have you playing again from time to time. Gameplay: Nine and a half stars: It's hard not to have a great time when playing this fantastic game. Overall: 9.5 stars! Bottom Line: GET THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE PS2!	1
This game shows off the PS2's graphical prowess, or what passes for graphical prowess on a PS2.  The controls are very easy to pick up, and if you don't demand anything from your games then this will probably satisfy you.  However, I found that collecting power cells and eco was a tedious task rather beneath someone of my intellectual stature.  The physics of the game were astoundingly poor; who ever heard of a "double jump"?  Even on the moon, with its unique gravity, Neil Armstrong was unable to do a double jump, and so the suggestion that a spiky-haired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensive. Furthermore, it has been noted in countless reviews that Daxter, the sidekick, is not irritating, and even perhaps amusing.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!  You plebians know nothing!  Daxter is the Newman of video games characters, the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never does. In conclusion, the game looks nice, plays nice, but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention.  Go play Dynasty Warriors or SSX Tricky instead!	-1
This is the best platformer of all time. Simply put, no other game can contend with this games replayabilty, graphics and loading time. You can easily pump out 45+ hours of gameplay without beating all of it. The graphics are super and the water effects are supreme. The air flows thorough the characters hari, giving them an unsurpassed life likeness. You never, ever experience any loading times. All this for only $$$. You cannot beatthe price considering over 800,000 humans paid $$$ for it. I highley recomend this game as it is perfect for younger children and adults alike.	1
ok it may get really annoying after a wile then something happens and changes it. When i play it its soooo boring but there something there that makes me stay!!!!DONT RENT IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A MEMORY CARD, or you will be sorry. This games grafix are amazing i got this game for ($) were i live. It was worth it, BUY it and live out your boring life with something fun!!	1
I saw lots of commercials, game previews, and demos on this game, and all had nothing but good things to show about this game! After playing a demo on this game, I knew I had to get it! It seemed really good, and when I finally got it, I was hooked! This game has a good story, awesome and beautiful graphics, and the characters are great! Daxter was funny, Samos Hagai(Green Sage) was funny and cool, and Jak was badass(even though he never spoke in the entire game). I really do hope that NaughtyDog(who really rocks at making games) makes a sequel to this game, it really does deserve and need one. The ending definitely leaves you hanging and wanting to know, "What's behind that freakin' door?!" Another reason why they should make a sequel is because of the villains: Gol and Maia Akaron. They make it pretty obvious that there was a chance the two villains survived falling into the Dark Eco silo(and I'll bet that falling into the Dark Eco like that will make them even more powerful). "Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy" is definitely a must have if you're into make believe stuff with elves, monsters, adventure,and danger. Get it or rent it( it's your choice).	1
I hesitated on buying this game for some time, based on the fact that it seemed to be made for a younger audience. But, I needed a new game and gave it a go. I expected an easy game with lame jokes, but what I got was an in-depth, fun, exciting, and some-what challenging epic adventure/game. This is what PS2 is about, and this is what I have been expecting. This game is like the Zelda for PS2, it wastes Maximo, Crash, and all of the dark and mysterious games like Max Payne that seem so depressing. This game is light-hearted and fun, everyone who plays will love it. I reccomend this game for everyone, and it starts off kind of lame, but oh no! just hold in there! It's a lot of fun.	1
After playing the demo and watching those stupid TV commercials I was sure that 'Jak and Daxter' was a stupid game. Then one day I was bored and there wasn't really anything interesting at the video store so I picked up 'Jak and Daxter' and I was really surprised. It's actually fun. It's actually VERY fun. Very fun and very addictive. I was up until 5 in the morning playing this game. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Anyway here's the score I give it: Graphics: 4.5 Sound: 5.0 Control: 5.0 Fun Factor: 5.0	1
Jak and Daxter once again disobeyed the Green Sage, and wandered off into Misty Island, an island full of evil creatures and mysical ecos. One of the ecos are Dark Eco, one of the most dangerous toxins known to man. It changes you at random. You could turn into a scientific nerd, an attractive jock, a rabbit, an ottsel, or an insane madman. Two of these things become reality to Jak and Daxter .As they arrived on the island, they noticed something wasn't right. As they moved in to investigate, the saw two warlock and witch looking monsters, ranting about how to "take over the world." Jak and Daxter ran off, but, before they could, poor Daxter fell into a pool of dark eco, and emerged an ottsel...the rest of the story you can figure out yourselves... Jak and Daxter:The Precursor Lagacy was one of the first Playstation 2 games released. With state of the art graphics, witty comeback and an enchanting plot, this is a must have. Buy it if you're a fan of Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot, Tomb raider or Spyro.	1
I bought this game in December when I purchased my PS2.  I completed it last night at like 3am...no, it hasn't taken me 7 months to finish.  I like this game so much, I keep letting my friends and family borrow it, and I finally got it back for an extended period of time. Being a HUGE fan of the Crash Bandicoot games for PSOne, I picked this one up based upon the Naughty Dog logo.  They developed some awesome games for the 1st generation playstation, I assumed that the 2nd generation game would rock as well.  It does!  The graphics in this game are suberb, it is like playing a cartoon.  The backgrounds and environments are lush and vivid, no load times, and an awesome plotline complete the total package. This game is great for younger gamers and those who aren't hardcore gamers at heart.  It appeals and works well across all genres and likes.  I am impressed with the smooth and seamless control and the speedy gameplay.  The game is perfection!  I highly reccomend that this game be added to any game library, it is truly one of the "must-haves."  I cant wait for a Jak and Daxter 2!!	1
you can totally throw the little dude!!  he just hangs around and then you're like, "WHAM!! EAT MY DAXTER!!"  when i first played this game i couldn't believe my eyes.  don't get me wrong, i wouldn't play this game with my eyes closed or anything, but when they were open it was like, "wow!"  trust me on this one!	-1
Personally, I like all things mythical, like dragons and wizards and bizzare, fanciful worlds. With Jak and Daxter, a magical world was lain before me! Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is truly one of the most remarkable games of it's genere I have ever seen! It ranks right up there with Spyro the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot and Mario! This game is about mystery and discovery as you go along. About turning you friend, Daxter, back to his elfish-self from him bieng an Ottsel-half Otter, half Weasel. You also discover secrets of the Precursors, ancient biengs that made Eco and your world, and a delvilish plot to change the world for the worst. This game looks fantasic and has massive landscapes and whimsical characters. It also has a variety of play mechanics and vehicles which helps you do great combo-attacks and fly on a baby Flut-Flut. For me, this game was a little to easy, but even after you finish, this is one of those games that you just like to run around in with no purpose. And it's from Naughty Dog-the fellows who made Crash Bandicoot, so they've placed a lot of Crash's personality into every microbit of this game, as well as thier experienced touch, so you know this game is good any which way you look at it. If you've got the wit and adventourus spirit, give Jak and Daxter a try. It's easy to get addicted to their world of intrigue, and easy to understand as well. Have fun! I did!	1
Naughty Dog, the creators of Crash Bandicoot have created a new adventure game that is even better.  Jak and Daxter are on a quest to collect power cells and precursor orbs.  The quest begins in Sandover Village; from there you will travel throughout a vast 3D world filled with all kinds of different environments. The graphics on this game are amazing.  Remember how awesome Crash looked the first time you saw it on PS1.  Well this reminds me of that feeling.  The controls are easy to get used to.  Jak and Daxter have several different attacks and jumps.  The camera angle can be moved using the right analog stick to view from any angle you choose.  Each level is huge and I spent a good amount of time just exploring. It will take most people about 18 hours to get through this game.  It will take longer to get all 101 power cells though.  Believe it or not Daxter is actually funny.  From the moment I got this game I played nothing else until I completed it.  It is very addicting and has good replay value.  Jak and Daxter also appeals to all ages of gamers.  This game should be in everyone's collection.  Bring on the sequel.	1
Daxter (the annoying but funny, and fun to listen to sidekick) and Jak (the adventurous, babe magnet, super stud hero) Make a great team. Daxter, with his smart-mouthed remarks, and funny dances and Jak with his smooth moves and...cool clothes!! WARNING: this game is highly addictive.	1
-Chad Steingraber- -Paradigm/Infogrames- -Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate- This is one of those games that I had fun playing through the entire game.  There were a few moments of complete frustration where I had to put it down and come back the next day...but it was worth it.  I didn't find anything to be repeatative or boring.  It brought me back to when I first bought a DreamCast and played RayMan 2.  I would definately suggest this game to anyone who likes action/adventure/platform styles games...it's a lot of fun.  I gave it four stars because of some of the frustration I encounted.  More than just a rental, this game will take you a little while (unless, you play it all weekend or can rent it for 7 days...then it's a rental).  Unless you are crazy insane for this game, you will only need to play it once.  I traded mine in for Drakan after I was done.	1
You have to play it! It is so cool! It's rated E,but that's only because it's simple to play. It has a good story line to it and you experince the time of your life. It's of a different world,but someday my theoy is that our world might be like that. It's by Naughty Dog a company of 10 people. It's about a boy named Jak who was as care-free as could be, with his pal Daxter an ugly looking,funky haired,buck tooth animal. They go to Misty island and Daxter falls in a pit of dark eco. And that's the little furry dude you see on the cover. Now you have to find a guy to change him back. First you go into training, then the real thing. You collect powercells to make whatever it is run. Just a tip, if you collect all the powercells to the Red Sage's place you'll just about have your final amount. And don't tick of Simos. And if you really want to know my opoinin Daxter looks better after he came out of the black eco then before. Hope I was helpful.	1
Unlike many adventure games this one doesn't make you watch the whole thing. It does have its share of cutscences but most of the time you get to run around in a free environment. They keep the edge of the game world away from you nice to. It has a good story and its quite long and keeps you interested by always introducing new charaters and the levels are huge. Only problems I see is the life scale is made up weird must collect 50 green things to get another peice of life. But its not much concern as since the late 90's all adventure games you have unlimited deaths. There are some anoying 3d jumping as always but the L3 analong control is nicely used to move the camera whereever you want around yourself. All and all its a fun game if you like doofy adventure games has some funny stuff and some anoying stuff.	1
Excellent game for the PS2!  It has comedy, challenge and (most of all) a good plot!   Jak And Daxter are pals, who disobeyed orders from the green sage not to go to Misty Island.  On Misty Island, Daxter takes a swim in a pool of dark eco, and changes into a small furry animal that looks like a squirrel.  The two pals ask the green sage for help, but the Green Sage doesn't know how to change Daxter back to his oringal form (and besides, its a BIG improvement for Daxter).  Jak and Daxter's quest is to find the sage, who lives FAR to the north, who can change Daxter back to his annoying self.   Most of the talking is done by Daxter, Jak doesn't talk much.  You control Jak, while Daxter rides on Jak's shoulder.  Daxter gives you advice and hints as you walk through the game.  The beginning levels are easy (as usual), but the game gets harder as you go.	1
A selection from the full review at Nintendorks: "SSX Tricky's in-game speech will frequently remind you that, 'It's all about putting on a show,' and that sentiment goes to the heart of the game and is what separates it from previous extreme/trick-based games. There's no pressure to complete your tricks or point your board in the right direction long before you land (a la Tony Hawk Pro Skater), and there are no quasi-realistic physics to encumber a free spirit (a la 1080 Snowboarding). SSX Tricky is about getting an obscene amount of air and pulling off entirely ridiculous stunts while just barely nosing out another racer at the finish line. It's more exhilarating than 1080 or THPS while being a bit less challenging. Briefly, you steer with the analog joystick and hold down the A-button to charge up a jump. During the last few milliseconds before a jump, you also charge up a spin or flip on the D-pad. Once in the air, your hands make a topward shift of focus to the L-, R-, and Z-buttons to pull off a variety of stunts, while you tweak the stunts or super-size them in Uber mode with the B-button. Completed tricks fill up your adrenaline meter and let you boost with the B-button when you're on the ground. During a race, you're forced to do tricks in order to be fast enough to finish the race. During Showoff mode, you're forced to use your adrenaline to hit the ramps with a good amount of speed so you can achieve more air and more tricks. Each character has tons of stats and boards to unlock, and solid replay comes from repeating the game with each character. If I had to liken SSX Tricky to any other game that a Nintendo system owner might have played, I'd have to suggest the great Beetle Adventure Racing on the N64. If you liked the over-the-top courses, shortcuts, and personality of that game, you'll enjoy SSX Tricky. So far, no screenshots or videos of SSX Tricky have been able to convey the shear visceral thrill of launching your character off of the side of a mountain, having the music melt away into a faint beat while you pull off an incredible 1440, then landing perfectly to cheers, popping fireworks, and a musical crescendo. It's something you have to experience to get excited about, and I hope you at least rent it. I know my copy will keep me company through the relatively barren winter release schedule ahead."	1
This game blew my mind!! Its like a mix between luging on a snowboard and Tony Hawk gone ballistic!!   The levels are incredible with plenty of sick secret levels and routes to take.  The racing is an all-out blast down the hill complete with other players trying to knock you down ro you knocking them down.  The tricks will blow you away!! They are easy to learn but the higher level tricks take some serious practice.  Tricks like superman, break dancing on top of the board in mid-air, using the board as a helicopter blade, and more!!! I found myself playing this game until the wee hours of the morning and regretting it the next day.  Very, very addictive and always fun to play with your kids or friends.  Multi-player action is a must!!	1
They don't lie when they say tricky about this game! The cool new celebrity voices like Lucy Liu and David Arquette. The cool new tricks and the brand new corses equal a "tricky" game which is fun and funny at the same time. Plus, the way you get to push people off their boards and beat their booties in a funky way!	1
This is probably one of the greatest platform games of all time.  Of course, that doesn't say much since platform games aren't truly the greatest games.  The graphics are very good, though a little garish.  The frustration level is not truly a problem.  The most important aspect is the openness of such a game.  You could move from the level to level with ease.  If you're stuck at one place, just move onto a different place.  The constraints of a standard platform game are absent. Basically, Jak and Daxter travel through different areas (beaches, volcanoes, caves, villages) and try to pick up power cells.  You can gain power cells through accomplishing many different task, from finding certain crates, destroying certain creatures, to mini-games, and on and on.  You travel by foot, travel in a sort of hover bike, or in one instance ride a small bird like creature. The controls are pretty intuitive, and the camera angles are right on.  You can't save at any point in the game, but the saving takes place in very frequent spots. .  This saves the user from repeating many jumps and actions.  Sometimes jumping is a little cheap and frustrating, but no one is asking for perfection The bad part is that it just is a platform game.  Even though the exploration part is nice, it's basically a series of jumps for most of the game.  It even falls to the same cliched trap of fighting some super boss at the end. Pros: Good graphics Intuitive Very little in terms of cut scenes Wide open Little repetition Cons: Just a platform game Time: 17 hours Frustration: Low Difficulty: Low	1
This game is platforming done right.  Huge sprawling levels filled with tons of intricate detail and no loading (almost).  On top of that a blast to play with very little bad to say about it.  Gameplay is well refined and a little borrowed from their past Crash games.  Is the game too short? No.  About 16-20 hours of solid gameplay.  Why I said it was over way too soon is because once you get to the end of the game you are left really wanting more.  The only teeny-tiny draw back are those ugly PS2 jaggies, they don't hinder your gaming experience but when you step back to take in the amazing detail you seem 'em crawling around everything.  A great game no-the-less.	1
If you intend to play Jak and Daxter from start to finish without stopping, you'd best eat a big meal, drink mightily, and take a potty break before you start: once this game is loaded, there are no wait times. I don't know how Naughty Dog managed it, but there is never a time in the entire game when things slow down while you wait for the Playstation to catch up. You play Jak (with Daxter the Otsel--that's otter/weasel--wisecracking away from his perch on your shoulder), whose primary goal is to save the world from Twisted Sister's Dee Snider and incidentally transform Daxter back into his much-less-attractive elven self. It's a fast-action, beautifully-crafted platform game in which the major objective is to collect power cells and use them to get you to the next area. The power cells and orbs do nothing for Jak's power or abilities, so Jak remains the same strong silent, reasonably powerful elf-guy from beginning to end. The challenges are many and varied: often Jak has to travel to a different region (level, if you will) to solve a problem--and collect a power cell. This results in some interesting event chains: the sculptor in town (area 1) has lost his muse (another weasel-like creature) on Misty Island (area 2), but to get to Misty Island you must use the fisherman's boat, which he'll only let you use if you catch 200 lbs of fish for him at his fishing shack in the Forbidden Jungle (area 3). Fortunately, the invisible load times and a few well-placed teleportals make access to pretty much anywhere a fairly simple task. As a result, your focus remains on solving the problem, not getting around. Game control is easy and intuitive, with the left analog stick controlling Jak's direction and speed, and the right controlling camera angle and zoom. Various jumps, punches, and spins as well as a scope-style targeting mode are available from the right thumbpad (sometimes in combination with the front triggers). A flyer and a Flut-Flut (large bird--think chocobo) are available for transport when the situation requires it, and their controls are equally easy to pick up, though it will probably take you a while to get a feel where the flyer is concerned...it likes to bounce uncontrollably sometimes. The weakest link is the plot--rarely does the impetus to collect power cells or orbs relate to the overall story: generally, you collect power cells to solve immediate problems and orbs to appease the locals and the Oracles, (who will trade you power cells for orbs). In fact, when you reach the final boss, it really doesn't matter how much stuff you've collected (except that, apparently, getting 100 power cells will get you an alternate ending). The only real gameplay annoyance is the occasional immutable or just plain bad camera angle. It's incredibly easy to make a misstep because you can't get the camera into a place where you can see what your next move should be. I don't know anyone who's played this and not enjoyed it--I'm not a big fan of platformers, myself, but I've had a blast playing this game, even if I'm no good at it.	1
I beat Jak and Daxter a couple of days ago and i must say it was a lot of fun. There are a lot of people to interact with, the puzzles are challenging, Daxter makes an excellent sidekick... But its too short! I mean they could have had more bosses and levels. Oh well. Its a great game anyway, I wish Mario was more like this, and the Sonic Adventure series has some minor problems as well... so the platform game of 2001 should be Jak and Daxter, or Maximo.	1
While this game's ending was a slight disappointment to me, I loved it.   1. The controls were very easy to slip into and use from the moment I loaded it in.   2. Load times are zilch.  Even when you die and the game reloads from the last spot, the load time is negligible.   3. The story is a variation on a theme, but it's originality of characters is to be applauded.  From the crotchety old green sage, to your smart alec sidekick, to the lecturing, long winded blue sage.  I still can't figure out what Farthy is supposed to be though.   4. The graphics are very well done and use the effect of 3d animation very well.   I do think the game is a bit short, I finished this in two days, upsetting my gamer friend at work who still doesn't believe I did it.   Overall this game is entertaining, fun and very well done.  It's worth the investment for the whole family.  From my daughter who likes to play too, to my father in law who heckles me in the background when i fall off a cliff into molten lava...	1
Entertaining and enjoyable but too short. Beat it in one day. Worth a rent but not a buy. Note to naughty dog: What was there is nice but there was too little of it too justify $.... You needed at least 5 times the content to make it worth buying this is a rental game only guys. Oh and thanks for nothing concerning the door that requires 100 power cells to open. Note: After you defeat the game there is another door wich requiers you to collect 100 power cells to enter. Don't bother. When you collect the 100 power cells and go to the door it opens, a bright light comes out, the charactors say "oh that is beautiful" and that is all that happens. I guess they really wanted to get this game on the market before it was finished or it was a cruel joke to those who collected the 100 power cells for nothing.	-1
In a world full of violent and sexual, mature PS2 games (and i don't mind those), it seems as if the PS2 was meant for teenagers on up. Well not now.  Jak and Daxter is a flawless PS2 game, reminding me somewhat of Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, or Crash Bandicoot.  This is a nice breath of fresh air for PS2 owners... something your little brother can play, have a great time, laugh, without hesitating.  and it is a good game, don't get me wrong. one of the best games ive ever played! its self explanitory, easy, and tons of fun.  Once you get used to everything on the fist stages, it gets harder though, so it isn't a total walk in the park.  there are great voice overs, and their worlds are very vibrant and have lots of color.  Its the first good game for PS2 for all ages.  While crash bandicoot on the PS2 really disappointed me, try this one instead.	1
ok this game is THE BEST for ps2 I have ever seen...OK if you have played Final Fantasy these graphics aren't as cool but is still top quality! you are on a quest to change Jak's friend Dexter back into a human then end up saving the world from dark eco.. any way this game is highly explanitory (they don't leave you confused and clueless) great story line, and it is like a real world! I mean its not just level after level it is an entire world of exploration! I still find myself re-playing the game! as always rent before you buy but this is a great game. it has top game play (not overly frusterating), great graphics, you can explore everything, and fun little tasks to earn powercells. all in all this game is the best!	1
Jak and Daxter is by far the best Platform game out for any of the next generation systems right now.  The gameplay is very similar to that of Naughty Dog's Crash Bandicoot games.  The graphics are excellent, and there is plenty of places to explore, and things to collect.  After collecting my first 20 orbs in Jak and Daxter,  I must admit that this is one of the coolest games I have played in a while. Wait until you try to get over the lava canyon, or have to catch the fish (you old school gamers may remember the Atari 2600 game Kaboom, its very similar, even though its only for a short time (unless you stink at it ;) )).....this is truly cool stuff!! The sound is typical Naughty Dog Fair, and doesn't really add to or take away anything from the game.  At one point, I could of sworn that it was the same music from Crash Bandicoot. The saving feature in Jak and Daxter is great, it saves you the frustration of having to restart the level, when you die. This is great because the levels are huge, and it makes the game much easier to play. Overall, I like this game a lot, its a great looking game, and its a blast to play! I can see Naughty Dog using Jak & Daxter as their next platform game,  of which many sequels will be made. And yet another great game for the PS2!!! Eat your heart out X-box!!	1
I usally do not like sport games, but this game is different.  I really don't like racing in tricky but the trick campaign is really great. It is really fun to play the multiplayer and verses your friends and to see who is the king.  At first it is hard to do tricks, but after a little bit you will be riding like a pro.  You get to build up your chacters and get them better boards, you can build up your trick level and your speed level and much more.	1
just like i said when you buy this game youll have so much fun with it. but after a month or two itll get extremely boring it has a very low value to it.  But it is cheap so you could just buy it for a month or two then sell again. thats what i did. Youll have a good old time with this game for only a bit though.	1
JAK AND DAXTER: THE PRECURSOR LEGACY is a fun adventure/role-play game brought to you by the makers of CRASH BANDICOOT (Naughty Dog). Let me tell you, this game is fun! It's filled with lush 3D graphics, an interesting storyline, funny characters, and tons of stuff to do. You play as Jak with your sidekick Daxter. In the beginning of the game Daxter gets transformed into another form. He now looks like a cute rodent and it's up to Jak and him to find the Blue Sage to transform him back. Along the way you encounter the Green Sage and he gives you a bunch of missions to complete that will restore the land. By completing the tasks you'll also get rid of "the bad guys." JAK AND DAXTER: THE PRECURSOR LEGACY is filled with challenges to keep you on your toes but they're not hard. The challenges are a lot of fun and Daxter is soooo cute and funny. He keeps you entertained though out the levels. JAK AND DAXTER is definately a fun filled adventure that everyone will enjoy.	1
This game is so much fun. Jak is the main character with his furry friend Daxter going along for the ride on his shoulders.  Daxter's do nothing job is kibitzing.  his dialogue is entertaining, scathing and often hilarious.  A sidewalk superintendant of sorts. Jak plays his role well with many good moves and fine built in control of the figure. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular.  A lot of thought was put into creating new and different locations and game play. Dispatching the final boss, a gigantic robot is actually fun. It's been many a game since I could make that statement.	1
Remember all the time you wasted playing Mario Bros on your Nintendo?  Live those days all over again with Jak & Daxter.  Only now, do it in an amazingly rendered 3D world of beaches, jungles, swamps, icy mountains, and fiery cavern depths. The first thing I noticed in the game were these absolutely beautiful graphics.  Insects buzz around, the wind moves through the trees, and everything behaves naturally enough to pass as a real cartoonish environment.  Having never played a Naughty Dog title before I was stunned by the attention to graphic detail, like Jak's feet kicking up sand as he runs along the beach.  The graphics associated with the powerups are also very well done.  I really cannot give too much praise to the games artistic design.  The spatially-oriented sound helps provide for excellent immersion. The gameplay remains nothing new.  Collect doodads, collect some doodads to get other doodads, finish little side quests to get doodads, all while donig some sort of puzzle solving.  Sure, there's tons of platform jumping, an old saw of the action/adventure genre.  It won't matter when it's done as well as this though. My only complaint, and it's a small one, was with the story (nonexistent) & characters (one-dimensional & thus dull), which has always been a problem with this genre, so one gets used to it.  Also, one thought I had was that it would have been neat to have had a chance to use Daxter (the critter/sidekick on Jak's shoulder) alone in a couple of sections.  As it is, he's just along for the ride & for color commentary.	1
Crash Bandicoot: Wrath of Cortex came out and I gave it four stars. Now, if I gave that four stars, this game should have got 6. In all truth, Naughty Dog made the makers of the 5th Crash game look like fools. (They used to do the Crash series).   The graphics are smooth, pleasing, and detailed. The sound is nice as well. The characters are likeable, and sometimes humorous. The game takes you in the game, which is what makes it special. The tasks and vast open levels of gameplay impress and amaze me.   The game can be a bit difficult on the inside, but it is easy to learn and difficult to master. This is a must buy for any PS2 owner.	1
these are the creators of crash bandicoot and crash bash.what happens in this new game is jak and daxter go to beast island when they are not suppose to go there.daxter gets turned into the little creature on the front of the game.now the new legacy begins!	1
I was looking for a new video game entirely different from the games I typically buy.  My husband played this one with a few of his buddies while out to sea in the navy, and recommended it.  I figured this was just his way of getting himself a new game.  ha ha  (Wouldn't be the first time) Well, he was in a way, but I enjoyed it just as much as he did.  The game is a lot of fun.  The music is real catchy and you'll find yourself singing along wherever you go. And if the characters voices sound familiar to you, it's because they are.  Actors actually lended their voices and if you watch the video you can see who they are.  But to name a few, David Arquette, Lucy Liu, and Macy Gray. The game doesn't get tiresome like a lot of games like this do.  The split screen in multiplayer isn't too distracting like it can be in other games either.  This one is a good buy, and if you can find it grab it.  I like it so much, I'm now considering getting SSX 3.	1
Ah, Run DMC.  Where would we be without you?  Sorry, I digress. SSX Tricky is the best arcade-style snowboarding game on the GCN, and probably the best one produced yet.  It's not exactly a huge category of games, so normally this wouldn't be hard to do, but SSX Tricky absolutely blows away every other snowboarding game I've ever played. The folks over at EA Games took the critically acclaimed SSX and turned everything up to 11 for this one.  The characters, the moves, the levels, the music -- everything is over the top and amazingly fun. The wide variety of characters are voiced by some top-notch voice actors, which gives them a much deeper personality than more sports game figureheads.  The main single-player game also features a "hostility meter" that measures how much the other players like or dislike you.  The other characters will talk to you before, during, and after the race depending on how much they (dis)like you and your actions.  Some of the characters hate each other by default, while others will only hate you if you go around slamming them into the ground repeatedly on the trails.  Pissing everybody off, however, is not a great idea, as then by the last few races in the circuit, everyone will go out of their way to make you lose. The level design is outstanding.  The courses are located all over the world, and range from gentle, largely natural mountain courses to city streets to an indoor snowboard park.  Each course comes in both a "race" and a "trick" version (which adds numerous ramps, jumps, and slides, as well as bonus point multipliers at strategic locations). The gameplay is tight.  You have a great degree of control over your boarder, and you can do an extensive variety of flips, spins, grabs, tweaks, and special moves (it's a slightly less extensive variety than on the PS2, which has an extra shoulder button, but you'll hardly ever notice it in practice).  The latter require you to fill up a "turbo" meter by doing smaller tricks or alternatively by knocking down opposing riders (which fills the meter instantly).  When the meter fills, you have about 15 seconds to find a big jump and pull off one of your character's "uber" tricks, which are worth a massive amount of points.  If you pull off 6 uber tricks in a single run, you'll have unlimited turbo for the rest of the course, which is the best way to rack up those huge scores, especially on the longer, more challenging levels.  By beating levels in the game, you can increase each character's stats, and by performing each trick in their "trick book", you can unlock a variety of extra outfits and boards. As compared to the PS2 and XBox versions, the Gamecube is graphically much closer to the XBox.  The PS2 simply can't keep up -- the texture detail on the characters and courses is significantly better on the GCN (especially the chrome-skinned "Master" outfits -- they just look *bad* on the PS2).  On the other hand, the PS2 has an extra shoulder button, which means they can do more tricks.  However, this isn't something that ever bothered me very much. The multiplayer mode is excellent -- it's just like the single-player mode, except there are two people competing against each other (you can have CPU opponents if you like during races, although it's just the two of you in the stunt mode).  Knocking over your friends is always very entertaining.  One drawback is that there's no good way to "handicap" a much better player against a beginner, other than maybe making the better player take a character that hasn't been built all the way up.  It would be nice if you could tone a character's stats down, give the better player fewer points for their tricks, or give a head start in the racing courses. I strongly recommend SSX Tricky to anyone even remotely interested in a snowboarding game, or in a fun multiplayer game for their Nintendo Gamecube.  You won't be disappointed.	1
First off, this game is very fun and detailed. The characters you play as have hilarious personallities (the Buddhist, the 70s rock fan, the active little Japanese Girl With a High Voice) and shout out insults at their enemies when passed. The courses are also very well detailed and loads of fun. The tricks are also amazingly cool and fun to pull off. I'd say this is a must have for Xtreme sports fans.	1
SSX games are the best snowboarding games ever.  Why?  For starters, You can go anywhere you want on your board.  SSX is one of the most diverse Snowboarding games out there and definately worthy of your attention.	1
I've had this game for 5 months and still hasn't got boring! This is without a dought the 2nd best game for the cube. Anyway it's all fun here	1
I hate to do this, I really do. I hate to give a game a 5-star rating and act like everyone else here giving the game a 5-star rating, but this game is a 5-star type of game. SSX Tricky seems to be the best snowboarding game since 1080 snowboarding. 1080 snowboarding and the Tony Hawk series started the whole "action sports" cateogory where you play games of the snowboarding and skateboarding genre. These type of games have been overloading, too many games have come out in this genre and they come out so quickly that they become boring, tiresome, and they always seem to have a huge problem. Its kind of like "Ive seen this all before." This game however, is not like that. SSX Tricky brings a new style of a snowboarding game to gamers. It adds a more personal type of style, giving the gamer someone who is, like them. Right at the beggining when you choose your boarder you can see personal things about that person. Maybe that person acts like you on the snowboarding field, maybe that person likes the same music. Whatever the hobby this game adds personal attitude to the game. Thats the diffrence between this game and other action sport genre games. Anywayz enough of the diffrences, lets get to the parts of this game that, make this game fun. First off graphics. The graphics of the whole EA BIG SPORTS company are always great. They mix realistic graphics with a littl cartoony mix. The sound and music is also great. I just love the tunes in the background while your pulling off a double backflip. The sound effects are also great. The crunching of snow boots onto snowboards is an excellent mix. Plus the talking from the characters is also excellent. People that one person hates could be ragged on and dissed. For example Luther may say to Mac that he will eat him. This is quite humorous and adds effect to the gameplay. The friendship meter is also great. For example if your Mac and you push your friend Zoe a few times then she may get madder at you and not be as nice to you as she was before. Wut wud this game be without tricks. There are many tricks to master in this game, including tricks called Uber tricks. These tricks altho ez are hard to get your trick meter up and are also hard to get big enuff air to make one of these tricks. The tricks altho sumtimes its easier to forget about tricks in races can become a big factor onto ur turbo meter. When ur trick meter is up for example you can zoom through everyone. However why do tricks if your trying to win the race. All in all an excellent game that shines of greatness. This game is a definite buy, altho sum may think of renting it first. This game appeals to the hardcore gamer and the begginer.	1
In my opinion, Jak and Daxter is the best game of 2001. It's has amazing graphics and voice overs and great gameplay, even the music is great. This game, which was made by the creators of Crash Bandicoot, is like a buffed up version of Banjo Kazooie with different characters. It's hard to express how fun this game is, it has to be one of the top 20 maybe even top 10 games of all time in my mind. There are lots of little missions to beat and vechiles to get while you adventure with the main characters Jak and Daxter. Though its most like Banjo Kazooie, other games are similar to this like Zelda 64, Donkey Kong 64, Sonic Adventure, and Crash Bandicoot. If your a fan of any of those games you should defenitly check this out.	1
This game is fun, fun, fun!!! The graphics are nice, the sound is nice, the adventure is nice and my wife finaly playing video games, is very nice. She hates all my other titles but she loves this and my son gazes at the amazeing wide virety of worlds. No loading time is very nice. There is absolutely nothing you can say to deprive this game of it's well disorved hype. I suggest to you, if you have a family and just plain love playing adventure games, this is a must buy! 5 STARS BAY-BE!!!!	1
SSX Tricky is an awesome game, personally, my 2nd favorite (My all time favorite is Super Smash Bros Melee just so you know). I love the game play, the graphics are sensational, pretty much as life-like as can be. There is only one thing that separates it from the preqel SSX, when your character comes flying off his or her board and does an Uber Trick (A special trick that no one else can perform). The Uber Trick can be performed once your boost meter is full. (Pay close attention to the right hand side of the screen.) The Insane tricks are what makes this game special. As far as the game play goes, there are a total of 12 characters, (However you start out with the folloing 4 [Their age is also listed]) Mac Frasier-16 Elise Riggs-24 Moby Jones -19 Eddie Wachowski-19 But you can later access 8 more riders by earning gold medals in the World Circut mode (NOTE: there are two modes of play, Showoff-Where you earn points by doing tricks or race mode-where you race against other racers. [Which mode you do it on doesn't matter]). The characters trick/riding style depends on what board they use Alpine Boarder/Board=longboard-Focuses mainly on speed Freestyle Boarder/Board=shortboard-Focuses mainly on tricks BX Boarder/Board=Mid-Sized board-Focuses on every area You also have this thing called a Trick Book, where you do tricks to earn a new outfit. If you mannage to complete the whole Trick Book, you earn an UberBoard (The Best Board in the whole game). If I was to rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it an 11. Hey, what can I say? I'm addicted to this game!!!	1
go get this game its worth it its fun as hell and the replay is there one of the best games on gamecube	1
SSX Tricky is a great game in many aspects. The graphics are sweet, the course designs are nice, the music is catchy, and there are quite a few things to unlock. I wish there were more courses, and a four-player mode would have been nice, but overall SSX Tricky delivers a solid game experience.	1
In a word: magnificent. Like most of the games being released this year, Jak&Daxter starts off with an animated opening, which introduces some pertinent characters and explains the premise of your adventure. But from the get-go, J&D stands apart from its rivals. Whereas most game characters look great but don't emote and have voices that make you long for text instead, J&D characters are fully animated and show great personality through both their body language and their superb voice acting. From the opening animation you launch *immediately* into the game. J&D is real-time so there is no waiting for load screens to tick away until they reach 100%. (When you accomplish one of your goals, there is a brief pause while the games saves your progress, but that's a good thing, especially for those who forget to save often ^_~) Learning the controls is part of the game - and a great deal of fun - so you don't have to sit reading some 50-page manual. The fun starts right away as you control Jak and make your way through the training area. Daxter rides shotgun on your shoulder, making funny quips and giving helpful advice (if you turn hints "on" in the options menu). The in-game animation for the duo is stunning (just look at the difference between when Jak runs for miles or just leisurely walks along) and Jak is very easy to control with the left analog stick. Brightly colored houses and foliage, realistic texture maps, and an actual rising and setting sun immerse you in the world. Don't like the camera angle? The right analog stick let's you control your view. You learn your objectives as the game progresses, but should you forget, they are listed in the options menu as they are revealed. The quirky enemies are few at the start of the game (a great design choice as it allows you to become comfortable with controlling Jak before being attacked from all angles) but they build in number as you progress, and it becomes more challenging. At it's core, J&D is a simple "find and fetch" game ala Super Mario 64, but it's so entertaining, so imaginative, so well acted, and just ... so amazing, that even if you think you're tired of run-and-jump platform games, you will want to give this one a try. (Trust me, you'll probably want to own this just to see Daxter break-dance when you find a power-orb!) All around brilliance make this an easy recommendation for gamers who like to have fun, those who admire great design, or parents looking for something that will keep their children entertained without warping their fragile little minds. Superb!	1
A very solid game! It seems that ever since Spyro, there have been lots of immitators, but they all fell far short.  Either the controlls were jerky, there were camera problems or the game was just plain poor.  I had just played Frogger the great beyond, and it was miserable!  The wrong mix, hard to control, couldn't save on a board and whenever you jumped from under an island, you were stuck in a limbo--shutting off was the only remedy!!! Back to Jak.... I cannot say enough.  There are many cinematic cut scenes, but they are not too much and the voices are still interesting after many hours of playing.  The flight boards are tough, but fun and with practice, possible for everyone.  The first must buy that I can think of (non sport) for the PS2!!!  Challenging without being impossible; entertaining and not trite, just a great time!!	1
I don't have high expectation for this game when I bought it. I just want to have a game that my little niece can play in my PS2. You know GTA3 and Teggen are not really for little kid. After the first try I can't stop playing it. This game is so fun to play. You as Jak running around to found the power cells by solving little puzzles. Not much you can do to Dexter, but you better pay attention to what he said. The game play is great and the graphic is wonderful. And other reviewers are right, there is no load time, well almost no load time. It gives me a feeling that it is a fast pace 'Final Fantasy' game. I recommend this game to everyone from 6 to 36.	1
Crash Bandi who? Seriously, Naughy Dog's Jak and Daxter handily bests the Crash games in every way. With responsive contros and quest design blatantly lifted from super mario 64. J and D won't win the most original award, but if you're gonna yoink from someone, take from the best. The game does break some new ground in the realm of disc loading times, specifically, the lack thereof. All of the game's many stages flow smoothly together with no breaks. You can even stand on high vistas and look out to see several areas far in the distance impressive stuff. Those views sure are pretty, thanks to lush, attractive graphics that rival the system's best. Subtle touches, like a continuous, gradual dat to night cycle and realistic looking snow flurries add to the game's visual charm. Aural pleasures take the back seat to graphics. Music is sparse and forgettable, but the bountiful dialog will keep you away from the mute button. Also, unlike some modern action games that are over in a flash, J&D is so obviously inspired by Mario 64, i do feel obliged to dock it a few points for creativity. In fact, one of its biggest flaws, a serious shortage of bosses, is a direct holdover from Nintendo's classic. But overall, it's an impressive effort. No other Play Station 2 platformer comes close this holiday season.	1
SSX Tricky is awsome. This game has Eddie, Elise, Mac, Moby, Brodi, Kaori, Zoe, Seeiah, Psymon, Luther, JP, Marisol, and Mix Master Mike. The course are Garibaldi, Snowdream, Elisam Alps, Mesablanca, Mercury City, and more. The game has good graphics. IT is great racing game with the world's best and terrific tricks. This game u can do 180's to 1800's. This game has a code for Mix Master Mike which is Hold R+L and press A(2),Z,A(2),Z,A(2),Z,A(2),Z and relase L+R. This game was rated by professionals at gaming for one the best Gamecube game ever made. I love watching some of the peoles ranking tapes when your character gets a better ranking. Don't listen to the other who say the game is bad. The game is way better than Dark Summit. Dark Summit is not as god as SSX Tricky.  It has good tricks. I like this game, because you do races and trick. You can unlock many characters. You unlock many levels. Pipedream is a good trick level. You get an accual level. If you've played Street or Tony Hawk Skater, you like this game. You can get almost 1,000,000 points on Tokyo Megaplex or Garibaldi. You can get many new outfits. Don't stop. When you get Master ranking you get Master outfit and a better board (You can get a new board every time you go up 1 ranking. It's cool watching videos when you get Master ranking. Uber Tricks are awesome to watch espially Eddie's. The best Uber I can do is with Mac and it's Walk the Dog. You when get a full Tricky boost. Starters are best off to stay as Eddie, Mac, Elise, and Moby until you get Master Ranking for one of them. This an amazing game. It one of the best game plays for GameCube. You have  12 snowboarders. Don't buy it for PS2, because you have the amazing graphics. Don't buy Dark Summit either, because it's not as spectacular. The only bad thing is that they sometimes have mild language, but it doesn't matter so much. This the most spectacular snowboarding game. It is a long time to beat it. Racing is fun, because you have to win 1st 3 times. Showoff is also amazing, because you have grinds. You also have multiplyers in this. Yellow stands for 2x, orange is 3x, and red is 5x. The trick book is also really useful, because can learn the best tricks. Trick book chapters 6 is based on each person's Uber tricks. I like the worm for Eddie, Walk the Dog for Mac, and La La La Lock for Elise, because they're worth so much. All of the Uber Trick are worth at least 13,000 and the most is 21,000. Don't buy Dark Summit, but buy the most spectacular snowboarding game, SSX Tricky.	1
This game is very entertaining and has a lot of replay value as it did on PS2 and Xbox. The trix are mad and disobey all laws of gravity and the characters have famous celebrity voices from the likes of Lucy Liu and David Arquette. The easier earlier courses are good but the later ones are just insane! The tricks are quite easy to pull off and the racing action is great too. Overall this is a great game as it was on PS2 but it is slightly inferior to it's predecessor which is not what Gamcube fans want. The system is more powerful than the PS2 and i think this title was just rushed to make an early release before making any improvements on the graphics and some of the controls could have been better. Great game but next time i hope EA makes a better effort with ports from PS2 to to GC. But still if u never played it before on PS2 buy this and "get tricky!"	1
Do you like snowboarding? Do you like racing games? Do you like game where you have to bust out tricks to get high scores? Chances are you answered yes to at least one of these questions. If so then you gotta play this game. This game has it all, racing, fighting, busting out big tricks and even some funny characters. Graphics are this games specialty. The levels look amazing. The characters you play each have a vast amount of funny and rude remarks to add a bit of comedy to the game. Tricks are another important part of the game, with each character having his or her own tricks the game never gets old. You will feel like you are playing a whole new game with each character you pick.   Now don't get me wrong this is a great game but it does have it's downsides. The anouncer person doesn't do a great job of calling out the tricks and he is well annoying at times. The control and trick execution takes a while to get use to. Also there are very limited gameplay. There is a single session where you can do stunt mode, race, or time trial, and there is a championship mode where you can compete to unlock new levels, boards, outfits, etc.   I think this game is a must have for most gamers and definetely a must have for snowboarding fans. With it's over the top style and the hillarious characters SSX Tricky will keep you coming back for more.	1
After hours of play, I still don't get tired of this game (My thumbs and fingers may argue with that statement.)  First off, unless you don't plan on ever shutting down your NCube, invest the extra 15 bucks in a memory card.  As you progress by perfecting tricks, bettering your times, and gaining access to new characters and equipment, you'll only be pulled in more. Also, you'll be able to access areas you could not acheive when you were just a puny begginer. SSX Tricky definitely has replay appeal, and is also fun to challenge a friend to a little board bashing.  Soon you'll be thinking to yourself "I could absolutely do this on the slopes." I did.  Thank goodness wearing a full leg cast doesn't effect my controller abilities.  Now if I can just teach the cat to plug the controller back in.	1
I got this game ... at [the store] and I can say I am not disappointed. To tell you the truth, I don't really like snowboarding games that much. (This is the first one I ever bought, I played 1080 Snowboarding at a friends house.) However, it was better than I expected, but not perfect. Graphics: 9/10 The Graphics are pretty good. I have seen better in other Gamecube games, but this will have to do. Sound: 10/10 This is SSX Tricky's best attribute. The music was custom made for this game by various artists. After listning for a while (during game play)I have to say that it is amazing music. Control: 10/10 The control is also very nice. Turning is easily accomplished and it is easy to perform a trick, but hard tricks get much harder to perform. This offers enough challenge for everyone. Gameplay: 9/10 The game has eight normal coarses that need to be unlocked by winning races in race mode or by getting enough points in showoff mode. There are two extra coarses that when unlocked, can only be accessed in Practice mode. (This is something I do not like too much.) Speaking of modes, there are three main modes. Practice, World Circuit and Single Race. Each can be accessed with one or two players except World Circuit. World Circuit is the were you can race in competitions and try to unlock more level. In Single Race, you can race against the computer or a friend in one race. In practice mode, you can race just for fun by yourself or with a friend. (no computers.) You can also do trick practice in practice mode. This allows you to try to perform all the tricks in the game. Fun Factor: 9/10 Each of the coarses is a fast-paced race or trick fest to the bottom. SSX Tricky is not a realistic game, but is more of a no physics at all, type of game. Even if you are not a major fan of snowboarding, I still recommend picking this up. You will not be disappointed. I know I sure wasn't. If you have ever read any of my reviews you will know the scoring system is always: Graphics: 10% Sound: 05% Control: 25% Gameplay: 30% Fun Factor: 30% SSX Tricky got the following scores: Graphics: 9(.9) Sound: 10(.5) Control: 10(2.5) Gameplay: 9(2.7) Fun Factor: 9(2.7) Final Score: 9.3 rounds to a 9!	1
I became an SSX fan when it was thrown in with the PS2 bundle that I bought at Amazon.com. I wasn't a skating fan before, but I found SSX to be an excellent game that was highly addictive. The same is true for SSX Tricky, the latest snowboarding game from EA Sports. SSX Tricky is an improvement in pretty much every area over SSX (although keep in mind, I am comparing the PS2 version of SSX to the GameCube version of SSX Tricky), and the few flaws that were retained from SSX or introduced in this version are far outweighed by the quality of play and graphics. If you've not played SSX before, the concept is simple - start by choosing one of a few riders, enter races, win to unlock tracks, boards, and riders. You get medals for placing first, second, or third in the final heat of a race or by beating specific scores in Showoff mode. As you gain experience, you add points to your rider's abilities - these abilities, combined with the board your rider uses, make it easier to speed, turn, do tricks, and stay on your board when you get a shove. SSX Tricky takes each area of SSX and expands it a little. There are two new tracks, a beginner track and an expert track, and the others exist basically as they did before, but with more detail, rails, jumps, and tricks. Most of the characters were carried over from the original, although some of them have markedly different personalities now (I liked the old Zoe better than this one), and new characters have been added too. Personalities? One of the big changes is that the behavior of your rider is more significant. In SSX, your rider made comments as he or she did their thing, but the main sound came from the music in the background and the announcer, who's the same this time around. In SSX Tricky, your riders make more comments, and the background music is quieter by default. However, the biggest change there is that you now have "friends" and "rivals." Rivals are more likely to knock you down during a race. If you knock people down yourself, you increase their aggressiveness toward you. That carries over to future races, so you may not necessarily want to knock down everyone in sight. I haven't yet figured out how to make people more friendly. Successfully knocking people down is one way to fill your familiar "boost meter," in addition to the time-honored tradition of pulling off tricks. The bigger the trick, the more boost you get. You can still use it for turbo, but this time, it's more important than that. When you fill the meter, you start a 20-second timer. During this time, if you catch enough air, you can pull off an uber trick, which is worth significantly more in points than the others. Complete six tricks and you get unlimited boost and uber potential for the rest of the race. Let the time expire or wipe out and you have to fill your meter again. Wiping out in any event will reduce your boost meter, as will using Y to bring your character back on track (if you've fallen into a giant ravine, are way off course, or are stuck). Once you get to some of the more advanced tracks, you'll need to pull off uber tricks to get medals in Showoff mode. Remember that uber tricks are like regular tricks in that they can be part of combos and that you get half credit for repeating a trick, one-third credit for the second repeat, and so on. Another improvement is that individual statistics are kept for each rider - their best time and score on each track, along with medals they have, and their best performance in each of a number of categories, including knockdowns, number of each kind of trick, and rail, grab, and air time. I like records because they give you something else to go after if you're stuck in a rut or have unlocked everything. There are also bios on each rider as well as a movie that can be unlocked if you reach Master level with a rider. Trick books work differently now. In SSX, you had three levels of tricks, and you could complete them in any order, if you could figure them out. Remember how Hiro's trick book was messed up? Well, in SSX Tricky, you have to complete them one chapter at a time. Each chapter contains 5 tricks, so with 6 chapters, you have fewer tricks to complete, and you don't get credit for pulling off a triple back flip from chapter 3 if you're still on chapter 2. It also seems as though there is less variation in the trick books - everyone has basically the same tricks in chapters 1 and 2, but starting with chapter 3, you get some originality. One nice new feature is that you can pause the game during a run, bring up your trick book, and see right there what combo you need to pull off. In the past, you either had to write it down, buy a hint book, or have a really good memory. I did mention flaws. Some of them existed in SSX, like the annoying thing about Alpine riders where you really need to go forward, because the board isn't symmetric front-to-back like a Freestyle or BX board, but it slows you down to turn around, and you can't always tell which way it'll turn you. Because you're going the same way, you really can only do half of the tricks that another board will let you do, because you don't have the option to do a Switch trick (off the opposite foot). On that note, because the GameCube controller has three trigger buttons instead of the four the PS2 has, this version allows for fewer in-air variations, so you have to be more careful about repeating tricks. I also disagree about some places that it insists are out-of-bounds. All in all, though, those are minor complaints. The combination of the more in-depth tracks, better graphics, and uber tricks makes for some really interesting racing, both for spectators and players. Also, I really appreciate the uber-tricks because they make it possible to get the higher scores on some of the more difficult tracks like Elysium Alps. In SSX, you pretty much had to nail every 5x crystal to get a gold, because you had no other way of getting big points. Now, with the right jumps, you can use uber tricks to make up for that. You still need to learn the shortcuts and alternate routes to get the big points and quick times - and you may need a different route in Showoff mode than the one you took in Race mode. The graphics also add something else to the characters, showing a little more of the story behind them ... in more ways than one. The scene that's played when Elise moves up a rank is, um, interesting. There's definitely a feel of designed-by-teenage-guys to this game. Overall, this is a really good sequel to SSX. I'm sure the PS2 and Xbox versions are good as well, but I would definitely recommend this game. I've got three other GameCube games, none of which has managed to hold my attention, and right now, they're all patiently waiting by the TV for SSX Tricky to leave the spotlight. I think it'll be a while before that happens.	1
Bottom Line THIS GAME IS AWESOME its Breathe TAKING!!!! Performing the InSaNe TrIx and getting a STANDING OVATION its a real RUSH 4 a game!!!!! Do yourself or another a favor and purchase this GAME u will not REGRET it even if u dislike SNOWBOARDING this game is UNBELIEVEBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Yes, you can use Monster's adapter, but I am happy with this one by Microsoft. It is only $20 and has outputs for my component cables as well as an Optical output for 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. It comes with some cheap component video cables but it gets the job done. People may complain that it is not shielded, but it honestly did not make a difference for me as I don't have it lying next to any power cords or speakers.	1
If you're going to have an Xbox on an HDTV you probably need this. The picture isn't HD quality like an Xbox360 or PS3 but its much much better than RF, Composite, or Svideo.	1
this just plugged into the old school XBOX (not the 360) and let it live on for a little longer. The picture quality on a HDTV is adequate and it is great that my son can play his favorite game with friends Star Wars Battlefront on parties. It is tough to find fun 4 player shooters for the newer consoles.	1

When I first bought mu HDTV this Feb.  The picture from Xbox looked like crap.  It was blurry and distorted.  I bought this product last Friday, and now Xbox looks better then ever.  The games in HD look even better also, even the games that are not in HD look great.  If you have an HDTV and still want to play Xbox you must buy this item.	1
I saw this in the store the other day and decided to try it out since I have a 53inch HDTV.  I wasn't expecting much but I was really suprised at the difference in pictures vs. the standed AV cable that came with the XBOX.  After hooking it up, I went to my XBOX control panel to enable 1080i.  While I didn't see much difference in Rainbow Six 3, when I popped Madden in, I immediately noticed a difference.  The picture seems a lot crisper and sharp, I must say I am plesantly suprised.  I then decided to try NCAA football.  With the standard AV cable I always found NCAA to be rather grainy and sort of blurry, but after playing the game with the HDAV Pack, the game looked much much better.  No more graininess, the picture is as clear as can be.  I will have to play Halo for the 100000th time to see if I notice a difference in that as well. This product is worth all 1,999 pennies that it costs.  For those that say you can't tell the difference I don't know what to say.  Remember to enable it in your XBOX control panel or it won't work.  I'm not sure how this works with regular TVs if at all, so that may be your problem too.  This is a must have for HDTV owners.  OK I am so stupid.  Nearly 3 years after getting this thing, I just now realized that this pack also has an optical connection for digital audio sound.  I have no idea why it took me so long to realize this, but now that I have, I plugged in an optical cable to my receiver, and my XBOX games are now able to be enjoyed all over again, true surround sound, the way XBOX games are meant to be played.  This makes this even more worth the money.	1
If you have an HDTV or a 5.1 surround sound system, you'll need this to experience the XBox to its fullest. For only (about) $20, this gives you all the cables you need.  However, if you want to use the optical digital output, you'll need to supply your own cable.  Also, if you're a cable snob you might want to pick up some higher quality cables.  Personally, I think the cables included are just fine.	1
If you have an HDTV you can't miss out on this (or if you have a bit more cash, the component monster cables). When compared with the standard video cables that comes with Xbox, this is awesome. I noticed a great difference in picture and sound quality (when using a fiber optic cable).  Make sure to go set up the xbox properly after you connect the cables.  (Go into the settings and turn on the high definition capabilities and the dolby/dts sound) If you are into quality then you cant miss this product.	1
If you have an HDTV why wouldn't you want the highest quality possible?	1
As of a couple of days ago, I own all three of the microsoft made video packs.  The standard cables out of the box are great for standard cables: well made with a thick gauge.  I was using the S-video cables for months as I was alternating my Xbox and my PS2 through my s-video jack in the front of my TV.  I was very happy with my S-video hookups, but it was the DVD playback that made me go with the HDTV package. I already owned some very high end component cables I bought here in Japan (they take their cables and wire very seriously over here), so I'm using those instead of the ones that came in the box.  I can't rave enough about this kind of flexibility.  The PS2 component cables seem flimsy in comparison, and with them, what you see is what you get.  No chance of using your own or upgrading. I could have shelled out more dollars for the Monster, but why bother when I already have some superior cables?  I've got a 36" Sony Wega and let me tell you, my games and DVD's look incredible.  I even replaced my old JVC DVD player with my Xbox and now use it as my full-time DVD player.  The picture looks so much better. What I find even more impressive is a function I can't even use.  If I had an HDTV, the Xbox has settings and options for high definition playback which only show up after you've plugged in the HDTV box.  Made me wish, not for the first or last time, that I'd spent a little more cash and gotten the XBR Wega.  If you have HDTV and you don't have HDTV hookups for your Xbox, you are missing oput big time.  If you can afford an HDTV, you can afford this pack, so get one immediately, it's quite choice.	1
Microsoft has given us a very powerful and versatile game machine in the Xbox!!!  The basic system is great, but with all the extra accessories we begin to see and appreciate the true power under the Xbox hood. The High Definition AV Pack allows us to improve and get a glimpse of the Xbox's potential.  This Pack only gives us in a normal TV environment, 480i (480 interlaced horizontal lines), component video with 2 channel stereo. NOTE: you must have a component video receiver!! Now the magic begins!!!  If you have a HDTV w/component progressive scan (480p) & VSS (Virtual Surround Sound) or DTS (Digital Theatre System) standby because the Xbox's power is about to begin. Component video - a 3 wire (w/grounds) UNSHIELDED CABLE; (Y) - Luminance (Brightness), (Pb) - Crominance (Color-Blue) & (Pr) - Crominance (Color-Red).  By separating your Blue & Red colors provides a more pure signal to your TV/HDTV where it is combined through comb filters for the sharpest picture presentation.  Basically provides either a 480i (interlaced-analog) horizontal lines or 480p (progressive scan (line doubler)horizontal lines. NOTE: You must have HDTV & DTS for the 480p and digital 5.1 to be unleashed.  Games are 480p (outstanding picture quality) where as movies are only 480i (normal DVD presentation- excellent picture). A great economical accessory to enjoy the Xbox power !!!!	1
This product worked fine for the first month, but then I started getting periodic video glitches, usually in the form of a "streak" or smear running from high-contrast objects (like football players) all the way to the right edge of the screen. Soon after that, the video started going black-and-white and even sometimes would black out completely for a couple seconds at a time. This happened during 3 different games. It turned out to be the cheap cables Microsoft ships with this. Wiggling and repositioning them helped, but you'll want to replace them with higher quality cables at the first sign of trouble.	-1
There seems to be a lot of misinformation with regard to this HDAV Pack.  After having installed and played with it, I will try to set the record right.  The pack is all-inclusive.  That is to say for twenty bucks, it contains all the cables you need to connect to your HD ready TV.  The cables that are included are very basic unshielded component video (3) and RCA audio (2).  With this pack, the best you can do right now is a vertical resolution of 480 lines because the output of the setup screen and all the current games, even Halo, are only NTSC and do not take advantage of the potential capability of 1080 lines of resolution.  So don't believe those who claim to run Halo at 1080i.  That is not to say, however, that Halo at 480 lines isn't gorgeous.  Ultimately, if you have an HDTV, you need this pack to take advantage of it.	1
Don't get me wrong, the XBox is cool. But to really make it stand out from the PS/2 you must have this AV Pack (not to mention a digitial TV and a Dolby Digital/DTS Reciever). The XBox supports multiple HD formats (depending on the game) and does real-time encoding of Dolby Digital 5.1. This make games like Halo go from pretty darn cool to mind-blowingly AWESOME! There is one minor pitfall. If you select a HD format your TV doesn't support, your only indication of the problem is a blank screen when you start the game.	1
A previous review suggests you get the Monster Cable product, which is fine except they are not really competing products. You buy this AV pack if you want DD 5.1 Surround or if you already have a S-Video cable around. The Monster Cable gets you good old Stereo, not exactly why I bought an XBox. Also, Sony PS2 can only output 5.1 Surround in the Full Motion Video (FMV) sequences, not in the actual gameplay. And let me tell you, Halo in 5.1 with an S-Video connection is amazing and totally addicting!	1
If you have S-Video and optical audio capabilities, you have no choice but to buy this adapter.  The audio is the beauty of the connection.  There is no substitute for surround sound.	1
The product picture doesn't show everything that comes with this kit.  It also includes an S-Video/RCA cable that will connect the audio and s-video to your system.  What it DOES NOT include is the fiber-optic digital audio cable which is a must have if you have a Dolby Digital AV system. I can't tell you how much better the sound is with Dolby Digital enabled.  You've got to hear it to believe it. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that you can't use one of the cheaper coax digital cables, but instead have to fork out another $ for the fiber optic cable.	1
The decision is simple: if you have a TV that support S-video, you should get this pack.  If you have a surround sound system, you should get this pack.  I bought it to enhance the video (don't have a hi-fi at home), and boy, what a difference it makes, for both games and DVD movies.  Just make sure your TV does have an S-video input.  Definitely worth it.	1
For those of you that don't know (and as I've recently discovered there are a few of you), there are a few ways of improving the already exceptional performance of the X-Box.  The best bang for your buck is the advance AV pack which allows you to upgrade from those yellow, red, and white AV cables, which are standard for almost all home entertainment equipment, to S-video and dolby digital. I was originally planning to order the monster component video cables which are far more expensive, but offer the very best in performance.  Eventually I decided to go with S-video instead because my 36" Sony Wega has s-video hookups in the front, as does my second TV, and the televisions of all my friends whose houses I sometimes take my box.  When I saw this product on the shelf for half the price of the monster hook-ups, I bought it impulsively and I'm very pleased with the results. For those with very high-end equipment, HDTV, or those willing to shell out a little extra dough, there's no substitute for Monster.  For the rest of us, this little set-up does the job quite nicely.  I've got a decent system: 36" Sony Wega, Onkyo receiver and Polk speakers, and it feels like I'm finally getting all my money out of my Xbox. After playing these game for two months with the standard cables, the difference is stunning.  The Dolby Digital sound is immersive and incredible.  There's just no comparison.  The superior video actually makes some games easier to play.  S-Video improves the depth, clarity and color, allowing you to see distant objects clearly, which is important when playing Halo or Gotham Racer.  You can see creatures clearly or the outlines of an impending turn allowing you better reaction time.  A surprising benefit, but a welcome one. While I'm satisfied with this inexpensive little product, there's a few things you should know:  if you want dolby digital sound, you'll need to buy an optical cable seperately.  If you can afford HDTV, you can definitely afford Monster component cables, so do yourself a favor and buy them.  If you're new to things like S-video and aren't sure what they are, make sure your TV has at least one S-video inlet.  If you have a mid-range TV built in the last 4 years, you probably do, but know what your TV can do before you buy any of the available wires.	1
I bought the Monster cable XGL-LW100 (fiber cable) in conjunction with the Monster XGL200 (rca video and audio), and Dolby Digital simply did not work. This was not the case of me not setting the option in Dashboard - Settings, the XBOX simply did not recognize the cable as implementing Dolby Digital. This is very disappointing, I have been a loyal Monster Cable customer for as long as I can remember, and their product simply didn't work. Microsoft XBOX support knows of these problems, and the tell you to get the Microsoft kits, so buyer beware on the Monster Cable solutions, they don't work on all XBOX's. I returned both the XGL200 and the XGL-LW100 for the Microsoft Advanced AV kit and got Acoustic Research fiber cable and gold plated RCA video cable and I enjoy Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS from my XBOX now. Couple things to set straight. This box in includes the following connection: S-Video, RCA Video and Audio, Optical Out. The Microsoft Advanced AV kit includes the breakout box and basic cables to hook up S-Video and RCA audio, but not a fiber cable or RCA video cable.	1
Pumpkins.  You get to shoot pumpkins.  And go to bowling alleys!!! How cool is that???  Besides most of the vehicles from TM2 are back, and who doesn't like TM2???  Do not worrry, you want be dissapointed with this game, buy it!!!  And by the way, people may think this game is babyish, but it's rated T!! It's not babyish and perfect for all ages.	1
like game, haven't play for long time ago same with tm as twisted metal 2-4. no idea to say more	1
thank you for having this game and in its good condition you have increased my collection of games by one	1
This is a game that I bought for my grandson and he just loves to play it. l would recommend to buying it as it is very action pack.	1
This was one of my favorite games when I was younger, and it's still just as much fun as I remember.	1
Great game and great story.  Very fun to play but not as good as Twisted Metal II, "In my opinion the best one out of the series."	1
This game isn't that great. I didn't like the characters. The worlds in this one is retarded and it was an easy game. But it's still better than parts 1 and 2.	-1
Out of all the Twisted Metal games that has ever come out, Twisted Metal: Small Brawl is the one you'll hear the least about. Yet, in my opinion, is about one of the most fun of them all to play. It came out after Twisted Metal Black. It's easy to see that this game is pointed more toward the younger crowd but, being a Twisted Metal fan, I loved it just the same.  In this game, Calypso is a schoolyard bully who harasses the characters into joining in an RC car version of the Twisted Metal contest. All of the game's drivers  are all children who attend the same grade school as him.  They all command miniature versions of the cars they drive when they get older. Eleven characters are available from the get go with 5 more to unlock, having mostly every one of your favorites in the roster. There's 8 levels to battle in..Playground Peril, Carn-o-maul, Easy Death Oven, Minigolf Mayhem, Meat your Maker, Gridiron Gore, Treetop Rumble and Now Slaying!. It's a younger, more lighthearted approach to the Twisted Metal formula but fun. I love it.	1
It arrived by the delivery date and it was a great game.	1
Got it brand new. Love it.	1
item arrived on time.item was as described.	1
ax Payne was a shooter which implemented bullet-time for the first time. But what's even more original about the title, is that it's a shooter with a story.	1
I USED TO HAVE MAX PAYNE ON MY ORIGINAL XBOX AND I HAVE BEAT IT SEVERAL TIMES BUT I GREW ANNOYED WITH THE BLOOD MAZE LEVEL AND ENDED UP BREAKING MY XBOX, YEARS LATER I AM GLAD TO ADD MAX PAYNE TO MY COLLECTION AGAIN, I LOVE THE GAMEPLAY AND I LOVE BULLET TIME AND THIS IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE  OF THE SERIES ALTHOUGH I HAVE YET TO PLAY MAX PAYNE 3, SO GLAD TO HAVE THIS GAME BACK IN MY COLLECTION!	1
It's an old XBOX game that wouldn't work on my XBOX 360 console.  That's the risk you run getting old games.	-1
Max Payne only has bullets and retribution. His family, murdered by junkies, he sets out to wipe the city of the drug that cost them their lives, opening a story that reeks of bullets, slow motion shootouts and dark narration.  Framed for murder a fellow detective, Payne remains undercover within a mob family to discover the truth. Among the bullet cases Max meets some interesting characters, such as twin assassin Mona Sax, the mysterious Alfred Wooden and various trigger happy mobsters from separate feuding mob families. The story itself, set amongst a typical revenge/vendetta genre, unfolds smoothly with dreams of past events appearing between acts, perfect for the John Woo or Tarantino film enthusiasts. Payne sums up events & various conversations through his dark narration, a true gem of the entire adventure. The uncommon comic storyboards replace modern cuts scenes set the perfect noir tone.  This third person shooter features good graphics although characters don't have any facial expressions, some have rag doll mechanics while others appear stiff as a board; however both of these features hardly affect game play or enjoyment. Controls handle fine, a click of the control pad brings up the vast amount of weapons one can carry & trigger a strong characteristic: bullet time. A fun, serious advantage over the resourceful A.I. that allows you to take out multiple enemies, duck for cover or continue your current life, best part being it replenishes with every kill. Weapons all appear to be very closely patterned after their real life counter parts, sounding great as you run for cover and return fire.  Max Payne is a great rental. For those who love high difficulty challenges, it's a must have and will get their money's worth here. The look of a simple shooter, united with great narration, graphic novel cut scenes that play perfectly to the violent story, atmosphere, mythology overtone & film noir references that plaque the story, Payne is a standout title, one that is a joy to play. The hero's pain has only begun.  Last Words: B, Payne like this is so enjoyable it's hard not to like it.	1
I love the atmosphere of this game. It's very dark, foreboding and spooky. The graphics still rock. If you like these type of games, then I definitely recommend Max Payne.	1
Wow did it come fast. Just in 2 days. The game when i got it looked brand new (without the plastic wrap) and the case is a clear dark green which is cool. (not like an original xbox case. More like a clear xbox one) Works great and the game is fun. Thought i should start out with the first Max Payne before Max Payne 3 comes out	1
When Sam Lake released in 2001 his first video game, Max Payne's success was incredible. With its numerous trophies that recognized its incredible drama and writing, the dark story of a NYPD detective whose american dream is destroyed by a horrible tragedy became a classic of the video game. Filled with references from asian action movies, the Matrix and even David Lynch works (ex:Lost Highway), this action game has been adapted for the X-Box console, and also for the X Box 360 as a downloadable game on X Box Live. So far, I think the transfer to the XBox works very well. For example, the controls and the camera are easy to use and the game offers enough replay thanks to its various levels of difficulties one can select at the start of the game. Though some would complain that the level design is a little bit dated today, I disagree with them for I think that Same Lake managed to put what sometimes game designers don't put in certain great-looking video games. And by that I mean that Sam Lake put in his game an atmosphere, a tension in the story, the dialogues, its comic book cinematics and an upsetting presence in Max Payne's nightmares, essential scenes to the narration of the game.  Unlike Alan Wake, which is rated for teens, this game is definitely not for younger players for it is rated for mature audiences only. With all its drug references, dark occult cults and psychotic characters, I think this game may not be a relaxing treat for those that want to play relaxing game. I'm saying this because I read many reviews for Alan Wake where gamers were a bit upset by the atmosphere of Alan Wake. But playing a Sam Lake video game is never a comfortable ride. It is a strange and terrifying world, but it is one where you find great scripts, voice-acting, soundtrack, visuals, and most of all, excellent plots, unlike what the reviewer Bob Andrews is saying.  A great way to start for those that want to see more of Sam Lake's universe and excellent prose.	1
The story for the game is gritty,cynical and basically dark. The story is one that is ever present in movies if you've ever seen the movie "Mad Max" its kind of the same premise except this game takes place in an urban setting and deals more with drugs, the criminal underworld, and sinister corparate figures. The gameplay is satisfying with alot of slow mo gun fights and alot of weapons to choose from making it a entertaining ride from start to finish. This game is buy no questions asked and be sure to pick up its sequel.	1
This game was one of my all time favorites but I couldn't find a good copy until now.  Came in great condition and it plays well too.  Awesome game and great graphics!!	1
Max Payne is a phenomenal game. I got this back in 2004 when I got my XBOX and it is truly one of the best XBOX games of all time. The series was multiplatform as it was on the ps2 but was far superior on the XBOX. Controls and graphics were a lot better on the XBOX version. Gameplay ? Thats what this game is about intense fun and never a dull moment. This is the type of game when you pick it up you do not stop playing until you beat it and thats no joke.  Sound is good enough. The story is great and thats coming from someone that is turned off by video game stories. Every approach to this game is great. From the graphics to the characters there is not much here to gripe about.  If you are going to get Max Payne 3 when it comes out do yourself a favor and go back and pick this up. You will not regret it.	1
This game was better on the PC, but the Xbox version was really fun as well.  I loved the action sequences and the storyline is top-knotch.  I did not care for the ending, and the part where you are drugged up and have to walk through the maze is a miserable experience to say the least.  Other than those incidents, this game is incredible.  Enemy AI is great, and the graphics are fantastic.  You MUST experience the 'bullet-time' to appreciate this game in its fullest.  I highly recommend this game if you are looking for something that is different than just "shoot 'em up."	1
Max Payne and its bullet time was the first game to allow the gamer to experience this innovative concept!  What a breath of fresh air!  I love the comic book picture storytelling and the linear story.  Like reading a detective novel.  Very interesting.	1
The best thing Max Payne has going for it is a tremendously effective immediate atmosphere. From moment one, you feel like you're a part of this gritty, grimy, underground world. You're convinced that drippy, rusty pipes and dirty snow are the only constants in your own life, and all of that helps to make the central character, Max himself, much more understandable and sympathetic. All of the little things work together, from the graphics to the storytelling to the various ambient sounds to the characters themselves, to paint this immersive picture of a city overflowing with criminals, corrupt cops, self-centered politicians and very few true good guys. Even Max himself is far from a squeaky clean do-gooder, and seems more like a comedically poetic Punisher than a Superman as he fires out one overly wordsmithed sentence after another like so many dirt-encrusted bullets. Really, Max only distances himself from the guys on the receiving end of his wrath through an admirable drive to discover the truth and a tragic origin, and this lack of any true, identifiable hero works toward that aforementioned greater good, delivering a more realistic setting and allowing the story to take some liberties with its subject that would have otherwise been taboo.  Max's tale plays like a solid motion picture; you come in just as the action gets interesting (a rookie cop living the "American Dream" comes home one night to discover a set of intruders in his house, and fails to gun them down before they slaughter his wife and infant child) and hang around as the anti-hero quickly loses his inhibitions and his mind, accepting an undercover job that predictably goes bad and leaves him cut off in the middle of a criminal underworld that feels he's betrayed them. The story is compelling, and is always laid out in one of two ways; either through a live-rendered cutscene in between scenarios or by way of a series of narrated, graphic novel-reminiscent storyboards. It's nothing new to see a game featuring speaking parts in the middle of a mission any more, but the paneled storyboard work that serves to bookend each sub-level is an interestingly novel concept that somehow manages to avoid the cheesiness you'd think it would be drowning in. Although the frames themselves are obviously based off of source photography, and that photography looks like nothing more than a half dozen programmers and their friends out goofing off on the streets and occasionally shooting stills for a game they happen to be working on, there's a certain charm to these pages that helps the player to further identify with the events that are going on within. It's a nice break from all of the tense, blood and guts action of the rest of the game to sit back and take in a quick comic book-based scene, even if that scene does happen to involve just as much blood and violence as the gameplay.  As Payne slowly begins to lose friends and brain cells, he also begins to lose his focus on reality and slides into several amazing, if frustratingly tedious, hallucinogenic nightmares and fantasies. These are the scenes that really help to set the storyline apart from its peers, while at the same time dragging its gameplay a notch or two below that universal standard. The world spins hazily and blurrily around you, your field of vision is always clouded by a sort of dizzying grey cloud, things seem to move just a little bit too fluidly, and time slows to a crawl... they really are some of the best in-game visualizations of a dream-like state I've ever seen, and are crawling with the same sort of bloody, twisted, hopeless tone that fills the rest of the game. You'll hear the last wails unleashed by Max's wife and the occasional wounded scream of his child off in the murky depths, and the first three or four times they'll send shivers down your spine. Once you're on your sixteenth jaunt through the area, they'll grow more than a little annoying. Still, if it weren't for these little bits and pieces of horror, the game would tread dangerously close to straight action, with no respite.  Gameplay itself is slick and easy to master, with the first few levels acting as a great primer for what's to come. There's no real "lock-on" mechanism, as is so prevalent in similar games, but there is Payne's infamous "bullet time" function, which makes the process of aiming precisely at a moving target a bit less hairy. If you've seen The Matrix, then you probably already knew what I was talking about when I said "bullet time" and thus don't need a more detailed explanation, but for those who haven't; Max leaps into the air in some sort of dramatic, gun-wielding swan dive, and from the moment he leaves the ground until the moment he touches dirt again, time slows to a crawl. It's the same sort of thing that was employed previously in Conker's Bad Fur Day and made you groan when you saw a CGI cow performing it in the trailer for Kung Pow a few years ago, but is actually handled with some restraint so that it doesn't feel all that gimmicky and truly blends in as a helpful new gameplay element. You get a limited amount of "bullet time" to dole out, (exactly how much depends upon the difficulty level you've chosen) so you're not doing it over and over and over again, and you're given enough control of your actions in the middle of a dive to keep it from being an easy, surefire kill every single time.  Payne's graphics have long been hailed as a measuring stick of sorts for the Box, and while I'll certainly agree that they're far above the standards set during the N64-PSone war, they haven't aged all that well as this generation's battles near their end. The textures and character animations have become almost run-of-the-mill over the years, and while that may say a thing or two about the game's long-lasting impact on the industry and the trends it may or may not have set, it doesn't necessarily come across that way when played for the first time today. The characters themselves have always appeared to me as though they lacked real weight and mass. They look like scarecrows, especially in profile, with regularly-sized heads and hands, but stick arms and bodies with thick clothes just draped over to give the illusion of substance. The facial textures, while beautiful, don't look particularly professional and feel more like user-submitted skins wrapped around the same body several times over. The constant smirk adorned by Max himself only serves to further reinforce this sensation. The environmental textures that wow you from the ground level don't carry over as the skyscrapers near the roof level, and while that's not something you'll notice in the game's first few levels, later stages take place almost exclusively atop high rises and warehouses, where the poor walls are featured, front and center. Building interiors are sufficiently varied, with little bits and pieces of black humor thrown in like a porno poster on the wall or a hidden video camera facing the bedroom behind a false wall in a seedy hotel, but occasionally distract you with sealed doorways that look identical to the doors you'll need to be breaking open or casually pushing aside as the game progresses. This isn't a bad looking game, but I wouldn't say it's deserving of excessive praise, either. It's close, but the effort and attention to detail seems to drip away as you reach the later levels.  The sound, especially the voice-over work, is very well done. Although the majority of the game is merely accompanied by ambient noise, (and, more often than not, screaming and gunfire) you'll occasionally run into some music or white noise that is particularly effective in setting a mood or getting a laugh. The programs running on the few functional televisions you'll discover are especially funny, and smack of the kind of comedy you'd expect from the various radio stations in modern chapters of Grand Theft Auto. When somebody's speaking, which is really quite often, the voices suit the situations almost shockingly well. Payne himself sports a deep, gritty, exceptionally noir-detective baritone, and pounds out the game's sometimes over-the-top dialogue to terrific results. Sometimes I have trouble discerning whether this game was meant to be a revival of the noir genre or a parody of it, as the acting varies from extremely camp to chillingly effective, and that's a fun line to walk as the events progress.  Playing a game of Max Payne is like owning a passably good movie on DVD. It's not great, it won't be bringing home any Oscars and it isn't quite my definition of an epic, must-see production; it is solid entertainment for a couple of nights. You'll pop it in once in a while when you don't want to have to think about anything in particular, and it'll deliver a fun time. It's got just enough depth to keep you motivated throughout a long session, but momentarily entertaining enough not to demand your time in huge, six hour bunches. I can see how those who rushed out to pick up their copy on release day were disappointed... this isn't substantial enough a game to justify a full fifty bucks. It's short, relatively easy and overly linear. There's no immediate replay value, despite the ability to unlock a few new modes of gameplay, because they're all essentially applying questionable new rules to the exact same game. It introduced a few new gameplay elements and represented itself strongly in both visual and audio, but just doesn't have that undefinable "it" factor to push it up and above the rest of the pack. Every time the story would take a step forward, the gameplay would take a step back, and vice versa. At this point in its lifespan, and for the price you're likely to discover it for today, I'd say Payne is worth the expense, but I can see why some of my running buddies felt betrayed by it back in '01 when they were expecting another GTA, which is pretty much what it was advertised as, and got a straightforward noir-era third person shooter.	1
If you've never played a game with slow mo dives, get this then Enter the Matrix. There's a good story line was well. The problem with this is the faces don't look rite. Checkout Ninja gaidan Dead to Rights(like Max Payne)	1
I rented this game because I had heard that it was short, and yes it is now that I have had it for one day I am already halfway through the game. But there are four difficulty levels and you will want to play it time and time again because of the extreme fun and wonderful story. Yeah, the SCRIPT is a little bit crappy, NOT THE VOICE ACTING!!! Why can't people just tell the difference between voice acting and script! The voice acting is great, wonderful quality. This game really is worth buying, because it is so cheap but you could beat it just by renting. There is a very atmospheric feel to this game. NOTE TO PARENTS: This game is not very bad at all, I say that a 13 year old should be allowed to play it. Some of the cutscenes you may want to skip, but that's all. The only SC in this game is referenced, nothing is shown. If you let your children go to public schools, then they should be allowed to play this game.	1
Max Payne is definitly one of the best action games out there Pros: Sweet graphics A huge aresonal of weapons Bullet time puts enemies at your mercy Short but sweet Nice graphic Novel Cutseenes Quick save is tite(Don't need to start all the way over like in the PS2 version) Just a pure action-Shoot em up game Cons: Horrible voice acting Plot starts good, but later on, it makes no sence Not much replay value Max Payne definitly brought Hong Kong shootout action films to life on consoles with propper justice.  Altho the dialoge is just plain out horrible, the gameplay is what matters, and the gameplay is all action.  If you ever wanted a pure action game, get this; if you ever wanted to be Chow-Yun Fat, this is as close as you get; if you want a lengthy game, rent this first, cause it's not that long. Peace	1
Max Payne is one of the best 3rd person shooters ever and the gameplay takes you so far into the world it's great... To parents if your son is 13 he should be allowed to play it	1

Max Payne is a man with nothing to loose, and with his mind set on revenge... Really, this is a great game! I enjoyed it from beggining to the end. This game features bullet time and its not just a cool feature. It helps you out during the game and is essential to your success. Max Payne also has many different types of weapons including grenades, guns and a baseball bat. The story isn't really amazing but the main focus here isn't on the story. Its on the action, baby! This game has plenty of action. The storyline isn't all that bad and Max Payne faces some stunning revelations in it. The length is under fifteen hours, but that isn't too bad considering the price of Max Payne. You can get it for under $20 and considering DVD's cost as much as that and they are usually only about two hours, its a good value. So go pick up this awesome game.	1
This game is amazing, its definatley one of my favorite Xbox games that I own yet. Whats so good about it, in my opinion is that it throws you into the game right away with no special training missions u must do before being able to start the real game. The controls are easy to master and the game itself is amazing. The story plot involves a cop (max payne) who had a perfect life until he came home one day and found his wife and baby murdered. After that he goes a little crazy and decides to take on the whole entire crime under-world of New York City to see who,and why soembody did this. What i like best about the villians is that in the beggining of the game the villians are just cheap, sleazy mafia people and gangsters, but once the story really starts to unfold and your plunged into wat is going on you will be taking on swat-team type villians its all cool! The graphics are very good and the bullet time feature is amazing and unlike other games that tried to do bullet time before, this one works and really makes it seem natural and sleek and stylish. So I definatley think that you should buy this or at the least rent it and im praying that they will be making a sequel soon!	1
The answer is no, you could not. These are some of the reasons why this game is so addictive, so fun, and so brilliant: Payneful Wait Pays Off Finnish game development company Remedy Entertainment has been working on their Max-FX game engine and the Max Payne game title since late 1996, following the success of their Apogee published 2D Racer, Death Rally. From fall 1996 to fall 2001 is a long road to take from concept to finished product, and despite a seemingly endless development cycle, Max Payne has weathered the long winters and burst onto the PC gaming scene with both guns blazing. Noir to the Max One thing you don't find much of in today's action games is story. Usually the developers just give you a gentle push toward the enemy and substitute state-of-the-art graphics and level designs for things like plot and characters. In Max Payne you play Max Payne, a New York City cop whose life is torn asunder when his wife and baby are killed by psychos drugged out on a new designer drug called Valkyr. Max joins the DEA and goes undercover with the Mob hoping to discover the source of this new killer drug. Just when all the clues are starting to fall into place, Max is betrayed -- framed for killing his contact at the DEA. Now both the police and the Mob are after Max. With no place left to go and nothing left to lose, Max wages a personal war on crime, along the way uncovering a tangled web of street thugs, Mafia crime bosses, and secret government cover ups in the dank underworld of a city clutched in the grip of the century's worst blizzard. At first glance the story may seem a little trite, even clich -- framed cop seeks vengeance on the Mafia underworld only to uncover secret government conspiracy -- however, Remedy Entertainment brings it to life using comic book style story boards for the bulk of the tale. These detailed Photoshop-modified images give the story in Max Payne a gritty stylistic feel that matches the dark mood and stark realism of the game's levels. Blending these story boards more seamlessly into the game, these sequences are often triggered by a television broadcast, a clutter of loose paperwork found on a desk, or even a radio left playing in an empty office cubicle. They help bring the game's environments to life while moving the plot along at the same time. The voice acting in these sequences is top-notch, matching the noir mood of the game perfectly. Payneful Dreams Satan was here. Moving the storyline along with comic book style cut-scenes is one thing, but Max Payne takes storytelling to a new level weaving together scripted events and storyline themed levels. First you play out the opening sequence where Max's wife and baby are murdered by Valkyr-addicted drug fiends, and later in the game Max experiences two hallucinatory dream sequences. These dreams bring Max's torment to life and let the player "live" the painful memories and horrific moments that have driven him to the edge. While a few players may be put off by the mazelike quality to these levels (and that fact that you can still die -- even in a dream) they add recurring themes to the game and add depth to a character who would normally be nothing more than a gun-toting, one-liner spewing clich -- like in most 3D action games. Maximum Graphics Max Payne uses the 3rd person point-of-view perspective. This allowed the developers to pull off two shrewd special effects: the Matrix styled slow-mo "Bullet Time," and the John Woo style jumping effect known as "Shootdodge." These two effects can also be used together in one action-movie slow-motion acrobatic "Bullet Dodge Combo." Max can run into a room full of thugs and deftly dodge incoming fire by flying through the air and shooting in slow motion. While Bullet Time slows the game down -- to the point where you can see individual bullets and shotgun pellets whizzing by -- it doesn't slow down your mouse pointer -- giving Max superhuman reflexes and pinpoint accuracy. These effects have to be seen to be appreciated as they take the game to a whole new level. It really is like a John Woo movie on your PC screen. Max Payne lacks nothing in the graphics department. Levels are highly detailed and full of interactive objects that can be shot or blown up. Toilets flush, bar taps spit beer, and you can even find running water in a [cheap] flophouse. With photo realistic textures the game looks run down and gritty -- like a seedy corner bar on the bad side of town. Adding to the realism, guns have the proper bolt actions and spit out shell casings when fired. Enemy characters will react to the environment when killed, slumping over chairs or falling over tables without clipping through walls like in most games. Corpses, bullet holes, and shell casings stay in the environment for the duration of the level. No ghostlike fading away for enemies in Max Payne. The dead stay dead. Paynefully Short Max Payne does fall short in a couple of spots. The game is almost criminally short and will take the average gamer only 10 hours to solve from beginning cut-scene to ending storyboards. At a retail price of [not too expensive] Max Payne might not offer enough gaming bang for your gaming buck. When you complete the game, the extra tough "Hard Boiled" mode and the time-limited "New York Minute" gameplay mods are unlocked. However, the game plays through the same levels again with the added frustrations of not being able to skip the in-game cut-scenes. Maximum Conclusion Even if Max Payne is a little short, it is still one of the best PC games released this year. When you stack up the excellent storyline, awesome visuals, stellar special effects, and pulse-pounding gunfights, Max Payne is simply one of the most fun action games on the market today. You owe it to yourself to enter the gritty noir world of Max Payne. Just be sure you take an extra clip! [BIG DANIEL McFOOT]	1
This is the absolute best 3-D shooter out there!  It blows away anything you can think of.  The only reason (the other game) is so highlighted is because it's made by Microsoft.  I think, however, that most gamers will enjoy Rockstar's hard, edgy approach to shooters, though.  The comic-style boxed cut scenes between levels are VERY entertaining, also.	1
A terribly good value in the realm of overhyped and priced games.  It's selfish, good shoot-em up fun with responsive controls, fine graphics and decent replay.  One of the few games I couldn't walk away from since I began playing.  The story is secondary to a series of shooting scenarios that are enhanced by a slow motion control that actually adds to the action.  This game is far superior to "Dead to Rights" which it is often inaccurately compared to.  The comic book cut-scenes are surprisingly well done, while the oft mentioned dream sequences are interesting if unfortunately annoying.  Well-worth the minimal cash outlay.	1
Max Payne is a very good game, but basically the only reason is that the creators came up with a innovative "ace up Max's sleeve" called BulletTime.  This slows down everything as if it were slow motion and Max can aim real-time while the bad guys cannot.  Very cool once you actually try it.  However, it does feature repetive gameplay and the easier difficulty is too easy.  Here is a look (1 awful to 10 great): Gameplay (7.5): The movement, camera functions, weapons, aiming, shooting, and BulletTime are all well laid-out and easy to master.  The levels/boards to get through are somewhat repetitive and the cheesy storyboards with even worse dialogue can get annoying. No multiplayer (big drawback). Graphics (8.0): Just very good all the way around; nothing spectacular and nothing to complain about.  Solid. Replay (7.5): Good replay value until you complete the mission, which is not that difficult.  You will want to sell it after that unless you cannot part with the BulletTime. Overall (7.0): A cool game while the novelty lasts. A few tweaks, such as adding multiplayer and re-doing the dialogue, could have made it so much better.	1
Great game. No joke, a truly great game.  I was skeptical at first before I bought it, but was not sorry after.  Great plot, very interactive.  Very realistic.  Excellent graphics.  Will hook you in and not want to stop playing.  Very fun.  Excellent, user friendly weapons and several levels to keep your interest.  Only problem was the language and screaming was a little too graphic in some parts, but otherwise, great game. I can't wait for the sequel coming out next year.  The only game I have played of its type as good as Halo. I would not sell back this game.	1
I Can't believe how many people say that the voice acting sucked and that the Bullet Time feature gets old. Max Payne looks and fells like an updated ganster movie. The voice of Max Payne is very Dark and Kind of scary, Which is perfect for the Character. Bullet Time is Awesome, It never gets repetitive or boring. What I Like about the game- Realistic 3D enviroments,Good story, Bullet Time is awesome and comes in handy numerous times. What I Don't like about the game- There are two parts in the game where Max gets drugged, There are two weird Dream Sequences/Flashbacks where you have to follow a trail of Blood to Find your Murdered Wife and Daughter. Other than those 2 levels this game is a great Buy	1
This game is awesome and I'm not just saying that because of the bullet time. GRAPHICS- The only thing I wished they changed is the look of Max Payne he's like this old dude, I guess they had to do that because the whole point of the game is that he's mad because the dudes killed his family but i still wish he looked cooler. GAMEPLAY- Very good I don't know how they could do better. BULLET TIME- As I said I would have loved this game even if they didn't have bullet time but it is an awesome feature.  Oh and its not that hard to control. STORY- It is really a cool story I just wish that he could kill the enemies in story mode, for example on the last level you are standing right in front of the biggest enemy in the game and you just let her walk away. OBJECTS- The objects in this game are totally cool.  The guns are awesome only I wish the sniper could lock on to people.  The painkillers are really great idea they restore life and thats what they do in real life too which makes it a much better idea than health packs.  Also a lot of stuff you see you can use, I only wish you could climb over fences. MAX PAYNE VS. HALO- This is certainly a hard decision.  The single game in Halo has many problems people drown those problems out because of the multiplayer.  Max Payne has no multiplayer but the normal game makes up for that very easily, I still wish there was a multiplayer to it. Pro's For Halo *Greatest Multiplayer of all time *Awesome vehicles that you can control *Awesome human and alien weapons *The visor was a good idea.  It was a good excuse for seeing how much health you have unlike Max Payne. Pro's For Max Payne *Even better weapons *Better story *Much better single game than Halo *Painkillers instead of Health Packs *Bullet time Con's For Halo *Single game not better than Max Payne *Flud (kind of alien thing you have to kill) is a very bad idea. *Not the best story *Awesome weapons but not enough of them *Gets Boring Con's For Max Payne *No multiplayer *No excuse for seeing how much health *Max Payne is an old man I personally like Max Payne just a tad bit better, but that may be because I like the urban setting. Max Payne may seem like it has a flaws but no other game is better and has less flaws except maybe Halo.	1
All we can hope is that XBOX picks up ALL the Rockstar Games (e.g., GRAND THEFT AUTO 3, STATE OF EMERGENCY, etc.).  MAX PAYNE is an entertaining thrill ride.  Definitely worth picking up, and here's a few reasons why: >> Funny, intense and articulate story boards.  Formatted in classic, adult comic book fashion. >> Superb AI.  Great visual and sound effects.  Killer gun selection. >> Ground breaking, slow-motion gun-play mode.  Embodies a classic John Woo film. >> Great plot twists, colorful characters.  Gets a little complicated at times, so pay close attention as the game progresses. With the exception of Halo, this is the best action, role-playing game yet released on the XBOX; guaranteed hours of rollicking good fun.  Hope to see more of this genre in the near future.	1
I love how its all strange talk like, you really feel like your in trouble with the cops. The matrix-like feel (slow motion) makes the game different then every other first person shooter. its a buy	1
The other positive reviews have said it all. I own the PC version and absolutely loved it. Too bad the story is on the short side, but still worth every penny just for the John Woo-style experience. The Xbox version is easier to play, but otherwise is just a port of the excellent PC version without the mod editor. Oh, yes, you can save the game AT ANY POINT!! All console games should be like this!!! If you've played the PC version, there's nothing new here (even the graphics is pretty much the same). If you haven't, get this title for your Xbox.	1
...well not this very minute.  But so far this game is terrific!!  The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is smooth, and the plot development is addictive.  If you have even thought about getting this game, do yourself a favor and buy it.  I was a little hesitant at first, but I am very happy that i did.  I just hope that it's not too short.	1
While this game is no "Halo", it is still one of the top games for the Xbox.  The slow motion Matrix effect is excellent, and the graphics are top notch. One of the few complaints I have with this game is the lack of a consistent "feel" - there are so many stops for the comic-book like dialogue, you can't ever really get in the groove of the game.  I hope there is a sequel.	1
Max Payne on the XBox is the best version to date!!!  There is no comparison to PS2 etc.  This shows us the true potential of the Xbox and its gaming future! The graphics and playability is glitch free and play is realtime!! If you have a HDTV with component video you will even make the game better by getting the 480p (480 horizontal lines with Progressive Scan x 2) display since the XBox's game video output is 480p.  This actually doubles the lines for the clearest picture available!!! NOTE: To get this 480p you'll need to buy the HDTV cable set for the XBox!!  Normal output is 480i (480 horizontal lines of Interlaced video - excellent picture). Summary: Max Payne New York undercover cop's wife & child are murdered.  He is framed and pursued by everyone including his fellow police & feds.  The actual storyline unravels as you move through the winter night of blizzard ridden New York trying to solve, and find your families murderers.  There is nice narration and comic strip segments to fill you in as you transition between segments.  There is plenty of action, weapons, clue solving and adversaries who you find out are plentiful & after you with there own vengence. This is a visual pleasure and the sound track adds to the drama.  Hours of gameplay are in store for you.  You won't put it down until you solve & get your revenge.  Enjoy.	1
While it won't go down in history as one of the greatest video games ever, Max Payne does have plenty of intriguing areas that make it a fun game to experience. 1 - Bullet Time!  Being able to shoot, dive, and roll in slow motion to take out a room full of baddies is just plain addictive.  I never got tired of recklessly running into danger with both guns blazing. 2 - Dialogue!  If you're a fan of action movies then the dialogue in Payne will have you cracking up.  Yes, it is supposed to be THIS bad (the people at Extended Play missed the boat here). 3 - The Story!  I was always wondering where this game was going to take me.  Each time I thought, "This is the end!" a new level began.  Every level also made me smile as I could see how film noir and action cinema helped forge the areas that I would be battling through. 4 - Time!  Unlike many games you don't need to devote your life to playing Max Payne.  It's an excellent weekend renter as it's easily winnable within 10 hours.  True fans though will enjoy the challenging difficulty levels that can be unlocked once you win the first time. All in all I recommend Max Payne for Xbox owners who want to spend some time smiling and having a fun time blowing away the bad guys.	1
This game has translated extremely well to the Xbox.  The control scheme and button layout work wonderfully with the Xbox controller, a factor which surprised me.  The graphics on this game are also top notch. What really sets this game apart from other action games in the same genre is the use of "bullet time".  For those that don't know, your character Max Payne has the ability to slow time down to a snails pace for when the action gets hectic, or you simply want to look cool kicking some bootay.  Some may feel that this may get repertitive throughout the game, but I never get tired of this aspect. What the game is really lacking is a good story.  It begins decently but gets boring within the first act.  Also, the cut scenes are rather weak as is the voice acting. Unfortunately, this is not multiplayer, nor are their other options that set this version truly apart from its PC brethren.  If you have the game for PC, it's really not worth picking up for the Xbox.  But, it is definitely a top notch rental for those who haven't played it before. I should warn you against buying this game.  It's not a short game by any means, however it doesn't offer much resistance against finishing the game within a five day rental.  And after finishing it, it might just sit on your shelf for a while.  Good game, good rental, but poor replay value thus making it only a mediocre purchase in my opinion.	1
This is a tight game despite the constipated look max payne has on his face throughout the game.	1
All I have to say is anyone that doesn't give this game 5 stars is crazy.  This is definitely one of the best if not the best XBox games to date.  I love this game.  I'll never get sick of it!	1
This game has gone way beyond my expectations.  The incedible graphics only add to the fun of the story. The pace is not to exhausting, nor is it too slow.  I have 8 Xbox games, and this one shot right to the top of my play list.  Just a simple thought, but now I must go back and continue my investigation.	1
There have been many great action games in the past such as James Bond's Goldeneye and Duke Nukem. But this game puts all of them to shame. Max Payne is one of the most violent action games I've played since Soldier of Fortune. You get a variety of weapons spanning from Sniper Rifles to Baseball Bats. The way you play is very interesting. You simply aim in a third-person view at the bad guys. One of the coolest features in this game is the slow-down meter. The slow-down meter lets you actually slow down the time and lets you shoot in a Matrix-style format. Very entertaining. Also, Max Payne has one of the best stories in an action game ever. You start out by reliving when your wife and baby were killed by gangsters. All that was left is a V on the wall with a seringe. It's a very scary part of the story with all the screaming and graphic violence. After that, everything goes downhill as you shoot your way through mob bosses to discover a secret on a continuing research project to raise the moral in troops. And to top it off, your now a fugitive. You don't end up being a big hero in the end, but you will be satisfied. I also found the dream sequences to be rather fun to play. Making your way across a thin trail of blood while at the same time being haunted by the death of your wife and baby is a nice touch which adds to the terrifying atomasphere. The only part that may upset some game players is that Max Payne is way to short. There is a timed version you can play when you beat the game, but that isn't quite enough to satisfy players who want more out of the game. Overall, Max Payne ends up to be one of the most involving and funnest games out there. Just keep telling yourself it's just a game. Highly recommended.	1
Bought this cable for my first gen Xbox and couldn't be happier. It feels like it's pretty good quality and gives a good picture. Couldn't ask for more.	1
I've had to restart this game three times because for some reason the game wants to save to a memory card instead of the hard drive The people who ported this one from PS2 didn't thoroughly Q&A this critical feature.  Don't eject the disk or you will lose a days worth of playing! Dialogue and cut scenes take up much valuable game time and are pretty obnoxious if you are restarting the game from the beginning. The punch kick combat is very primitive as are the car and jet controls.  There is a game called Oni by Bungie that has breathtaking grappling and kung fu moves and it predates this one by at least a year. Rather than being a real game this is more like a narrative of the T.V. cartoon and you get to play a bit here and there. I'm not alone on this please read reviews under other game platforms.  One person hits on what I'm trying to say by comparing it to Dragons Lair or Space Ace. Or perhaps we could be looking at a new form of interactive cartoon/gaming hybrid?  If so it should cost half the price of a real game!!	-1
I must say that I am mostly impressed.  This game is the first Batman video game I've ever played that I enjoyed (the others, quite frankly, were awful).  The graphics are great, the movement is very fluid, and the animated sequences are fantastic.  They developed no shortage of moves for Batman, such as gliding with his cape, or hiding in shadows against the wall. The problem is that the game can be very frustrating at certain points due to the limitations in control.  It would have worked much better if its controls were more like Halo and Max Payne, in which you move with one thumbstick and control the viewpoint with the other.  Here, Batman's perspective is limited and you constantly have to press the trigger button when you want to look in the direction that Batman is facing. The fight scenes are good, as are Batman's martial arts moves, but there are certain parts where it is very awkward and frustrating to maneuver him.  The biggest example of this is when fighting Poison Ivy's minions hand-to-hand; the very slight delay between pressing the button and the execution of the move is just long enough for the plant guy's to knock you on your butt. Having Batman use the grapple is neat, but very limited: you use the grapple only to certain select spots where they allow you to do it, and not to any surface that would likely be able to hold a grappling hook.  It's not like Spider-Man (which in most ways was obviously Batman: Vengeance's biggest inspiration) where you can pretty much use the web to attach to whatever you want. The car and plane chases are lame.  There's no other word for them.  The detail is scant, control is very limited and if you deviate even slightly from the set path, you lose and have to restart from the checkpoint.  Basically, it's as if the developers spent five minutes working on the vehicle sequences. If you compare this game to trend setters such as Playstation's Spider-Man, which set the standard for urban superhero games, or X-Box's Halo, which has amazing graphics, fantastic control and great vehicles, Batman falls a little short.  Still, for anyone who loved the animated series (which I did), it is a heck of a lot of fun to interact in Gotham City, the atmosphere of which the developers flawlessly mirrored for this game.  I was very impressed by the graphics and it was so great that they got the original cast from the cartoon to provide the voices here.	1
I needed this to add a larger hard drive to my Original Xbox	1
i use this all the time, it worked great, , like new, great bang for the buck,	1
This game stinks on all 3 systems (4 if you count GBA). There is more jumping around than fighting. And the fighting is just punching. So the whole game is jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, punch, punch, punch, jump, jump, etc. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!	-1
great product	1

I can play Halo 1 again. Im excited.	1
Very pleased, thank you!	1

Age Of Empires 2 is a masterpiece. Regardless of any complaints anyone has made about this game, there is no arguing. This one of the most fun, addictive, and satisfying games ever made.  You can play it for months. I played it for over a year, then came back and played it for another year. It's probably the most addictive game I've ever played. Not Mario, not Zelda, not the great Doom, not Quake or Half-life or Warcraft or even Grand Theft Auto has ever had me as hooked as this game. Microsoft and Ensemble Studios hit the nail on the head with AOE 2.  The sequel to Age Of Empires keeps everything that made the first one great, throws away almost everything that made it bad, and throws an amazing, revamped user interface that gives the player god-like power if used expertly.  The different civilizations are fantastic. The advantages and disadvantages of each one make the game interesting and balanced, although some civilizations are better (overall) than others. I mean, really, who doesn't love (and equally hate) the Longbowmen? The War Elephants? The Woad Raiders? The Throwing Axeman?  The units are the best part of the game. Except for the paladin and scorpion wipeout trick, the unit balance is superb. The naval battles are amazing, with fireships, ballista ships, and even ships that launch cannonballs.  There are more buildings, tons more upgrades, and a brand-new unit I like to call the x-factor: the trebuchet. This is one of the units that makes AOE 2 a true delight. As built up as a city can become, it can be destroyed in minutes with enough trebuchets.  The multiplayer aspect of this game is what solidifies AOE 2's standing as one of the best games ever made. It is surreal. I've had 12-hour multiplayer sessions many times. You just don't want to stop. It's so fun!!! It's madness!  As far as challenge goes, you'll get all you want. Just try beating the entire game on the hardest difficulty and see the headache you get. And if you get through with that, buy the expansion pack and eat your heart out.  Buy this game! Play it until you're sick of it! That probably won't happen, but even if it does, when you come back from your break you'll be twice as hooked.  Ha!!! The memories I have of this game! Man, this is the best!	1
if you don't have this game already,you should. This game will truly give you endless hours and hours of fun. I've had this game since it came out,and i still play it all the time. It brings some history to kids minds about the middle ages and their warfare, but also gives you tons of action and strategy....a truly great game.	1
Gamecube is hosting about every hit on Dreamcast. This one, unlike the others, is the most original and amazingly innoventive game to hit the market. PSO had you play with other people around the world from Asia, Europe, South America, Antaritica, North America, Austrilla, and Africa. The game proves that you could go around the world in less than 5 minutes. The original gameplay and astounding graphics made the game a classic on Dreamcast. Hopefully, on Gamecube will be able to improve the Dreamcast game by taking out the tiny little promblems that were bad so Sega of America, Inc. has to make the grubby problems into perfect details. Will Gamecube live up to it's title or fail miserably? It's up to them...	1
Great product	1
great nintendo multiplayer action at its finest	1
This game is flat out the best GameCube game I have ever played. It's a great game if you ever have friends over, because it has a offline split-screen co-op feature. It is also still possible to play online using a private server, which is great.  The game is a great collectible, if I were you...I'd buy it while it's still cheap. You can find it here on Amazon for a variety of prices, lowest I have seen is about $35, which is a pretty good price for the game.  Great graphics for its time, great game play, and great music. Just a great game overall.	1
(...) I can say that AOE 2 is my second favorite game of all time, it is so well done... You get to control civilizations from the Britons to the Turks to the Byzantines, and build swordsmen, archers, knights, and castles; what could be more fun? Unfortunately, it took 2 years from the time it was released on the PC to get it over to the Mac. It's here now, though, so we can finally play it. It's not be the best port in the world, but at least it's there, and it hardly if ever crashes after you update CarbonLib. Besides, you can just save your game when important things happen in it... Aside from getting a PC, there's no other way to play it, and I definitely recommend this as a must-have for anyone who plays games on a Mac. One last thing: For some reason, the hotkey for gate and archery range are both 'A', so you have to change it under options to '/', which is what it's supposed to be...	1
Great service! There is nothing that needs to be improved at all. Will buy from again sometime in the near future.	1
for my step grandson he loves it.	1
You should pretty much already know what this game is about if you're reading reviews. If you're buying used, be careful, since gamecube discs are notorious for being riddled with game destroying errors.	1
Already had this game. This is to replace the one that was missing. I haven't tried to play it in my Wii yet tho. I need to re-condition the disk first. Too many fingerprints and some very light scratches.	1
This game is super fun and super addicting. I really enjoy it and its put together well. I definitly think everyone should get this game	1
I bought it refurbished so I could play it. I recieved it. I played it. And I gotta say this game never gets old for me. It's to bad they took the online servers down. Wich also means you can't download extra quests or get a hunters licence. What you can do though is play single-player offline story mode and offline multi-player Multi mode split-screen. It's a game to create a character, Level him/her up, get new weapons, armor, and Magic abilities as you go. And of corse learn what happend to pioneer 1 and the planet of Ragol. Note: you can't exactly play the story line in multi-mode. You just kind of run through the levels one at a time leveling up and getting new items either by shopping or what you find in the field. You can skip levels in multi-mode by getting further in Single mode with the main player. This game allowes you to customize a character for play for those of you that don't know. Also the Xbox 360 version does not and will likley never work. I own that as well. It's worthless. You wanna play? I recommend buying this one for gamecube. It works on the nintendo wii with gamecube controllers ;)	1
If you are reading this, chances are you are a fan of RPGs and are already deciding on buying this. That's fine. My review won't change your opinion. If however, you are one of the newer ones who want to venture into this world, it might not be your cup of tea.  Despite the rave reviews it has gotten, the word I can sum the game up is: repetitive. The core design of the game is essentially moving through areas, slashing at monsters, collecting items and leveling up. That is essentially what you'll be doing for hours, weeks, months and perhaps years.  The graphics are not up to the standards of other games. However, I believe they had to do this in order to allow 4-player splitscreen mode. The music is very interesting, ranging from moody techno music to sorrowful tones.  You are given the choice to choose 1 of 12 classes and change the looks of the character you are given. The classes are broken down into 3 archetypes: hunters, rangers and force. Hunters are melee fighters that fight head-on with enemies. Rangers use ranged weapons obviously and force is like the spell-casting class of the game. Within each class, you'll have some divisions such as a guy who's beefier in damage and accuracy, yet lacks the ability to cast any spell at all.  Once you make a character, you are given some sort of ID that determines item drops in the game for you. You then arrive in the lobby area. Here is where you'll spend your time in the game. There is a shop to trade, sell and buy items, a medical station to heal wounds, a mission area to get more assignments and an elevator to allow you to talk to the space government. The story is loosely about a colony of humans that are inside a ship that want to colonize a planet. However, they send hunters to check if the location is safe before landing.  There are two chapters to the game, hence the title, Episodes I and II. For multiplayer, you are given a splitscreen mode for up to four players. You used to be able to play online through Sega, if you purchased a Hunter's License, which is a fee of $15 each month. It's been discontinued, but there are private servers floating around that you can join.  To conclude, PSO is a game that's been done before here and there. Slashing at monsters to loot them is not revolutionary, nor does it require player skill. You are going to play this game for many hours, but I don't think all those hours will be enjoyable. The true value of this game is in the online play, but even that is marginalized when you think about all the other games that let you do that and more (Diablo 2).  If spending all your time grinding at simple-AI programmed monsters to collect items is your idea of fun, this game will be your fantasy. Otherwise, if you are like me, you'll feel unchallenged.	-1
MY SON WANTED IT FOR XMAS. HE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE FOR IT. IT'S HARD TO FIND, FOR IT BEING USED AND OLD IT WAS COSTLY. BUT HE SWEARS IT'S WORTH THE MONEY.	1
The Gamecube version is comparable to x-box' version and it is easier to set up and start play. (Microsoft should take a lesson) Can create several characters and get the full experience.  Very fun and addictive.	1
I think that people who have known of this and played this all agree it is one of the best games ever released.  so many choices to choose so much possibilities. You pick your class arranging from humans to androids. You customize your clothing gear and so on, and then your're off. You start on a space ship and work your way onto a planet Ragol and discover the truth of the people on Pioneer 1 are no more. The story has little focus on the actual gameplay. You can have optional quest to do easy objectives like find someone or so on to gain money(Mesta).The fun of the game is the multiplayer or online.eaither way you have 4 people you can play with at a time. You and your friends can team up hit off to Ragol and start killing of the inhabitants wich are threatning you. Online you are offered weapons and gear that are not obtainable offline. It is very addicting collecting and upgrading weapons to their own potential. Or to find a rare weapon thta everyone wants including yourself. When you level up you can brag to all your friends then wait till they die and take their cash. You can heal your friends i nbattles or be jerks to them if you're stronger and let them die off and you take all the goods you want. So many people can't put this game down. Wit hall the arrangments of guns,swords,sabes,daggers,rifles,wands,magical spells,and shields you can obtai nit makes it endless. Each location on the planet hasa theme liek a forest,cave,mine,ruin and so on. The bosses are rugged and tough and rewuire team work. You can raise little robots (mags) and they become ike your own helper but you must train them and feed them in order to do so. Whats really nice is the fact that you get episode 2 along with episode 1. Thats a one-up fro mthe Dreamcast version. Now when you're done episode one you can take your gaming exsperience further and go through countless hours of more extravagent roaming of\ver lush envirements like seabeds. The enemies for the most part are appropriate if it's the forest the enemies go along with the envirement. I will say the AI is a little lacking but it's all to fun to find doubts on why not to play it. The controls are easy to get the hang of and soon you'll be a pro at timing shots and getting good accuracy. Buy this and go home happy.	1
Some of you may remember the Phantasy Star games on Sega Genisis as a great series of RPG well heads up cause Phantasy Star is back but now it's completly different but don't worry change is a good thing. Gameplay: 10/10 One of the coolest things about this game is the character creation you can pick out of 3 races Humans Newmans and Androids and from 3 character styles you can literally have you and 20 people online as the same class and with all the apperence options no one will look identical. Hunters:Who are swordsmen/ women by nature and can use every sort of sword sabers partisans daggers katanas sicles double sided swords (Darth Maul style) even use two swords at once but can also handle guns handguns mechguns but their strength and selection is limited and some technquies (magc spells aka techs) but the strength of these spells are limited to levels 15 or 20 when the ultimate level is 30. Rangers:These are your marksmen/ women they can use every kind of gun handguns mechguns shotguns bazookas rifles imaginable and some swords sabers and a few double sided swords but their strength and selection is limited and techs but their strength of these spells are also limited to either level 15 or 20 Forces:Forces are wizards they excel in using techs and can really tear up when they get their techs stronger they can get them all the way to the max tech level of 30 they use canes and staffs wands spellbooks and other wizard equipment but they can also use a few guns handguns and certain rifles and swords sabers and double sided swords but are very weak in this area so your much better off going off wizard style. So between all these occupations and races there are 12 classes all of which are unique and have advantages and disadvantages over each other such as having more defence or attacking power than another class also techs max level is affected by the class you choose Androids are robots basicly they can't use techs at all but can see traps and set them to help them take on their enemies also because they are robotical they have a big strengh advantage Humans are well humans (yes even in this futuristic world we humans still exsist) who are hunters or rangers they can only get the techs to level 15 but have highter defence and have better evasion rates Newmans are genetically enhanced humans who are a combo of a Force and Humter anyway they are hunters and or forces can get the techs to level 20 unless they are a force then they have the potiental to get the techs to 30 and do big damage Now after you have choosen your class you get to create their look from scratch hair style skin color height weight face paint job (if an android) everything! Now on to the overall gameplay it is intense online you can interact with thousands of people all over the world and go into the world of Ragol and explore,chat,and fight! The fighting is great you find yourself fighting hundreds of different enemies and you along with some buds will have the time of your life fighting off the hoardes of evil the gameplay style is action rpg like Guantlet or Baldurs Gate only a lot more intense there are 4 different difficulties Normal Hard Very Hard and Ultimate you can find thousands of items and play through both Episode 1 (formally version 1 and 2 on Dreamcast) and 2 (a completly new adventure with amped difficulty) and play dozens of online quests some are your run of the mill monster elimination quests and fetch quests but some are really cool making a movie particapating with the enemy monsters in festival along with special holiday specific that Sonic Team the creators of Phantasy Star download on the servers depending on the time of year also there are some quests online that add a lot to the story and a upcoming one that tells plot info to the upcoming sequel Phantasy Star Online Episode 3 and level to the ultmate level of 200 also you can play 3 different modes Normal,Challange, and Battle Challenge:You play through the games levels with a preselected level and equipment and try to survive Battle:Should you get tired of the first 2 modes you can challenge your freinds to a battle and fight them to your hearts content. If you don't feel like or are unable to get online there is always the offline mode which have a bunch of quests and a great story also the offline mode has multiplayer options so you and your freinds can enjoy the game in the same room. Story 10/10 The story is great and involving and has several side quests It begins when the people of a planet called Coral discover that there planet will soon be destroyed so they send probes into space to find a hostpitable planet they found one called Ragol they then built a giant spaceship called Pioneer 1 and got a few thousand people to get the planet ready and sent it off Pioneer 2 made it to Ragol with everyone that remained on Coral aboard but just as it opens communication with Pioneer 1 a huge explsion shakes the planet and contact with Pioneer 1 is lost thats where you come in you are to investigate the planet and find out what happened. Graphics: 10/10 The graphics in this game are amazing the detail given to your character is great and every indvidual level is beatiful espcially in Episode 2 waterfalls lava pits all come together to make a great game environment. Length: 10/10 This game is huge you'll spend hundreds of hours chating leveling and fighting it is truly one of the most expansive games out there Replay Value: 10/10 Simply put you'll be putting in this in for years to come Bottom Line: 10/10 With hundreds of monsters 12 character classes 4 difficulties 3 Ocupations 2 Episodes equals 1 perfect game Phantsy Star Online Epsiode 1 And 2 is comparable to the best RPGs out there and second to none	1
Right now my best friend Forrest is like god to me he bought the game for the dreamcast when i played it iwas hooked on PSO phonics then i got the game for my birth day. then weeks weeks weeks later i found out that PSO was comming To the game cube thats when things got real...  all right  this game has great and betiful graphics great online and offline game play the charather desighn feauture is really stunning those are just some of the things that i am going to review the game play is simple enouth to understand you learn combos buy combos there are pleanty of diferent moves and magic for each weapon there are no combos or magic attacks that are the same so don't worry there are plenty of weapons around 137 and some but what is real bicthy about the real real real real real cool weapon is that they are hard as hell to get-unlock-find-receive-or win like the double bladed swords light saber like weapons but if your a gun type person there is gun to so don't think your missing out Lets talk Final Fantsy summons in PSO there are little robot like summon that you can feed and take care of ... they have this hidden abiltty called (photon blast) the Mags(summon) turn into  animals like PowerRanger cretures  ( are so  so  so so so cool man im fool of it) In the game you grow levals in STR-DEF-ABL- and so on this is quiete possible the best online game evere created( and this is not just my oppionin) The bad part is this is only one og the few online games in the GameCube sorry but this the truth face it But don't worry ive have not beaten the game  but that will last me untill Phantasy Star online Episode III C.A.R.D Revoltion like i seid  don't think of it as  a come back trust the PHANTOM	1
One of the best, longest games on the gamecube.  You start into the game as a Hunter, Force, or Ranger at lv 1 with basic items.  There is more specific clases like RAmar and HUcast (ranger human male and hunter android male respectively) which limit you what items you get and what your beginning stats are.  For example HUcast's have regenerating HP and the most ATK but the least amount of accuracy compared to the other classes.  You get experience for killing monsters and when you get enough exp. you level up.  You can get up to level 200,  that is the highest in any game that i know of.  When you level up your stats increase until they are maxed out. The point of the game after you beat the story on all 4 difficulties (normal, hard, very hard, and ultimate) is to collect all of the many rares and special items this game has (well over 250).  This game has a GREAT replay value and also is the only game online for the gamecube (other than warppipe compatible games:  [...] for more information).  I would recommend adding this to your library of games.	1
When Phantasy Star Online hit on the Dreamcast it became an instant hit and one of the greatest selling games the Dreamcast had next to Soul Calibur. It was a huge MMORPG where thousands of players went online to work together in 4 great levels of action gameplay. Also, with the arrival of the expansion version 2, people could now battle each other in PK fights and even play a little soccer while waiting in the lobby for a new game to begin. The game was great and now that greatness returns with the new Gamecube version.  This one brings together the classic Episode I, along with the new Episode II.  This package promises everything the original had, but with new weapons, items, worlds, and more. Graphically, it is basically the same thing you would expect from the original version. Character models are done well except no real interaction with your character really....The action of the character follow through well though, and there are many types of designs for all 12 character models. As you can change Hair, Body, Proportions, and of course your name. The environments are rich and beautiful for the outside levels like forest and caves, but mines and ruins are repetitive but it doesn't distract from the gameplay at all. The GC version also have excellent effects such as heat waves, fog, and nice water waves and shadowing. The enemies and bosses are great as well and the introduction is mysterious and interesting. All in all great but nothing groundbreaking. The sound is a recollection of all the music from the dreamcast version with some slow paced and fast paced techno music and symphony music. Even some music from the original Phantasy Star series has been included in Episode II. The music and sound effects for each level are quite fitting, except for some enemies that are very annoying when they are attacked such as the little penguin like Rag Rappy or the massive Pan-Arms.  However, the sound department does its job in pulling you into this game. Now we get to the department that makes this game totally worthwhile...The story is basically something goes wrong with a ship of people called Pioneer 1 as they venture to the world of Ragol. Also, the animal and technology on Ragol has all turned evil and new powerful creatures have emerged. It is your job as a hunter, force, or ranger to investigate find survivors, unlock evidence, and defeat the beings responsible for the mess. As a ever moving online experience it does just fine. There are 2 modes in the game Episode I and Episode II. Episode I contains basically the same thing as the Dreamcast version. All the old levels are back with their respective bosses and enemies. However, there are new items, weapons, and other things to look forward to as well. The graphics and music have been improved as well in Episode I and provides a better experience. Also, each of the new levels look great and the new enemies and bosses are even cooler with new powers and challenges. Also, included in the offline mode is now a split screen multiplayer where 2-4 people can engage in a adventure into levels helping each other out or can battle to the death in a PK duel. Problems however plague the offline split screen mode. The graphics have been trimmed down to allow the split screen to work effectively but its nothing too bad, but the split screen for 3-4 players are very small and sometimes its hard to see. Though in the end if you can get by the problems it is a great way to level. Online mode is all you would expect it to be, you can get online by buying the Modem or BBA adapters for 35 bucks at any available retailer. Online lets you go online with people from all over the world. Work together as a team, PK battle, play some soccer, or just relax and exchange guild cards in the lobby. The trading system has been improved incredibly as well. No more dropping on the ground where items could be stolen or people could be deceived. Trade windows are now available for trustful trading actions. Also, as before new quests can be downloaded every holiday season for even more fun along with the other 100+ quests the game has to offer. With new items, character designs, mags, weapons, and levels you can't go wrong. Though the monthly fee is 9 dollars a month its still worth it all the way. The Replay Value is where this game purely shines. The online gameplay makes this game a dream. Working together, joining guilds, making friends is what its all about in a MMORPG. Also, leveling is a lot of fun as it is  a sense of accomplishment and as you level you can use your hard earned items and weapons as you meet their requirements. Tons of quests, weapons, and incredible boss fights make it even better. Also, playing with different characters can be real fun as well. All in all whether online or offline the game is a blast and you can pull easily up to 150 hours in this game.  So, get connected and have a great time with one of the best console online RPG's available.	1
Okay, let's start with this: I literally played for over 5 hours the day that I got this. I played for about 5 yesterday, and 2 with the great splitscreen Multiplayer mode on Friday. WARNING: This game is addicting, fun, and will keep you occupied for hours on end! Heck, the character creation system is fun enough to play for a while! What model head to you want? Clothes? Skin color? Hairdoo? Hair color? Short? Tall? Fat? Skinny? Is the upperbody bigger, or the lower body? What preportions? It's just great. I'm giving it 5 stars, and I haven't even gotten online yet!	1
Not the right cord.	-1
I love this game! Online=paradise its sooooooooooooooo addicting!!!!!!! it lacks story line a tinsy bit.but the awsome game play is perfecto! Get it on ur gamecube.	1
If you didn't have to pay 9 bucks a month for it.  Go find the original unopened and a Dreamcast.  It's free and basicaly the same expierience.  The 9 dollar fee is totaly uncalled for and not worth it.  Skip this game.  It's great but not 9 bucks a month great.	-1
good	1
didn't work but okay got the right 1 thanks	-1
Exellent Product	1
Hunting down Game Cube's only online title may be a chore that some people may not be interested in, while hunting down the broadband adapter is even worse... thankfully I found both, and had a credit card handy that day, and boy am I glad I did.  I was a fan of he Dreamcast original, and so when Episode 1&2 was announced for GameCube I was very happy. Regardless of what anybody has said about graphical enhancements in the past I cannot stress enough that there has been drastic enhancements to the graphics, to the camera, and best of all to the controller sensitivity, defending you character is so much easier because the game is a lot more responsive than its previous incarnations.  There are more character types to choose from, new strengths, new weaknesses, a few new monsters, etc, and it is plenty fun on its own without going online.  Sega also included the option for four-player action offline, which is also a blast.  There is one complaint I have for this game, and only one, the lack of a keyboard, or headset for communication. Despite the addition of hotkeys, conversation online is a big pain because typing through the control pad is too slow, and by the time I finish my sentence my comrades have already left the lobby. Nintendo needs to release a keyboard for the GameCube, even if it's only for PSO.  Be aware that this game is not out of print, its just that demand is extremely high, and during the next few months it may be difficult to find, but not impossible. Some websites are reporting that the product is discontinued, but this is not the case. The game is a lot of fun, and if you don't mind doing a little hunting for it it's well worth the price of admission. Hopefully this means Nintendo will get its act together with online games and start getting serious about an online plan.	1
SEAGA!!!!WHY????? If your looking at this item here at amazon around 12/9 your wodering why this item is not only out of stock but may be discontinued. The answer lies in SEGA's incredibly stupid marketing plans by not making nearly enough games to meet demand. This game had been totally soled out across the entire country! There isn't a single one left. Its just like the idiotic mistake of sony to not even come close to making enough PS2's on release. Its gonna be at least a month until this game becomes easy to find! ... YOU SEGA! Yea it sounds corny but its true!	1
Since my parents won't let me get an account this review is based on the offline play. First of all this game is VERY, VERY monotonous. Monsters are repeated very, very much. The designers got so obsessed with a monster they made like about 7 types of that monster, and the only thing that varied the types were the color and size. Also there aren't many different monsters in the game. Also, most of episode 1 takes place underground; underground mines, caves and ruins. And at each place the same freaking rooms are repeated over and over again. The game play at first is OK, as well as the weapons, character types (well balanced) and character creation. But this game will bore you in a week or two, that is if you don't play it so often. It has the same graphics as the dreamcast version.	-1
Phantasy Star Online is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. Not only is PSO well planned and thought out, but it offers more modes of play than the original Dreamcast release. I was very pleased to find that there are now four modes of play with PSO. There is Single player, Multiplayer Co-op, Multiplayer Challenge, and Multiplayer Online. In single player, you can take jobs and progress through an actual story. The story is set after an apocalyptic event. You are a hunter, who travels to the planet's surface on missions. As your missions progress, you learn more about what happened to the planet. As time progresses, you become stronger, and can learn more skills. Single player mode offers the most interaction with Non-Player Characters (NPCs). There are only slight differences between the multiplayer modes. Multiplayer Online and Multiplayer Co-op are the exact same. You go out and fight on the planet's surface, for no other reason, than to gain levels. This may not seem like much, but you have to play multiplayer to gain access to some items. Different character classes gain different items during standard play. For instance, a FOMARL (Male/Human/Force) will gain access to an Ice Saber +3, but must trade the saber with a HUMAR for a Draw Cane +1. You may also exchange money in Multiplayer modes(Except Challenge). Challenge mode varies from the other Multiplayer modes. Challenge allows you to fight other players (online or offline) for the heck of it. You can even wager items or money in the events. Game play takes some getting used to, but it is not difficult to learn. Movement is performed with the left analog stick. This is not the problem. The problem comes in planning ahead. In battle, you only have 6 actions that can be accessed quickly. You set these up in the customization menu. You can set attacks, items, or techniques in these slots. Often times, you'll find yourself fighting a slew of enemies, each weak to a different element, so you will equip yourself with all 3 elemental attacks. Yet, when you have more useful techniques, like raising your attack power, you quickly find yourself in need of a quick fix. PSO has no pause feature, so as soon as you hit start, you need to make sure you are moving around, while using the right analog stick to navigate through menus. This can be cumbersome for those who are not accustomed to the Mouse and Keyboard play method or have trouble multitasking.  The trouble with being in the menu screen, is that you can not realign your sight. You must rely on your ability to maneuver blindly. Once you are out of the menu screen, you can use the L trigger to realign your field of vision. I can not say I was completely impressed with the PSO's environments. They seem a little lacking. Forests are just open fields surrounded by trees. This fails to provide an accurate feeling of actually being hunted or hunting the beasts that roam the land. The creature roster is rather impressive and imaginative. Designs range from small chicken like animals to huge ogres and worse. Sonic Team really had their work cut out for them. Character growth is presented rather well in PSO. Instead of just leveling every time you kill something, like in Final Fantasy and most other RPGs, it takes hours before you even start to grow. The downside of this is that it takes forever to learn new techniques (which is necessary if you play as a Force user). The upside is that the game remains fun and does not become too easy too quickly. Not only does your character grow, but you also have a creature that travels with you called a MAG. MAGs can be equipped. Once equipped, a MAG will increase your stats. You need to feed them items every so often. Feeding your MAG regularly will cause it to gain levels. The more levels it gains, the stronger of an ally it will be. Feeding MAGs can be anything from recovery items to revival items. MAGs also allow your character to perform overdrive attacks. The manner in which you raise your MAG, determines what overdrives your MAG will have. PSO has an excellent character creation system. First you choose what type you want your character to be (Hunter, Ranger or Force). Then you choose the gender and species. Once this is done, you can begin to design your character. Your character is customizable in the following areas: face, hair, skin tone, outfit, and proportion. Proportioning means that you select how tall/short and skinny/fat your character will be. Androids are the only let down. With Androids, you can only choose from a few preset body and head combinations. Androids also can not use techniques, which comes as a disadvantage. But they do get interesting weapons, such as chainsaws and reapers. PSO wasn't entirely a great game. I was disappointed that you could not go on quests in multiplayer modes. It was also a draw back that characters are hard to level. For beginners to the RPG world, this can be very frustrating. Overall, I found PSO to be a great game. It did not require an entire Memory Card like most Game Cube games. Despite the minor problems with this title, I would give it a 9.9. I highly recommend this to other Game Cube owners. Online or Offline, this is a must own.	1
Arrived before I expected it.  My son is thrilled that his Xbox is repaired and working great.  This is a fantastic deal!	1
Works just like the original. Skinnier though.	1
i bought an xbox halo edition from my friend for a deal but i did knowing i would have to acquire the parts to get it running. i only got the system so i had to buy this and some other components. it works fine for its price and is kind of frustration free.	1
cable was good	1
This cable Will make the set up of old school Xbox really easy. Very easy to install into any tv. I am very happy.	1
Friend I work with had an old school Xbox and the cables frayed apart on it.  Bought him this as a replacement.  He tells me the cords are actually longer than the original and the jacks are tighter and fit more snug into the ports on the back of his TV.  If I find out they crapped out on him I will update my review.  Until then, he seems very pleased with this set of cables.	1
fantastic purchase. Seller got it to me really fast. The product was in perfect condition and I could not have been happier. I can finally play my Xbox and my DDR game. I recommend this seller and this product.	1
This is a great game for players wanting an entry level/easy to learn strategy role-playing game.  I played this years ago and it was a great re-introduction to SRPGS for me since the last one I played previously at the time was Shining Force.  It is also a good precursor before playing games such as Disgaea, FF Tactics, Fire Emblem or other more difficult SRPGs.  Graphics are simple and will be hard to look at for many of todays gamers.  I brought this as a cheap game to be played on my then fiance's PS1 when I spent the night over 10 years ago and it was a pleasant surprise. Again not a complicated SRPG at all, but a simple, solid entry level SRPG (think similar to how Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was good for introducing RPGS). Hope this was helpful.	1
This is a great game. It's very similar to Final Fantasy: Tactics but instead of people you control monsters! Cool!	1
This game is just adorable! It is similar to Rhapsody. You have cute monsters as your allies and depending on what crystalls you feed them - determines what cute monster it will become. Very interesting story, new enemies - and dungeon designs. It is very simple to play - so this is the game that you play when u want to relax and just have fun. I really really enjoyed it!! ^_~	1
This game is a very good game and even more so as cheap as it is.  The characters are cute, the storyline is good, and there's no gore.  You're led through the story which makes it pretty simple.  Luke(the main character) and his sister Elena are descendants of the Eternal Eyes.  They along with two friends find a box of jewels and learn that Luke can use the jewels to create magical puppets(pappets).  The puppet you make depends on what jewels you give it.  Later after raising the puppet a few levels, you can evolve it.  Each puppet has its own powers & abilities but you can add to these abilities by continuing to use jewels on them.  There are two stores you go to to buy things such as riceballs, star fragments, and dad's smack which will help you & your puppets during battles. Even after you finish the game, there's still more incentive to play again because at the end it tells you congrats, you finished so we added some bonuses for you.  Make sure you go back to look for them.  You'll be quite surprised!!!  Ok well I was.  Also, if bad graphics drive you nuts, don't even waste your time.  This is cartoonish, it doesn't look real, and a lot of the edges are sharp and block your view of a battle at some points.  However this takes nothing away from the game.	1
the same has the original.... well is te original and is very cheaper, need to buy more, for replacement, if you have and old one this is the best option	1
Got my triple plug... YES!.. this is the older xbox cord and I need to write four more words thanks.	1
The shipping was fast, and the product works great! It showed up, I plugged it in, and every thing works fine. Thank You, & Have A Good Day	1
since my son was kind enough to loose the original cord for the xbox i needed a replacement. this one fits and works perfectly.	1
Thank God that they make replacement av cables i just bought a used x box and the seller didn't have av cables so i ordered these so thank god or i wouldnt play at all thay are exactly the same as the ones that come with the console fit great work great	1
Bought this cable cause I found a god deal on an original Xbox, but the AV Cable was not included. Tried this cable out and works like a charm. Also, the cable is very well made and feels like a good build quality product. Very happy with my purchase of this product.	1
My xbox had a break in the cord, I ordered from Amazon and it was exactly like my old one.  Now my xbox is working perfectly.	1
I bought this game as a Christmas gift for my nine year old daughter.  She is a fan of the Monster Rancher show.  She absolutely loves it!  It is similar to, but not a clone of the Pokemon gameboy games and should appeal to any fan of the series.	1
Thsi is a great game! It is very similair to Monster Rancher 2 for PS1. You generate a monster buy putting in a word and it uses the word to generate the monster. Each time you get a new monster it adds it to your book and the word you need used  generate it. Any word will work! That is one of the funnest things in the game it typing in weird words to see what you get. You train your monsters to battle in tournaments so you can make them stronger and earn money. You must feed and care for your monster too. There are even little events that pop up once in a while in the game where you can get useful items or get bargain. Your monsters can battle until they are 3-4 years old and then you can just retire them or make them a coach! You can have multi[le monsters by freezing them(putting them into hibernation) and reviving them. I would say the graphics aren't so bad once you get to playing them game(hey it is a LOT better than the original GB or GBC!).If you are a fan of Monster Ranchn garantee you will  like this!	1
This game is so cool to play it and I think you  play PS2 one this games be out world.	1
I did not like this game at all. However I love the sequel Burnout 2. I suggest you avoid this one and play 2 instead. End of story.	-1
I finally completed Baldur's Gate:Dark Alliance, during which I had received this game.  The manual looked like it kept the elements of the original games (which I even went back and replayed last summer).  While replaying the old games brought back the enjoyment of playing them on the Apple in seventh grade, games of today are far too many and more fun to waste a lot of time on a game that in today's terms could only be considered repetive at best, and boring at worst.  As with some of the previous reviews, the graphics and sound harken back to the days of Wizardry four - the first "graphical" Wizardry.  In other words, pretty poor.  When I got the game I noticed that Sir-Tech did not produce it and assumed they had been bought out by this company.  However, Wizardry 8 on the PC is out, and its produced by Sir-Tech.  All of which is to say that don't waste your time. There are better games to spend the day away - such as Baldur's Gate or Summoner.	-1
Don't plan on it. It is bad. You will be in a bland environment, with graphics made for the N64, then you will be in a story that doesn't involve you or anyone! Awesome! Not only is there no motivation, but there is a boring game! Take for example, save points. To save you have to leave, to leave you have to find an item or WALK back. When you learn about team attacks from this dude, he tells you all the different things then you try them. There is one that took me 3 hours to beat. It is called team defence. Every turn, 16 goblins would run at my guys, one time I tried attacking the goblins, but died horribly and had to redo my hour long work. Ok so then I tried again. This time when I did team defence, my girl would get lucky sometimes and hit something. it literally took me 2 hours just to do that battle. 3 hours because of the losing it and walking back. Cons: -The game costs money -Battles are repetitive -The environments are stupid. It is blocks. All blocks. -You hit up, down, left, and right to do everything. -The town is all text and stuff, there isn't any walking around. -The game has such poor graphics that are some of the most boring and uninspired environments ever conceived in a game. -The atari has better graphics than this game Pros: -The game is hard to find -You get a receipt for buying it	-1
This is another game that leaves much to be desired. The graphics are very PSone like and the gameplay lacks any real substance. You race past cars trying to get near misses and by doing so you fill up your burnout meter. Once your burnout meter is full you can go to supersonic speed whitch doesnt look or feel any different than when you were going normal speed. The near misses get to be very boring after a while. And there are not enough cars or tracks available. The racing to get to the next ckeckpoint is a little to arcade-like. The good thing about this game is that the steering and control are very tight. Bottom line rent it don't buy it. Buy GT3. That's it from me. I'm out :)	-1
Burnout is definitely not worth buying.  Even a rental isn't quite warranted.  Actually, the best way to experience Burnout is to stop by a friend's house when he's rented (or bought) it.  If you drive just one lap of a race, you get the idea.  There's really not that much more to get out of it.  With games increasingly being measured by the hours of original play that they offer, this is really quite pathetic. The idea is appealing to anyone who lives in a metropolitan area and has to hassle with traffic--just plow through the congestion and buzz on.  However, the execution of the game is so half-arsed that even young children will lose interest after a few heats.  Get more points by sliding around corners?  Who cares?  Drive head-on into traffic to get a bonus speed burst?  Even this is dull in Burnout.  The replays are very choppy, as well; the pavement looks about as believable as it would if you were to try to pass a glass of milk off as the Statue of Liberty. It seems that the next ingenious move by some bright developer is going to involve melding the possibilities of this game with the spot-on craftsmanship of the Gran Turismo series.  Let's invoke crashes on the highway at 150 mph...let's see some damage on the cars where it happens...let's have a suped-up racing engine that tears through the suburbs and plows down small families...Wheeeee!  Unfortunately, Grand Theft Auto 3 has already done this, so don't get all in to a tither like you do. If someone wants to make just a racer interesting for me after something as satisfying as GTA 3, though, they're going to have to do better than Burnout.  Pity your friend and his (expensive) mistake after your obligatory lap--and save your money. (...)	-1
Did not work at all. Would not even come up on the ps2. Could not read disk came up over and over.	-1
Now that was a good game.  It had decent music, decent graphics for its time, and the characters you chose looked beautiful.  This is so so in my opinion, as it is not enough better from what I've seen to warrant an overhaul of your machine (you need a Pentium 3 or more, a dvd-rom, and everything else to work well; Daggerfall ran on WIndows 95/98).  I managed to get it to run even without the dvd-rom, but I wasn't really impressed.  That all considered, the controls are harder to maneuver (since I didn't have a manual, I had a tough time figuring out how to talk to people), and they scrapped the default design from Daggerfall, so you have to move forward using alphanumerics instead of cursor keys.  If you have a manual, and you have the specifications, it might be worth your while.  Given the choice, though, I'd rather purchase Daggerfall again. I just found out that even though XP generally forbids Daggerfall, if you are unlucky enough to have XP and not have capacity to run Morrowind, go type in Daggerfall XP patch into the search engine to reconfigure the system. I think the deal is that it's illegal to have both on your computer, so if you have Morrowind capacity (I hate you), you shouldn't install this patch.	-1
The world of Morrowwind looks like a brown ugly swamp.  The same drab colors are everywhere you go.  Oh ya, and while you tour this uninteresting landscape, you may be attacked by crabs and flies. Interactions with other characters are highly uninteresting, the quests are boring and it takes forever to walk everywhere. Fighting consists of clicking your mouse button over and over to swing your weapon.  It's really lame. This game falls way short of the quality of Elder Scrolls I: Arena.  If you want a REAL roll playing game, get Baldur's Gate II!  That's a modern day classic and you can purchase it for around 20 bucks nwo.	-1
I honestly do not see what everyone else does in this game. I bought it based on the all the tremendous hype it received. I was really excited about the game when I first played it, but within a week of installing it, I realized that it just wasn't all it was made up to be by all the hype. The world is expansive, yes. In fact, its overwhelming. The landscapes look great and the enviornmental and weather effects are amazing. The problem with this gigantic world is that it is sparsely populated. You only see signs of life when you go into towns or dungeons. Most of the time the wilderness is uninhabited. And that makes the game lonely. In fact, this game is like playing Ever Quests and other similar massive online games...except you are the only player. There is no one else. And that gets lonely. Why a multi-player option was not included is beyond comprehension. The character models are quite possibly the ugliest character models I have ever seen in a game. The faces are hideous, and all the models look deformed and blocky. This is not because of a system configuration (my computer running top of the line hardware), it is just horrible character design. Further adding to the feeling of repetition, there are only about 5 or 6 different faces per race, further split up between gender. So, with hundreds of NPC's in the game, you see the same faces repeated...ALOT. Not only are all the faces and character models virtually identical, but they all repeat the same text over and over. Although there is a long and involved story in the game, I could never follow it. I didn't find it interesting at all, and frankly, since every character said virtually the same thing, after a while I just found myself not really caring what NPC's said. I ignored them completely. That made the game utterly boring. Maybe its my own fault, but I honestly just got sick of reading the same text over and over from the repetetive NPCs. Creating your character is probably the only entertaining thing about this game. You have the option to pick a pre-existing class, have a custom class created for you by answering questions, or creating your very own class, mixing any abilities that you wish. There are multiple races to choose from, each having unique abilities that set them apart from one another. Picking your appearence is pointless, simply because there aren't many choices, and they all look the same. Plus, you'll see whatever face you pick for yourself repeated over and over in the game on the NPCs, as I mentioned earlier. Upping your skills in the game is simple enough, though it takes hours and hours. If you have the time--and high boredom threshold--you could stand in one spot using your skills over and over and get them up. Using your skills over and over is the only way to advance them, and until you find heavy combat areas, you won't advance much at all. Despite the amazing environmental graphics and weather effects, great ambient sound and sense of exploration, Morrowind just doesn't really cut it. I found the music to be repetetive and dull. There is alot to do in the game, but quests just seem so empty. Of the few quests that I did, I never once got a feeling of satisfaction upon completion. In the end it just felt like more mundane tasks to do, and that made it boring. The heavily touted World Editor allows you to do all types of things, editing almost anything about the game.  You could build your very own world if you had the time and patience.  Oh, and did I mention you need a degree in Quantum Physics to even comprehend how complex the editor is?  Only die-hard, heavily devoted users who would forsake everything else in their life and spend countless hours, days, even weeks trying to learn and master the editor should bother with it.  It is definitely not for the casual editor, or someone with a remote interest in tinkering with the game. If you have countless hours to devote to this game, then you might find it enjoyable. Frankly, I just do not have the time or patience to devote to the game...and it quite simply does not live up in any way to the tremendous hype it received. If the game DID live up to its hype, then I would enjoy it...then I would find the time to devote to this game. In the end, I found it to be nothing more than a repetetive, boring, and dreary gameplay experience. Morrowind should only be played by fanatic, hardcore RPG players. Casual gamers should stay away.	-1
Ladies and gentlemen, I have some terrible news. Morrowind, the third chapter in the Elder Scrolls saga, has proven to be one of the biggest PC let-downs in history. The game is a definitive example of what happens when endless opportunities meet horrible gameplay. By endless opportunities I mean that our good friends at Bethesda Softworks spent countless hours developing an amazingly beautiful and immersive 3d world...one in which you can go anywhere and do almost anything.-Open ended, epic world and events. - Though I did also say horrible gameplay...and Morrowind suffers immeasurably from just that. The fighting system is agonizingly weak. Unless you have a great weapon and awesome abilities with that weapon, you're going to spend a great deal of time getting [beat] by some of the games lowliest creatures.  Also - There are so many spells and enchantments to use that it gets overwhelming trying to remember what does what and how to use it. Not only are the spells too many, but the interface with which to use them is cumbersome and annoying as well. You get stuck in these skirmishes, and you're struggling to attack and switch spells at the same time while your enemy(impossible to outrun) beats you down with little effort. _ Like I said, the world is very beautiful and the characters are amazingly detailed, but all this is lost as the game tries to run before it can walk.  I'm sure geeks with nothing to do with their lives will have a fun time modding this one to death and spending every hour playing it until their character can stand up to the game's foes.  But for the rest of us, crap on that. - - In short, Morrowind's designers tried to stuff 5 pounds worth of greatness into an 11 ounce box.** Too much at once for any gamer who doesn't think an aggravation induced stroke should be part of epic fantasy gameplaying. - Buy at your own risk.	-1
The requirements on the box state soemthing to the effect of "If your video card is as fast as x you may play". Well, I have a voodoo 5500 and it is definitely faster than the card they listed, but it is totally unsupported. They could at least list out the exact cards it supports, for God's sake.  SInce there are only 3 of them I think, that is not a lot to ask.... Being a programmer myself I am forgiving of bugs as long as they make an effort to patch in the future, or I would not have purchased the game considering how shoddy their past games were when initially released, but this is a different story; to require the directX features that they do, they would have had to develop to that directX level before it was even released or supported by the graphics card vendors. At any real software shop, such a thing would never be considered; the 'engineers' at bethesda are proving themselves hacks more than ever with this nonsense. I for one will never be purchasing a game from this company again....	-1
I am going to make this very simple, the quote on the box states "best looking RPG ever".  This is not an exaggeration -- this is pure fact.  The monsters, weaponry and game space are without equal -- anywhere, in any game.  But at the same time, imagine trying to play Doom 2 or Civilization on an Atari 2600.  You got it: it won't work -- just like Morrowind on most modern day HOME computers. Unless you're running it on an NSA mainframe (think Cray supercomputer), then expect three hours of wait time for every hour of play time, or worse.  And even though the visuals are stunning, it becomes maddeningly frustrating to have to deal w/ all the load times, oftentimes in the middle of battle. To give you a sense for the system requirements, I run an HP 9895 with 256 MB of RDRAM with an Intel 1.7 Ghtz Pentium 4 processor and a video card with 32 megs of video RAM.  And this game cooks all system resources and consistently crashes my machine about every 45 minutes.  If Bethesda Softworks (the company who eveloped this game) is reading this: yes, this is an indictment of your ability to manage code and system resources -- you've done a terrible job of this in Morrowind. Net/net: 1) Awesome visuals 2) Cool monsters and weaponry 3) Huge, and I mean huuuuuge world to play in 4) Unfortunately, do yourself a favor, put your money and time elsewhere -- this game is simply not fun due to the exasperatingly slow play caused by flawed programming	-1
Like its predecessor, 'Morrowind' promises great things, shows potential for achieving those ends, and fails. The gameplay itself is superb, with open-ended character development and a large game world which allows for countless hours of exploration. And also countless hours of desktop crashes (which require a reboot), horrendous lag/framerate problems and everybody's favourite memory from 'Daggerfall,' the fall through the world. Actually, PRIOR to the patch, I didn't experience much by way of CTD, but now it occurs after about 15 minutes of game play, and without fail. Maybe in 6-12 months the game will be sufficiently patched to achieve stability, allowing me to return to the wonderful world-setting Bethesda has created. Until then, however, the CD will have to collect dust. Even with a high-end system configured to run this game efficiently, I have yet to be able to experience "Morrowind" without extraordinary frustration and disappointment.	-1
The graphics are impressive, however, when interacting with other characters a window pops up and you basically have to read and click as a means for interaction. There is a main window with text that represents the response of the character you are interacting with, and on the right there are headings that read rumors, where are you from, etc... I find this interaction to be totally archaic so I was totally unimpressed by this gameplay. Also, after you have clicked on all of the options on how to communicate with the character and you click on goodbye, as you are leaving the character will say, "Can I help you", or something to that affect. Didn't I just exhaust every question with this guy? What else do I need to speak about? Also, the fighting in this game is really dissapointing. You hit then he hits, you hit then he hits...get the point? Yawn.... I believe this game would have been the greatest game ever made if it came out ten years ago. Definately try before you buy.	-1
I will echo the words of so many others who have made the mistake of purchasing this "game."  My system exceeds the "recommended requirements" printed on the box, and yet the game, when it runs, runs horrificly. for example: 1:  every time you enter a new region in the game, gameplay stops for solid minutes while the new region loads. 2:  Every time I approach an NPC to interact, the game locks up for at least 60 seconds, while it loads whatever snippet of info the NPC has associated with it. 3:  The game will sporadically lock up for 2-3 minutes, for no apparent reason. 4:  Loading a game takes around 5 minutes. 5:  support is horrible.  Beyond the standard, weak advice to "load the most recent graphic card drivers and re-install direct X 8.1", there is zero- I repeat- ZERO customer support available. 6:  the ingame graphic engine causes my geforce 2 to lock up, even when the game is played at 640X480.   Geez- I could go on- but I think the above 6 examples (which- trust me- are the very tip of the iceberg of faults that this game comprises) are reason enough to avoid this.  Playing this game is neither fun, enjoyable, or even tolerable. Furthermore- after un-installing this game, my copy of CREATURE ISLE no longer plays properly.  It's rare that a game comes along that actually does DAMAGE to your system...	-1
I am going to reveal the ending, so do not read ahead if you still want to play this game. Many others have already posted their opinions here, so I will not go through the whole game in detail. But as many others have said, the voice-acting for the Obi-Wan character is ridiculously, unintentionally humorous -- the actor sounds like a guy with a head cold trying to imitate Ewan McGregor doing Obi-Wan, exaggerating the distinctive traits McGregor's Scottish accent -- so even lilts in his voice are thrown into hyperdrive. (as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept. gave to Qui-Gon Jinn -- yes, the bridge on Liam Neeson's nose may be somewhat big, but since when did he have Karl Malden's nose?) The game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department -- sometimes you can't see features on faces. But onto the ending. The game is fun, with a handful of challenging levels -- mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind high-powered laser cannons. But it's marred by a disappointingly quick and all-too-easy ending. The moment arrives -- you finally meet Darth Maul. Just like in the movie, you stand behind the laser wall and watch as Qui-Gon is struck down by Maul. And finally the wall opens, you hold your breath, ready for a tough battle -- one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out. But it's not to be. Darth Maul is ridiculously easy to defeat. I beat him on my first try and in less than a minute. And you have to fight him twice -- as once you take him down the first time, he gets a new, full meter of health. So in less than a minute, I drew down two full health meters. I felt cheated, to say the least. I remember fighting against Mace Windu to have to reach the next level, and I had to go toe to toe against him some 20 to 30 times before I finally beat him. I was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty, but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game. All I had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and Maul was done. How in the world could the game's makers create such a lackluster, lifeless, no-threat ending battle? I was left extremely wanting, and if it were a movie, I would have angrily asked for my money back. I cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was. Even more now, the Darth Maul character cries out for a game of his own. One can only wish -- for this Maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fight.	-1
When I heard that there would be an Obi-Wan game built in the vein of Jedi Knights I was so happy I bought an XBox. Well, I'm hitting myself pretty hard right now. While I will admit that XBox has had a very small handful of noteworthy titles my PS2 and GameCube have been giving me a lot more pleasure and good games to choose from. Obi-Wan stands as a testament to the type of over hyped garbage that the XBox has been pushing down a perhaps gullible consumer markets throat for almost a year now. To think that I bought the system for this game... Let me attack every aspect of it that is wrong.  The graphics are Playstation 1 quality at best, granted running in high resolution, but the character models, frame rate and animation are all terrible. The control feels clumsy, the story is boring, and as an Obi-Wan fan I was more put off by the way they portrayed Obi-Wan than enthusiastic about it.  The voice acting was terrible. The voice actors sounded nothing like their movie counterparts, and Obi-Wan came off as being very smug, and unlikable simply because of his voice alone. The sad part of this game is how great the game could have been if A) the graphics were more in touch with what the XBox CAN do, which is a lot more than this, B) the story and dialogue were a lot better, and C) the controls were not so clumsy and were a bit more precise. It is amazing to me that this game made it to the market like this. It was the reason I bought an XBox, it is a good thing I'm broke and could only afford to rent the game. Consumer beware! Rent this game before buying it!	-1
I sure expected a lot more from this game than what it offers. The game itself is ok but the graphics are terrible. This game was obviously not built from the ground up to take advantage of the Xbox. Rather, Lucas just took an existing graphics engine and packaged it as a new game. I'm suprised that Microsoft allowed this game to be one of the early Xbox titles. With so many other games that have good gameplay and fantastic graphics, I just don't understand why this one was released except as a fill in until other Star Wars games come out. With the power of the Xbox this game could have been fantastic if it was built to be a top notch game like Halo. Instead we are left with a ok game and 1995 type graphics for the same money that a game such as Halo costs.	-1
Aside from some of the really cool things that you can do with the "force" and decent controls, everything else about this game... The graphics look out-dated and non-Xboxish and you fight the same monsters over and over and over and over again in a very repetitive game. The voice-acting and CG movies are just plain bad. Avoid this game -- get Halo instead.	-1
That is the question that I want answered, and thought that I had found it when I learned about this game last year. But the end result is monotonous and seems rushed. First of all, for an adventure game, the story needs to much more explained than the little snippets that are given throughout the game. What you do get are little tidbits from the Episode I plot line thrown into the mix. But, they are displayed poorly throughout, as much is in this game. To follow up on the displaying poorly remark, I have to say that the graphics on this game are definitely sub par. Most of the levels get extremely monotonous. You will know what I mean after following Qui Gon around into room after room that look absolutley identical. You will also notice that during the cut scenes, or during other gameplay parts when characters are speaking, they lack the ability to move their lips when they are speaking. It just seemed to me that the developers avoided attention to detail that any Star Wars fan would want. The gameplay is what I should really be focusing on though. The force abilities rock, as does the manual control of the lightsaber. I have a feeling that these aspects are what they began with and based the game around as they are the best parts of it. This game also allows the ability of "bullet time" to a certain extent, however I didn't find it useful except in a few minor circumstances. But, the major drawback to the gameplay is controlling Obi Wans movement. He lacks the ability to turn quickly to the right or the left, and his movement is incredibly choppy. You may just laugh as loud as I did the first time you saw him run as well. Another serious drawback to the game is the camera. There are some serious problems when you get to close to a wall or to another character.  Other stalls in the gameplay include when more enemies are loading, and WHENEVER you turn on or off your lightsaber. This game is barely worth the rental in my opinion, and only worth the purchase if you are a die hard Star Wars fan who needs to play all the games related to the series.	-1
Man, this game is the worst game I had ever played. EVerything is wrong about this game. THe controls are aweful, TRhe graphics are outdated, the moves (...), the caractors look bad, the fighting is terrible. When I first rented this game because I am a avid game of fighting, after the first match, I returned it to blockbuster. I HAVE NEVER PLAYED SUCH A FAILURE!!(...). This game is abysmal. This game sholud have never been released because it is so(...) aweful. (...)	-1
I'm not a master at fighting games, but I got to wiggle my way through the medium difficulty level of MK1 on SNES, and I finish the medium level of Super Street Fighter II revival. But MK advance is way too hard, even on the easiest level. It's not challenging, it's downright frustrating.	-1
Mortal Kombat Advance was released years ago, but as long as the game remains on the market, people should be warned of the utter disgrace of a title they may one day consider.  If you're reading this because that day has come, heed my words closely: There is no legitimate reason to buy Mortal Kombat Advance.  None.  Midway was once well-known as a failure in making handheld versions of their popular, arcade-quality titles.  Mortal Kombat Advance is one of these.  The game is filled with bugs, making the easiest difficulty as ridiculous as it is inconsistant, then almost impossible on any difficulty from the default up.  If you're still playing the game after a half-hour or so, it's probably to figure out how to beat anyone in the higher difficulty levels; simply put, it isn't.  The game just wasn't made well enough to offer fair play against CPU, and if that's all you've got for play options, then your experience is going to be the worst possible.  The rest of MKA's elements are a mixed bag.  The graphics are standard for classic Mortal Kombat games, but the animation is subpar, giving it the air a bad SNES port.  The same goes for sound, which is minimal, and music, which is poor if even existent.  There really isn't anything for this game to fall back on; not only is it shamefully unimpressive in its gameplay, but it's an embarrassment to hear and see, too.  The only thing this game is even remotely good for is two-player combat.  There are over 20 "Kombatants," giving players plenty of characters to keep things mixed up.  Not having to deal with the AI is a plus, but the bugs make it difficult to execute moves; consequently, fights are reduced to button-mashing and desperate attempts to pull off combos and special moves, which may or may not even work.  This too may ultimately leave you frustrated, especially since the prospect of playing two-player meant TWO copies of this game were purchased; that's simply two too many.  Midway has learned its lesson since releasing Mortal Kombat Advance, releasing far better titles in MK: Deadly Alliance and MK Tournament Edition.  Again, if you're even considering Mortal Kombat Advance, do yourself a favor and don't.  There are plenty of better options out there.	-1
Its umk3 potable and ruined. It could have been so easy to finally come out with a good mk game on gameboy. the graphics and sound are incredible, and the number of players is nice, but pnce again the game play is sooo bad. It is extermely hard, and very boring. The people move so slow and its almost impossible to win. They should take the old mk2 for the old gb and port it to gba with color and bloo(sorta like the gg version) that would be a thousand times better.	-1
I buy EGM alot and I read all their reviews but something  caught my eye. Mortal Kombat Advance got a O.O out of 10.  I read the review of it and began to laugh one reviewer quoted,  "Mortal Kombat is a stinking pile of bloody dog krap!"  While another quoted, "I'd rather be locked in solitary  confinment while gargling cat piss." Ignor reviewer one, I  do not reccomend this to anyone this game is crap, WARNING:  DO NOT PLAY should be stuck to the box case.....hooorrible	-1
If you truly and utterly hate someone, then I have a little hint for you.  Buy them this game.  When they play and see the sketchy graphics, the poor backgrounds, and the fact that some of the special moves go through your opponent, they will think the game is defective.  When they go to the game store to exchange it for a real copy, you will laugh with glee as they find that there was no defect, but it was the real game!  Only use this against a bitter enemy however, as this game is an incredible torture that I would wish upon noone.  If that doesn't convince you to run away at the sight of this game, then let me put it this way: Hitler is being forced to play it right now on the 9th level of Hell.	-1
I was looking forward to a complete packing of MK for GBA, but the controls and gameplay was horrible.  Very hard to execute moves and it was way too easy for the CPU opponent to sweep you into oblivion.  I ended up trading this one back. If you want portable Kombat for Game Boy Advance, go for MKII and MKIII instead. (looking foward to MK Deadly Alliance)	-1
If only Midway would put more thought into their games, this could have been one of the best games for the GBA.  First off this is an exact copy of the 16 bit versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which isn't a bad thing, but the translation to the GBA could have been done much, MUCH more better, and what we have is a game that feels unfinished.  The graphics are bland, very bland.  The characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky.  The moves aren't as easy to pull off as you might think, and yeah they take practice to pull off, but they could have been made much better.  All in all, Mortal Kombat Advance isn't worth the asking price, but its not a completely bad game, just buy it when you find it in a bargain bin.	-1
This was my first attempt at the horror genre. The game is certainly creepy, and has some great scenes, but I didn't find it captivating at all. The game was just too slow. The plot was on the corny side, but it had a few nice surprises. I think the biggest problem was that you couldn't just spend an hour here and there for this game. It required large chunks of time to really get into it. Too bad, because it looked like it had potential.	-1
Aaarrrrggghhhh! This game is awful! I must admit that I was taken in by the storyline and creepy aura of this game. But, the game contol is the worst of any X-box game I've played. More than half of your game-time is spent just trying to make your character "James" go in the proper direction. There is only one thumbstick used to control both the direction he looks and the direction he moves. VERY AWKWARD!! On many occasion, such as narrow hallways etc., you find yourself pushing up on the thumbstick so that you can have a face-to-face veiw of James walking right toward you. I guess this might be OK if James was a buxom hot chick, but he's not, and this camera angle makes it impossible to see where you are going. James doesn't jump, James doesn't crouch, heck you can barely just make him walk! Konami needs to learn that no matter how good the storyline and graphics, if you can't control the character the game is worthless. p.s. Konami, can I get my $$ back?	-1
Ok.  This game i rented hoping to have a good action-storyline based game.  Well theres a story line, and i have to day its a good one.  But the fun in this game lacks, its can be addictive, but unless you have alot of time on your hands, its not really great.  The graphics are top notch the gameplay is good, the setup overall is good.  But after paying for awhile i lost intrest and put it down.  If you are someone who likes strategy, lots of thinking and lots of time, this game is for you.  But if you are someone who likes fast paced action and exitement this game is not for you.  I do have to day at times there is some action and some horror, but not much, so this game i give to stars for the graphics, and for the lack of intrest and fun.	-1
SILENT HILL WAS WITHOUT  QUESTION THE MOST BORING AND NON ACTION OR STORYLINE OF A GAME IVE  EVER PLAYED.FIRST OF ALL ITS ALMOST IMPOSIBLE TO GET ANYWHERE IN THE GAME WITHOUT CHEATING WITH THE BOOK I DONT BUY GAMES SO I HAVE TO CHEAT AND PLAY WITH THE BOOK SO I CAN PLAY THE STUPID GAME FINDING STUFF ON YOUR OWN IS ALL THE FUN NOT WITH SILNT HILL AND I PLAYED IT ON PS2 AND I  HATED ON THAT GAME SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT ON XBOX.WELL IM SORRY TO SAY THAT IT RANKS DOWN AS LOW AS BRITNEYS DANCE BEAT.THEY NEED TO STOP THIS MESS NOW MAKING A THIRD GAME IS GONNA DO ONLY ONE THING MAKE ME WRITE ANOTHER BAD REVIEW WHITCH I HAVE NOT DONE IN ALONG TIME SORRY ITS JUST PLAIN BAD.	-1
This isn't necessarily a bad game, but I found the difficult controls and awkward fighting to be annoying.  Fans of Max Payne, Halo, and other games of that ilk should consider renting this game before buying it.	-1
I don't know where some of these reviews came from, maybe they own stock in the company, but this game has extremely poor game play control and is a waste of money.  Not even close to a Max Payne.  Save your money and if you want to know anything more about the game, rent it first, even at that, save your money and buy something decent.	-1
This cable has poor video quality compared to the Nintendo cable.  It seems like there is interference.  I do not recommend buying this.	-1
This is the third aftermarket cable I've bought to attempt to connect my Game Cube after losing the original cord.  Every cord I've tried results in a very poor picture.  I started to think maybe there was something wrong with the Game Cube or my TV, but then I found the original cord, and it works just fine.  I did test this cord with my SNES and it seems to work fine for that one.  Not sure what the issue is, but I wouldn't recommend using this cord with a Game Cube.	-1
Just gotten the console. The power cord and controller were not in it at all.	-1
This came in with a disc reading problem, and made me embarrass my friend at his birthday. Thanks for the malfunctioning console. I had to trade it with my friend's so he could have a working X-box.	-1
Yes, this controller looks very nice. The rubber pads are great, and it is a bit smaller. However, the response on it is horrible. First off, I like the Microsoft controllers. I have small hands and people complain about the size of the controller, but after a little bit of playing, it really does feel natural in your hands. ALL the buttons are pressure sensitive; this is not the case with the MadCatz controllers. The buttons on the Madcatz controllers are NOT pressure sensitive. I have confirmed this by going into the Sparring Mode of DOA3 and running through the moves tutorial. When using this controller, the moves are different. You now have to use the direction pad in combination with different button presses to execute moves. For example, a certain move that requires just a HARD button press with the Microsoft controller now requires you to hit Down on the direction pad along with the button press to pull off the same move with the MadCatz controller. Add to that the fact that you have to really push down on the MadCatz buttons to get any response out of it really makes the MadCatz an inferior, frustrating, and after long periods of play, a painful controller to use. Do yourself a favor, just stick with the Microsoft controllers for now and avoid this one.	-1
When i purchased this game i thought it would be fun to play a classic game such as Baldur's Gate, but when i got to play it, omg, it is so, so slow and the graphics are incredibly horrible. I couldn't beleive what I was seeing. It's horrible. The battles are the most awful thing, the characters are the ugliest thing, the gameplay just makes you want to hit your head with the CDs and the box of Baldur's Gate and throw up on it. IT'S THE WORST RPG I HAVE EVER PLAYED. It's a disgrace to the RPGs. I like the board game, but this, this is simply a bad, bad PC D&D game. Amazingly boring. Absolutely awful  DO NOT BUY. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY. I'm almost sure that you'll regret it.	-1
pins are way to tight. had to loosen up with pliers. ended up ripping the rca ports out of a BRAND NEW HARMON KARDON RECEIVER!!! although with a softmoded firmware n pushing the xbox at 1080 it looks almost as good as 360	-1
Don't be deceived by the 4-star rating this game inexplicably has on Amazon. Granted, it's not the worst game ever, but it just doesn't compare favorably to most of the other recent games that I've played for the PS2. Once the spectacular (albeit gory) opening cutscene is done, it's all downhill.  First of all, it's clear that this was intended to be a PS1 title originally, so it's not really fair to compare it to what's currently available for the PS2. Therefore, I have to cut them some slack on the choice to go with painted backdrops instead of a 3D rendered environment. Still, they clearly didn't have the talent to make the environments interesting and/or beautiful. It's not so much that I prefer 3D environments; it's just that if you're going to go with backdrops, please, make them well drawn. Shadow Hearts' backdrops don't even compare favorably to most of Square's RPG games for the PS1, let alone stuff that's available for the PS2.  The dialogue is, more often than not, skin-crawlingly bad. They were apparently trying to be campy and anachronistic; however, they didn't take it far enough to make it seem deliberate. You could write it off as bad translation, but the frequent use of modern American idioms makes me think otherwise. Someone at Sacnoth just had really bad taste with language. The main character Yuri goes from man-child timid to tough-guy bravado far too quickly; it's not clever or funny, it's just inconsistent writing. Alice, the pretty young thing and object of everyone's desire (those programmers really, really need to get out more - I mean, just look at her skirt), is drawn paper-thin in terms of character, and everyone else is just there as props. The writers also seem to take great glee in presenting you with as much blood and gore as possible. I'm not sure what the point is. Is it supposed to make the game more "adult" or edgy? It's just icky. There's one section of the game when you're pretty much just walking around on blood-soaked earth (and probably entrails), and the accompanying sound effects are enough to turn your stomach. Yuck!!  The bad guy's name is Roger Bacon. I'm sorry, that's the most ridiculous name for a villain I've ever heard. Yes, I understand there's a historical reason for this, but come on; you're up against a breakfast side-dish. I mean, how threatening is that. "I went to the store today and I picked up some Roger Bacon."  The sub-plots are mostly lame (you have to go through TRIALS to get to the temple - how original), the cut-scenes are long and boring (ask anyone who has played this game about "Shloop... shloop... splat! Skreeeee!"), and most of your time is spent just hoping you can get to somewhere more interesting than where you are. Occasionally there was a well-thought-out plot point that I enjoyed (particularly the parallels between Yuri and his father), but for the most part it's just one dull environment after another.  The plot itself suffers from serious lack of development. It looks like the programmers and writers simply ran out of time, so they wrapped it up as quickly as possible; in fact, they specifically threw in a not-so-subtle self-conscious joke about the fact that they couldn't finish writing the game in time, so they had to cut stuff. Really sad. The end battle and resulting aftermath is so anti-climactic and boring that I ended up feeling like the whole game was a complete waste of my time. That's 40+ hours of my life that I will never get back.  The music is one of the game's few strong suits, with a pretty good number of catchy tunes. But once again, it's wildly inconsistent. It's 1913 and you've got heavy metal blaring in the opening cutscene. Wha huh? The music tends to be fairly inappropriate for a lot of the game, but at least it's entertaining.  Most games that feature turn-based combat (since Final Fantasy VII at least) tend to involve selecting an action, and then you sit there for a good long time while the animation plays out. Not so with Shadow Hearts; you have to do a little thumb-dancing with the Judgment Ring(tm). Overall, I find this to be a plus because it adds a little risk/reward element. You can elect to just go with the safe route, or you can take a risk and go with a more difficult (and more damaging) option. I like it.  The monster and player animation is adequate. Not great. Every once in a while a character does something clever or amusing and I have to chuckle at the animator's sense of humor, but meh. I've seen better. For some reason, something like 75% of the monsters are essentially humans hanging upside down, or with mis-placed limbs or joints. I'm betting that they found it easier to simply move a few limbs around on a standard humanoid 3d-model to create a new monster instead of coming up with something truly original.  For some reason, inventory items are limited in the number of characters for the name, so you get really stupid and meaningless item names like "V-blade-Blodauth." Wha?  The use of emoticons is reasonably clever, but it seems to me that it was mainly implemented for the purpose of cutting down the number of animations or movements that they needed to code. It doesn't really add much, and sometimes it's a little puzzling; like, just what is that icon that looks like a teardrop?  To sum up, if you do get this game, you'll probably have a good time, but you'll have to laugh at some of the ridiculous cliches and other absurdities. Overall, I give this game 2 stars as it isn't ENTIRELY horrible, but it's just not quite developed enough to be what I would call "average." I would only recommend playing through this game if you intend to also play the sequels, which are markedly better in production quality and more deliberate with their use of camp and anachronism.	-1
I gave it 2 stars for the cracks in case and the unsealed this was im a bit disappointed	-1
Eh.  Graphics are great, battles are okay, but the extreme amount of linearity and annoying characters (personality and voice alike) robbed me of the chance to even FINISH it.  You can't explore.  Anything.  That's not a Final Fantasy game!  Was happy to get an open world back when FF12 came out... before they release 13 which somehow turned out to be WORSE than 10, but I digress.	-1
This game didn't work. It kept glitching up. But this is a great game i would buy a working copy.	-1
I could not get into this game, despite knowing it's a classic RPG.  The beginning was clumsy and very drawn out.  I found the game play to be awkward, especially compared to other RPGs, the DQ series, Zelda, Castlevania, many others.	-1
Final Fantasy X  is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square as the tenth entry in the Final Fantasy series. The game marks the Final Fantasy series transition from entirely pre-rendered backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas, and is also the first in the series to feature voice acting. Final Fantasy X replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the "Conditional Turn-Based Battle" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the "Sphere Grid".  Set in the fantasy world of Spira, the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a blitzball star who finds himself in Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the summoner Yuna on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.  Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.  The gameplay of Final Fantasy X differs from that of previous Final Fantasy games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In Final Fantasy X, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X features numerous minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport "blitzball"  Final Fantasy X introduces the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system in place of the series' traditional Active Time Battle system first used in Final Fantasy IV. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. "Limit Breaks", highly-damaging special attacks, reappear in Final Fantasy X as "Overdrives". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.  Final Fantasy X introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the "Aeons" of Final Fantasy X arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests  The game has enjoyed high review scores from Japanese and Western critics. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu and Famitsu PS2 awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score, and readers of the former magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006. Another Japanese gaming magazine, The Play Station, gave the game a score of 29/30. Famitsu, Famitsu PS2, and The Play Station expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline, graphics, and movies. The game maintains a 91% approval rating on GameRankings and 92 out of 100 on Metacritic. Producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that the overall reception to the game was "excellent", having received praise and awards from the media.  IGN's David Smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. They also felt that the game's graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game as a whole was "the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clich&eacute;s commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was "diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game". Similarly, GamePro described its character building system and battle system as "two of the best innovations in the series". The visuals of the game were commended by GameSpy's Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as "top-notch", as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted most of them were "above average" and called the music "rich".  Edge rated the game considerably lower, criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as "nauseating", particularly panning Tidus. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer criticized the game's linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell noted that the game's puzzle segments were "depressing" and "superfluous", and that although the Sphere Grid was "a nice touch", it took up too much of the game. The linearity of the game was positively commented on by GamePro who stated that a player would not be required to participate in side-quests or the mini-game to reach the game's conclusion, finding some of them unappealing. Game Revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped, some even being too long.	-1
Game didn't work, well..it worked for about 15 mins then it freezes up at one particular part and no amount of disc cleaning fixes this.	-1
ps 2  well its going to ps 3  revamped  but the story is fast its mostly long beocuse of the required long  fights  while  not  movong  closer to the end	-1
I don't understand why some people love this game. From the obnoxious voice acting, to the obnoxious characters, to the mindnumbingly boring plot, there are no saving graces of this waste of energy.  I should have quit playing after ten hours, but I deluded myself into thinking it was going to get better. Yes, there are a few "surprise" plot twists, but they were predictable. Combat was interesting, but got old real fast. The leveling system was neat, but only superficially so. The cut scenes were plentiful and by plentiful I mean TOO MANY.  And don't get me started on Blitzball.  After the masterpiece which was the seventh game, the Final Fantasy series slipped with part eight. Part nine lifted the series, but this tenth one just about killed it for me. I have yet to play XII, but if it's just as bad as X, then I'm finished with the Final Fantasy series.	-1
The day of RPG's is over. This game, which I was told would bridge the gap from FFIX, failed and failed epically to provide. I'm not proud to say I purchased this game.	-1
This may shock you but I really don't think this game is the classic everyone say's it is.  The Good: The ability to tag your party members in and out is really neat. The summons actually stay and fight instead of attacking once and going away. ( i was amazed by this the first time i played it.) there is some exploration and hidden eons at end game.  The Bad: Everyone is really good at killing a certain kind of monster, turning random battles into rock paper scissors. Tidus for the lizards, Auron for the shells, Lulu for the Elementals, Rikku for machines, ect. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't SO prominent. You will literally go through most of the game one-shotting anything that isn't a boss monster, and don't even get me started on stone-touch weapons...  The voice acting is cringe worthy. Most of the game is a linier to the point most of the game world feels like a giant hallway. The Other characters are infinitely more interesting than Tidus. (Which is bad because he's narrating the story.) The blitzball. The plotholes.  The meh: The art style will either be hilariously camp or jarring to the point it takes you out of the story, or both. I mean the whole thing just screams "cosplay this! I dare ya!"  In conclusion, If you like this game, then good for you. If you don't then i'm honestly not that surprised.	-1
boring, boring, boring, so, so, boring.  I'm not even sure this is a game, there is no action and when there is action it's crap, for every minute of game play you have to sit through about 20min of a really bad movie. 1) story sucks 2) game play sucks [because there is none] 3) characters suck 4) cut scene's are DULL, IRRELEVANT AND YOU CAN'T SKIP THROUGH THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Yes, the plot is great and the game starts off really fun. And it has so many elements in there that make you enjoy it. However, as you reach toward the end of the game, the battles start getting ridiculously hard. If you are a game pro or you start off by following some game guide from the very beginning, maybe it's not a problem coz by the time you reach the end, your characters are strong enough and you would have enough items to support yourself in the battles. But fact is not everyone is a game pro or has some guide to follow. We SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. The game's difficulty should be reasonable for everyone as long as they play through.  But apparently if you don't do well enough in the beginning, then the game will become very miserable for you at the end coz you have to rely on luck to win. It's a punishment for not being pro enough. And you're pretty much screwed unless you have to mood and time to go back and start off again. There are other flaws as well. For example, the game maker could be a lot nicer by adding an item description when you're trying to use items during the battle. Some very useful items for battles are not available for sale. You will get frustrated as you reach toward the end and that misses the whole point of playing a game.	-1
Final Fantasy 10 is lets face it a bad 50 hour long movie. since I am still mad I WASTED 20 DOLLARS ON THIS GAME!!!!! Im not even going to give it a decent review. I mean the voice acting of this game is just sooooo terrible. Tidus voice sounds like hes eleven years old. The story is long and dull if you liked FF 1-9 AVOID FF 10	-1
When I got this game I was really up for it. I was in the middle of FFXII, buit decided to start on FFX. I had started to play it on my nephew's system a year or so ago. Anyway, I ended up with a PS2 and decided to get my own copy and start over. The graphics were 5 star as was the storyline. The design was poor. It was over balanced in so far as the number of battles. You could barely move without getting into another tussle. You start to walk up and talk to someone or get ready to open a chest and another battle. After about 49 Hrs. of this, I finally gave it up and took the thing to the used game store. My nephew, who lives to do battle, said it was way too much for him and it slowed down to a crawl. I ended up with 48:50 in the game and I was in the main corridor of the Al Bhed place. I couldn't move forward because of one battle after another. By this time the game had quit being fun and enjoyable. That was almost 49 Hrs. invested for nothing (it went to the used game store). Again, had they balanced out the game between moving the story along and the occasional battle/boss battle, it would have been enjoyable. Bottom line is that this game is heavily loaded with constant battles with hardly any down time in between. Great Concept, poor execution. Charlie S. Richmond Va.	-1
I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy Series: of Final Fantasy 1 (NES), 7 (PS1) and 9 (PS1). Final Fantasy X, however, reeks with fanboy stupidity, annoying, repetitive battles, and hours upon hours of boring, mundane, and unskippable "cut scenes" of characters exchanging dialogue. To make a bad situation worse, the voice acting is terrible. Squaresoft found actual voice talent when they localized Kingdom Hearts, so botching their flagship series is inexcusable.  Once I beat the game (which I did, while I was sick in bed with mono for a month), I felt like I'd completed a chore. I was expecting a game, but I found myself spending more time watching unskippable cut scenes than I did playing. Even when playing, all I did was move my character from point A to point B to advance the story. The only sense of interactivity came from not immediately going to point B, seeing if I could talk to a person or find a treasure chest that would come in useful, or suddenly getting stopped to battle a random monster for little to no reward.  The only thing that really kept me interested was the sphere grid system for character abilities. This system is a bold, ingenius move away from the traditional RPG levelling system. There are no levels--only nodes with abilities arranged in a gigantic, complex maze. By defeating enemies in battle you gain moves around the grid to activate more nodes. This part of the game was very addictive.  Overall, however, this title was just a disappointment. The lack of a world map may have been to create a sense of a giant world, but the path through this giant world ends up being a giant straight line. This, combined with the overwhelming amount of boring dialog exchanges, makes this installment of the Final Fantasy series very skippable.	-1
I bought this game at the full price, and discovered that all the hype was flat wrong.  The cut scenes were amazing, and the character leveling it very interesting, but that is all.  The game is very linear.  There is NO decision making on the part of the gamer about where to go or what to do.  The battle scenes are contrived and turn based, which I've always found boring and irritating.  It takes no skill or imagination to manuver through this game.  I wish I'd never bought this game.	-1
As the greatest Final Fantasy fan ever, I was very much looking forward to a true sequel to Final Fantasy 7, and I've always fantasized to myself about a FF game that was on a new generation platform.  I thought FFX was going to be the game I was always waiting for, but sadly, I was mistaken.  First of all, they totally mucked up the graphics.  Why did they have to move away from the elegance and beauty of the FF7 graphics?  FFX is all smooth and shiny and stuff.  Its totally just a cop-out made to look exactly like every other new RPG, rather than steering its own evolutionary course like FF7.  Who thought this game would be better by adding more polygons?  That is ridiculous.  Also, the story in FFX is more boring than church. They keep bashing you over the head with it again and again.  I get it already.  If you hate your father, and become a successful Fun-ball player, then you will create a giant sin ball that will destroy the fake fantasy world you just got transported to.  Gotcha.  Whose bright idea was it to put voice acting in this game?  Seriously, I can read.  Those dumb-heads at Square have severely underestimated me by doing this.  I read the FF7 script like five hundred times.  Do you really think I want to listen to this long, boring story?  No way.  Also, their voices aren't right, and I hate them.  Which reminds me, Tidus is stupid, and all whiny and wussy and stuff.  He was like my worst character, nothing like the cold, calculating majesty of Cloud.  Boo Tidus!  Also, the FFX mini-games aren't nearly up to par.  Fun-ball and chocobo race just aren't any fun at all.  Not like the brilliance of FF7's sub hunt, or board race, or mog's hidden fantasy castle adventure.  Please.  I'm going to spend hundreds of hours playing mini-games, so they should be good enough to be their very own game, like all of FF7's games.  All the bonus stuff you can do in FFX was stupid and easy too.  I killed the Ultimate weapon without even breaking the slightest of sweats, unlike the titanic struggle it was in FF7.  And what's the deal with the combat system?  Its like they thought I was too stupid to do things with a little action bar, and now I need it to be turn based.  And the summon animations only take like 30 seconds, so that you don't get the full majesty and wonderment of the spell.  Sitting through all five minutes of Knights of the Round was a pleasure every time, and it gave me an unnerving sense of power.  And I never needed to change out any member of my Cloud, Tifa, Cait Sith dream team in the middle of a FF7 fight, so why did they make FFX so stupid and hard and different and stuff so that sometimes I might want to switch people out.  Sometimes I just don't understand those screw ups at Square at all.  Why can't they just let you level up in a normal way?  That was very confusing.  When you fight things, you get little balls or something, and you put them in a thing.  I didn't really get it.  You're supposed to just get experience points, and then every once in a while it says, "Godly Cloud has leveled up", and it plays the little song.  In closing, this game was pretty stupid, despite my expectations.  I mean, as the greatest FF fan ever, I think I can tell these things, but this was just a hideous rehash of FF7, with nothing new added, and no innovation, and some huge backward steps in the story and character departments.  You're probably better off just playing Final Fantasy 7: "The Sephiroth Wars", again, because it is awesome.	-1
Wow, was this game a waste of time. Watching my brother play it, I didn't think it looked all that great, but the music was catchy and the battle system looked interesting so I bought it...  WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS...  ...Well, the music is allright at times, but only at few certain times. Most of the time it is standard at best, and that's the games high point, along with graphics of course. I won't lie, the graphics are great, but who cares about graphics in an RPG? I dont... The storyline was where the horror all started...Blitzball? Please...couldn't they have come up with anything better? This game is a prime example that SquareSoft (now "Square Enix") is horribly running out of ideas and is seeking the road of desperation. Surprisingly, this game is made by the team who made 8, which is amazing. I mean, 8 is my favorite FF game next to 6, and I cant believe that team made such a horrid RPG. Sure, there are similarities, such as realistic characters and a story that is more involving of the characters themselves, but come'n, FFX is a tragedy. The worst part of the game, the part that killed it for me, was the Sphere Grid. Oh man, where do I start? Basically, you sit there for long periods of time moving a cursor around this big dark grey/blue "sphere grid". It is incredibly boring, making you constantly click on different "nodes" and move there, and then use certain items to gain abilities. And what happened to leveling up? I guess the geniuses decided to take that out as well. It is really pointless, because now EXP is taken place by AP, which is a substitute in disguise. Battling seems much more tedious now, and you never truly feel that your characters are getting better, especially when you consider how long it takes to master this game. The sphere grid is just TOO big, and too boring. If I wanted to be bored I would play Mist or Halo, or some other computer game. It was cool to be able to play as summons, I will give them that, but when its better playing as a summon than the actual character you know something has got to be wrong...Just avoid this game at all costs, unless you want to waste a bunch of your life moving a cursor around a sphere grid...	-1
Well I am a huge fan of Final Fantasies but this one was just an embarassment. The point is just like any other FF but i'll let ya know whats wrong with it. First of the main character...Tidus....I think the name speaks for itself. The kid is a moron. Apparently he is a professional "blitz ball" player whatever the hell that is. One of the poorest excuses of a sport I have ever seen. More or less underwater soccer with cheap rules and unrealistic physics. But in short the entire time I was playing the game I was embarassed just playing as Tidus. Probably the worst FF character their is in the saga of Final Fantasies.  The magic and sphere grid was stupid as hell. You couldn't get your magic without waiting for a couple of years and it took forever to get around it. Remember in the other FFs when you got your magic and spells by gaining expierence or by collecting items. Well in this game Tidus and the gang thought up something new. Now you have to go through this annoying ass sphere grid which takes an hour to learn and another 100 hours to complete(Probably more).  Now the concept is just like I said similar to the other FFs with a story of love involved with the saving of all human kind. Well in this story Tidus is supposed to save the world with his "girlfriend" Yuna. The other characters are complete tag-ons and them making an impact on the story did not come into play at all.  Another thing wrong with this game was the boss. Now over the years in a bunch of different games I have seen werid bosses and cool bosses. Nevertheless it was nothing like I saw here. The boss "Sin" is a big blob. Not only that but hes brown (kinda makes you think). So with a queerish fellow like Tidus fighitng a Brown Blob Sin the game reached an all time low. So think about it do you want to reduce yourself to a level of absolute disgrace..If not don't play this game otherwise go for it and be embarassed out of your mind and be bored as hell. You will be disapointed. Their is an absolute gurantee that you will be disapointed after your done playing this game!!	-1
With a hugely absorbing plot and some beautifully-executed, long-overdue in-game enhancements, 'Final Fantasy X' ought to have been the standard-bearing Mega-Game that we all expected it to be. Sadly, thanks in no small part to a VERY limiting control system and very little room for gameplay freedom, FF X instead descends into the Bargain Bin of Pretty Games Sans Substance. Players control a young man named Tidus, a blond-haired juvenile-voiced Blitzball player, who, after his city is attacked by an evil force called Sin, his guardian Auran takes him to another world to uncover his heritage and save the universe from Sin. From there you get to recruit bigger and better players and there is, as always, a multitude of nice extras and side-quests that. in theory, add colour and excitement to the game. First, the good points. The graphics are astounding, with large, beautifully-detailed characters and bad guys maintaining a very impressive frame-rate on-screen. Music is fairly standard FF fare, stirring battle tunes and o-so-sweet ballady tracks adding much atmosphere to the proceedings. The voice acting has been unfairly criticised, it's good, and a hugely welcome change from endless reams of text to wade through. It's also easier to remember plot points when you hear them, and there's no danger of skipping over them with a Cancel button. However, this is customisable, and you can have the audio with or without subtitles. The plot, on paper, is one of the best FF plots around - detailed and complex, without being confusing, it's the stuff of solid games legends. Unfortunately, though, none of these points can save FF X from the in-game mechanics, and this is where FF X fails badly. The shrines and cityscapes of FF X are beautifuly detailed and bear exploring, and the fact that one can learn the language of Al Bhed are excellent points, both worthy of exploring at one's leisure. However, thanks to the hugely restrictive game-on-rails nature of FF X, it's oftentimes impossible to go where you want to go, or to prepare for the bigger battles. This affects the storyline, too, as major events for the first part of the game are few and far between, and so fighting beasties to build up your levels becomes such a chore. Plodding along, you very quickly get a sense of not having much to do with the game itself, that you're just there to watch events unfold and press the X button intermittently. And for some gamers, that's fine, but aftermagnificent titles like FF VII and FF IX, it's not really good enough for a FF sequel. Also, Blitzball is possibly one of the most over-complicated side quests ever, really worthy of being a game in itself. A disappointment that could so very easily have been an unequivocal classic, FF X is really a rent-before-you-buy title.	-1
I understand that many people love this game. I understand that people love the characters, the storyline, and the visually stunning cutscenes. There are even people who like the levelling up system, find the combat fascinating, and feel that the emotional development of the characters is well done and genuinely touching. I am not one of them. There are a lot of things wrong with Final Fantasy X. One of the first, and most noticable changes from previous Final Fantasies is the completely voiced dialogue. This lends itself to a more natural and immersive feel when done right, but FFX's dialogue is so poorly delivered, it is more cringe inducing than inspiring. As though the scriptwriters felt they had to come up with dialogue to match the lackluster acting, the storyline is one of the most blatantly obvious and hamfisted statements I've ever seen in any medium, poorly written children's books included. The main enemy is "Sin." Please. In regards to the game itself, the gameplay consists almost entirely of walking towards a red dot. I understand that that statement may seem confusing, but on the "map" on screen, there is a red dot pointing to exactly where you need to go to progress in the story. Looking for secret items? Head exactly in the opposite direction from the red dot, and you're more than likely to find some helpful items. This is not "gameplay." This is merely the illusion of interaction in between movies. Movies that will make you want to tear your ears off, the dialogue is so horrific. The combat system is rote RPG fare, with subtle alterations to the norm that don't end up making it a better or worse experience. Grandia II's combat system stomps all over it, and honestly, after Grandia II, no company, big or small, should be making "turn-based" RPG combat systems that are as dull as this one. The new level up and skill development system supposedly allows for character customization, but there's simply no point. Each character starts out on the grid in a position that has an optimal path, and the *only* benefit to diverging from that path is for the novelty of having your brawler actually be a weak spellcaster, and have no brawling abilities. Whee! I played about 25 hours of FFX, before finally realizing that not only would I never bother to finish this game, I found that I hated it. Hated it with a passion. The insipid storyline, the pathetically stupid main character, the horribly written relationship between the two leads, and the god-awful, ham-fisted, ridiculous writing makes this a game that I simply cannot recommend to anyone. The fact that it's as popular as it is is a strong statement about how much influence marketing and pretty graphics have on the game buying population as a whole, and it's not a statement that I could repeat here without it getting edited. I love videogames. I love RPG's. I love a quality story. I do not, however, have any love for Final Fantasy X.	-1
I am not the best video game reviewer.  I don't have hundreds of games, in fact I am very limited.  I have played FF7 and 8, I loved seven the most, eight was fine but too depressing IMO.  I had seen so many good reviews and heard so many good things about X and seeing that they did a part 2 to X, well I had to buy it (needless to say I got the Playstation 2 this Christmas so like I said, not the biggest video gamer). I wanted to like X I really did.  It had some breathtaking scenes and CGs.  Some of the action was inviting.  The characters themselves were very interesting.  But.  There was one anime movie after the next, very little if any character choices to go here there and everywhere.  The storyline was so convoluted that I could not make heads or tails of what was going on, not to mention I could not understand what this Sin being was (looked like a mutant whale to me)  It was so linear and it was so tight that I got bored easily, very easily.  I felt that there were waaayyy too many tutorials. I could not and cannot understand the character evolution dynamics.  I don't understand the whole structure even with help from the walkthrough books and what I looked up on the net, maybe its just me, but this game did not fit me at all. I seriously doubt I will get X-2 now.  Oh well.  Live and learn!	-1
I realize that a lot of people love this game but frankly it is just not my cup of tea.  Most of the time you do nothing but watch a movie.  It has to be the longest movie ever.  Even when you do get to play all you do is walk from point A to B. It is just plain boring and really slow.  I admit it could get better at the end.  I haven't invested the 300 hours that my brother has, but there are a lot better games out there where you get to play right from the beginning instead of a hundred hours into it.	-1
Loved MoO2, one of the greatest games ever. Master of Orion 3 is as far from 2 as cow poop is from filet mignon.  I borrowed this game (along with strategy guide) from a friend right after this game came out. Installed and tried it over the weekend. Was so Gosh Darned AWFUL that I brought it back to him the following Monday. He wouldn't take it back. Is such a pile of crap of a game, that he would NOT even accept the game back.  If you pay money for this, like any money, at all, you will regret it. Someone GAVE this game to me, and I regret owning it.  If you're on the fence about spending money on this, take the money you are going to spend and give it to a midget to kick you in the nuts for 4 hours, you will get more enjoyment out of it than this game.	-1
I can't get this game to run on my computer.  It is having display issues.  It's either too large, cutting things off, or things are just plain invisible.  I've tried re-installing twice.  MOOII is my absolute favorite game, and I had high hopes for this one.	-1
An excellent game idea. I played the first and fell in love with it way back when. This newest version though is a big disappointment. It doesn't have hardly any of the original style that made the first so fun and the interface on this one is *HORRIBLE*. There is no real hand-held manual for such a complicated game, only in-game and that is vague at best. Learning how to do something as eventually vital as build a fleet in order to defend or invade is hilariously ridiculous. At the time this series began, it was close to the only one like it and easily worth it, but it's clear they've lost the magic and the point with this one. Pass it by.	-1
Yeah, I'm a little late in writting a review for this game (about three years).  I decided to write one now, because i bought this game the day it came out, and just within these past few months (of 2006) i actually figured out how the game actually works.  It definitely has a high learning curve, i must of had 300 or so hours in playing this game before i was even a novice at it.  To say it's complicated is a serious understatement.  There's so many settings and buttons that it reminds me of one of those purposly complicated chain of machines and gadgets they use to do simple things like open doors for fun.  Just when you think you have it figured out, something happens that makes you throw a drink across the room and shout "Why the $%%# is it doing that???".  The main weakness in the game is the manual i think, it simply doesnt do a good job of explaining how the game actually works.  Only about 40% of the features and interactions are explained in it.  You're basically on your own to figure out everything else, which leads to a mountain of questions.  Heck, it took me about two years of playing the game on and off before i actually figured out how to create a task force.  Other questions still haunt me, with no answers to be found.  Can you disband a ground force unit?  Do they actually cost maintenance like the manual says....?  Anyone?  Supposidly, the game has a lot of automation features that make it easier for you.  Unfortunatly, these never work the way you want them too.  I cant count how many times i've been in the thick of a war, only to find that all my colonies are building scouts and colony ships rather than warships.  Great, the enemy is pounding away at our borders, but i got 30 colony ships in reserve, thanks a lot.  I'd like to say that the "Planetary AI" feature does some things right, but it really doesnt.  Instead of setting an compromised, steady financial setting it usually likes to just run the colony into the ground for a few turns, then do nothing at all for a few turns to fix the damage.  The fix, of course, is to simply turn all the automation off and do everything by yourself.  Which....can be quite a task when you're controling 30 or 40 worlds.  A single turn can take upwards of around 20 minutes like this (usually it takes about 600+ to win the game).  It's kind of sad that this is all the game is about when it comes down to it.  About 80% of your time is simply going to be spent on getting your colonies to do what you want them too, when supposidly it's supposed to be done for you.  Of course...all this frustration has to be leading to something really good right???  Nope.  The battles systems is....pretty basic.  There really is no room for strategy, brute force always wins.  The Ground combat system is laughably simple, yet confusing as to how it works.  Which leads me to my next rant:  Taking Planets from enemys.  This....is extremely difficult.  Invading a system, and destroying and local fleets, and planetary defences is actually the easy part of invading.  The hard part is what to do next.  Do you want to just destroy the colony on the planet?  Or do you want to invade the planet and control it yourself?  Well...if you want to choose the wisest path and just nuke the colony, you got yet another headache in store for you.  It's basically darn near impossible to do so.  It can (and does) take about 30-40 turns of orbital bombardment to destroy a colony (as opposed to the one or two in MOO2).  The only time effiecent method is to invade with ground forces and take the colony for yourself.  This leads to yet another series of headaches.  For one, the ground battle system is kind of a masterpiece in that it is both idiotically simple, and complicated at the same time.  You get to choose from about 20 different battle tactics on how you're going to assault the planet, without any explanation at all on the benifits or weaknesses of any of them.  Basically it's just a matter of guessing and hoping for luck.  If you do conquer the planet, you're in control of all the alien race there.  This isn't so great because the AI isn't very picky in choosing planets, so you usually end up with a real dump (yet another planet you have to manually control), with a population thats useless to you.  You cant really create things like colony ships there, because they'll create ones of their race, not yours.  So on top of the mountain of frustrations you have already, you get another: Somehow finding a way to keep your entire empire populated by your original race for simplicity's sake.  I'll stop before i get to far into this, rest assured i could write pages more of the headaches you have to deal with, but you get the idea.  The only other thing i want to mention is the interface really is a terrible design.  The first thing i learned in my freshman VB class was to make the interface user friendly (number 1 priority), these designers had a whole different agenda.  I won't go into many details but let me ask you this:  When you go to File, then Save As then click a file, it asks if you want to overwrite the file.  As an industry standard, which side of the little menu is "OK" and "Cancel" on?  "Ok" is on the left.  Of course, the designers of MOO3 just felt the need to be different, and cause tons and tons of frustration for people who blindly think that clicking on the left button saves the game.  All in all, i play the game because I "Want" to like it....not really because i do.	-1
This game is a terrible game!  I hated it in every way!  The game involved little play, most of it was movies.  It was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system.  The grapics were good but only is some scenes.  In the rest, the grapics were grainy.  The bosses past the half point of the game were super impossibly hard to beat.  Before the half point the bosses were super incedibly easy to beat.  The storyline was non progressive.(it stayed the same through the whole game)  There was a pokemon style of travel.  You walk a bit, fight a bit, and thats about it.  The cut scenes were SOOOOOOO LONG, and they wernt always with good grapics.  Personally, the only thing that I would recommend this game for is to throw it in the trash.	-1
If you've played the original or part 2 of Master of Orion (MOO) then you have an appreciation for all that this game could have been.  MOO 3 is not the same game as found in its ancestors.  Too much has been layered over and too much has been relegated to the closet.  The basic premise of guiding your civilization through various science fiction phases of development is still here - but in a much more complex, confusing, and over-bearing manner.  Sure there are ways to automate many things - but what fun is a simulation game if the simulator is simulating it?  And if you attempt to micromanage everything yourself (which I HAVE to do in such a game) then the cumbersome and often clumsy interface and mannerisms of MOO 3 become apparent.  Graphics & Sound:  -  The music and sound were nothing to write home about.  Adequate but not impressive.  Which is unfortunate in a sci-fi game where so many elements and moods could have been introduced: so many alien sounds could have been but aren't.  -  The graphics, in my opinion, were quite good.  The game doesn't need overly complex graphics to succeed but the visuals in this game, when appropriate, were quite satisfying.  There is a good look to the alien races and management screens.  Gameplay:  - the interface is clumsy and cumbersome: the tools you need to use are buried in the management menus and pull-downs.  Exploring and experimenting with various buttons, levers, whistles, and yo-yo's consumes an insane amount of time.  The game fails to incorporate the important and minor stuff into one easily-accessed package.  -  Developing your civilization can be very rewarding in a game like this: but MOO 3, because of its clumsy interface and very confusing research trees, fails to give you a sense of accomplishment.  Researching some new stellar technology is nothing more than getting an "okay it's done, what do you want next?" prompt.  Performance:  - if your PC meets the requirements on the box you shouldn't have any problems.  I tried the game on two differently configured systems (mid-range and high-end) and had no problems.  - if you have performance issues turn down the various sound or graphic options in game; also check for video card & sound driver updates for your system; and finally disable any background programs like virus scanners before running  2 Stars for potential, the rest were lost for not realizing the potential!  == Take care	-1
If anything this game got me reHooked on Master of Orion 2.  This game just sits there and plays it's self and that makes it boring, very boring.  Any chance we can get a Master of Orion 4 that is based on the aspects that made this line of games fun and popular instead of something new?	-1
i am coming at this from a moo2 perspective. i am a big fan of that game. when i initially purchases moo3 a year or more ago, i sat down and impatiently tried to learn the game. i only spent about an hour or less and i gave up. what was i missing? anyway, i chocked it up to not spending enough time to learn the game. i went back and had fun with moo2. recently, i sat down and spent another 3+ hours trying to learn moo3. i went through all of the guidance dialogs, read all of them.  the main problems are: the game has become too complex. you can automate almost anything, but there are so many things to control that's all you can do ... automate. so you are left with little to control. attempting to control most any aspect of your economy or war effort by hand will most certainly result in a failure, unless you are willing to spend hours per move.  also, there seemed to be some problem with the game AI. without going into details, after playing for a bit i seemed to come to a stalemate. i was hopelessly outgunned against an enemy that blocked my progress into the rest of the galaxy. he would not attack me, no matter what. i tried inciting him in all possible ways. i even tried to surrender to him, and he refused?!?? i threw everything i had at him and he just kept detroying my ships, but never came after me.  also, as the game got more complex, it too longer and longer for the computer to process its moves. it got so it was taking 20+ seconds on a 2ghz machine. annoying to say the least.	-1
There are many 4X/Space-Stratagey fans out there, and many attempts to make games in this genre. But sadly, few are successes. Some are good, but few know about them, such as Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain (one of my favorites). Some are good, and everyone who knows the genre exists knows the game, such as Master of Orion 2. Some are just colasal flops, and usually for many different reasons. Do I have experience enough to judge a good 4X game? Well, I have played many of the games, but some disagree with my views on them. Here are the ones I have. My all time favorite, Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain; Master of Orion 2, one of my less favorites; Space Empires 4, in the middle of my list; Conquest: Frontier Wars gets second place; Star Wars: Rebelion, had potental, but didn't quite deliver; Star Trek: Birth of the Federation, also had potential, but didn't quite deliver. And that's all I can think of right now. Anyway, on to Master of Orion 3. The prequel, MoO2 was many people's favorite, and it was good for when it came out (though I prefered Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain), but I wasn't one of it's biggest fans. Now MoO3 is a different story. I didn't actually buy it mind you. I got the full version 60 minute demo, and it was terrible. Although better visually than most, the menus and selection are very poorly done and getting anything done is nearly impossible. I didn't see the battles, but that makes no difference if the main interface is so bad you can't get anything done. There is little helpful information for running your empire. All-in-all, this game isn't worth the time of day. If you want a 4X game, I reccomend getting Conquest:Frontier Wars, MoO2, or Space Empires 4. I haven't tried Galactic Empires yet, but it looks cool, so that could be a possibility. But this isn't the game that you are looking for. So hit the back button, and move on. If you don't believe me, just read the other reviews on this game.	-1
First off, when I heard MOO3 was coming out, I was excited.  More excited because the rumor was that if MOO3 was successful a Master of Magic 2 might be developed. I read all the horrible reviews that everyone wrote, and thought to myself, "Hey, I loved MOO, MOO2, MOM, Civ2" and just about every other turn based strategy game out there.  I'll have to like this.  I figured all the negative reviews were just by people who get frustrated by complexity. The game is complex.  VERY complex.  I consider myself a pretty intelligent guy.  I'm college educated.  I've been playing strategy games for a long time.  I have no clue the the [F-Bomb] is going with the economics and research aspects of the game.  I'm sure a lot of time and effort went into developing this side of the game, but personally, I find US Income Taxes much easier to understand than this. I've put in about 6 hours of game playing and I'm pretty much giving up.  I kept thinking that I'm missing something and the game will get fun after just 10 or 20 more turns.  The game just isn't fun.  I don't mind playing for an hour to get into the game to get the challenge going (Getting setup in CIV and developing Cities takes time for the later battle).  But the game is just missing the fun aspect. ...e And the most depressing part, I sincerely hope they do make a MOM2...just don't let Quicksilver Developers touch it.	-1
I tried to play this game untill I got to a fun point.  I really did.  But it was for naught.  The game just plain ... 1- "real time space combat" in this game = watching little dots on your screen shoot at eachother for awhile.  The space combat graphics look like they are from 1990.  Their is very little in way of stradegy to it at all. 2- 4+ levels of menues you have to navigate through just to manage a planet.  Each planet you go requires that you click through menu after menu to get anywhere. 3- The Tech tree is basicly an AI controlled monstrosity that you can't really understand or control.  Your scientists study multipule sciences at the same time and go on to the next automaticly.  The whole thing is very confusing.  There is no sence of "I need to get this tech so I can get 'x' ability". 4- The enemy AI is [horrible].  Completely stupid.  I often found enemy races declaring war one turn, making peace the next, then declaring war again the turn after... over and over for round after round. Take this for what it's worth from someone who put a lot of initial time into the game.  I won't be playing it again.  Total rip off.	-1
And that's about it, folks. The end of Final Fantasy as we know it. Why does every recent Final Fantasy have to be turn-based, has to be a long haired blonde whiner, fake voice-acting, no real strategy in battle, hard bosses, and a bland story? Because Square can't make Final Fantasies anymore, folks. Whatever happened to the goodness of 6, 7, and 9?	-1
Original Thoughts upon first starting the game: I have the DVD version of this game, and this is the first day I have played it. I have to say the install went well, very few options to choose from in the DVD version. Apparently in the CD ROM version you can select how much to load onto the HDD, but you don't get that option here. According to the website, this is most likely because the speed of a DVD rom drive is so fast, there is no need. Unfortunately, despite the speed of the DVD drive, the game play is so choppy that it's unplayable. The recommendation from the vendor web site says that if your game play is choppy, turn the sound/music off. That doesn't make for a very interesting game if you don't have music in the background. (I did turn the music off, and it does make a difference, but the choppy scrolling and pausing is still there, plus, no music). The game seems to pause the DVD every time you finish scrolling or moving, which means it has to spin back up if you want to move and scroll again. This on a P4 machine seems a bit too problematic for the game to be any fun at all. I agree wholeheartedly with other reviews too, the acting is a bit blah. When you read mission logs from some of the scientists, you can see them reading from cue cards pretty much. Though, the game isn't about the acting, it's about the puzzle solving. Just for grins, I went onto the vendor web site and looked in the game hints section. I have to say that the first hint presented on the page is simply mind boggling. Not only are there random sequences built into the game so that each game is different, and each time you play it it is different, but all the mathematics involved seems to be quite counter intuitive. I'm not a meteorologist, so tracking weather patterns isn't my forte. So I have no clue how to get past the main first puzzle without reading that hint. All in all, after only 30 minutes of game play, i'm quite disappointed. There is one thing to make a puzzle challenging, quite another to make it so random that game play ceases to be fun. Final thoughts after finishing the game - I have finished the game now. Amazingly quickly. Mostly because after you visit three worlds...that's it. Done. There are so many features of the game, and especially of the ship that you never get to learn about because the game ends so abruptly. I was able to get around a lot of the choppy game play by disabling all virus scanning programs before starting the game, as well as closing any other open programs (even things like my printer manager). Again, many more hard and counterintuitive puzzles through the rest of the game. There were some neat sound effects with bells you had to ring in certain orders, etc...and cool water effects. Unfortunately, since I had worked so hard on the puzzles, i felt like the end of the game was a real let-down. There should have been several more worlds to encounter before solving the game, and much more of the vivid scenario that you should be able to interact with. It's almost as if the game ended just as it got really interesting :-)	-1
Don't get me wrong I love Final Fantasy but FFX is poo! First you might be expecting a 4 disc set like previous versions but this one is a one disk game.  This means less space for a variety of music (The battle song gets real old real fast) and less space for graphics (All the good graphics are the same as they show you on the commercial, nothing new) after you see all the good graphics Square really skimps on the characters details.  They turn into 16 bit graphics before your half way through the game.  Final Fantasy had a good reputation with previous versions but this one is just riding the comp wave.  The next one will have to be better because this one stinks!	-1
When I played Final Fantasy X, it felt like pokemon, but with really cool monsters, and a great plot. Now don't get me wrong, pokemon was a great game, but on PlayStation2, I expect a little better. So what do you do? Walk around unimaginative maps where you have absolutely no freedom to explore. Then, at any moment, the screen flashes, and a monster appears that you must battle with your own. The battles are fought entirely on boring, menus. When you kill a monster, you are bombarded by huge, meaningless numbers. The whole game just screams "pokemon". Yawn.	-1
When you blow you hard earned dosh on this and begin to play it, you are given the chance to pick up rubbish... Erm... Yep, you read it right, you play dustman for the day and pick up litter. Assuming you are not frantically searching for the reciept, you then get to ride on one of the amusments for a prize before going back to play litter pick up. In short... THIS GAME SUCKS!!! The graphics may look O.K, but it's this kind of game that gives Gamecube a bad name. This sould only be less fun if it squirted bleach in your eyes! Avoid like poo on the pavement! GOOD BITS Erm... Erm... Erm... (Insert positive comment here!) BAD BITS It's BORING Graphics are dull IT'S THE WORST GAME AROUND PEOPLE	-1
This game could have a been a world better. The premise is that you are in a theme park, and you must complete "rides" which are basically mini games that take a few attempts to master, and once you're done--that's it. While it is cool to see different characters, (Woody Woodpecker, Frankenstien) the map is difficult to move around in. There is no real replay value once you've finished the game. It will just set on the shelf. It's a definate bargain basket game if the price is low enough because of the great graphics and the fact that the mini games are somewhat fun. But, it is fatally flawed with a lack of orginality and low replay value.	-1
First, lets just say that this game sounds awesome. So you order it. Get it, then play it. Then you will say " Why did I waste $50 on this?". Good question! First, I will say the visuals of the park are excellent. That is the only reason it got 2 stars in my rating. But that is where it all ends. You start out at the beginning of the park looking for a park map. You walk around, talk to people and Woody Woodpecker who are trying to give you clues as to what to do next. Well, you don't need clues. All you do is go to each attraction( which are Back to the Future, Backdraft, Lost World, Jaws, E.T. and Western World) complete the tasks or mini-games for each attraction and get a stamp. Oh, I forgot, the big challenge is to find all of the letters in the park that spell out Universal Studios. Of course it is no challenge at all! Once you have collected all of the stamps and have seen the "Hollywood Magic Show", the game ends. I finished it in 2 hours. There is only one possible purpose to this game, advertisement for Universal Studios! Maybe it is good and challenging for young kids(10&under), otherwise don't waste your money! Rent it first to see if you like it, but I doubt you will.	-1
This is the poorest design I have seen in 20 years of gaming. The interface is extremely confusing. You are moving in one direction until the cut scene then you are moving in the opposite direction. So until you get the hang of it, you're running back and forth between scenes. Most of the attractions will not allow you in until you accumulate enough points for either a cap or an E pass. How do you accumulate points? By picking up garbage and throwing it in trash cans! Wow this is fun! Or collecting letters that make up the name Universal Studios Theme Park. My daughter and I played for about half and hour and finally gave up. It was dull, boring, and frustrating. We had more fun making fun of the game than playing it. I can't believe they actually make you pay for this!!! STAY AWAY unless you want a lesson in how BAD a game can be.	-1
This game is really bad.  You go into the park and walk around picking up trash off the ground.  Then you become hopelessly lost in the park because there are no maps or signs or anything.  And when you finally find one of the rides, Woody Woodpecker says you can't go in because there are too many people.  So you have to find your way back to the entrance (good luck) and buy a cap with the points you have earned shaking characters hands and picking up trash.  The camera angles leave much to be desired and can't be adjusted at all.  Back to the Future and Wild Wild West games are moderately fun for about 5 minutes.  Anyone can beat the game in a day or two.	-1
It's been said that "if it ain't broke,don't fix it."So why then does Square soft keep "fixing" the classic elements of the FF series that so many veteran players have grown to love??Square tired to change things drastically in FF8,and it failed HORRIBLY! After playing FF9(which I rented BEFORE going straight out and buying it)I believed Square learned it's lesson with messing with a good thing,and that some times "old school" is truely the best option. FF10 completely destroyed my hope by changing everything....mostly for the worst!  The mini-games are WAY too deep and confusing,the experience gaining system was completely ruined with a "new" way,and both the characters and plot were very plastic and unconvincing! Why did they make the lead hero a cocky,arrogant sports player??I actually hated the hero in the story! He kept making these "witty" remarks which were,well....anything but! This also brings me to the VERY BAD voice acting! It reminded me of a Pokemon or Dragonball Z episode....yech!!The only impressive thing about FF10 is the graphics,but I'm not throwing down [money] for mere eye candy! Besides didn't Square try to make a FF movie relying soley on graphics??Look what happened to it! I'll stick with good ol' fashioned 4,5,6 and 7. Think I'll go ahead and pass with the whole online only 11th installment of this series as well!	-1
well, there were great graphics, the plot was cheesy, the characters were idiots and the game play was horrible. I'm sorry but I couldn't stand this game. the further I got the more I grew to hate it. You do all this reapetitive fighting to get to maybe a few seconds of great graphics. they liked to talk to lot to. I guess that's what role playing games do, but these characters were just so dumb. So if you haven't gotten this game and don't know why you haven't, now you know.	-1
Squaresoft and Final Fantasy games usually get great reviews. The voice acting really sucks the actors sound like they're reading emotionlessly. But the fact that it has voice acting at all is pretty neat.  Pretty boring. I guess if you've played any FF it's just the same as the one before it but with better graphics. Speaking of graphics this game is total eye candy.  The sweetest graphics I've ever seen. The only thing I don't like about the graphics are that they are too bright, happy and colorful.  I haven't played much yet, only about 2 hours or so but I'm pretty sure I'm going to just abandon it until I finish playing Shadow Hearts.  With the real-time expressions and voice acting instead of text this game really should be fun.  I guess I'm probably just sick of playing these FF games.  But knowing myself I'll probably fire up the Gameshark 2 and play it quick just to see the movies...	-1
I bought this based on most of the other reviews. I thought it would be exciting. NOT! You have to sit there and watch these boring scenes and stupid storylines. Then you get a couple seconds of control. Some of the battles are fun, but you have to wait soooo long to get to them, it's not worth it. The worst thing is if you die, you have to sit through all the storyline AGAIN to get back to your battle. No cuts or fast-forwards. I still can't believe that! IF I RENTED IT FIRST, NO WAY WOULD I HAVE BOUGHT IT!	-1
I really, really liked the game.  I could think of a ton of positive things to say, the story was good, gameplay was decent.  All the positive things other people have been saying. Then...I spend over two hours fighting some impossible-to-kill monster. (I had to fight him 4 times before I won...maybe I'm just lousy at the game, who knows?  But seriously, I'd been doing just fine up to this point.)  The game proceeded to the next scene without any opportunity to save.  And of course, I'm instantly killed in the next battle, without even a chance to fight.  (Two of the monsters literally kicked two of my characters out of the screen with special attacks, and the third proceeded to flambe the remaining character--apparently I was "ambushed".)  I didn't even know there was *going* to be a battle. Just brilliant, guys. Try it again?  No thanks.  I ended up trashing the DVD and throwing it away.  Any game that wants to waste my time like that...forget it. I'm sure the designers thought they were being cute.  They weren't.  No more Squaresoft games for me. Actually, make that "no more games that don't let you save at any arbitrary time".  I'm totally fed up with RPGs that force you to play for hours because you can't save, and this is definitely one of them. That, and the weird `random encounter' technique that Squaresoft uses really gets old.  I'd much prefer to be able to explore an area without running into yet another random battle with the same three creatures.	-1
This, for me, was the biggest waste of money. It is an animated story that has very mild interaction. For me, it is not a game. If you want to watch a cartoon for most of the time and then play for a couple of minutes and then watch a cartoon for a while and then play for a couple of minutes, etc., etc., then you will love this game, otherwise save your money. If you really are curious, rent it first. This way you don't waste forty+ dollars like I did. The animation is good, but I'm not going to review this for game play, because I do not consider it a game. Some love this game, and some hate it.....This is a rent first, buy later (if you like it).	-1
ok when this game came out I RAN not walked to buy it...boy was I in for a nasty surprise! the gameplay is AWFUL I don't know what else to say....I found my self in one annoying battle after another I mean in the beginning it was reasonable but further on I found my self in impossible, to the point of screaming with frusteration battles! ok the graphics are breathtaking I have never even SEEN something so real and the story line is to die for! another thing...they have EXTREMELY complacated and wacko systems I felt like I was in algebra class! tutorial after tutorial and none making sense! also it is almost ALL movie! ok though the story line is so amazing it didn't bother me but then I found that every 2 steps I was in a unfair impossible battle and would die and have to start ALL over again! AHHH! that is when I took the game back...I suggest renting and IF you like it (I did in the beginning) try to get a few levels past Blitzball (that is when the 2 steps and a battle where enemies get 4 or 5 turns each taking 300 to 600 HP ok often you don't even get a move before you are dead!) before you buy it...	-1
item was not the one pictured,in the ad, couldn't get a refund, from the company,, wouldnt reccomend doing buisness with this company..	-1
I have played the game for about six hours now.  I am truly dissapointed!! the storyline develops very slowly, not making any sense yet.  I wonder why Squaresoft introduced the blitzball game, it is completely annoying!!  I have been forcing myself to play just to see if the game gets any better, so far nothing!!  I can only say that this has been the most boring FF I have played so far.  Previously I had played FF8 and I had over 60 hours of gameplay (I couldn't play anything else) so I am giving this game (FFX) two stars, just because I expect to see some improvement later on, I hope my expectations are not wrong. The sphere grid ability system is far from intuitive and I still working on figuring out what to do with the characters. The good things about this game are the graphics, very well done!!  Square is taking on the advantages that the PS2 console provide in terms of graphics.  The voice acting is very well performed also, it is really good to hear the characters talk to each other, definitely something I missed from previous FF releases. I hope I can come back and rewrite this review and give more stars to it, but I can only say for now to those of you who are about to buy this game to hold it and wait, rent it, play it a day or two and then decide whether you want to purchase this game or not.  So far I am planning to sell this game if it doesn't satisfy me the next two days.	-1
So far I'm about ten hours into this game. Which isn't saying much. Most of the gameplay isn't really gameplay. On average, for every hour you play for about ten or fifteen minutes you can actually control what your party does. Everything else is just drawn out micro-cinemas. I am a big fan of all the other FF games but I think they went a little overboard on the cinematic aspect of this game. The graphics are amazing. That's true. I'm not trying to dispute that. It does however, take more than dazzeling graphics to make a game work. I think square sacrificed some of the finer points of gameplay to accomodate the stunning visuals. I would recomend this game to anyone because I am loyal to the series and it still may surprise me yet. Just be warned to be patient and be ready to put your controller down often. Also, up until this point the storyline has been relativley flat and dull.	-1
Same music, same battle engine, same lame charactor dialogue as Gandia II. Even so it would have been a fun game if I could of skiped the crapy dialogue that was made for 5 year olds. Would have been an excellent game if they would have hired some writers and voice tallent. But what they ended up with was a few hours of actualy fun game play mixed in with hour upon endless hour of crapy dialogue a five year old would find boring. Pros: Great graphics   Great gameplay (when there was any) cons: unending crapy dialogue (made this game a no purchase for me)	-1
I have 30 hours into this movie/game, because I refused to believe Square would come out with a movie in the guise of a game. And FFX is just that. A movie with limited (and I mean LIMITED) player interaction, on a level with the horrible Xenogears. There are NO camera angle changes, and no 360 degree control. The game is TOTALLY and completely linear. You spend the first two hours watching young Tidus, a supposedly great blitzball player, whine and whimper about `his old man' disappearing when he was young. Not only is the voice over emotionally inconsistant, the pitch is irritable. AND YOU CANNOT X-MASH THROUGH THE SCENES! The `game' is in complete control thoughout. The plot is entangled (and I mean in knots) with religious conflict and political manipulation, the intricacies of which, as an adult, I understood and enjoyed. As a teen, I wouldn't tolerate it, and would be horrified when I found YOU CANNOT BYPASS A SINGLE SCENE THROUGHOUT THE GAME. While most of the backdrops are graphically superior, there is little exploration allowed. Your characters run only only on paths in area scenes, and there is NO world scene, and no control over destination. You only go where the game sends you. (I have 30 hours in, I hope it changes...) But there are some redeeming factors here. If you don't mind watching another `Final Fantasy: Spirits Within' movie, you are in luck. The computer graphics are absolutely breathtaking. As far as ganes go, FFX is the CG feather in Square's cap,  especially the ocean scenes involving Sin, the mega-whale sized creature bent on destruction. I have never seen creatures and water displayed with such realism. On land, the trees sway, and I wish Square had invested as much time in the gameplay as they did making everyone's hair move in the breeze. The voice-overs were a step up in reading text after text after text (I turned the text off and just listened...)The battle scenes are copied from FFIX with a few graphic enhancements. The `sphere' grid' is a new way of powering up and learning spells, and is the most amusing part of the game. Weapons do not get stronger (you buy/find ones with different attributes) which is diappointing. Now for the Aeons, your summoned beings. There are only 4, taken from FFIX, with some very nice enhanced graphics. Unfortunately, the summoning scenes are excrutiatingly long (at least 15 seconds each and every time. Apparently Square was so enamured with the graphics, you CANNNOT shorten them as in prior FF games. You might as well get up and make a sandwich everytime you summon), so you prefer to leave Yuna, the heroine out of the battles. The sphere grid is a neat new way of upping HP and MP, and is actually challenging to maze through.  The side game of Blitz is fair, but I found the control buttons do not respond per the instructions. You'll see. And, the game controls the matches. I prefered the card games in FF VIII and IX. And for you mothers of 12 year old boys, FFX graphics are true to EVERY scantily clad female body movement, so be ready for Lulu the Black Mage. I play nothing but RPG's and Res-Evil style games. RPG stands for Role Playing Game. There is little to be had here except for moving the characters in and out of the battle scenes. I have 30 hours into this game only because I couldn't believe Square would come out with another game/movie (guess I forgot Xenogears) As a game, this falls so far short. As an example of computer graphic capabilities, Square has given us the showcase of the year. And I do mean a showcase. This is the feather in Square's graphics cap. I have played every FF game, as well as almost every RPG made. I cannot recommend you buy this as a game, new. I would wait a week for the movies fans to return theirs, and buy it then. Since it is totally linear, without skip capabilities, I would not rent this. You will have it a while. Perhaps I will update this after I finish the `game', unless I just get sick of it and move on. There are several other Square games much more suited to GAMING. I recommend FF IX most highly, as well as ChronoCross (very nicely done), the sequel to ChronoTrigger. Also try, Legend of Dragoon, Star Ocean: Second Story, and Breath of Fire III. For Dreamcast, try Skies of Arcadia. 50 hours of total 360 degree control through an extremely vast world.	-1
While the graphics are good among the best on PS2 the game itself is long, tedious, and boring.  Not the way video games should be made.  What Squaresoft should do is stop making Final Fantasy a video game and instead continue making movies of it that flop, or books that no one will buy. In closing, save your money for a decent game or buy this game and take destroy it in some creative way.	-1
bla. it's not very good and the gameplay combos are almost exactly the same as spiderman 1 on the ps1. plus it's soooooooooo soooooooooo soooooooooo soooooooooo hard	-1
When I originally played this game, I remember thinking how badly it sucked, and how horrible the controls were. However, over time I told myself, how I must have been mistaken. How could the game be as bad as I remember it, when everyone in the gaming community loved this game to pieces! Clearly, I was mistaken! Years have passed, and I never broke it out again, until now!  First, let me just say, that for an early PS2 game release, the graphics are astounding! Its has lens flares, and isn't even very choppy, which is unusual for a PS2 game as well. Overall, in terms of graphics, this game was incredible! True, the models weren't that great, but they were passable.  The sound was great! How could it not be? Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe lend their voice talents to the game, to help give it that authentic spidey movie feel. Then, as if that wasn't enough, they tossed in Bruce Campbell as the Narrator/tour guide, just to bump the game up to cult status. The music and sound effects were brilliant, and quite realistic. However, it was slightly dated, but again, I cant stress this enough: Its from the PS2 and is 10 years old!  That was the good stuff.  The controls were just as bad as I remember. I mean horrible! However, it should be noted, that most games released during that video game era had horrible controls. Still, this is worse than most of those. It could have been a much smoother experience, especially since the PS2 controller is virtually identical to the PS3 controller. I see no reason, why they couldn't take the time to make a smooth control scheme like games have today!  In terms of difficulty, it wasn't as hard as I remember it being, however the game is by no means a cakewalk. It is difficult, and at time frustratingly so, although I feel a lot of that has to do with the controls. I cant begin to tell you how many times I would find myself stuck to a wall, clinging there, while being shot at.  Still, the game has some level of fun factor, especially if you are an avid spidey fan, and with the new spider-man reboot being out, it might be fun to flash back to the original.	-1
Patient:Doctor,I feel enclosed in many levels. The first was okay with the free swinging action,but then,there was no room to fight,NO ROOM TO FIGHT!!!(sob)Peter would say things over and over again! I couldn't take it anymore! He wouldn't shutup! That is why I did it. That's right I broke the disk and I'm PROUD,PROUD, PROUD,PROUD.I WOULD DO IT AGAIN TOO! AND AGAIN,AGAIN!HAH,HAH,HAH HA!Police office:Whats wrong with him?Shrink:It seems he has 2 of 5 syndrome	-1
Spider-Man is a stupid game. It is really boring and hard. Dont buy it unles you love Spider-Man. The controls are horrible too. I hate this game.	-1
Spiderman is sooo whimpy in this game. I wonder if the people who made this game know that in the comics Spiderman can bench press TEN TONS!!! You have to beat on a simple crook several times to get him to go down. That is so unlike Spiderman that it's absurd. What's worse, the bad guys often come at you in large groups, making them almost impossible to defeat. Each level gets progressivly more difficult, and more frustrating. I finally reached one level that had tons of traps and robots...I can't get any farther. That was the first day I had the game. I would strongly suggest renting this one instead of buying it if you must try it.	-1
I liked the game for the most part but I got so irritated with the controls and the camera angles in the game that i just eventually gave up on it.  I was getting into it but I would just get to frustrated.  Ex: If you are pushing right to run with a side view and the view changes to behind, you would expect to rotate the control to forward to keep going straight (like in Mario 64) but doing that will cause you to run right until you let go and push forward again.  This is majorilly irritating when being ganged up on by multiple people.  The camera angle will almost never stay constant even when locked on and you just lose control of everything.  I also wish you could be more sneeky and spider-like attacking villians.  Once you hit someone, everyone in the area will come running.  Also, give the villians a few more things to say or make them talk less.  I REALLY wanted to like the game but had to many bugs.  The Movie was great but the game needed a little more work	-1
Scratched and didn't work	-1
Play as Spider-man, with all these intense features  *A big outside world you can look at and the small portion you can actually visit. *Swing through the skies with the speed of Granny on the porch swing. *Try to chase villains who are much faster than you. *Play chase levels against them over and over and over again until you memorize where they're going, because your maximum speed is far to slow to possibly catch them directly. *Die instantly if you ever even think of touching the ground. *Play mostly inside levels.  It's silly to play outside...doing what he's actually famous for. *Enjoy a series of short painful levels where your death to a boss means re-doing 15 mins work. *Now add stealth to those missions.  Rock on!  And...Introducing the most challenging foe ever in a video game.  The game camera!  Yes, you too can try to fight dozens of villains, some shooting at you, without actually being able to see any of them!  Die yet again from a gunshot that you couldn't see and had no chance to avoid anyway.  Use the wicked awesome lock-on feature that keeps the camera focused on your villain...except when it randomly refuses to work.  Cool!  But wait!  There's more!  Order now and we'll let the camera angle randomly change your controls and send you in a different direction than you wanted!  It's Spider-tastic!  --- I'm a big fan of Spider-man games, going way back.  Maximum Carnage was one of my favorites on the old Sega Genesis and I really loved the PS1 Spider-man which uses a similar engine.  Here you do get Spider-man, and yes there's decent production value to the game, but it has a lot wrong with it.  I found it a chore to play on Hero mode so I could unlock the Goblin and at least then I could play through again with a decent character.  Adding the Goblin and giving a storyline was just an incredibly cool idea.  The camera is easily the worst I've ever seen in any game and the voice acting, with the exception of Bruce Campbell during the tutorial, sounds like nobody wants to be there recording it.  Toby especially, he just kind of sounded tired reciting his lines.  The only reason I gave this even 2 stars is because you can unlock Goblin which is a cool idea if nothing else.  Yeah, you can play this game, but a lot of other games are better.  It seems many people disliked the game, but I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Marvel-Nemesis-Rise-of-the-Imperfects/dp/B0009351P2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects</a>&nbsp;better than this.  You might give it a try.  If you only have a Gamecube and have few choices in Spider-man games, get this (if it's cheap), but it's just not the greatest Spider-man game out there.	-1
This game isn't nearly worth what I payed for it. The camera for the game is backwords and you can't fix it, and it has other camera glitches that get very irritating. I decided to get a cheat so I could play the last level instead of wasting my time, but five minutes looking for the cheat wasn't worth playing the last level. I beat spider-man 1 for the playstation 1 at least 7 times and I would recommend it instead of spider-man the movie if you have a playstation 1. (...)	-1
its waaaaaaay to simple it takes 5 minute a mission thats 5 times 22 it equals 110 minutes of gameplay that not even two hours.  even oon hard mode its simple.  Im sorry i just don't understand why it got peoples choice but i hate it. but the graphics are all right and the fighting is all right thats why it got 2 stars. But its just way to simple even on hard mode.	-1
This game really stinks. Graphics are the only thing that would save it from a 1 star. Nice explosions. Gameplay is boring and not exciting, only fun when you fight in the air, like the vulture. Way too easy to beat. And also, when you swing in the air,you can basically swing forever. But what's strange is that you're web shoots to the sky when you swing, and doesn't get on a building. The web gets on the sky???!!! Spiderman looks retarded when he's swinging. Sound is bad execpt for the voice acting. Dialogue sounds AWFUL. A bad/mediocre game. Do not buy, a waste of you're money.	-1
First off, do not buy this game. The controls are totally messed up because Spiderman might keep running when you try to make him stop, AND when you are web-swinging, you stick onto any wall you bump into. I'd also like to add that this game is very short. It is only a mere ten levels (four of which are very easy) and a few mini-games which quickly get old. The graphics are a small con, but still affect the game nonetheless. The only place where graphics are good are the movie sequences. Overall, do not get this game, rent it. It isn't worth fifty bucks.	-1
Rated a 2.5 - The outdoor areas are fun to swing around, very beautiful. However the inside places are different, web-slinging doesn't seem designed for indoors. The fighting makes up a whole lot of the game, unfortunately the fighting is so completely dull and lame. The graphics indoors look like good PS1 visuals. The cinema scenes are absolutely horrid, on PS1 they were ok, here on Gamecube they are inexcusable. Some more work should have been done to improve character models for GC and Xbox. There are more camera issues, it seems, than last time out, there's an option to use C to help out, but it doesn't much. Sometimes Spidey'll be stuck on walls or pillars. Try picking up an item with B and then walking around indoors using C. A lot of the voices are great (Bruce Campbell, Tobey Maguire, Norman Osborn-guy, Scorpion) it's nice to have some of the stars of the film. Bruce Campbell as the in-game host is spectacular. I dislike how much they strived to make Peter Parker's face look more like Mr. Maguire than the character (Sleepy blue eyes??). Characters like the vulture, thugs and Mary Jane are bad, how many times can this game say 'UGLY', or 'FREAK'? There are about 300 one-liners which helps to engage, but I disliked having to hear thugs say the exact same thing all the time. Also, the music is quite repetitive, very much like lame movie sonic wallpaper, sprawling sometimes, ambient at others, very noticeably in the wrong place at the wrong time. Overall, it sounds like Star Wars prequel music, but nothing like Danny Elfman's Spider-Man score. Overall, this is a solid rental especially if you liked the original, but should've been more next-generation and immersive, there could be a Metal Gear Solid 1-style quality Spidey game.	-1
This game is really cool but it just gets too hard after four or five levels. I own this game but I have never beat it because it's just too hard. It seems like it's only made for the expert gamers. Wolverine's Revenge is better as far as Super-hero games go.	-1
This game is so over rated or at least rated by those who only are addicted to the game and techno music.  The only reason to buy the game is if you want to listen to the same techno music all the time.  The sound effects are NOT all people crack them up to be.  The gameplay is so simple my 8 year old nephew went through this game with ease.  There is no challenge in the game and if you do like the music in this game you will be happy to know that there is a sound track coming out so you can pick that up for 10 bucks rather than wasteing your money on this less than satisfying game which is 50 bucks.	-1
I cannot believe that EA sports made this piece of junk as part of its otherwise superior sports series.  No season mode, no historical teams, and limited replayability..  Buy a previous years' edition instead.	-1
I haven't played this game and probably never will because... WARNING:  I read this game has no season or dynasty mode.  I read this on a game related website.  I'm not 100% sure, but if this game truly doesn't have a season or dynasty mode (only tourney or exhibition) then I'm not buying it.  What is the point in this game without a season mode or recruiting and all that stuff?  EASports has really let me down. Their NCAA Football has a great recruiting system.  NBA Live has all kinds of season and career options.  Now EA sports bball on the PS2 (supposed to be a great system) doesn't even have a season.  I was going to get this game for by birthday, but now I'm definitely not.  What a joke and an insult.  I'll now look into NBA 2k2 or just wait until baseball season to buy a sports game.  Heck, I might even try hockey.	-1
This game is only mediocore. The game has good graphics, but bad sound effects. It takes no advantages over the GeForce 3 and Radeon 8500 GPU's and it doesn't even use EAX sound mode! The game has brainless gameplay, which makes the game very repetetive after a few weeks. The only thing i found that the game has as a strong point is that I have never had as many enemies run at me at the same time.	-1
I rented this game back when it hist stores and i must say THANK GOD I DIDN'T buy this game!!  The visuals are reasonably good, the dioloug is pretty funny and the music is cool but this game is extreamly short, It took me about less then 3 hours to beat this game and I immidiatley returned the game..\  Overall PaRappa the Rapper 2 isn't worth the money AT ALL...Very short game...  2.4 out of 5 stars...	-1
PaRappaTheRappa 2 is not only a tremendously long title,but a pice of trash. It's about this midget dancing dog. He gets a life time supplies of noodles.(um....)And that's all he thinks about. there's 3 words to describe this game: NOODLES-DANCING-LAME Whatever you don't buy this game!!! Unless you like midget dogs in a rapper outfit that dances. sincerly,   kenny	-1
I rented this yesterday for a 3-year-old, figuring the music and graphics would be something she'd enjoy. Imagine my chagrin when the game came on and there was NO SOUND.  I poked and prodded and looked for options, but couldn't find any indication of why it didn't work. Someone online had the answer for me:  for whatever reason, the producers of this game elected not to include a digital audio out sound track. It's a music game.  Hello? My PS2 is integrated into my home theatre system--to maximize performance, it's hooked up with a component video cable and an optical digital audio cable. If your system is hooked up in a similar way, you will not hear the audio for this game without reconfiguring your PS2 hookup. On my system, a bad design choice makes this game unplayable.  Zero stars.	-1
Look, I loved the first PaRappa game so much that I imported the soundtrack.  Heck, I even love UmJammer Lammy despite it's vomiting catipiller's forcing women to give birth, but this game just doesn't measure up.  The main problem is the lack of a fun story-line.  The entire business about all food being turned into noodles is even dumber than it sounds, and the events  leading up to the actual levels are just plain unfunny.  The fact that the songs aren't catchy is also a big let-down, and then add in the fact that you have to play an annoying practice level before each song, and well......it just gets worse from there.  The two player version isn't much to write home about, and the load times hasn't improved much at all.  All in all, this game has had the fun beaten out of it with a large bat, and that makes me all too sad.  You can find the first two games waaaaay cheap, so if you haven't played a PaRappa game, then pick them up and avoid this unless you're a die-hard fan.  In that case, just rent it.	-1
The game did not work! I was upset.	-1
Does not work with PS3 machines.	-1
I loved the first Sonic Adventure game (Gamecube remake) and I only expected this one to be as good, if not better. But, boy was I wrong. It's a truly horrible game that's scattered all over the place with no non-linear progression or free roaming abilities of the original.  The graphics are ugly, the camera system is the worst I have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive. Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game? Or the cool mini-games that keep you coming back again and again? It was just ugly and garish and far inferior to Sonic Adventure. Do not buy or rent.  I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it.	-1
Sonic A2B is a mediocre game, plain and simple. ___Pros___ Fun 2 player Some fun levels ___Cons___ Average graphics Bad camera Awful voice acting No four player racing Terrible story I wish that Sega would get it throught there heads. Sonic is not a 3-d game. I loved it back when it was a classic 16-bit Genisis game. If they could make a 2-d sonic with Gamecube quality graphics, it would rock. Oh, and take out that chao garbage. It is not fun. In fact that is what gave the game a 2/5 instead of a 3/5. Get sonic for the Gameboy. That is a truly fun experiance.	-1
Haha 150 bucks are you kidding me. What a waste. This is ridiculous. Yes I am too poor to buy a tv so im going to buy a small LCD screen for 150 dollars, pathetic. You can plainly tell from the product and the character on the screen of the product this is a shi*ty a*s item. Instead buy a small tv. Or buy Final Fantasy X that doesn't require a tv. Just requires a small brain.	-1
I absolutely HATE this screen. It is so tiny, that you cant even see anything barely. I play sports games mainly, but on this screen its nearly impossible to play because you cant see anything. NOT WORTH 150 BUCKS AT ALL!!! There is another option out there that i will tell you about here...Go to best buy, or another electronics company, and buy a power inverter. i have a JENSEN brand 300 watt inverter. It plugs straight into your cigarette lighter spot in the car. Then, if you have a small kitchen tv that some people have, or about a 13 inch tv, you can plug that into the inverter, and have a full sized tv in the back of your car or whereever you want. Defintittely the better option, worth the money...i think the inverter is the same cost as the piece of crap screen.	-1
Sonic just isn't the same in 3D, and this game proves it.  When you control sonic the game is fun, but you are not given the option to be sonic the whole game and you end up going on tedious and annoying treasure hunts with knuckles, and terrible mech action with tails.  With Sonic being the sole character the game would have been a lot better but even still the series just isn't as entertaining in a 3d world.	-1
This game starts off under the guise of and innovative and entertaining fantasy based adventure/rpg. Having never played the original, I was a little in the dark about the story, but the history is fairly intersting even though the main plot is kind of thin. The gameplay is fluid and you definately get a good assortment of moves to dispatch your enemies with. The level progression system is definatively Diablo inspired. Now for what's wrong with the game. For starters, your max level is 9. Which for any adventure/rpg title is very disappointing on more than one count. Case in point, you cannot max out all of your stats at level 9, which means you must allocate points to only the skills you want to really beef up. Which wouldn't be terrible if A) You were actually aware that you had to do this, and B) If the game didn't force you to use all of your potential skills. So what you end up having instead of a customizable character whom you can choose to make a fighter or a spellcaster, etc. you are forced to have a little of everything, creating an overall mediocre character. My second complaint, although not as bad as the first, is that the difficulty of the game only increases in the number of monsters you must kill later on. So instead of throwing some engrossing puzzles at you, you end up just hacking your way through the last few levels of the game. If they ever make another sequel, I hope they improve on these flaws, because the game does have a solid foundation, but in the end, I was disappointed.	-1
I'm 45 years old, and have been a avid video gamer since Pong came out. Atari, Commodore, you name it! So if I say a game is really junk...I speak from experience. In fact, I would prefer most Commodore 64 games to this title! The PS2 was designed to offer much more than State of Emergency asks of it. Save your money!	-1
I mean this game is fantastic it truly is a great game you have to try it out. State of Emergency for Playstation 2 makes one hell of a Coaster! Never again will your drinks leave marks on the furnature with this remarkable gem from Rockstar. I reccomend that anyone who is looking for a something to rest their drinks on try this game.	-1
State of Emergency was released the spring after Grand Theft Auto III became a national obsession.  Published by the same company (Rockstar - but developed by now out-of-business developer VIS) the game successfully cashed-in on Grand Theft Auto's success.  Featuring similar ultra-violent, mission based gameplay, State of Emergency actually plays nothing like GTA.    The game takes place during massive riots, (the game's claim to fame being the more than one hundred characters on screen at once), and you play as one of a number of characters rebelling against The Corporation.  There are three levels each featuring about fifty missions to complete amidst the chaos.  Trouble is, the missions are all mindless and repetitive, and are virtually all just a slight variation on a basic formula: you'll either be sent to kill a target, sent to protect a target and/or escort him or her somewhere else, or you'll be sent to destroy a building, car, or area.  The missions are fun for a short while, but once you realize you're just performing the same task over and over again, it quickly grows tired.    Some of the minigames are fun, however, and rather than being mission based, they are generally based on time and points - you'll kill people or destroy property while collecting extra time from downed enemies while racing against the clock, and you'll keep coming back for more trying to beat your best score.    The gameplay, however, is still simple and boring; just a 3-D beat-em-up, with a few attack buttons and a handful of weapons to wield (though the ability to pick up some smaller objects floating around each level, like benches, is a welcome feature).  And yes, it is an ultraviolent game, despite the cartoonish visuals.  Blood sprays realistically as you fire in to crowds, taking down innocent civilians; pink blobs (guts) pop out when people are shot, limbs and heads come off (you can wield them as weapons, in fact)...  it's all mindless and gimmicky.    Sure, it's really cheap these days, and if you're really interetsed I'd say go for it, but it really isn't even worth a rental.	-1
I don't know what to make of this game. I think the idea is for it to be serious, but I wound up laughing at this game while playing it. You are going against the corporation and all h*ll breaks loose. For that matter, everything breaks loose. The crowd is all rioting by breaking into stores and stealling. You go around with your trusty baseball bat and club people to a nice pulp. But wait till the cops get a hold of you. You won't be a happy camper for long. Basically, the idea is interesting, if not a little warped. But the final verdict is that it is boring to play and has very little story line, if any, to keep you wanting more. I would say I got a few good laughs out of it. You haven't lived until you have seen a town go on a riot rampage. Speaks volumes about how RockStar sees society. Lots of people were looking forward to this game. It is luck that there wasn't a riot after they found out how poor the game was. Good thing I only borrowed the game.	-1
This game is cool when you see everyone running around.  It's kind of funny.  But this gets old real quick.  You end up doing the same thing over and over.  All the people running around are the same thing over and over.  Rockstar is an excellent game producer with GTA under its belt and Vice City.  But this is the WORST of all the games they ever made.  I'm sure San Andres will be Awesome but SOE SUCKS!  Sorry.	-1
When I first heard about this game in late 2001/early 2002, I was pretty stoked. I mean, it was from Rockstar Games (the people who brought us the almighty GTA series), and it was about RIOTING. I figured, it would be like GTA3 (Vice City wasn't out at the time, remember?), and I could riot and cause all kinds of damage to a town! SWEET! Well, I bought the game, and for the first ten minutes, I loved it. Then, it got a little boring. The next day, I started actually doing missions in Revolution Mode. Boy, talk about repetitive. No spoken dialogue, no real variety, etc. Hell, some of them weren't even that fun. And some were just plain flat-out IMPOSSIBLE. Take one mission (please note that this one happens pretty early in the game): it is your duty to protect some guy while he goes into a jewelry store (something about a bomb, I don't remember). Sounds easy, right? Heh heh. WRONG!!!!!!! About 30 different guys start swarming the entrance, and if even ONE gets in, MISSION FAILED. :-( My Dualshock 2 controller is now slightly dinged thanks to that mission. The Chaos Mode was a little better, though, and keeps me from giving this game the dreaded lone-star review. In this one, you could just go completely crazy and destroy stuff. But even this mode has its faults. For instance, 3/4 of the time, you get a significant amount of points taken off if you kill ANY civilian. HUH?!? And even without it, the game gets quite boring. I ended up selling this game to [a video game store] for a lousy $2 store credit card that got ruined because I left it in my pants pocket and it went through the wash and I had to throw it away. (No big loss.) I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not that good. Save your money and just stick with the GTA series if it's violence you're after. Or, of course, you could just give me a billion "Not Helpful" votes.	-1
No, it isn't woo at all. Boo, it's boo. The game is bad. It is repetitive. I took it back after 2 days. Bad game, easy to beat, and even easier to hate. You walk around and shoot stuff. You find stuff like guns, and shoot otehr things. There are no cool characters. There are like 4 environments that are small, repetitive, and bland. You honestly can't say anything good about this game. On the kaos mode, you can shoot everything for points. All the time you will be under civilian penalty. O THATS REAL FUN! If you shoot a civilian you lose tons of points. For about 2 seconds the penalty is off, but by that time you don't wanna break you boring streak of not killing anything and only shooting controlled burst to avoid killing any civilians. Seriously, there isn't any freedom in this game like gta. There are no extras, there is nothing to do except follow some guys, and do work for them. Don't buy it.	-1
What a mess! This game stinky inky inks inks and that is my honest and most friendly opinion of this game. It doesn't even dip into the grand theft auto pool. This is a uneven, unfinished, and unfun game. I WARN YOU ONCE TO STAY AWAY	-1
What a terrible game. The whole point of this game is to loot stores and cause chaos without getting caught or killed. There seemed to be a lot of hype surrounding this game because of its violent nature but that died down when people realized that it was boring. There's only so many times you want to do the same thing over and over. Don't bother with this game.	-1
I strongly think you should rent this game, but don't buy it. It literaly gets boring after a 1/2 hour. It also makes your brain hurt,... It's a fun game to play, but only for 30 minutes, at the most. DON"T BUY IT, I REPEAT DON"T BUY IT!	-1
We should have all known this would happen once GTA3 made it big - that Rockstar would try to follow it up with a similar themed game, without the things that made the first one great.  Enter State of Emergency, a game that allows you to kill a lot of people, occasionally for the benefit of a local thug, and that's roughly it.  Gone are the engaging risky plot elements of GTA, the high speed chases, the expansive worlds, the threatening personalities.  What remains is a shallow, hollow attempt at a game which never acheives the same high caliber of the GTA series.  In State of Emergency, you'll throw large objects at innocent bystanders' heads, bash in skulls with garbage cans, fire away into a crowded mall, or just punch strangers without care.  Sounds fun, I'll admit.  But after about twenty minutes of wanton destruction, you'll wonder, what else is there to do?  Sadly, the game implicitly answers: not much.  Zero replay value, and only short-lived initial shock-value intrigue.  Pass this one up, and wait for Vice City.	-1
I checked out this game, because (probably like the majority), the makers of the of the greatest games of all made it. "State of Emergency" STRONGELY dissappointed me. The levels, well... actully, I can't tell if they're all the same or not because I've only played the first for about a half an hour and got bored. But, the level itself was pretty dull. The only cool feature was the civilains (the many, many civilians) running around for you to chase or shoot at or whatever when you're bored (pretty much always). You find weapons on the ground, ranging from night-sticks to uzis to bazookas, to use on your enemies, who, as well, have a wide variety of weapons as well. This may sound fun, but it's not. You quickly grow weary of running around for people who want you to kill a certain security guard or steal diamons, ect., and the coolness of the civialians running around gets very annoying, especially when they get in your way when you're trying to shoot a bad guy, and end up wasting ammo on them. I don't recommend BUYING this game to (pretty musch) anyone, but, if you must, a quick 1-week rental would be enough. That's all.	-1
No Plot, sense less no point violence.  If some one can tell me wha the point of making this game is I may pay you.  This game flat out [isn't good]	-1
I was excited when I first started playing this game. The storyline is pretty cool, I liked the idea of playing as a revolutionist trying to overthrow a repressive government. But after 15-20 min the game fell through. The game is just too monotonous to be of any replay value. I enjoyed the game at first, but the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over. I trudged through the game anyways, just to see the ending. What really annoyed me was the ending! I thought the ending would be interesting, but it was not worth at all. If the game had a good ending, I would have given it more stars. I would not buy this game. Rent it, you can beat it in a few days. After going through the game once, you will not want to do it ever again.	-1
Jes' like a newspaper, it was ment to be used, then thrown away like garbage.  Thats jes what this game is: Jes' like a newspaper the front page doesn't last long, jes like the main part of the game, story mode, Only lasted 1 day, and I knew the rest of the game would liably be garbage.  Then like a newspaper, u try to see if anything else is good.  All the modes [stink], and git old too fast, jes like other sections of the newspaper, u don't even wanna read. I was gonna throw it away like garbage, until my borther wanted tha game.  I was gonna give it to him, cuz I put a nasty scratch, that's why I was gonna throuw it away, cuz I couldn't return it wit' a nasty scratch.  But my brother gave me deal that was too good to refuse.  He traded me Max Payen for a game worth no more than a newspaper.  I didn't say a damn thang after that.  He told me the game was great, but dead on arrival was too hard; and it was a early birthday gift.  I agreed with him, but I'd rather accept a challange, than playing a game, that's like a DVD look at todays news, that u control. The game lacks a good storyline, good missions, graphics(look like Tekken 1 graphics, I mean [come] on it's the PS2 4 cryin' out loud)It also lacks, Alot of ammo, voices, good gangs, good multiple modes, and good guns. The hype is pure garbage, and all this good things reviews said about it makes u wanna buy it, but when u play it u'll realize it's a 100% rip off, cuz u'll realize, it's jes like a newspaper, good at first but garbage the next second. Do not only me but urself a favor, don't buy a game that's worth no more than a newspaper thats worth [money].  U'll thank me later.  Peace out.	-1
I have had this game for months now, and I will say that in the beginning it was sickly entertaining.  The game made me laugh more than anything.  But, after about a month it got really old and somewhat boring.  The game is a great one to rent and then forget about it.  The replay value on it is horribly low...maybe even in the negatives.	-1
"State of Emergency" really puts you in a State of emergency when you spend so much on it and it turns out to be the worse game you have ever purchased. The graphics, well they're okay. But the gameplay has no meaning. You are running around like a lunatic with no substancial goal to achieve. Overall the game serves no meaning and its a waste of money, aswell as time. If you were expecting another GTA3, this game is no where near it!!!	-1
This game has a lot going against it.  If the mass media gets a hold of this game like they did GTA3, there will no doubt be a collective outcry from parents groups, conservatives and other general naysayers with a microphone and an opinion.  Unfortunately, I don't think this game is good enough to warrant that kind of attention. Like a lot of people, I was really looking forward to this game.  While I don't own GTA3 (I'm waiting for the Xbox version) I have lots of friends who do, and I have to admit it's a fantastic game.  It's huge open-ended, versatile and has that nihilistic charm that truly makes it a guilty pleasure.  Unfortunately, SoE, has all the nihilism and little of the charm. Everyone has wanted to fight the power and stick it to the man at least once in their lives, and for that primal urge, this game does provide a welcome catharsis.  It is fun to run around in Chaos mode with wild abandon, beating people down, smashing windows and blowing stuff up, but eventually you have to take in the fact that the graphics are really shoddy (I'm assuming with the huge crowd constantly in circulation, the developers had to sacrifice quality) and the gameplay is really monotonous.  I have to say the biggest flaw of all is the lack of multiplayer.  This could have really been a saving grace for the game.  The whole idea of mob mentality is COMPLETELY LOST in a single player game. It seems so obvious to me that I have to wonder what the developers were thinking.  It's the difference between anarchy and stupidity. Also, I hate to sound like one of the groups I was kind of shelling earlier, but the mindless violence concept of this game seems a lot less fun in a post-911 world. I'm definitely an anti-censorship kinda guy, but anyone buying this game for their young kid should question their skills as a parent. It's made for mature audiences and only us old guys need apply (though once you start playing the game I doubt you'll feel very "mature")  I think I would have enjoyed this game much better a year ago. I also might have liked this game better as a rental, but lack of a rental outlet where I live means I get burned more than I'd lke to admit. If you can rent this game and feel the absolute need to satisfy your curiosity RENT, DON'T BUY.  Take that one piece of advice above anything else I've written here.  If you find that it's a must own, then you can go shell out your $ with perfect confidence.	-1
I purchased this game while still reveling in GTA3 and thought it would be comparable in at least action and goals, but it wasn't. The erroneous comparisons of reviewers come from the maker (Rockstar) and the violence, but that's where the similarities end. I've managed to play it two or three times after bringing it home and haven't bothered since. The game has no real direction, cartoon like graphics and unimaginative gameplay. ... Obviously, other gamers feel the same way that I do if a major chain is already selling off their excess. Stick to the other Rockstar hits and avoid this bomb. If you have even a modicum of intelligence, you'll grow bored with it quickly.	-1
state of emergency - PS2 games get worse and worse. it is only fun for the first 15 minutes or so, then you can just throw it away or burn it on the camp fire.	-1
oh man...i'm in a mental state of depression, i haven't spoken to anyone in 3 days, i haven't eaten, i've lost sleep and whenever i DO get to sleep, i have nightmares about this game actually being GOOD......but it's NOT!, for the love of GOD, please don't get your hopes up on this major disappoinment, ROCKSTAR has hit the peak with GRAND THEFT AUTO 3, but got shot right back down and got buried TWICE with THIS game, 100+ missions taking at the most 1 minute 30 seconds each, WOW! WE'RE LIVIN ON THE EDGE THERE! WOOOHOOO!....(not)...but ne wayz, i'l admit it....at the beginning it's kinda fun blowing stuff up, using an assortment of weapons......THAT'S IT!....even the storyline [isn't good]! and not to mention the instability of game controls...oh my, this game is SO not for me, no way, a big NO NO for the your collection of 5 star games...i mean, i wouldn't even suggest to RENT this game, i'm sorry....but according to my own personal game fanatic opinion.....THIS GAME [STINKS]! <vomit>, but that's just ME....go ahead and buy it, it's a free country :)	-1
I didn't like this game very much.  Sure, it's got violence, and lots of it, but after you get past the gore (granted, it takes a while) then you've got a very shallow game.  You'll get maybe, a half hour, to an hour of gameplay, then throw it aside, along with all those games you got tired of when you were 5. Please, Rockstar, Grand Theft Auto 3 was so much better than this, send this game back to h3ll where it came from...NOW! Best Feature: Violence by the boatload! Worst Feature: Everything else... Final Score: 2/5 Nothing great here, try GTA3 instead.	-1
Yup. But it is good at wearing out your thumb. I can imagine how many people will want to buy this game, given that rockstar made the great GTA3. Just don't let the name fool you - this game is just a lot of headache... There's way too much going on on the screen at one time, and it's near impossible to concentrate on the game hero. The game is basically a specialized gta3 (centered on beating people up and breaking things), except it's nowhere near as realistic (you can run straight through people, and the amount of detail is miniscule, compared to gta3). Overall, I strongly recommend renting this game first. Once you do, I'm quite sure you won't want to buy it. Everyone is everywhere at once, and you will find yourself jamming the buttons mindlessly.	-1
It is like they thought if they make it as bloody and violent as they could it would sell...and I guess they are right.  Once you get past the fact that you can mow down a crowd with a AK 47 or chop someone's head off or break their leg and arm there is not much to this game.  It plays like this...walk around beating/shooting/stabbing...gangs and the police/corporation and doing silly missions like escorting characters, killing heavily armed/protected business men and things of that nature.  You cannot drive ANYTHING...The weapons are pretty cool, as is the fighting action...but the story and actual depth of the game is not all that at all...GTA3 was 100% better...RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!	-1
this is awful. Most over-hyped product of the year! I think Rockstar just threw this together at the last second to cash in on GTA3 success. Everything about this game sounds great, but when you start playing, it becomes boring in about 20 minutes, and even hard to endure after 40 minutes. It's the same dozen characters running and the same few missions over and over again.	-1
I can't begin to describe how slow each level loads, how easily you get killed, and then you have to wait out that load period again to get back in the game. And when I stopped for the day, I couldn't find where I had left off when I came back, since the levels are circular, with levels within the levels, and the game doesn't remember for you, at least not that I was ever able to tell.  It was just awful. Even with a Gameshark, it was excruciating. I never finished it.	-1
It's always disappointing when something doesn't live up to its hype.  Video games are an institution based on hype, with mixed results: Atari's ET didn't work, but Nintendo's Super Mario 3 was a great game.  Mechwarrior 2 turned out to be a dud, but Black & White deservedly took its place in the Valhalla of Video Gaming.  And Rockstar Games has given us two much-hyped titles in the last year - Grand Theft Auto 3, and this game, State of Emergency, and true to form, one turned out to be great, and one turned out to stink. In case you need it spelled out for you, State of Emergency is the one that stinks. Everything Rockstar did right in GTA 3 has been replaced here.  Although the graphics are a nice attempt to return to the cartoon-style that made GTA and GTA 2 such enjoyable (and not so realistic) games, they are about the only thing that SOE has going for it.  There are two game modes, Revolution (with a storyline) and Chaos (sans story, all mayhem) that are basically the same.  The idea behind Chaos is that you run around grabbing weapons, breaking windows, and killing lots of cops.  Since you have access to all the weapons right off the bat, and you can kill the cops one by one (like the Foot Soldiers from Mutant Turtles, they wait until you are done breaking their buddy's neck before attacking you), so Chaos mode looses its fun after a few minutes.  On my very first game, right out of the box, I got more than quadruple the factory-set high score - and I thought, "is this it?"  Revolution isn't much better - the storyline is just a series of excuses to run around and kill cops and gangs. Gameplay is a joke.  The camera (also a problem in GTA 3, I should point out) has a very hard time showing the action, especially if you want to turn around and clobber the guys chasing you.  In SOE's favor is fairly decent stick control (unlike the godawful Batman: Vengeance), but fighting comes down to little more than button-mashing.  And that's really all there is to say about SOE.  Little plot, crummy gameplay - it's just not enough to keep you awake.  I played it for about an hour, and there it sits.  I think I'll go trade it for a Sega Saturn and a copy of Darius Gaiden. If you need any more proof that this game is a letdown, take a look at how many people are selling used ones, and how many people are waiting in line to buy used ones.  As of this writing, less than two weeks after the game came out (and it's a hard game to find, I might add), 14 people are trying to dump them and there are no people waiting to buy them.  Don't make the mistake of having to turn around and dump yours in the next week, either - stick with GTA 3.	-1
I know this isn't Grand Theft Auto 4, but come on, I was expecting something close to the quailty and overall fun of Grand Theft 3.  What I got was a boring and headache-inducing excuse for a game.  There are people running all over the screen.  This is old news about 20 minutes into the game.  The controls are awkward, and worst of all, there is no substance to State Of Emergency--it is boring.  Go pick up GTA 3, and ignore this waste of time.	-1
Rockstar pulled off the game of a lifetime with GTA3.  This time around, they fall flat.  Long story short, State Of Emergency looks good, but the controls are retarded, the missions boring and repetitive, and overall, the game gets old--very quickly.  I'd stay away from this one.	-1
This game was pretty disappointing.  I was waiting for this game.[...] and now that I have it I am like what was I so excited for? The game is fun for about an hour but then you have the missions which are frustrating and a little annoying since you can't access all the characters immediately, you have to beat the missions which are too difficult for their time.  I have more fun and got farther playing Gundam: Zeonic Front which I must say is a much better game. I liked GTA3, best game ever and the missions though difficult were fun. Plus you had the freedom of roaming the parts of Liberty City and little side missions to improve your skills.  In State of Emergency there are no side missions, KAOS mode is still limiting, there's no sense of freedom as in GTA3 which was a way better game. State of Emergency is something Rockstar ought to have kept to themselves.  I look forward to another game as violent and free roaming as GTA3 but State of Emergency just played with my emotions.	-1
This game was a big disapointment for me. I have been waiting for this game for a long time only to be disapointed with doing the same thing over and over. The only thing that changes in the game is the setting. All you do is fight and then fight and then fight some more. I would not recommend this game to anyone. In fact, I am taking my back tonight and getting a different game!	-1
After playing and thoroughly enjoying GTA3 by Rock Star I was looking forward to another game that played similar.  I thought that SOE was going to be a similar type game to GTA3, except with the feature of total destruction of your surroundings and with hundreds of people on the screen at once.  And I was right to an extent.  You can destroy your surroundings in SOE, and there are loads of people on the screen at once, but it didn't have the same zeal that GTA3 had.  SOE played kind of like a Final Fight type game or something. Run around punching and kicking, blowing stuff up, which I know sounds like fun, but it gets old real fast. Now I realize that my expectations were VERY high after GTA3, maybe way too high to be honest. I guess I figured that this game was going to be like GTA3, except with lots of people on the screen and with the ability to destroy your surroundings. What I got when I put it in was a cartoony free-for-all fight. Sure there are missions to perform, but they seemed uninspired and got boring pretty quickly. Sure the game is violent, but it's got a cartoony type violence to it. The characters in the game are colorful but not realistic. And this may be another aspect that I was expecting to be more like GTA3, which had a more realistic look and feel to it.  Not to say that aspect of the game was bad, just not really my style. Now I realize that this game is not GTA3, even though I was hoping that it would be just like it. It's just that the game was not what I was expecting at all. Again, I was thinking that it would at least be similar to GTA3, except with lots of people on the screen at once. Which is another thing about the game. Sure it's kind of neat to see that many people on the screen at once, but after a while it gets a bit annoying. Where are all these people going anyways? They just run around and act hysterical, doesn't make much sense. But it's a video game and I suppose it doesn't have to make sense. For people that plan on buying SOE on the strength of how good GTA3 is, I would say don't.  It's not the same game, or even close in my opinion.  I would recommend renting it first and see if it's your type of game.  I imagine that some will really like the game, I just know it wasn't for me. Well the good thing I did do was trade the game in for Maximo: Ghosts to Glory and so far I have been real happy with that decision. I should have got Maximo to begin with, but live and learn I guess.	-1
I went and picked up a copy of State of Emergency when it was released yesterday and boy was I disapointed. I was very psyched to get this game as I've been reading previews of it for months on the web and all the hype about it has been nothing but good. But this game is a definete waste of money. First of all, the graphics are sub par and the camera angle can be very annoying at times. The controls are ok, but you can only hold one weapon at a time. The thing that made me the most mad was the actual game. The game comes off immature and childish. The "missions" are not fun and just plain annoying and the user interface is confusing as hell. I am a very big fan of GTA3 and this game can't hold a candle to it. I think they should have taken themselves a little more seriously when making this game. I returned the game today and picked up Drakan: Ancients' Gates and that game is awesome. 2 stars for a good attempt at a storyline and the fun factor of whooping everyone's butt with multiple weapons, but gets very old very quick. Stay away and make it a renter.	-1
If Logitech's corded WingMan RumblePad had the same design and ergonomics, I would have gotten that.  However, it did not and I fell in love with the feel and action of the Logitech Cordless RumblePad. What I feel is great about this pad is everything except the cordless facet of it.  There are no hard edges or loose feel to any of the parts.  There is nice, solid feel and feedback to the D-Pad (I prefer the solid concave disc, less fatigue).  The dual joysticks are also concave which is nice on the thumbs.  They also move and feel just like the sticks on the DualShock PS1/PS2 gamepad which is good.  The buttons on the Cordless RumblePad are solid and have a good action to them.  There are no harsh edges to dig into your skin.  There are no loose, hard-plastic reactions or noises to these buttons.  And the hand extensions are perfect for my hands.  Once again there are no harsh edges and everything is contoured to fit comfortably.  The rumble effect is just like the DualShock as well.  It's neat and sometimes helpful, but really isn't necessary.  Fortunately, Logitech allows you to control whether the Rumble effect is on or off (major battery conservation in having it off).  I never had any problems installing this gamepad or getting it to work within games, until recently. Gamepads are a seasonal item.  They're only good for certain games.  Often they are necessary for ported Console games.  Which brings me to my present.  I have the urge to replay Final Fantasy VII and VII on the PC.  These games cry for a gamepad, so I fetched my WingMan Cordless RumblePad.  After a week of web research I have discovered the my receiver is dead.  And that this has happened to numerous WingMan Cordless RumblePad owners who have had their gamepad for a year or more. There are no replacement receivers sold.  The best advice offered is to "try" Logitech Tech Support. :( With a decent set of rechargeable batteries (total of 4 AA, 8 if you want to hot-swap them) and a good rechargeable battery recharger that drains all the power from the batteries before it recharges them, you will have the best wireless rumblepad for a year.  And then after that year you may find yourself with a dead receiver.  And after it becomes a lost cause through normal avenues, you may find yourself wanting to open that receiver to see if you can find the short or whatever is causing the problem.  You'll find the screw in the bottom holding things together isn't alone and that the seam on the receiver is sealed with some kind of ACME Super Glue and give up. Wish me luck.  I'm off to find a replacement gamepad. Battery Recommendations: Powerex AA NIMH 1800mAh or better. Charger Recommendations: Maha Energy MH-C204F	-1
I first bought this to play GTA3 and after installing found that the right stick does not calibrate properly (i'm running windows XP), when I try to use this in that game the person starts to spin around until you nudge the stick slightly towards the middle before it ceases this undesirable activity.  In Windows the joystick calibration portion of the device driver allows you to calibrate based on extremes of movement to pick the mid point and the extreme ends of movement in any direction, after installing the Logitech software for mapping keys and functions to buttons I found that they have absolutely no way of changing your calibration.  I supposed they thought their product is always going to be perfectly calibrated and will never have a problem.. Anyhow, at the time I figured it could have been a problem with the hardware so I took it back and exchanged it for another one.  Same thing happened with the new one.  I called Logitech up and they wanted me to send it back and replace it with one of theirs they had.. Figuring a replacement would still do the same thing guessing the RMA process would waste good 2 weeks of my time.  I uninstalled the Logitech software and fought with the calibration built into Windows and finally tricked it into finding the proper center of the stick.  The problem with doing this is you don't get full functionality from all the buttons in certain games where you cant map functions to specific buttons in game.  I am fairly well versed in Windows so I couldn't imagine anyone doing this who's looking for a non nonsense install and setup, I found myself wanting to bash it with a hammer and chucking it out the window.  Though I kind of got it to work, many games will not detect a remapping of the two sticks and your either stuck with their default use mappings or you cant use them at all. Logitech makes decent hardware, but they seem to allways fall short when it comes to drivers and software, I own their Z-560 sound system and a number of versions of their cordless keyboards and mice and find that the default Windows drivers run far better than what they have to offer without irritating programs running in the systray and consuming memory and wasting time with loading useless garbageware every time you boot. Battery life on this stick is pretty good, after buying it and using it for about a month its sat on my desk for almost a year without use and still powered on when i tried it.  To my dismay a couple months later when it did stop working I noticed that a couple of the batteries went south and started to leak inside.  No damage was done to the unit so I put a new set of batteries in and it started working again, lucky for me because I'd hate to have a paperweight that leaks battery acid. Seriously consider getting another game pad, or buy it from a place that would give you no problems returning it if you decide that you don't like it.	-1
Then was a time when you could look nowhere else for the best sports games. It did not matter how many sports games were made, if it wasn't made by Ea Sports then it was not worth playing. That era is sadly gone. It has passed the same way that many of the old stadiums have. We now reflect on the games of old because the last thing one wants to do is look at what Ea is producing now.   Their games are worse than Michael Jordans attempts to hit a curve. Triple play 2002 has shown again that the creativity, imagination and dedication to the sport they are trying to emulate has faded.   The graphics of this game are just plain bad. It is slow, The players are out of proportion and the overall effect just isn't there. The gameplay is bad and players are unresponsive to commands. Batting is done via that new idea in baseball game. The stupid target/crosshairs box. Someone should just realise that idea is just plain dull.   Realism is not really there much either. At the end of the day it just is not that much fun. A game I did enjoy was high heat. Not a great leader in any area. But the gameplay was strong enough to have fun with. And having fun is what I want from a game. But until we see a baseball game to the standard of NFL2K2 by Segasports then I suggest we save our money and wait till we get something good.	-1
The graphics are sharp, except they seems a little carttony for the players. One big problem for me is the rather difficult fielding and even easier hitting--you'll have a 10 to 10 game by the second inning if you're not careful! And lastly, the game feels a little rushed, I'mrenting a version and it crashed on me 3 times :-( Not a good impression EA Sports, back tot he showers with this one!	-1
Do the people who made tp02 even try to make it better than last years?  They did not suceed in any case.  It is relatively to hit and pitch, but fielding is just too difficult.  My advice: buy High Heat 2003 instead	-1
i bought this because i wanted to see if there were any improvements over the original... absolutely none. i had the original on N64 and to me the gameplay and graphics were way better on the original. i have it also on dreamcast and the sound and graphics are better. this game offers new tracks. but to me they suck, there simple and the AI are a little smarter but the controls aren't smooth and its hard to control, plus the customization of the pods are there either  so i have nothing good to say about this game. maybe if they remake it again in with the design systems of today i might appreciation the graphics if they do a really good job. but i doubt they will remake this game, it didn't have a big audience then. i would appreciate it but i not gonna cry over not having a new one.  play the original. on dreamcast or n64 if you have those systems. or get a really good emulator for pc and game on that. (there aren't that many reliable Emulators so make sure you do your research)	-1
After playing Everything or Nothing and Nightfire, this game is so lame and awful. The storyline is boring, the characters are awful, and the levels and duration of the game are terrible. The way the controls are programmed in this game are also not great, and it makes it hard to remember what button does what and makes it very difficult to subdue the enemies. I guess if you've never played James Bond games before, you could try this game as an introduction, but if you've played the other James Bond games I mentioned, skip this one, because you'll be severely disappointed. The only plus about this game? I think the James Bond character in it looks quite hot.	-1
Let me start off by saying that I bought the PS2 only because I was waiting to buy this game (thankfully NHL 2002, GTA 3, KO Kings 2001 & Victorious Boxers have made the purchase well worthwhile anyway)and have just ran out and bought it on it's first day of release. My first inkling of something possibly being wrong occurred when I read the directions and saw that the career mode if you can call it that, no longer has training, and is limited to a pyramid shaped grid in which you have to defeat 4 boxers on the lower level, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next and wallah you fight for the title. There is no longer a list of 20 contenders with records who you must train and fight, and no real sense of a true career. My next inking of something amiss was when i saw the controls and found out there is no actual button for an uppercut.  instead of having an uppercut button, you have a right hook button, which any boxing person knows does not exist for a right handed boxer in real boxing.  The uppercut is thrown by holding the R1 button and pressing another button....did I mention there's no options to configure the controls to make them more intuitive? So you have a straight right button and a right hook button that pretty much do the same thing...real realistic 'aint it? Anyway, I was still looking forward to playing the game and just popped it in.  The first thing I noticed was that the graphics are MUCH more primative then last year (a great game by the way) and the fighters all looked emaciated and stooped like they had a bad back.  The punch animations were stiff and actually reminded me of the crummy first version of KO Kings...now for the really awful part..as if this failure of a game really needs more.....BODY PUNCHES...they do not exist!!!!!  Actually they do exist but you have no control over them!  You throw a right to the head and if the computer deems it better to go to the body then it simply becomes a body blow.  There is no button to actually choose a body blow, just the computer deciding for you.  Needless to say this gives the game a feeling of complete lack of control...what's more, you cannot even choose to block body punches...there is only a block button and if you opponent throws a punch the computer decides should go to the body, then you block it by pressing the same button you would to block a head shot.  Even more ridiculous, the L2 button (which in previous versions allowed you to go to the body) now is the low punch button.  So by hitting it you can always throw a low blow..the only problem being that you get disqualified after around 5 of them and just by accident your going to throw a few since instincively you hit L2 thinking you will be throwing a body blow...why Black Ops decided to give such an important button over to something that has so little use should just stand as an example of the ineptness of the bozos who designed this game. Pretty much this is a button mashing mess with no redeeming qualities that becomes repetitive after a few minutes...yes not much of a lasting value, unless you're on your deathbed, which is probably preferrable to playing yhis game. From my review, I guess you can tell I was severely dissapointed with this game.  I so wanted to like it, and based on last year's game, am in utter shock as to how this could have happened.  I appreciate that they wanted to incorporate a new engine like Victorious Boxers, but that game based its system on realism, where you have to learn to counter, go to the body, and just plain box!  This game is simply a watered down version of Teken, with subpar graphics and no kicking.  I am returning mine tommorow (at a 15% penalty) so I never have to polute my PS2 with this garbage.  I implore anyone looking for a boxing simulation to stay away from this, or the designers will not get the message that they cannot peddle [garbage].  Even if you are not looking for a boxing simulation, and are interested in a fighting game, you can do way better then this.  Shame on Black Ops and EA Sports for releasing this disgrace.	-1
No one can call this a boxing sim with a a straight face. It's a arcade button mashers nightmare of the worst kind. How can EA, who is KNOW for making great sports title drop the ball (no pun) on KK2. First off, EA needs to put as much time & effort on it's boxing games like it does with it's other sports titles. For those who think this is a boxing sim, let me point some things out. Real boxers don't throw 160 punches a round. All boxers don't get up 4 times in the a fight like EA would like you to believe. I'm led to think EA never watched a fight their entire lives considering there are NO one punch KO's. It's the typical, reduce the fighters health to zero before knocking him out/down routine. In this day & age of true gaming sims this doesn't cut it. Like football players every boxer is unique. Boxers fatigue differently, etc. Not all boxers are the same as EA would like you to think. I'm not talking about the obvious attributes like speed & power. They need to take into consideration the boxers heart, chin, defense, illegal tactics, combination punches, signiture punch, boxers weak points, choking in big fights, having a off night, etc.. I might sound harsh, but when I hear of a boxing sim I get very skeptical. EA is insulting boxing fans all around of world with this title by claiming it's a 'sim'. Call it what it is a arcade boxing game with boxers. & why aren't all the fighters real? Football has how many hundreds of players & EA could only come up with 21 real fighters!! Very bad. I suggest they try very, very, hard by inlisting the aid of boxing experts, boxing fans, & trainers alike. This is the only way to get a real boxing sim up & running. The bottom line is EA doesn't care about boxing games so they don't put in much realism to it. You cannot fool me by having great life like graphics when the core of the gameplay isn't. Anyone who wants a real boxing sim check out lance heffner boxing game. It's great. A true boxing fans dream. There are no graphics so you arcade boxing type fans wouldn't like it..	-1
This game does have nice graphics and sound.  The punch selection is pathetic.  There is no way to choose body blow v. head blow.  You can get your boxer to move around the ring, but you cannot truly make him duck and bob.  Basically all you do is try to press your buttons faster than the computer can.  If your fighter is ranked higher, no problem, fight someone tougher than you and its aggravating.  Basially you just stand there and exchange blows until someone falls.  No strategy.	-1
Ok, Im gonna be Frank, and you can be Joe...Never Mind. When I was wee, and I got my Nintendo 64 system, the only game that intrested me was Goldeneye. I had played it at my friends house, and I bought it and played it everyday. I liked how many of the things were based off the movie, and how somethings were added. To me it was a good game. Then a couple years later, a new James Bond game was made. I bought that game too. Played it and liked the multiplayer the best and the story line too how everything tied in. But this game, this one is pathetic. I bought this game along with Beach Spikers, and I can tell you right now, you wish you would be playing that instead. Ok: 1. If you are gonna make a good James Bond game, then get Rareware to do it cause they looked like the only people to make a good James Bond game. Why? Well those are the people that made your loveable Goldeneye! COL! 2. Get a new Plot! The games plot was so stupid, I mean seriously, Q or R looked like Dumbledore from Harry Potter! And you obviously knew the girl was gonna turn out a bad person(Not technically but ya). I mean, come on! 3. Who the crap was the Rig Diver? I mean, they introduce her in that big jump off scene and yet they don't say who she is. The good thing or should I say the Best of the Best, is the Multiplayer. 1. The grapple was the coolest idea invented. I mean, who would give up of being Spiderman for a game period? 2. I like the bot idea. Like TWINE, thats the best idea EA came up with. I like how if I wish to play alone, then that would the best thing. Overall: Im rating it 2 stars Only for the Multiplayer.... If you are a collecter of JB games, then you should rent this one first. For me, I beat it in 1...Day...Flat. (Without Cheat Book) Come on EA! I want a more harder game, that some kind of game thats so easy! The only thing this game is good for is Multiplayer. I sure hope Nightfire is better than this!	-1
Joanna Dark it is not. This game is dull,talks to you as though you are watching Play Skool,and -the most real complaint- it is hard,in a headache inducing way,to focus laser guns etc on the exact spot you need to focus them on. Ridiculous.	-1
TERRIBLE! I played a few levels and it is absolutely terrible! I think the only good James Bond game i ever played was goldeneye but even that got old but this gets old from the first gun shot. terrible controls. I won't buy this game unless it's...on sale forget about this!	-1
I own this mat and will throw it away after I review it.  Yes, it is cheap, but you ONLY get what you pay for.  I had five people test it out including myself, and the reviews were generally negative.  All of us love the game (Konamix is awesome!) but the mat is a little "iffy". Both the bottom and top of the mat slide substantially, unless you modify your mat (substantially duct tape it down).  The buttons are inaccurate and the left button stopped registering hits only two days after I purchased it.  If you are only buying DDR to play it once a month, you may be able to deal with this mat, otherwise, take my advice and purchase another mat.  There are a lot of options on the internet... Happy hunting!	-1
I got one of these because I thought it was a cool idea. I opened the box and it smelled like gasoline. I thought it would air out but it didn`t. In order to play it, you need to stand on your heels in order to not press the wrong buttons. It was almost impossible to press 2 buttons at once, plus there are no L or R buttons. Some of the other brands I tried were even worse. In short, it [stinks].	-1
I have the Red Octane mats, and those are awesome, but I used this mat at a friend's house.  Holy cow.  It moves everywhere.  If you don't hit it hard enough (I tap gently for the most part), you miss.  You start off facing front, and then the mat moves you across the room backwards.  Not conducive to getting A's.  Get the Red Octane mats.  Totally worth the price.  Love 'em.	-1
If you have any aspirations of actually becoming a decent Dance Dance Revolution player and moving up to the more challenging and satisfying songs, do not buy this pad -- or any soft pad, for that matter.   Soft pads slide on the floor. They crumple and wrinkle up. They miss steps and fail to register sometimes. The surface feels the same all over, making it impossible to tell where your feet are without looking down.   More advanced soft pads are available, which are thicker, but they still slide and have sensitivity problems.   The only way to properly enjoy DDR at home is to purchase a metal pad. Just look up "metal DDR pad" on an internet auction site. Yes, they are expensive, but they'll also last for a very, very long time and put up with a lot of abuse. They also won't slide, will be extremely sensitive, and you can tell where your feet are without looking down. If you want the arcade experience at home, a metal pad is the only way to get it.	-1
These pads are like most ddr pads out there:  poorly constructed and not durable.  The pad slides around when you play on it, and one of the buttons stopped working about 8 days after I bought it.  I thought I'd pick up a cheap one since I needed an extra pad when friends came over. Do yourself a favor and head over to RedOctane.com for some quality pads.  I have their Ignition pad, which is way better than this type of cheap pad because it has a cushioned insert which slips into the middle and keeps the pad from sliding around and is easier on your feet.  Another friend has the regular redoctane pad with pad cover and it works great, too.  Overall, don't buy the Intec pad unless you know you won't be playing DDR for very long.	-1
First of all, what were the people who designed this mat thinking??? It's ugly and the colors clash. Also, soft mats slip around way too much. You can't beat hard songs and it is frustrating even getting good scores on the easy songs. The response on soft mats is unreliable and unpredictable. If you want to enjoy DDR, you're going to have to shell out for the expensive hard pads. Sorry people, there is no cheap way out of this one. And don't let any seller convince you that foam on the bottom of a soft mat or an anti-slip cover will make it better, because it won't.	-1
I'm generally a console gamer but since moving to college and having an internet speed that is lightning fast allowing for online gaming, my PC has taken over the role.  (I know, good use of a college education right?)  I really hate playing games on the PC where my hands are spread over the entire keyboard and I have to remember 27 thousand key combinations correlating to buttons that are no where near one another (e.g. press w + spacebar + c + mouse click for "rolling thrust."  This was for Jedi Knights:Jedi Academy).  I thought this gamepad would solve my dilemma but Nostromo has not updated any of their game templates since 2003.  From what I understand Logitech provides more up to date donwloads so I recommend checking out their rumblepad along with the Nostromo, see which one better fits your style of gaming.  Cheers.	-1
I realy am going to be honest, this is the worst sims expansion pack. It's really a waste of money because there is no use going to "vacation island", when you can throw a party, go to "Studio Town", or go to "Downtown Sim City." Before you buy this game buy:  Sim's Superstar, Sim's House Party, and Sim's Hot Date those are the best Sim's Expansion Packs	-1
You know what I love about The Sims?  I enjoy builing houses and adding furniture as my income increases.  I also enjoy enhancing my Sims skills and advancing them in their jobs.  I do not enjoy just watching them interact so that I can "play house." Because of that, The Sims Vacation was the last expansion I bought because it disappointed me for the same reasons the Hot Date expansion did.  I'm sure there are people that love to role-play their Sims in new downtown districts (i.e. Hot Date) or hotel resorts (i.e. Vacation) but I found both of those additions boring.  It's already hard enough to keep all the Sims hygiene, social and other tabs updated, and it becomes even more difficult when you take your Sims on vacation.  Sure, it's interesting for a few minutes to watch your Sims ride an attraction or another expansion feature but it's not what made the game fun for me in the first place.  I would only recommend this expansion for the diehard fans of The Sims series.  I'd check out The Sims Unleashed or The Sims Superstar expansion packs (the two most recent expansions) first because they seem to focus on normal gameplay enhancements instead of the "side attractions" that make up The Sims Vacation or The Sims Hot Date.  Of course, if you only want new decorations and furniture, Vacation adds it own fair share of the normal expansion extras.  Honestly, I'd wait for the next deluxe edition that packages several expansions together.  With the upcoming sequel, you can expect some good deals as The Sims tries to repackage all sequels for one last sales push.  Or you can just wait for the sequel which will be out in a few months and has the same gameplay but much better graphics.	-1
i feel that dance dance revolution is better and this game only copied it. If you where interested in this game. Get Dance Dance Revolution or one of the sequals such as ddr max. I also recommend the mats for it.the mats last about a year. Pros of Dance Dance Revolution: Good exercise with mats Helps you make quick desicisions with fast songs Helps timing Fun Cons of Dance Dance Revolution: very very addictive but who cares mats only last a year long [yes that addictive]	-1
........um wow......a game for britney....um...yea.....she um has no skills.......she cant sing or dance......why buy a game about it.....but as a boy thats just me....	-1
first off read the review titled: "Not bad.... but could have been more" that person has done a good job of summing up the gameplay and the overall quality of the game.  I would echo the fact that the game is fun for a few hours.  The gameplay ramps up considerably fast and I find the second 5 levels to be really challenging.  Only for the extremely dextrous fingers.  The audio and video are both very solid, and I bet fans of britney (esp young ones) will really enjoy the back stage reward features where you can unlock footage of her rehersals from her vegas show that was on mtv.  The slightly interactive concert footage is cool and there are a bunch of other clips of britney being goofy to unlock.  All this would have been better if the film quality or backstage footage was really high quality but its just not so you are left sort of wanting more.  The MAJOR drawback (if not for the following I would have thought the game had meritted 3 or 4 stars) is that it only contains 5 songs.  That is just silly britney has at least 10 singles and other popular music games make it a point to include closer to a dozen different songs.  I like stronger, hit me baby, oops, slave, and hhmmmm the other one escapes me, but its just not enough after a couple hours.  Furthermore any parent or roomate listening in will be driven crazy after an hour of the same 5 songs. One final note -- the game has a very nice 2 player mode that allows for a good deal of handicapping while still making the game fun for both players.  That I can appreciate.  In conclusion, while by no means a dud, Britney could have added another 5 songs and the game would have been a real sleeper.  As it is its probably a better rental except for die hard fans.	-1
All right folks, be warned.  While this game is on XBox, and we all like to think of the graphics first on the big green machine, you'll have a major obstacle in your way.  the CONTROLS. it's sorta of bad Mojo, too.  this game could have easily been put in the same category (or close) to Devil May Cry if the controls were better.  you ONLY get to use the D-Pad, no analog love for us!  think Resident Evil Controls, but worse, you gotta push on the old Nintendo-Pad to move.  remember doing that back in the days, when we just didn't know any better??  maybe the army has just gotten me thinking like this, but how could something [like this] continue to happen to games?  i hate to see things like this persist in any area, especially gaming...	-1
Don't get me wrong-- I LOOOVE the Sims-- I have all four.  I didn't give this game a rating because I haven't played it yet.  However, with Sims Hot Date, there are too many bugs, and even though Maxis did a recent patch for such problems as Sims not being able to get off a couch after cuddling, some purchase items not being transferred, etc., (I tried downloading the most recent patch for HD, and can't due to problems with their winzip)I hope that most bugs are worked out for this program prior to release date.  I think that Maxis is coming out with these additions much too fast and are not really testing enough prior to releasing-- hence, the many problems with the Hot Date program.  I will just wait about 8 months to a year before purchasing Vacation-- Maybe they'll have all the bugs worked out by then.	-1
The Xbox never impressed me, and this is one of many games that shows me why the system was so weak:  The game is pretty awful, overall.  The music is terrible.  It's just a bunch of techno beats that we've all heard from better games.  COUNTLESS other games, in fact.  The game gets boring really fast.  Skating around the same people all the time is pretty boring.  Skip this game.	-1
This game isn't even a game. You just go around grinding for 99% of it. Plus the music...Ahhhhh.... It isn't even music. It just makes these weird sounds the whole game except for one where there constantly swearing. If i were you i would actually by a game.	-1
this game is okay at first, but then it gets boring. i thought that it would be alright (i must have been kidding myself!). i am up for the new challenges (but not this...). i can't see how this game gets such a high rating...i think it is for kids honestly. i am a kid-at-heart, but i couldn't take this...skating game. i just hope "they" don't make anymore sequels, they should be done I KNOW I AM!!!!! RATED TWO BECAUSE SHADED GRAPHICS ARE COOL!	-1
I got Wreckless with the antipation of owning a new fun XBox game.  I, being a veteran gamer, was left sorely disappointed. After playing several missions I've come to realize that the developers of the game must think we gamers love having to do boring things over and over again.  They also think we'd like to see a terrible looking instant replay of us doing it over and over again.  The game frequently pummels you with below the belt hits, smacks you with cheap shots and puts a doom clock over your head just for spite.  The graphics are fantastic but who cares when the gameplay is lame.  They say the physics engine is accurate.  I don't see it.  GTA3's better than that.  At least the cars don't disappear in front of you or corners throw you for a 180 everytime your near.  The in game arrows will blind you and the huge map and displays all over your screen make seeing where your going a huge hassle.  Bottom line, Save your money or just rent it!	-1
CHEESY GRAPHICS BAD SOUNDTRACK WARNING: MAY CAUSE DEPRESSION IT IS HORRIBLE!!...	-1
I rented this game and I played it for about 45 minutes. Then I turned it off. It was pretty bad for a couple reasons. 1. You have a time limit, which is barely enough to complete the missions. 2. The only way to blow up other cars is to run into them. This is so stupid because it takes a while for the damage to go down and there is traffic so you are constantly getting hit by other cars and then you have to catch up to the bad guys again. 3. There are no weapons. This kind of goes along with #2 but this game could be a lot better if they were weapons, like twisted metal, except in a different style. 4. There isn't much freedom. You can't just drive around like in GTA3, all you do is the missions, which get frustrating and so I turned it off. Just about the only good things in this game are the graphics. The streets and buildings are very realistic and so are the crashes. I don't reccomend this game at all. I think it was a wast of my 5 bucks to rent it, so it would absolutely be a waste of 50 bucks to buy it.	-1
Wreckless cooly shows off the graphic power of the Xbox.  The rendering of a stylized Hong Kong looks just gorgeous.  The framerate is also good, and there is a lot of action.  But the controls are a big letdown and makes the action a moot point at times.  For some reason I have a lot of trouble making simply left and right turns, and when I try to powerslide I more often than not slam into a wall -- mind you that I thought I was pretty good at playing Project Gotham.  The cars also flop too easily, and you can get stuck occasionally due to what looks like a bug.  Very frustrating.  At best a rental title.	-1
Homer Simpson would have one thing to say about this game: "Boooorrring" Wreckless offers stunning graphics, but very little in the way of gameplay.  It is a good demonstration of XBox technology and very little else. The game centers around a set of missions that put you against the Japanese mafia.  The missions involve racing around a city and usually involve destroying something using your car (other cars, dim sum stands, etc).  Missions are timed and you must complete sets of missions to advance.  Completing missions unlocks new cars as well.  All in all, the missions are diverse but aren't interesting enough to keep you playing. The cars themselves aren't particularly easy to drive.  They tend to have a lot of oversteer, meaning it is very easy to loose control of the back of the car.  Weaving in and out of traffic at high speed is almost impossible with some of the vehicles.  A bit of understeer and better sliding ability would make the driving aspect of the game much more enjoyable. The major upside to this game are the graphics.  They are just amazing.  It is worth renting this game just for a few days of eye candy. Also, the destructability of the city is very impressive.  You can drive just about anywhere and hit anything, with all objects reacting just the way you would expect.  At the end of a mission you'll find you've leave the streets in turmoil .. :)	-1
I'd recommend renting this game.  I picked it up thinking it would be something like Grand Theft Auto 3, but it's nothing like it at all.  You are stuck in your vehicle the whole time, and crashing into other people gets really boring after about 10 minutes.  The missions are lacking, and downright easy, and the graphics aren't all that good.  The cars handle really bad, and I find it awkward to steer them at higher speeds.  I don't know what catagory to place this game in, I'm thinking JUNK would be a good one though.  Right now, with games like this out, I'm thinking I should have stuck with the PS2.	-1
this game was predicted to be one of the reasons to buy an Xbox but unfortunately that prediction was way off. The graphics are great, i can't deny that but the game is too short and repetitive. I finished my friend's game in a few days and it was good while it lasted but now that it's over i won't return to it. But a longer and larger sequel could be a great game..I'm not just saying these negative things about this Xbox game because i am a nintendo fan but this is just a bit poor..If u want good games for Xbox buy Halo/Dead or Alive 3	-1
I am a 12-year Street Fighter veteran who's played over a dozen permutations of this series on seven, eight different consoles, mostly pad-based.  The prospect of any SF game working well on the Game Boy Advance looked slim, and sure enough, the game just doesn't translate. My main concern, adapting to the four-button layout, turned out to be minor compared to the poor response.  Every attack takes half a beat to be executed, requiring the player to "pre-execute" moves before their time, thus making the delicate, complex Street Fighter fighting system impossible.  The graphics are impressively close to the old PlayStation version that I played, and they managed to keep all the characters, but this is no compensation for the fact that the control pad is too unresponsive to handle Street Fighter-style combos, super moves, and charge moves.  Where I used to be able to pull off a 10-hit combo with Karin, now I struggle to pull off even a two-in-one fireball, and my left hand was cramped after two or three fights. I can't blame the game developers all the way; the game and the console were simply not a compatible match.  Nevertheless, most of my Gameboy Advance games (excluding the incredibly poor 007 Nightfire) are far more responsive than this.  I can't help but think if they had sacrificed some graphics and scaled down the character roster a little, they would have had a much more playable game.	-1
You know, pirates are all about sailing the seven seas, scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled. But Pirates: The Legened of Black Kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should be.   First off, the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items. But even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that fun.   You can also dock on many islands and many worlds as Katrina de' Leon, but even that is exceptionly bad. She does not have many moves or abilityes and heck, she can't even climb up the smallest hills!   Graphics on this game are very poor, and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible. The only good graphics of the game are the waters of the oceans you sail which look very real.   The music is alright...when it decides to turn itself on. One of this games' many flaws is that it gives you no motivation to keep "adventuring" while you play and you don't feel like you ever want to plug it in after your done playing!   However, there are little aspects of this game that seem interesting but not enough to keep you from being bored, such as Tiki Heads which give you different attacks, and magical figureheads on your ship to give it powers out of the ordinary. Yet even these items do very little to keep you wanting to play.   Mostly, I kept wanting to see more variety of gameplay and challenges, as it quickly got repetitive, and the puzzles on this game are quick to solve.   All in all, if you like horrible, poorly desighned laking gameplay in a video game, I sugest that you don't even glance at this game next time you come across it.   It just plain isn't worth it.	-1
total crap ai cheats i shot a guy with a boozoka 4 times and instead of dyeing he stood there an d kept shooting enemys respawn on machine gun over and over enemys do not reload wepon fire contu\inually while you reload ea games allways cheat	-1
Not at all memorable, just a game they threw together for an early release on new consoles	-1
I played this many years ago (2002) when it was first released and got stuck about midway thru the game on a mission where I kept getting mowed down by a machine game nest in an alley. I got tired of repeating that level over and over ad nauseam and I stopped playing.  Last week (2015), looking for some single-player FPS action on my trusty old PS2, I decided to revisit this game on NORMAL difficulty. The controls are completely wonky. NO sensitivity settings? WTH? The character moves way too slowly when moving and aiming. Now I know why I put it down many years ago.  EXAMPLE: Early in the game, my character was trapped in a corner with absolutely no escape. Maybe I can jump? Nope. Move left, right, forward, backward? Nope. I'm stuck. Hard. I had to reset the level. In the submarine mission, I was continually spraying the same narrow corridor with a German MP40 submachine gun and I had to unload 2 clips just to kill 5 Nazis. Gee, I had no idea machine guns were so bloody ineffective on enemy soldiers at close-range. LOL. I kept getting mowed down over and over again by the same 5 Nazis with no escape and no defilade while my character slowly reloaded his heavy duty NERF gun. Hurry up, grandpa! I made it thru at least 4 times with only a drop of life left, only to be mowed down again in another narrow corridor farther on up the road by another 5 Nazis with still no defilade and no effective close-range weapon. By the 5th and 6th try my character's view snapped up at the ceiling and started to spin around and around and around while those dirty Kraut sailors annihilated me. Stuck again? Staring up at the ceiling? WTH? NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE! I guess the generals forgot to supply me with some Dramamine before I got on this crazy U-boat. LOL. Forget it. Who's got the time when I could be playing something fun. This game is an exercise in futility. Shameful beta testing.  I had no problem beating MOH 1 & 2 on the old PS1 and had a great time playing those games. But, this franchise was ruined when they made this wonky MESS the 3rd game in the MOH platform series. Unless you're a glutton for punishment stay far far away. If you have to play it, set it on EASY. That's what I'm doing now just to rip thru it and see what the rest of it looks like. (ARGH! I just shot Wernher von Braun with the sniper rifle 3 times in the head and he won't go down. He's still scribbling rocket fuel formulas on his little pad. I guess the generals gave me blanks because they want to use him at the end of the war. lol. PAINFUL.)  They say that WAR is HELL, but this game is like being stuck in PURGATORY!  It gets 2 stars for the level design, weapons choice, weapons sound effects, soundtrack, and the dying Nazi animations. Everything else about this game is just plain awful.  If you need a break from all the multiplayer FPSs on the newer platforms and you're looking for a great old single-player FPS experience for your good old PS2, get BLACK (superior) or KILLZONE (great). Those games ROCK!  This game SUCKS a Nazi Potato Masher!	-1
no good at all	-1
let's see, this game was made about 5 years ago.. maybe then, it was considered great, but now?  nope!  call of duty 1 for PC was way way better than this.  no thanks.	-1
First let me start off by saying I was really upset with EA for the  way they show D-Day.  If you've ever seen Saving Private Ryan, you'll know that the invasion was no walk in the park.  But EA, through some EXTRAODINARY act, managed to show this in an amost whimsical light.  You don't have to sprint madly across the beach, dodging bullets and mortor rounds, stepping over bodies and wounded soldiers.  No.  Instead, you run around on a fenced in stretch of beach maybe 50 yards wide, helping men who are pinned down by gunfire.  Its as simple as running (well, you don't have to run really) over to these men, and firing into the bunkers, causing the Germans to stop firing at you for a couple seconds and long enough for whoever you were helping to continue on his way.  Its incredibly stupid.  Then, when you finally get to the bunkers, you have to clear it by yourself.  For some reason, no one follows you in.  The rest of the game is basically a one-man assault on the entire German army.  You parade around shooting Nazis and getting shot maybe twenty times, then pick up a canteen, which heals you.  ITS SO STUPID!!!  Don't waste any time on this game.  I recommend Brothers in Arms.  Although its not all the way there, its much better than this game.  And, oh yeah, DON'T EVER GET MOH: RISING SUN!!! ITS WORSE THAN THIS GAME!!! (just so you know)	-1
I dislike this game... the only good level is the storming the beach level...very intense...but after i played call of duty..it left me wishing call of duty made a storming the beacxh level...can u imagen?..call of duty is a far superior wwII game..this is way too linear..and in war u don't fight all by ur lonesome...ur surronded by men a lot..  this game is too linear..follow the path shoot shoot..and it would be ok...but i found myself getting incredibly frustrated.. i get frustrated with a lot of games but if it frustrates to tyhe point where i just say "screw it" and sell it...its bad..im not a great gamer...i suck at games, ill admit...but still	-1
I am a huge fan of the pirate game genre, so I was excited to see this game in the XBOX section of the store.  I have owned most pirate games for the PC. If you're expecting Sea Dogs or anything close to the old Pirates game on the PC, with Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat, you will be as disappointed as I was with this game. This game might be good for kids learning to play video games, although it is violent.  Since I am not a kid, I grew bored of this game after an hour.  I will probably never play it again. The game play is extremely linear. It would be a good game for elementary school children, if it didn't have all the violence. Basically it's not kid enough for kids and not adult enough for adults.  It's just plain bad. If you need a crummy game fix, buy it at Amazon.  They have the lowest price anywhere for this game.	-1
For the past couple of years I've watched Electronic Arts, formerly one of the most reliable game companies on the scene, squander its reputation with game after game filled with relentless B.S.  I gave it another shot with Medal of Honor Frontline, because it was part of the franchise I'd played for a long time and I thought, how bad could it be? I should have remembered that the last two Medal of Honors I've played, Spearhead (for PC) and Infiltrator (for Gameboy Advance), both sucked.  Frontline was the first time since Medal of Honor Underground that I played this game on a console.  It should have felt like home -- instead, it felt like I was playing Spearhead without a mouse.  What caused them to mess up the control scheme so badly, I can't tell.  But now your character aims blindly thanks to a touchy-feely right analog stick.  I've had to do much more minute aiming adjustments in Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain, targeting distant enemies in the head, and I found it even harder here, though the enemy is just several steps away from me.  From the first level, I bumbled about blindly because foolishly, the game designers now rely mostly on sound to let you know where to go.  Not that bad a thing, except they botched the sound mix.  Rule of thumb in sound mixing:  Music and effects should never, never drown out dialogue.  Here, your superiors' instructions are neatly covered up in the gunfire, overloud music, and ambience.  From the beginning, I had to run around the beach while under enemy fire, looking for scattered teammates who were supposed to be yelling and waving at me to reach them.  Well, I can't hear them, and since there's no radar, I had to rely on blind luck to find them.  A very dumb flaw, easily fixable, but neglected.  Did they actually *test* this thing on real players? As with 90 per cent of games these days, the lighting looks good, and the music is great.  But once again, this game qualifies as a good-looking, good-sounding product that flunks its grade on mechanics.  I don't feel like I'm in control of my character.  Nothing is more of a drag than that.  I should've listened to my instinct and passed on this one.  I regret even the reduced price I'd paid for it .  Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor Underground were such classics, it's baffling how EA managed to botch it all up.	-1
I bought this game over a year ago, and I've only popped it into my PS2 on two occassions- once on the day of purchase, and once yesterday.  The control system is so terrible that it makes the game nearly impossible to play, and completely impossible to enjoy. Perhaps I wouldn't have felt so strongly about this if I hadn't already played the excellent "Medal of Honor: Allied Assault" on my PC, in which the player can use the mouse to aim.  Other than that, and a few slight differences in missions, the two games are almost identical. In "Frontline", the player is forced to use the analogue sticks to aim.  To add to the confusion, most control settings require him/her to use one for moving the view horizontally, and the other one for moving it vertically.  It is absolutely impossible, even on the easiest settings, to aim and fire 1/10 as quickly as the AI, making things far more frustrating than enjoyable.  Furthermore, the speed with which the view moves is always either too fast (causing the player to zip right by his/her target), or too slow (causing the player to take a dozen rounds in the chest before reaching the target). I've been annoyed by the unrealistically lightning-quick reactions of enemies in war games before (like in the original "Rainbow Six", for example), but this takes that annoyance to new heights.  Not only are the enemies too fast, the player is too slow. That said, I can't in good conscience give this game the lowest rating.  The missions look sharp and the theme is always a good one.  I also found the sound-effects to be quite nice.  But there is no way I will ever subject myself to this awful control scheme again.	-1
Maybe I'm just getting old. But this game seems to have no identity. As a shooter it's pretty bad. Trying to aim the crosshairs to shoot the enemy is an exercise in frustration, it's just not possible to precisely aim using the Playstation 2 analog sticks the way you can using a mouse on a computer. So many times I was in a small room with a German soldier, and I couldn't even put the crosshairs on him, and my character was like 4 feet away! Sometimes it's hard to hit a target just a few feet away even when you have a machine gun! These flaws might be forgivable if the story was any good... which it isn't. Another reviewer raved about the graphics, and I have to ask - were we playing the same game? Definitely nothing special here. This was my first foray into the "Medal of Honor" series, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed.	-1
This game is terriable. I cant believe people gave this game a good rating. Realistic? You cant even kill your own allies. Thats realistic? You people know nothing about video games. The game is linear and it seems that the allies would have lost the war without you, you end up doing everthing. The history lesson after each mission was boring and should have never been put in the game. The symphony music sounded like you were at a funeral. This game is not as good as everyone claims it is.	-1
If you have access to a half decent computer than don't even bother getting the PS2 version of this game. Allied Assault is so much more entertaining than Frontline, it's not even funny. I turned Frontline off in 20 minutes and played Allied Assault instead. Not only does Allied Assault have single player action, but online multiplayer, which the PS2 version does not have. Get Allied Assault on PC, and forget this one.	-1
This game has a nice set-up, and had the potential to be a good baseball sim.  Costas' play by play and the little cut scenes before you get up to bat really give you the feel of a baseball game.  However once you come up to bat, the game doesn't deliver.  I think I had 30 homers the first game that I played, and it got less and less challenging after that.  I recommend that you avoid this game unless you like home-run derby's.	-1
CAUTION: Read before buying. As with all sporting games, it's best to RENT before dropping [$$$]+ tax. You may like it, you may not. Sporting games, in particular, will appeal in different ways to different people, so find something that's compatible with your likes and dislikes. This game was certainly not for me. I'm a big fan of World Series 2K1 & 2K2 for the Dreamcast, and only hope they pump out a version for the XBOX. Here's a few rants that turned me off immediately. >>> Corny music. >>> When you're at the plate, the hitting indicator shows you where the ball is going to be pitched! Granted you don't know if it's a curve or a two-seamer or a sinker, but still, come on! Doesn't this take some of the challenge away? Is the catcher letting you know what's coming or something? ala, Crash Davis from "Bull Durham?" "...here comes the deuce, and when you speak of me, speak of me kindly..." >>> Is it just me or is this some kind of "midget" league? The players are proportioned like infants, with extra large craniums who appear to be looming at a mere 4'9". >>> Bad sound effects. The crack of the bat (which the Dreamcast simulated beautifully) sounds anything but. For me, these CONS jumped right out at me and I was unable, in good conscience, to proceed any further. These are some basics that are critical in simulating the most realistic play possible. GOOD NEWS:  I just read the May XBOX Magazine and they are collaborating with WORLD SERIES BASEBALL (SEGA) for an EXCLUSIVE XBOX release in May.  How cool is this --- this is far and away my favorite baseball gaming package, and they're dissing PS2 on this release.  They're utilizing the full graphic capablility to create the finest baseball game yet.  I won't even rent this one --- I'll be buying immediately. Baseball is a huge part of my life, and a solid game is a must have for the season ahead!! On a side note, "ALL-STAR BASEBALL" was seriously lacking visually (again, thumbs down here); I have full confidence WORLD SERIES 2K3 will put the rest of these packages to bed...	-1
Get the Xbox version, which has better graphics, Dolby 5.1 surround sound (makes a HUGE difference), and easier controls.  Even the controller vibration seems a little more engaging on the Xbox.	-1
Ugh.. this game was terrible.  I will admit, the graphics we're pretty good, but that's all I will say that it positive about it.  The controls are the absolute worst.  There's so much going on at once and you're trying to figure out how to control your character.. you just get frustrated.  Atleast I did.  If you want to try it, rent it first.	-1
come on i bought the game on the first day it came out and i beat the game on that first day it's just too easy to beat the first level is fun ,but that's the only level that's fun goshyou can't even get in a tank or fighter plane!! ...	-1
...but not good.  As another reviewer said, the playability of this game is just silly.  Graphics=Great, Sound=Great, Realism=Truly leaves you scratching your head.  As mentioned by someone else, the enemies can engage you way before you can engage them.  Now, granted, some of them have the accuracy of the bad guys in a Rambo movie, but more often than not, you will get pegged from somebody that you can't even see.  I even noticed that no matter where I took cover, I still got hit.  The only way to make it remotely real is to cheat and put it on one-shot kill mode.  As the other reviewer said, you will get nailed about 4-5 times before you can even aim, and then all you do is continually re-aim because every time you get hit, the cross-hairs move.  The one-shot cheat solves this by actually making enemies go down when you shoot them.  But, I hate cheating to win a game.  If you want a first-person shooter that is as close to real as they can get, buy any of the "Half-Life" series of games.  I have played first-person shooters since the original "Castle Wolfenstein" came out for the old 286 computers (remember those kids?), and I must say that I have yet to find a more realistic and engaging game than "Half-Life".  All-in-all, MOH Frontline is not a game that people should buy if they are looking for realism.  Rent it for a weekend, solve it, and then move on.	-1
I expected so much from this title, but it suffers from the exact same problems as the first two MOH titles. They are as follows (in order of frustration level to me) Problem #1: Bullets come from absolutely nowhere... while this has been toned down since the "underground" installment, it is still very prevalent. Your enemies will shoot straight through buildings on occasion, and bullets will travel around corners as well. Problem #2: Every Nazi you come across is an absolute crackshot. I can sit there and watch an enemy through a thick fog in my sniper rifle scope from 200-300 yards sidestepping my crosshairs or running from side to side and hosing me down with a WWII-era STG40 automatic rifle (one of the most ridiculously inaccurate weapons ever made) with AT LEAST 70% accuracy at the same time- needless to say, this ends the level for me rather quickly. If I have a hard time sniping someone with a SNIPER RIFLE even though they are dead center in the crosshairs, they'd better suffer the same problem. Problem #3: Lt. Patterson is an IDIOT when it comes to weapons. He can squeeze the trigger, but aiming is another story. You should see "Operation Repunzel"- I am armed with a silenced pistol, getting hit from all different directions, and I can't hit a guy standing less than 3 feet away! The moron fires and a bullet hole appears in the wall behind him at least 45 degrees from the intended target. In short, it's ridiculous. A U.S. Army Lieutenant had to have been better trained in small-arms skill than this if he is to have survived WWII. Fortunately, he shoots quite well with a sniper rifle, but the machine guns and pistols are beyond frustrating. Problem #4: Realism. I never quite felt like I was executing a mission, but rather it seemed like a wild goose chase from medkit to medkit, absorbing dozens of bullets in my not-so-human body in between. This may have passed in the heyday of FPS's like DOOM, but today that stuff shouldn't cut it. Fellow gamers, is this what you think we should be getting from "the most realistic WWII shooter of all time?" Sure, the graphics, controls, and sound are great, but it lacks the flair where it really counts. Skip this one.	-1
First things first, I'm a big PS2 fanboy.  I have a PS2 and I don't even want the others.  There is one thing about this game though that really irks me, EA already has it made for PS2 without a multiplayer, and they are GOING to release it for Gamecube and X-Box with multiplayer.  What is it with EA?  Why do they always have to make better products for the other systems?  PS2 is just as good as the others...	-1
This game is fun but my question is why did they settle for single player. What I mean is this game like many others could have easily been made a 2 player split screen cooperative game. Then I would say the perfect game.  Who agrees with me that this would be the greatest game if it were split screen cooperative. Over all this is a good war game but it would be better if it were 2 player split screen cooperative.  Well its just a tip for the next medal of honor game Well click the yes under the review if u think this game should be coop and click no if u think it shouldnt. Thank you.	-1
FOr all those that played the demo, it's nothing compared to the mixed themes of this game. When do chefs on a U-boat thtow knives at you? ANd men shoot through walls? Men quickly change from the marines to the army in a matter of weeks. This game has terrible AI, limited gameplay, and no replay value due to a total lack of fun and multiplayer. Very disappointing after the great Allied assault pc game. This game is not great, but a sad excuse to anybody that compares it to GOldeneye. Very disappointing and not worth buying or even renting. Nothing about it's good. So stop with the good reviews and get lives you 12 year-old newbies to the first-person shooter world. It's better without your reviews and lies about this game.	-1
Okay, first off, I didn't glance at this game; I immersed myself in this game.  Please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great.  I played approximately 10 exhibition games, a twenty game season with playoffs, created players, and explored all the various game modes, and played quite a few 2 player games.  This game really seems to capture the essence of baseball.  Notice I used the word "seems".  When looking at this game in depth, this game has no long-term playability. First off, the graphics are terrible.  I mean really, really terrible.  It's almost like they transported the player graphics from Super Nintendo land.  The feel of baseball is almost deadened after looking at the super cheap animations.  Of course in most sports games, graphics shouldn't matter.  This is baseball though - the ambience, the look of the grass, the feel of the crowd, the skyline, all contribute to good game.  This hampers it. I would gladly sacrifice graphics for a good game.  At first, I thought it did.  After a few exhibition games, I felt like they finally reached the holy pantheon of sporting games, to be seated next to Madden 97 and the original NHL for the PC, NBA 2K and NFL2K for the Dreamcast, Lakers vs. Celtics for the Genesis, and Baseball Simulation 2000 (yes, 2000, even though it was released in the 80s) for the original NES.  My hopes quickly faded. The games' pitching-batter interface is very polished, and definitely is the game.  Unfortunately, it's full of glitches.  In one camera angle, the high and low pitches are distinct, but outside and inside pitches are awful.  In another angle, the exact opposite occurs. Why not have an angle that can show both?  In two others angles, it's just plain impossible to judge anything.  Curveballs are a plain joke, and couldn't even fool Jeremy Burnitz, while sliders and change-ups are just plain evil to hitters. Don't get me started on the Home run contest.  I hit ten home runs on ten pitches with Shinjo.  With Barry Bonds, the only way not to hit a home run is to not make contact. In terms of long-term play, I started off in pro level, and after steady improvement, I easily mastered it and progressed into all-star level.  All of sudden, my team was chalked full of Jose Cansecos and Dave Kingmans.  Even though I averaged three to four runs a game, almost all my runs were off home runs, the vast majority being solo shots.  Troy Glaus drove in more than half my runs.  For the very few times I got a single, the next at-bat resulted in a double play.  This type of game would bore any true baseball fan to death. So my offense stagnated, but I won approximately half my games on all-star level.  Then I noticed something.  Mostly all the games I played were one run games.  Out of these, the games were decided in the last two innings.  All of them.  No matter how much I altered the simulation level, the game would massage the abilities to make it a close score.  Any true baseball fan, like me, would be revolted.  Part of baseball consists of 12-1 games along with the 3-2 games.  Closers proved worthless.  To test my hypothesis, I chose to play the Angels versus the Yankees in the playoffs.  In every game that I was leading going into the eighth, my pitchers couldn't throw any strike except right down the middle, and all the Yankees became the re-incarnation of Barry Bonds.  Even though I could easily strike out Bernie Williams in the second inning, I would give up walk upon walk to Alfonso Soriano.  Of course, constantly walking Alfonso is not just a minor glitch; it's release-stopping bug!  While losing, Troy Percival would be pitch like Byun Hung Kim in the World Series.  After he gives up the lead, he'd pitch just like Pedro.  This type of things flies in the face of actual simulation and just plain ruins the game.  I found myself not trying to score in the fifth and sixth inning so I can have a chance of winning. So, the earlier innings are a waste, and the offense is boring as heck, the computer's AI sacrifice's the very notion of simulation, the graphics are terrible, and it's full of annoying glitches.  Why would anyone want to play this game?  A baseball game is made to be played for a long time, and this doesn't come close.  The only thing that redeems is it is that it's still pretty good in two player.  Of course, try to get a friend to come over and play a whole season - good luck. Baseball is the hardest game to simulate, and this game just could measure up.  I wasted some serious cash on this, so I hope you don't.	-1
This game [is bad]. I think that Goldeneye, The world is not Enough, and Tommorow Never Dies are by far the best of the Bond games. I think that this was not a good idea. The graphics [are bad], the gameplay [is bad], and the multiplayer is even worst. Hopefully the next Bond game will kick this ones fat ... back to the industry to teach the makers a lesson!!!	-1
Get Halo. Halo is much better... 007 is only a lazy attempt to get onto the Xbox, but the aiming is totally off... the characters move way too fast... it doesn't seem human. very unrealistic.	-1
Disc was flawless but no original packaging. just a black case.	-1
This game is absolutely terrible. I tried it out at the store first then decided to buy it.  What a mistake.  This game is so dark, it's hard to see where you're going.  It's actually a really difficult game and there are very few spots in the game that allow you to save.  I don't recommend this game to anyone.	-1
There's a method a lot of developers use to keep a race tight, in a racing game - it's called "rubber band" AI. Rather than having each individual computer opponent actually race, as they might in real life, their speed is tied directly to your speed. If you slow down, they slow down. If you speed up, they speed up. In theory, this keeps races close, and exciting. In Sled Storm, it makes them obnoxiously difficult, and takes any semblance of "fun" out of racing. It takes the "race" out of racing, in fact. You can hit every shortcut, every turbo boost, and not make a single mistake throughout the entireity of a 10 minute long race, and if you make a minor mistake at the end, you can go from 1st place to 6th in less than half a second, with no way to recover. This isn't an issue of making a huge mistake, and falling behind, it's an issue that no matter how well you know a track, and can exploit it, you'll *never* get more than half a second ahead of last place. As a result, Sled Storm isn't a racing game, it's a game about not making any mistakes, ever. It's not fun, it's not interesting, it's a horrible way to have implemented the computer "AI", and it makes the game so utterly pointless and worthless that it's not likely I will ever play it again.	-1
As the review title implies, I despise this game.  Sled Storm for the PS2 is a huge disappointment.  The graphics are ugly primary-color polygons with no texture, the tracks look like they were all stolen from SSX games, the "snowmobiles" sound like someone swatting at angry hornets with a rusty chainsaw, and the tracks are way too linear.  No off-track exploration here, folks.  If you see this game, just ignore it and walk away.	-1
For some reason, EA BIG decided to make a third SSX game, only involving snowmobiles instead of snowboards. If you decide to explore the tracks looking for shortcuts, you will find yourself crashing upon contact with thin air. The tracks themselves are [similiar to] SSX tracks, with the ever-present clown and carnival theme that EA BIG loves to incorporate in all their racing games. the snowmobiles sound like garbage, the graphics are polygons. Crashing into thin air is the real frustrating part... there is an invisible barrier on both sides, on top and under the linear track that forces the driver to run the track like a roller coaster. this game is garbage, plain and simple. The only demographic I think this CD ROM would satisfy are kids under the age of seven. SSX was good, but EA BIG is really running the linear roller-coaster type racing games into the ground fast.	-1
If killing the golden goose were a video game, EA Big's version would have crazy, stylin' tricks, a boss hip-hop / metal soundtrack and lots of attitude... all of which typifies what a huge disappointment the PS2 version of "Sled Storm" is.  Like "SSX Tricky", this is a game that overlooks solid gameplay in favor of production slickness and a contrived "coolness". The original PlayStation "Sled Storm" was a critics' darling and revered by a small fanbase that appreciated its mix of clever, shortcut-friendly mountain tracks, semi-realistic trick-oriented "sno-cross" tracks, and a game system that offered snomobiles that pitched, bounced and bobbed in ways that cars and snowboarders don't. All of those traits are absent in this PlayStation 2 version.  The tracks aren't clever; they're a garish collection of "extreme" design elements (look, it's the iceberg tunnel!  oh wow, it's the big lava jump!  hey, it's something ...from "The Nightmare Before Christmas") that makes gamers think that the marketing and art departments teamed up to browbeat the developers and anyone left over from the first game. The controls are similar to the original and the grapics are up to next-gen snuff, but racing has been de-emphasized in favor of a trick system that builds up a "boost" meter, so you spend much of your time recovering from trick-induced wrecks and boosting to catch up.  The camera is often sideways or even upside down, and is perfectly willing to follow your sled through obstacles like cave walls and rocks that should be more solid than they are. As for the bouncing, lurching snowmobiles, forget it -- paint the snow black and this could be mistaken for "San Francisco Rush 2049". EA Big, I knew "Sled Storm"... "Sled Storm" was a game I beat... and this, sir, is no "Sled Storm".  If this is truly the game you intended to make, then don't ruin your previous accomplishment by co-opting its name... call this "Radikkal EXtreme Sledz" or something more appopriate to its big unsubstantiated hype.	-1
The game features Barry Burton from Resident Evil (and he also appears in a bit of Resident Evil 2) and Leon Scott Kennedy (Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4). The story tells that Leon S. Kennedy went to a ship called Starlight and that, somehow, he got lost... So Barry has to come to that ship to find out where Leon is and to rescue him.. He discovers that the ship is full of zombies and some B.O.W.s, because the Umbrella Corp. put their dirty hands on that ship.. Barry also finds a survivor, who is named Lucia. And she'll help him to find Leon and whoever else is there... - Graphics: I must say this was one of the few games I've played on the Game Boy Color, so I can't really compare... But, for all I've seen (not that much), the graphics are good for that plataform... They try to work with shadows and stuff... Well, they did what they could...But the character looks horrible.. Not detailed at all.. Even enemies are more detailed. - Sound: The music isn't very good... You feel like it's the same one in the whole game.. Game Boy Color is not a powerful console for graphics nor sound... Talking about the few melodies in this game, I think they're Ok.. But can't be compared with any other Resident Evil game. You get sick of them. - Fun: This is not a masterpiece. It's very far from it. You can beat the game once, but you're probally not going to play it again... Because it's not very scary without the soundtrack (which has always been a great point in Resident Evil games) and with bad graphics - Educative: This is the only Teen-classified Resident Evil game... All the others are Mature-classified. The thing here has no big deal.. Some blood, violence.. You're killing zombies, anyway... You're not killing any human or any good guy.. You're killing biological weapons and zombies.. I think you parents don't have to worry about it... After all, this game is disappointing. I only suggest you to buy it if you're a hardcore Resident Evil fan or if you're a GBC game collector. It's a great title for GBC - who has no big titles.	-1
The Resident Evil series has had a tried but true tradition of creepy chills and shocks to elevate itself in the survival horror genre, it's just too bad that none of that matters on this nearly pitiful attempt to bring the series to a portable system (on the Game Boy Color of all systems nonetheless).  You get to play as Leon (the hero from Resident Evil 2) and Barry (one of the heroes from the original Resident Evil) and go up against an army of Umbrella undead on an ocean cruiseliner.  That might sound good on paper on a next-gen home system, but on the GBC the idea falls flat thanks to the system's limitations.  Gaiden features some innovation: the game is played on an overhead view and switches to a 2-D first person perspective when you encounter an enemy.  The graphics however are pretty bland, as is the sound.  Control is pretty tight, but you won't notice that as you wander around looking for the ever so tiring "find the key to open the door" type puzzles.  With all this thrown in Gaiden gets repetitive and boring, and you will likely not finish the game due to being disgusted with it.  All in all, Resident Evil Gaiden is a must play for Resident Evil fans, but you won't find anything to hold you to it.  Then again, it is better than Resident Evil: Survivor.	-1
Resident Evil is a name that most gamers know by heart as one of the most original and compelling games to grace the industry. It perfected the genre of Survival Horror and created a cult following immediately. Even today it is one of the most successful franchises in game history and definitely a large part of the bread and butter at CAPCOM. However it did not achieve this status for nothing. With every CLASSIC game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system. The Resident Evil series from the beginning was developed with exploration and puzzle solving in mind. Then the graphical presentation was developed to supply enough detail and interest that a person would actually want to explore it. The setting, in a mansion full of horror story influences, was perfect for the type of game style that was being developed. At the time they used static backgrounds due to the fact that the Sony Playstation system couldn't display enough polygons to make a believable environment. But doing it this way also proved to make the graphical presentation much smoother and more detail rich. Later the series would try full 3D in Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast, and then return to it's roots on GameCube in perhaps the best looking game to date. Resident Evil Gaiden for GBC was perhaps an unrealistic attempt from the beginning. The gameplay has completely changed so dramatically that it becomes a new game with a Resident Evil logo. It resembles more of a Metal Gear 8-bit Nintendo game from the 80's than a Resident Evil game. The battle system is completely boring and overly hard. It is more like a game of golf because you have to hit the button at the right time on a progress bar that scrolls left to right before you can shoot a zombie in combat mode. It's tricky and timing is everything. But, more importantly it just doesn't fit the RE universe and it is a poor attempt to port a name over to a dead handheld system with way too little power for such a detail/exploration latent game as RE. The graphics are horrible even for GBC standards and the battle system is poorly developed and there is no since this is even a RE game at all. Invest in something else, anything else. For 20 bucks more you could have RE for GameCube, the best RE there is. Stay away from this game I promise you will be taking it back the next day to trade for something else. It IS that BAD!	-1
Probably the most unknown Resident Evil game of them all, solely for it appearing on the GBC. The game plays like a 3rd person adventure, then when in combat with a zombie or creature, switches to a first person view where you your shots to choose where to shoot them. Overall, for a Resident Evil game, it isn't the best. But for a Game Boy Color game, this is one of the best. So, if for some reason you've never played a handheld more advanced than the original Game Boy or the Game Boy Color or if you're a diehard Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, you could probably find a better way to spend your money. NnyCW for CapCity	-1
I bought this game yesterday and i knew i made a mistake. It's like they didn't feel like finishing the game. What i hate the most about this game is the players models. Kobe and jordan look exactly alike. And the rest of the players don't look like themselves. I want a basketball game where the players look alike....Also, the camera angles [are bad]. It's like the screen is to low and you can barely see the crowd. I like playing in tv angle. they don't have that angle in this game. The gameplay also stinks because it is easy scoring points. I scored 50 points with kobe playing in all-star and only missed two shots, that [is no good]. The street mode [is terrible] simply because their isn't a crowd cheering for you like in the dreamcast version. So it is boring. i want someone cheering for me when i dunk. So in closing words, Do not get this game cause it [is no good]...trust me, This game is [dreadful]! you don't want a b ball game where the players don't look like themselves!!!!!	-1
This game is very boring.  No acion what so ever....if you want an action game, get Halo.	-1
How is it this game has all these reviews and high ratings when it won't be released for three more months? I guess Doc Brown must be renting out his DeLorean.	-1
Firstly, you can save a maximum of 127 games to a card, not blocks. Of you could only save 127 blocks, the memory card 251 wouldn't exist along with some upcoming SD memory card accessories. I thought this was a great card for a while but then it blew. So maybe it is true that I did have a couple save files equal to about 130 blocks and my memory card did feel pretty hot after Bomberman. But no card should die like that!! My recommendation is to go with the Memory card 251 by Nintendo. Nintendo cards are a lot sturdier. I am thankful that the card would just no longer save, rather than deleting my data and I could just move it over	-1
This game is not all that great.  Graphics are choppy and load times are long.  I say no one lives forever is crap.	-1
This Bond-wannabe game goes through the motions of a standard action game, but leaves nothing out of the ordinary. The graphics are dated, the story is used and the gameplay just isn't all that interesting. This is a dud in the action gaming world. Don't spend your money on this one.	-1
i didn't like this games at all. there are better games out there. trust me on this one don't buy it!!	-1
I THOUGHT THIS GAME MIGHT BE COOL BUT WHEN I PLAYED IT WAS HORRIBLE HERES STUFF ABOUT IT GRAPHICS:1/1O IT WAS TO FUZZY SOUND:1/10 TERRIBLE GAMEPLAY:1/10 VERY HARD COOLNESS:1/10 NOTHINGS COOL ABOUT IT RESULT:TERRIBLE MAYBE RENT IT BUT DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB GAME.	-1
I got this card and it erased my entire football team which took hours to create and my Bond game which took me a week to beat.  When I returned it to Toys'R'Us the Video Games sales clerk nerd told me that 99% of the people that bought this memory card from their store returned it with numerous complaints.  What else is there to say?  If you buy it, it might work but if it doesn't!  Everything is gone.  One friend of mine even got one of his games broken from this memory card!  PLEASE DO NOT MAKE the same mistake I made and get this Memory Card!  Interact is a SHAME!	-1
I'm not a fan of the show, but I found that the graphics and storyline were terrific and often funny. However, I absolutely hated the fact that I couldn't save during crucial parts of the game (such as after slaying one of the tougher creatures). Instead the annoying checkpoints are used at designated points (which are often VERY far apart). I became so frustrated having to go back and replay from a previous checkpoint 10 minutes of play back in the game that the game lost its fun and became a burden. I'm glad I rented this game because I will not buy it.	-1
I didn't believe that this card could really be as bad as everyone said on here, but boy was I wrong, it will let me save a file maybe 1 or 2 times, but if i go to overwrite it it would say corrupt data, and force me to format all my saves..luckily i kept backups on my nintendo brand memory card 59 though. i no longer trust interact.	-1
So I mark Warcraft III as the point where the franchise stopped being WARcraft, and became MAGEcraft, or Magiccraft, or some stupid snippy pun regarding a favor towards magic rather than war.  And don't worry, this negative review isn't all just about the visceral hatred of high fantasy involving lots of magic.  The game itself has plenty of bad flaws.  I used to love Warcraft. But I hate Warcraft since they made it "Blizzard presents: Magic: The Gathering".  My favorite thing about Warcraft was exactly what they took out in III and World of: a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy. There were no "Thyalawynd" or "Darkheart"s or "Ebonheart"s or "Gyilwind"s magic fantasy crap with gravity-defying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even blood.  There was no "We ah the Knoights of Lothar the Guilywind, son of Gunther the Loinhearted, son of Baxter the Baxton, son of Aragorn of Aragorn, and we foight fo peeeeeace" versus "Graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moves".  Warcraft wasn't like that at all---Warcraft had the Orcs coming into Azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war, and rather than accomodate, the Humans responded with war. And it blew up in their faces as the Orcs destroyed Stormwind Keep and forced the humans into Lothleroin, with the Orcs following. I don't remember what happened after that, but I think eventually the Orcs were beaten back by the Alliance of Humans and Elves.  Then I completely do not remember a single thing about Warcraft III other than Taurens supporting the Orcs for absolutely no reason, and the Undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and Night Elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of Godwynn EverNeverwind P. Dark-Ebonheart.  Warcraft and Warcraft II were to me, the modern Medieval-fantasy equivalent of Conan the Barbarian, in that yes, magic was there, and magic was used, but only the magicians practiced magic, and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion Orc Grunts and Troll Axethrowers.  Sure, then there came Ogre-Mages, Death Knights, Paladins, and the like, but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh, not just magic.  Instead in Warcraft III, and extending into World of Warcraft, magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army.  You can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like, but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeep.  But while magic would become the more central point beyond Warcraft III, War3's focus instead came upon HEROES!  The entire RTS aspect of this game is not fully broken, but rather fractured by not just the inclusion, but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes, who have dozens of hero-only chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them MORE powerful, and they have the ability to LEVEL UP and research MORE abilities and powers.  At least half the missions in the campaign I was apart of either involved playing ONLY as heroes, or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battles.  Then, UPKEEP.  The idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like Total War or in real life.  Upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army.  Upkeep does not exist in traditional RTS games.  In this game, upkeep means "you no longer mine as many resources" when you have too many units.  And "too many" ranges from 50-75 population points taken up.  And then comes the fact that full-army battles are rendered impossible when the average Orc Grunt starts costing THREE population points, and the maximum population is no longer the Blizzard standard of 200, but somewhere near 125-175 or so.  Controlling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather 7 of a resource rather than ten.  Medium upkeep reduces it to 5.  High upkeep reduces it to 3.  And an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their size.  This is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map.  But another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective, the player is basically forced into an arm's race with their opponents, to build up their base technologies, upgrade all they can, then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the 90% of other units available to train, just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thing.  And then again, the RTS idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible, and to hell with all other available units.  This is not how a good RTS works.  Starcraft comes to mind: an army of 30 basic Terran Marines can slaughter an enemy army of Hydralisks or Ultralisks.  An army of 30 Battlecruisers seems unstoppable, and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few Corsairs or Valkyries, or a flood of Scourges.  Or they can be broken up from all-out attack from an Arbiter's stasis, or a Ghost's lockdown.  They can suffer huge splash damage from Psionic Storms from High Templar or Infested Kerrigan.  In short, in Starcraft, every unit is effective if utilized properly.  You can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units, and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the like.  Warcraft III has none of it.  Every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder and/or base defense until that superunit or hero is available for building.  And so what was once "WARcraft" and I so deridingly called "Magecraft" could more accurately be called "Herocraft", because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game, EVEN the skirmishes, as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side.  AND you can get MORE THAN ONE hero on a map, one for heavy combat, one for support, and one for magic.	-1
Campaign mode: Is the best of the game. The graphics are awesome, even better of the own WoW. The campaign explains to you many things of the warcraft universe.  Custom game: One downside the 4 races may seem unbalanced. You need experience in RTS games to win a match, if you are new to RTS games, be ready for a lot of defeats.	-1
I played this game at an online convention.  The food limit was 100, and I had thought this would be reasonable anyway, it wasn't, as I spent about 10 or so workers trying to build up resources, as normally, gold is gathered at +10 per few seconds, and +5 wood per.  Come on! Then most major processes seemed to be a one-at-a-time deal making it take forever to build new buildings, learn new skills, and even just making troops leaving me open to attack.  What really bugged me though was two things: first, you can't gather without your base creating a catch 22 where if it is destroyed you need a base to gain materials to build a new base.  The second is the way food is gathered and done.  It's counterintuitive.  Rather than hunting down critters and expending resources, making food decrease when you breed critters(thereby allowing more troops) you have to operate within a very artificial limit.  And it doesn't seem any way you can dismiss your characters, nor does there seem to be a way to convert (*cough* useless *cough*) workers into fighters, so you have 10 workers hanging about which should be 3-5 fighters. It is an overhyped, overrated game as most of the major problems are addressed in Age of Empires/Myth games (the food, the workers could at least fight, and if your base is destroyed, you just die rather than be humiliated by not having the resources) or the Heroes of Might and Magic games (your hero that uses magic is actually leader of troops rather than someone who just gets killed off along with the rest, and they have wider selection of spells to boot).	-1
Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them "limited" accounts (a recommended "best practice" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to "user-level" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game. Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Warcraft III is an excellent game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation. More information on this issue is available at:   [...]	-1
Blizzards new installment into the warcraft world is an obvious atempt at bringing the worlds of starcraft and diablo into the already chaotic world of warcraft.  The introduction of the hero that can gain experiance points is great for the single player missons but when it comes to a standard multiplayer game I just want to  build up my base and attack when Im ready and not worry wiether or not my enemie has already gotten his hero to level 9 or not.  The graphics sounds animation cutscenes and gameplay are great but the whole idea of heros makes me wanna go see whats on TV.	-1
Three words for this franchise: "Out of gas". Warcraft 1 and 2 were excellent games, however, as with Blizzard's last few outings, this game falls well short of where it should be; offering nothing new or any kind of originality to the RTS genre. In game hero system? Warlords Battlecry 2 does it better... Great graphics? hardly, colorful, cartoonish triangles if anything else...Gameplay? eh.. boring after the first couple missions or so, no new missions of any kind to add life into this genre. Finally, the story is why this game gets one star.. It does have a fairly decent storyline, however, not up to par with some of the other great RPG storylines.	-1
Gamblers have it the worst in the video game department. For every half decent gambling related game that comes out (i.e. Multiplay Video Poker, Real Deal Slots, Slots II), there are twenty released that are complete junk. This is one of them... You play Steve Wynn, in so many words, by taking a poorly run casino and attempting to make it into something spectacular. The concept is great, but the execution is awful. The casinos themselves are poorly-rendered ripoffs of the Luxor, Excalibur, Treasure Island, and Binion's Horseshoe. They even managed to do really creepy looking renditions of Siegfried and Roy (apparently they own the Excalibur in this game.) The only original casino is one that looks like an old 50's style jukebox. So, what machines do you have to choose from? Slots, Video Poker, and Video Blackjack. That's it. What table games do you have? Blackjack and Craps. If you move up the ranks, you'll get Roulette, Pai-Gow, and a Wheel of Fortune table. Wow. The graphics on this game are so generic you really can't tell the difference between slot machines and blackjack machines. The craps tables are only barely distinguishable from the other tables. It's really awful how you supposedly have a variety of slot machines, yet they all look the same. Not that it matters as you can't play any of them and having different machines doesn't affect the game anyway. The gameplay is completely generic. It's a matter of, build enough items and the casino will fill up. I really don't see any advantage of using one machine over another or table games versus machines for that matter. Just dump enough items on the floor and you'll advance to the next level. Exciting, huh? I'll get really nitpicky now. The restaurants and shops you build? Just 2D images you paste on a wall. That's it. You can't go into these "wallpaper" shops or change anything about them (except you're able to offer keno in the restaurants - big deal!) Would it have been so difficult to allow us to adjust the prices on the items we sell? That's just one example. Add the fact the customers all say the same thing over and over and the fact the music is the same song over and over and you get the feeling a lot of corners were cut to rush this game out the door. Supposedly you can adjust how much the pit bosses give out in comps. If that's true, I've never seen anything happen. All they do is stand around and do nothing. (Ok, maybe that part of the game is realistic.) You can view how much cash customers have, but not how much cash they've spent - defeats the whole purpose of giving comps doesn't it? Speaking of which, if you click on a drunk customer he or she will start babbling like a drunk. Give them a comp and all of a sudden the speech sounds normal. Wow, I didn't know comps sober people up. The heavily-accented asian customers say things like "are any of the waitresses for sale?" If I had a politically correct bone in my body I'd think that sounds like a racist stereotype. You can set the house edge on the games to somehow control how much money you collect.  How is this done?  By using a slider bar you set from low to medium to high.  Think about this for a second.  Anyone remotely familiar with gambling (the editor who chopped this section out of my review isn't one of them) knows you can change the odds on a slot machine but you can't change the odds on most table games.  So how do you get more money out of them?  Are you putting a magnet on the roulette wheel?  Are you using loaded dice on the craps table?  I could go on and on, but I think you get my point.  The game is just totally unrealistic and nothing like what's really involved in operating a casino. The best economic sim released recently is Virtual Resort: Spring Break.  If the subject matter doesn't appeal to you and you must have a gambling tycoon game, then search for a copy of Casino Tycoon.  It's better, but not by much.  Better yet, save your money, or come to Vegas and bet it all on red or a hand of blackjack.  Even if you lose you'll have more fun than you will playing this game. Hope the review helped.	-1
First man to rush wins. 12 minute games (MaX).  This would have been a great game two years ago.  Certainly not worth the 60 bucks.  All your paying for right now is HYPE.	-1
WC3 is just another RTS.  The addition of heroes is nice, but (game balance issues aside) isn't enough to make this game feel new and different. If anything, I found WC3 to be a step in the wrong direction.  The single-player campaign is so highly scripted it feels like a Sierra game, where every two minutes the computer takes control away from you and you have sit and watch another cut scene.  The maps are very restrictive, with narrow pathways (you can't walk through wooded areas) channeling you down one or two directions in every level.  This left me feeling claustrophobic. The levels make the game feel more like an old 1D side-scroller than a modern, open-ended "3D" game.  The combination of heavy scripting and tightly constrained levels means there is zero replay value in the single player campaign. If you want a RTS that really has a new and different feel, try Kohan Immortal Soverigns and Kohan Ahriman's Gift.	-1
Blizzard's latest game, WarCraft III, has the momentum to make it one of this year's best selling games; however momentum does not equate to great gameplay.  The idea to take Diablo II and WarCraft, two extremely playable games, and meld them together to form a hybrid seems like an excellent concept.  The problem is that you get the worst of both worlds.  The tedious resource gathering aspect of WarCraft and the micromanagement associated with D2 when you hire a henchman. The graphics requirements are too high for what you get.  Compared to the graphics usage done by games like Neverwinter Nights, WC3 looks like it was written for Nintendo 64.  Blizzard should have stuck with 2D graphics like in StarCraft instead of attempting to utilize 3D.  Make sure your video card can support the game before making the purchase.  Although listed as supported, my Compaq n600c ATI Radeon Mobility video card would not run the game. Note that this card runs NWN, Half-life, and Wolfenstein just fine, all of which make much more use of 3D than this game ever will.  Voodoo 3 cards can run the game, but I found many screen artifacts. Gameplay is repetitive with little strategy.  In the single player mission, there is more cinematic than gameplay.  OK if you want to watch a movie.  Not OK if you want to play a game. Save your money, or spend your cash on a better game like Neverwinter Nights, because this one is a dud.	-1
Bad music, awful handeling, ect. I played Test Drive at my friend's house, and he said it was "a million times better than Grand Theft Auto 3." Devin lied. Here's the comparisens: Grand Theft Auto 3: You can get out of the car and steal other ones. Test Drive: Your stuck in one car the whole time. GTA3: No time limit. TD: Time limit. GTA3: You can run over people. TD: The people always jump out of the way, which gets annoying. GTA3: Radio stations. TD: One [terrible] RAP song playing the whole time. GTA3: Uzis, bazookas, pistols, flamethrowers, grenades,... TD: ...car. GTA3: Awesome control. TD: Horrid control. GTA3: Get it. TD: Don't.	-1
While I only give this game 2 stars, the potential is limitless!  All the games anymore will let you create a player and play a season, sure...How many have cards, stadiums, players and teams to unlock?!?...  Those are some of the goods....Now here's the extreme downfall....The hitting!...  As soon as the pitcher releases the ball, you'd better have the cursor where it belongs.  No, don't look at where you THINK it's going or where it LOOKS like it's going.  Even if the cursor is right where the icon should be, you always end up hitting high.  Like a blink of an eye the ball whizzes to the catchers mitt with little or no time to react.... If it wasn't for the hitting problem, which you'll find alot of people have, not just rookies, this game would be awesome.  Another major downfall is always having a darn Yankee on the cover.  What's the deal with that?!...  If you can find this game for less then $50, pick it up.  Other than that it will sit on your shelf, disappointing you everytime you look at it.	-1
Recently I wrote a rather favorable review of this game, but since that time I have taken it back and replaced it with High Heat Baseball 2003, a game whose graphics are not that great but whose gameplay is hands-down the best around. As I continued to play ASBB2003, I found that there were simply too many bugs in the game to really keep me interested, and some of these downright frustrated the heck out of me.  For example... 1. I played about 60 games of ASBB and during that time had only 1 walk. 2. No matter how big of a lead I would get the CPU would always close the gap in the late innings.  It's as if there was a setting for "keeping the score close." 3. Starting pitchers tire out way too quickly.  I was able to get only 1 starting pitcher to get a complete game.  By the 5th or 6th inning the pitcher would already be in the yellow. 4. When you first turn the game on, you have to navigate through 7 screens in order to load a file.  That's WAAAAAY too many! 5. Countless numbers of over the shoulder catches. 6. The CPU never attempted a pick-off throw to any base. Now this was the one thing that really made me nuts... When a player is injured and is placed on the DL, you can elect to have the computer automatically do it and bring up someone from the minors for you, or you can do it yourself.  I would usually do it myself, preferring to pick the replacement.  When the injured player is able to come off of the DL, you're again given the option to let the computer handle the transaction by choosing the 'AUTO' option.  You'd think that the player coming off the DL would automatically be placed on your roster and the replacement would be sent down to the minors.  But this is not the case.  'AUTO' simply means that the injured player is taken off the DL and placed onto your minor league team.  Even after choosing 'AUTO' you still have to go back and manually switch the player and his replacement to their respective places. NOT ONLY THAT, but you THEN have to go back and reconfigure ALL of your starting line-ups.  The computer does not automatically put the player into his original position or line-up spot.  You have to MANUALLY go back through each batting line-up and put your returning player in his respective slot in the batting order. This was the biggest pain in the neck for me, as this takes some time to do; it's not a short process at all. ASBB2003 was a good effort.  There's a lot of promise with the franchise mode in this effort, but overall, the interface is very cumbersome, the gameplay, while being easy, is not very realistic, and too many oversights with regard to the interface make this game very burdensome to me.	-1
The best baseball game I've ever laid my hands on, but it still has a lot of improving to do.  Due to all the work that I think needs to be done.... it only gets 2 stars from me. For one, game play is difficult. But that's cool. Because that's realistic. Practice. Practice. Practice. A lot of things have been done well. The players come to the plate, and you can tell who they are by looking at their faces. The movements and throws are very realistic. The atmosphere is sharp. The game keeps track of league leaders and league stats. You have a realistic farm team to work with. Send guys down... bring guys up. The thing that thrills me the most is the franchise mode. Very cool. I liked playing PC games more than game system games for that very reason in the past... but times change. Downfalls... AND THERE ARE A LOT!!  There are a lot of animation glitches. Outfielders will wait till the last second and then start to run and make an over-the-shoulder catch almost EVERYTIME. When stealing or outfielders throwing people out at bases, the way the tag looks means nothing. The animation is off. Players will tag the ground on the wrong side of the base and still call guys out. Walks are very rare. I think I've played 35 games and my pitchers maybe have 5 or 6 walks AS A TEAM (note: I just manage). I play in manager mode, because that's more fun for me. Yet, there is no way to pitch-out or pitch around. I get a two-strike count to somebody like Bonds or Sosa... you pitch around, yet there's no way to control that. The manual says L2 & R2 are pitch out and brush back, respectively. NOPE. They're both brush back pitches and brush backs usually make contact. There is no way to do instant replay. There's an automatic instant replay after EVERY play (even pop ups), but there's no way to control it. You can only hit a button to skip it. Finally, and what I think is the most important, is there is no drama in the commentary. You'll crush a long enough to be a homerun down the line that might be.. could be... a homerun, but the computer instantly tells you... foul ball. Too many baseball games soup up the power numbers and I don't care for that.  I'm one of those guys that likes baseball exactly the way it is.  This game does that too, but from what I understand, not as bad as others. Oh, one more thing... the computer changes your lineup without your authorization.  You'll set it, start the game and find that the computer has rearrange things and even started other people.  This severely pisses me off. Despite all that, it's still the best baseball game I've seen.  There's A LOT of work to be done... but this is definately a step in the right direction.	-1
Ok, let me start by saying that this game looks good. The ghosts and the mansion look very creepy. Reminding me of Silent Hill 2 (which I liked). They definetly achieve making you a little jumpy and just pretty much designing a scary atmosphere. So kudos to them for that. (Hence my 2 stars) The gameplay however is terrible. The character's movement is slow and annoying. And her weapon...an antique camera!! Who is the genius that came up with this one. Not only is it a bad idea but they don't even pull it off. Making it very hard to fight ghosts and needlessly tedious. Overall, I give this game 2 stars for the graphics and for the spooky environment. But the gameplay and overall game get zip. If you're really that interested in the idea of this game, then rent it. Don't buy it or you will regret it.	-1
A lot of Survival Horror games get a bad rep. for possessing painfully clunky controls and too much back-tracking, but they all seem to be directed at the wrong games and never at the right game. The right game to blame for the worse controls known to man in Survival Horror gaming goes to one game and if not just this one, then the rest of the franchise that spawned from it: FATAL FRAME.  Tecmo had a lot of unique ideas going through their heads for this game, but apparently the one thing they weren't thinking of was the one aspect that would've made this game worth the constant praise it gets.  Does this make any sense? You're playing the entire game as a nineteen year old girl who walks and runs slower than a drunk elephant. Plus, the controls are permanently in 2D meaning that up will force your character to do a 180 and walk in the direction you point her in. Fine in theory, but you have to realize that using 2D controls in a 3D game based entirely off of exploration and using set camera angles that change every time you move to a different room or fight ghosts is not a good idea.  What's worse is that enemies you face in this game move so fast and use up 99.8% of the terrain to their advantage that it's next to impossible to try and hurt them without taking any damage in return. The ghosts are also so vocal, whiny and badly spoken that their dialogue literally murders any atmosphere they had. Plus, I need to argue: who would be terrified of blue ghost children tromping after you with their arms in the air? It's like the game developers were trying to piss you off rather than scare you.  The game is very innovative and unique what with using a camera as a weapon and fighting ghosts as your main enemy, but facing such unfair, aesthetically awkward, questionably malevolent enemies with such unfair controls is about as fun and scary as being chased by a shag carpet in tennis shoes.	-1
I am a huge fan of survival horror games and this game is just bad. The graphics are quite good and the level designs are very atmospheric but the positive elements stop right there. The gameplay is awful. The character is very slow and your only weapon is a camera, which is not a "unique twist", it is an idiotic idea. It is beyond me how so many people are calling this the scariest game ever. I did not find this game to be even remotely scary. The ghosts are nothing more than annoying. Also, there are way too many of them. I could not finish the game because I ran out of film from being attacked by the same ghost, spouting the same cliched B Movie dialogue every five minutes, which is fine because I was seriously considering just not playing anymore anyway.	-1
I still remember the very first Test Drive game, for DOS.  It had EGA graphics and all you had to do was press the up, left and right arrows, and it was TONS of fun. Later versions of Test Drive for PC added better graphics and better physics, but otherwise remained the same.  This Xbox version is more or less on the same track (no pun intended).  The graphics is good but not much better than the PS2 version.  The gameplay is basically the same -- let's race and outrun the cops! -- although there's a mode ("underground") with a storyline and another where you play the cop and tag the six racers to "arrest" them.  There are four cities to choose from, and a seemingly large number of tracks. What frustrates me about this game is, in the basic racing mode, you have to be #1 to win the race and unlock the goodies.  And this is very difficult to achieve, because the AI competitors are unforgivingly fast (even though at times they seem a little "stupid" as they crash into walls and other cars -- eventually they always beat you).  Plus, it's very easy for you to crash into walls and other cars -- the car physics model is somewhere between arcade and serious simulation -- and if you do this once in a race, there's pretty much no way you can finish 1st; so you'll need start the race over. The designers could have made the game more accessibly by simply allowing a 2nd or 3rd finish, even if that earned fewer goodies.  I played the same tracks over and over again, and after two hours, I simply came to *hate* this game.  It's sad how un-fun the Test Drive series has become. So, in short, PS2-level graphics and difficult gameplay make this game at most a rental title... unless you are a diehard racing sim fan.	-1
As far as driving games go, Test Drive offers nothing particularly compelling.  It sets itself apart from other driving games in that it attempts to wrap a story around the races.  Seeing where this story goes makes for interesting gameplay, but that's about it. The driving itself is pretty fun, with courses ranging from twisting urban environment to rurual settings where you can really open it up.  You have a variety of cars at your fingertips, ranging from classic muscle cars to modern Italian supercars. The biggest downside to the game is that there is no damage model whatsoever.  If you get into a head on at full speed you'll see some impressive physics as the other car goes flying, but no cars sustain any damage.  All you loose is time. Test Drive is worth a rent, but there are better driving games out there for the XBox (such as Burnout and Project Gotham).	-1
I really wanted this game so I bought it and was initialy impressed.  However, the action is mild, and wears off fast, and the camera is only ok.  In general, it's not that good of a game, even though it was criticaly acclaimed.  It's a RTS game with little action and no ability to play the adventure with your own characters.  Overall, forget it.  It's no fun.	-1
This game really upset me. I was looking forward to playing it and the game had some stupid qlitch in it that made it unable to start once I installed it.  BUYER BEWARE! I could not find help for the problem and so I sold the game.  I also read other reviews that the game is good but no real multiplayer, unless you like only one on one battles and no real replayability, I would wait for something better that you can play again and again and it be a new adventure every time.  P.S.- Star Wars Galaxies RPG online- check out the reviews! its not superhero but its better than that... super space heros online.	-1
After being burnt on game after game- Morrowind- Black and White- Civ 3- all highly-touted games that failed to deliver even the slightest degree of gameply enjoyment, I decided to stick my neck out and purchase Freedom force- "what the hey?"  I thought- "The law of averages will eventually yield up a decent game, and I've heard good reviews..."   Needless to say- Burned again!   Freedom force is an abysmal little game- a horrendous, cumbersome interface that makes gameplay confusing and erratic.  Enemies that can run off the edge of the map and attack you at a distance- yet cannot be attacked.  Your "Heroes" might as well be named "Idiot man and Stupid boy", as they will stand idly around at let themselves be attacked and shot at, and not defend themselves.  Graphic glitches out the wazoo.  You have to click on an enemy sometimes as many as four times before your hero will attack...   Seriously- I've been playing video and computer games for 18 years- ever since the first "Ultima" game came out for the apple 2- and I have never seen such an onslaught of inferior products being foisted into the market...   What has happened to the art of game design?  Because from what I can tell, it has died.	-1
This is want I hate about Ubisoft. Ubisoft actually makes bad party games. If you like a party game get Crash Boom Bang for DS. Get Mario Party 9 for Wii. Also get Power puff girls z for dsl.	-1
Average graphics, slow gameplay, insanely shallow dialogue, and cheesy music. Need I say more?	-1
... can only say that it's disappointing. It's not that the games aren't true to the original. They are, they're perfect copies. That is unfortunately where this cart goes wrong. The games look great but the gamePLAY suffers. Of the entire collection only Asteroids can be truly called fun to play. The others scream for their original controllers. Missle Command and Centipede (both orignally trackball games) are at best frustrating and difficult to control. After the first couple of levels on either game, it becomes impossible to keep up. Tempest and Super Breakout originally used a knob controller for smooth movement, Tempest succeeds best in this translation while Super Breakout is so difficult to control you cannot clear a single level. Battlezone? Well, to be fair I always hated Battlezone, this version is o.k. but the computer gets some really easy kills on you and it too becomes unplayable. As for the trivia game, no one should know this much about Atari. You'd have to be Rain Man to know the minutiae involved in this quiz. I really wanted to like this cart...	-1
To slow meaning story. Just not into spending hours trying to learn the action keys. They have taken a video game and tried to make a pc game.	-1
I mean, don't get me wrong... It was a great game for its time, but I am a little disappointed in the game now. But it does the trick here overseas! Thank you for shipping it to me over here!	-1
I bought this game because it had an interesting premise. I was very intrigued at the notion of an action game where the goal is not to kill as many people as possible, but to achieve an objective without anyone knowing you were even there. Great idea. Unfortunately, the result is not so pleasant.  For starters, it is very nearly impossible to complete the missions in the manner the game suggests--quietly, without much unnecessary bloodshed. As an example (and without giving too much away) there is a mission with the objective of sniping a Russian bigwig through the window. You are dropped off at the subway nearby and have to navigate through roadblocks and patrolling guards to set up your kill point in a nearby apartment. Cool idea, right? Expect the sniper gun is stashed in a locker in the bloody subway. That's right. In the middle of the afternoon, in a crowded city subway station. How do you nonchalantly carry a four-foot sniper rifle through downtown St. Petersburg, and not alert any civilians or the dozen or so guards patrolling the neighborhood? Oh, that's right, you can't. Why didn't the shadowy ops who left your gear in the subway not simply leave them in the apartment? Oh, that's right, because its a game and you need an unrealistic challenge. So you're left with two options: blasting your way through every guard post you find, then setting up for your 'stealthy' kill from afar, or leaving the rifle in the locker and attempting the equally ridiculous feat of sniping the Russian with your handgun. Utterly ridiculous.  And let me remind you, before you simply write this off as someone who doesn't want a challenge in the game: this is your FIRST mission.  There is zero margin for error.  Where's the learning curve?  Am I the only one who did not buy the first Hitman?   In yet another level, you are expected to choose your kill point from several different areas, then set it up.  The only problem is that you have no time to case the neighborhood, because the target is only in area for a few minutes.  You have nothing to go on but a cumbersome map interface and some incredibly vague instructions from your employer.  You can't even jump over curbs or low (2 feet high) walls.  This is realism?   Amazingly, despite these glaring discrepancies, this game was touted by its producers--and hailed by consumers--as realistic.  Only in today's video-game driven culture would this in any way be considered realistic.  If the targets were really this hard and they absolutely needed to be taken out (to the tune of a six-figure fee), why wouldn't they just be strafed by a gunship?  Just as stealthy and probably cheaper.  If you like slow, tense FPS' with a lot of atmosphere, than you may like this one. But if incessant replays and unrealistic challenges frustrate you, skip this game.	-1
Im not complaning because it stinks or anything but because of something big. THE GAME DOESN'T WORK ON XP!!!!! I returned it to see if it was my computer that is the problem but it is very common for hitman 2 to crash on windows XP. so if it says "Direct3D : unable to create device. Try changing resolution or color depth" and on XP. Return it immediately. I returned it and got it on Xbox.	-1
Excellent graphics, fast cars.  Problem, I spin out often.  I have been racing NASCAR for 2 years and I have won several championships.  I have been trying to play this game but it won't let me.  I have practiced and practiced to no avail.  I have read the book over and over.  Yet, at any time, any lap, I spin towards the left.  You spin out, go against the wall and that is where you stay.  I usually have post position 1 and I am usually ahead and for no reason, even though I glide into the curve and speed up slowly I still spin out.  You are against the wall and you can only wait for all cars to go by.  From 1st to 43 on one spin.  2003 does not do this.  Computer cars are too agressive.  Yes , they have great crashes, I don't want to crash, I want to win. I am selling my 2004 and 2002.  My fantasy.  Too real for me.	-1
No wonder wwhy this game went to greatest hits so quick. Their are no story lines, confusing moves,and it is practically impossible to beat the game on Kumity mode. If you like fighting games, Get Tekken Games.	-1
yaaa, i dont....fighting games don't entertain me for long...probaly because i never have anybody to play them with..i played this game by myself but could never figure out how to work the ai thingy...i tryed and tryed..never could figure it out...	-1
This game is sooooo boring! The kumite mode goes on forever and you don't get anything! The characters are okay and so are the arenas, but they could be a lot better.	-1
This game totally [stinks]. It's all jaggy and the controls are slow.  There isn't even anything remotely close to a story behind it.  In fact if it didn't have liner notes I wouldn't know why anyone fought.  There aren't any movies at the end or anything.  Basically there isn't any reason at all to play this game.  Tekken tag and DOA2 are WAY better...	-1
I do not know if the product works or not. My son has an xbox 360 and it keeps saying in order to play I have to update and I have no ideal how to do that	-1
This item does not work with my xbox at all - says I need a hard drive storage - and I also did not realize that even if it did work it was only for one player	-1
Let's face it...Counter Strike fans will give this game high ratings no matter what. True die hard CS players like myself laugh at the weak attempt that was made in Condition Zero. If you have played Counter Strike, you will be disappointed. If you have dial-up or cannot access the internet...I still cannot recommend this game unless the price goes below $20. Save your money, buy Unreal Tournament 2004 and download some of the weapons mods and conversion mods available for free. The enemy AI is mind bendingly awesome and will humble you quickly. Plus, you get a more dynamic game that constantly changes and is very dynamic. Condition Zero is stale, repetitive, the enemy AI is predictable, the objectives are stupid - example, you must rescue 5 hostages and kill a terrorist with the sniper rifle. Ok fine...but see how hard it is to rescue 5 hostages when your computer AI teammates keep killing the terrorists and finishing the level before you can rescue any hostages at all! I had to let the terrorists kill my guys on purpose just to get around this problem!	-1
So, we were first told about Counter-Strike: Condition Zero back in 2000, when Counter-Strike was still a GOOD multiplayer gamer, not ridden with as many hackers, and definitely not flooded with annoying high-pitched kids telling eachother off through the voice chat feature. As you would expect from my anger witnessed in the above paragraph, I stopped playing the game. I waited and waited to get CS:CZ, the messiah of the Counter-Strike title. So, it just so happens that the game gets pushed back a few months, and then to the next year, and then the year after that. After a while, I lost interest in the game and just assumed it would never come out; I was wrong. So, out of no where, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero appears on the shelves of game stores everywhere -- and at a pretty unbelievable price! What's there to lose? I picked up a copy and ran home with it -- ditched my important work I had to finish at home and saved it for later, now it is Counter-Strike time! I load it up and what do I get? Well, first, for all you Linux users, it was VERY hard to get emulating correctly on WineX. If you are a Linux user and a member of the WineX community, look at the message boards because there are now posts on how to get the game running correctly. So, once I get my emulation problems out of the way, I was up and running with my game. Impressed? No, I wasn't even close to impressed. Graphics haven't improved even close to what I would have expected them to in this day and age. New content? A little: You get a few different weapons, some fixed bugs, a few new multiplayer maps, and a single player addition to the game. So, on with the single player: It's awful. And unlike many games such as Unreal Tournament 2003, graphics were NOT saving this gameplay fault. It's not very easy to explain really, but all you do is play the role of a counter-terrorist leader trying to take down a terrorist organization from committing random acts of crime. No depth to this story here, this is no Max Payne. Overall, the single player is not a great addition to this dying mutliplayer title. Could anything, oh ANYTHING save this game from getting one star? Something sure did save it! Multiplayer, something I haven't got into yet, is a bit out of the ordinary for Counter-Strike players. First, it DOES NOT use that AWFUL 'steam' program to connect to servers. Thank god. Second, it has implemented a nice little feature that STOPS HACKING ALMOST COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT!! Thank you for this, because the cheaters on Counter-Strike ruined the game for everyone, and this is the one feature of the game that I thought was worth the four-year wait. However, not much has changed at all as far as GAMEPLAY goes in the multiplayer version of this game; still your plain ol' terrorist vs. counter-terrorist game trying to defuse the bomb or rescure the hostages or whatever. And a note: if you hate Counter-Strike like I do for the same REASONS that I do (the ANNOYING, and IMMATURE players, especially all the little children with terrible net-ediquet), you will NOT be satisfied in this game. Why? Oh, simply because there's MORE of them in the Condition Zero game over the original game. Don't blow your money on this game as an excuse to leave the terrible playing environments found in the original, because this is no sollution in Condition Zero. So, this game isn't technically advanced (in the areas of video OR audio), this game isn't offering a very stellar single player game, and the multiplayer game can be found with the FREE version of Counter-Strike minus a little of the non-friendly environments. What good is this game? Beats me.  Overall, this game would have earned maybe three stars or MAYBE even four stars had it come out on time. But honestly, we DID NOT wait four years to get a game of such low quality. Don't waste your money on this game. There's better games to be bought for this price range. You can try Max Payne 2, a great single player game. Or you can try out the warcraft series, a game I LOVE in the multiplayer scene. For a little bit more money, Unreal Tournament 2004 is possibly one of the best multi AND single player games I have EVER played in my LIFE. These are better options that will keep you occupied when you're bored and feel the need to play a video game. Don't buy this. I hope my review has helped many concious-buyers out there :)	-1
(1)Cheating is such a problem that if you want to play this game then hopefully the single player mod will be good or else just play it on a LAN with friends. The internet on-line games are rife with cheating. Sometimes more than 50% of the players are using aimbot and wallhack and even the anti-cheating software is no good against them. Be prepared to be slaughtered if you do not cheat. (2)Valve have done nothing to curb this problem and they have even managed to get the code for HL2 leaked so cheating is going to be rife again. (3)They keep pushing the dates forward by 6 months or more which makes fans very unhappy. Anyway bottom line is the single player is all this going to be worth. The multiplaying arena is full of cheating and I would certainly NOT pay for a game that can not combat cheating. It should stay free until they can resolve the cheating exploits once and for all. Cheating ruins this game. It is like getting scores of 0 kills 52 deaths and the guy doing it all is like 60 kills 1 death. Is that worth your money?	-1
Feel sorry for anyone trying to pull off high scoring combos with the X-Box controller. Expect to throw your controller frequently.	-1
I really loved Unreal.  I'm also really impressed by Unreal Tournament 2003.  But I cannot believe what a poor product Unreal II: the Awakening is.  While I can see that they needed to give you more storyline than previous FPS games, I simply find the characters boring, the dialogue pretty trite--yes, even for a macho First-Person Shooter--and the gameplay terrible.  The animated cutscenes, while pretty, tend to go on too long and usually involve a long shot of a ship landing or docking, or someone walking up a staircase. It's really like UT2003 and Unreal II were built on 2 different engines:  they play like night & day on my system, a pretty decent PIV 2.0GHz, 400MHz FSB, with 1GB of RAM.  Movement is sluggish, weapons work so-so, and although Unreal II gives you the ability to "vault up" onto those crates and boxes that are so hard to negotiate in other FPS games, you still feel like you're wearing weights on your ankles.  I can play at any resolution or level of settings and the gameplay is the same. There's also bad cropping of the map - I've run across "invisible walls" that are in the middle of walkways, enemy combatants that get wedged into the landscape and jog in place, and objects that look as realistic as any 4-year-old FPS from the days when PIII was cutting-edge. I'd suggest you consider Unreal Tournament 2003 (and playing as one player with a lot of bots if you want a single-player game) instead of trying to slog through the poor performance of this game.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 4 is that teams of AI bots tend to behave better than the bots in the original Unreal.  This doesn't redeem the game, but it makes me see that they tried to bring something to the sequel.	-1
Okay, first of all, I've got to say that I love the graphics in the game, but that is probably its only redeeming quality as far as I'm concerned. I have listed my multiple beefs with Unreal II as follows... 1.) Storyline has nothing to do with the end of the first Unreal. 2.) John Dalton (your character) moves waayyyy too slow. It's almost like he tiptoes his way into battle. 3.) There are only about 8 or 9 levels altogether. The first Unreal had 39 levels (not including the intro and ending sequences). 4.) What happened to the rest of the enemies of Unreal 1? Most of the enemies in Unreal II are human (boring). I want my Krall, my Titan, my SkaarjGunner, my Brute, my Gasbag, my Devilfish, my SkaarjGunner, My SkaarjBerserker, my SkaarjWarrior, my Skaarj.... 5.) TOO MUCH BABYSITTING - I hate waiting for other characters in a game while they sit around doing their thing. 6.) There was no "Boss" which took about 70 or 80 rockets to kill, like in the first Unreal. Where's the sense of accomplishment? 7.) Where are my powerups? Why is that such a bad thing? 8.) Why did they even use the name, "Unreal" with this game? So there were a couple of Skaarj from the first game and the dispersion pistol (which cannot be upgraded - bummer) was available. Big deal. There is little resemblance to the original game. I know that the makers of the game wanted Unreal to "evolve" and to give it a different storyline, but they didn't have to ruin the game like this. 9.) You cannot skip the cinematics. Why can't you just hit the mouse button if you don't want to wait for people to finish talking? And why do you have to wait for Aida to take her sweet time to waltz from one computer to another? Why can't you just skip the debriefings altogether? Boy, what action this game has! Bottom line: If it weren't for the excellent graphics, I wouldn't even give this game 1 star. Here's to all the newest games with all your polygons and polident and whatever else it is that makes great graphics. I think I'll stick to the original Unreal which has been out for almost 6 years now, thank you very much.	-1
My initial reaction to this game was that of annoyance - I wanted to start playing, but couldn't, because I had to wade through several minutes of unnecessary speech. I assumed this would be temporary, but no - the non-skippable "cinematics" and speeches are a painful part of this game. That said, to call Unreal 2 a sequel would be an insult to the original - Unreal being a great game, from both visual and entertainment perspective. The new levels are good looking, but, like many have noted, short, linear and non-expansive. Compare this to the first Unreal, in which every level was large and varied. In addition, levels in Unreal connected very well together, and the bits of information pulled from electronic diaries were enough to understand the plot of the game; while Unreal 2 is quite the opposite - after every level you end up on the mother ship and have to take off to another planet (if you can sit through another boring "briefing" by someone who looks more like a Playboy Playmate than a member of military personnel). Yes, Unreal 2 is very good looking, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it should be a shooting game, and not a sad attempt at a half-arsed RPG. People shouldn't have to sit through 5 minutes of speeches just to start the stupid game - it's a shooting game for god's sake, not Final Fantasy. This game does have some redeeming qualities - the weapons are very interesting, for one thing. The levels are also different from one another visually. Also, the idea of having extra firepower on hand (Marine assistance) is fun every now and then. And... sorry, I can't think of anything else. The rest are cons - long, winded speeches about nothing in particular, weak plot, extremely long loading times (even for a machine less than a year old), linear gameplay (very little freedom) and restricted level structure. The game is also painfully short - it really can be finished in the matter of hours. I managed to actually finish it on my work computer within a week, playing half to an hour a day. The original Unreal was very impressive, as it ran circles around Quake, visually. While this one looks nice, it lacks serious innovation. Sure, the poly counts are higher, but what else? Not much, apparently.	-1
I'm really torn as I write this review, on the one hand I had so much fun beating this game, but on the other hand, its just isn't worth its price tag. The graphics are the best out there today but this comes at an extremely high cost, I own an extremely high end system and it chugged pretty bad some places. When it comes to first person shooters for me the main fun is in the weapons, and this game has no lack of weapons.  While a lot of the weapons are kinda [weak] and could be done without, some of them are just plain cool.  I personally loved the very last weapon in the game although a bit overpowered.  Some of the weapons could have been more balanced but you certainly have a wide variety to choose from. I have heard mised things about the AI, while I didn't pay much attention to thne AI I've heard it is extremly good however it can't live up to its potential because of the restricting corridors that plague the game. This game is full of action and most of the time you won't have trouble finding where to go.  This is the way I like a game. However it just...ends, I beat the game in 5 days and I wasn't by any means playing through it nonstop...I can't justify the price tag without a multiplayer mode. Fun while it last but not enough.	-1
Playing Unreal 2 has got to be one of the most tedious gaming experiences I ever had since I played Hunters: The Reckoning for Xbox. The plot seems like something right out of some Scfi Tv show. You are an ex-marine on a ship with a crew, you get missions from one of the crew members, and you're on your way. Dalton(the guy you play as) says the most stupidest things I ever heard. The graphics are great, but the level design looks like it was inspired by Star Wars. I almost fell asleep while playing the second level called "Hell." Why it's called "Hell" is beyond me because the level is on a snowy planet. You battle these giant bugs. Why introduce these new creatures? Why not just give us the Skaarj? You get to see them on the first level, along with "Space Monkeys," but the awesome atmosphere that the original Unreal had was missing. Here's another thing, no multiplayer. Soldier of Fortune 2 had tedious single-player, but the multiplayer component made the game worth buying for alone. I know they didn't intend for Unreal 2 to have multiplayer but if it did,  it would have probably better then the single-player portion. Folks, do yourself a favor and pick up these awesome titles: Unreal Gold, Unreal Tournament 2003, Half-life, Soldier of Fortune 2(for multiplayer only!) I never even finished Unreal 2, and I don't intend to either. I'm just going to wait until a cool mod is released and at least I'll have Unreal 2 to play it.	-1
I am very impressed with the graphics.  The problem with this game is the lack of content.  It is a frenzy of mindless carnage--just shoot shoot shoot.  Like Serious Sam on steroids.  To take a beautiful graphics engine such as this and use it to produce adolescent rubbish is a crime against technology.	-1
the gfx might be good.... but what good are realistic graphics when the gameplay stinks? This game has amateur-game-studio written all over it.... There is only one way to beat every level! that makes it basicly a walk-through interactive movie with linear advancement... gets very boring and doesnt require intuitive or logical thinking on the part of the player. After playing games like deus ex or nolf/nolf2, which had excellent story as well as multiple ways to complete each level, a game like unreal2 is a joke. plus there are lengthy loading screens about every 5-10 mins of play....and im on a p4-2.26ghz with 1GB of pc4200 and it takes 1min+ to load levels! I mean max payne had nearly as good gfx in unreal2, but had much shorter loading screens and they were few and far between.... and not to mention in unreal2 u must wait 1min+ just to quick load after you die... it really tests your patience. on another note, the reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the introduction movie/ingame cinematic (with studio logos) actually puts you in awe... very breathtaking..... but from there on out the game goes downhill. also, for people experiencing crashes.. there is a patch out that fixes it.. i had the same problem (i had to disable EAX) but after patch i can now enable it again and the game runs fine. -------------------------------- overall.... this game is a waste of money.. it belongs in a jewel case on the "value shelf". -duck	-1
It seems to be a trend in the video game world to make a game that has little or nothing to do with the original. Such is the case with Unreal 2.  The original Unreal was an interesting game for a few reasons.  In the course of the story you were dumped into an alien environment that was hostile and wondrous at the same time.  Nothing was explained to you and you were left to your own devices to figure out the world. It was a story idea that works very well with first person shooters. Now quiet a few years later we are given Unreal 2.  A game that has little or nothing to do with the original.  One gets the impression that the developers decided to buy the rights to the name to push an otherwise boring game idea. Nothing original is done here.  The story is boring and totally pointless.  This is nothing new in the first person shooter gender but it seems pointless to keep doing things we have all seen before.  So like all first person shooters before we look for the innovations.  Something that sets the game above the rest of the pack.  Playing the game I could not find it.  The graphics are quiet nice but the level design only get interesting at the end of the game. Since this game is a true single player game it's over way too fast and the replay value is pretty much zero. It's sad to see a original game like Unreal turned into a game that will be totally forgotten in a very short time.  It's a shame really because the game is NOT bad but just not as good as it could have been.  A different story line, something closer to the original and less goofy.	-1
as expected, Unreal 2 has some pretty nice graphics and environs. each world is nicely done and filled with ambient wildlife, great lighting, colors, textures, all that stuff. unfortunately, Unreal 2 is anything but. gameplay is very uninspired and trite. it's more of the same: move linearly from point to point, blow up a few baddies, press a switch, go to another point, get blocked from main route, find some alternate route, kick more butt, ad infinitum. occasionally, you'll need to protect a scientist or fight with a couple of marines, but those moments are rare. the only refreshing feature is the use of turrets and laser shields. a few times, you will need to strategically place them to defend your position from overwhelming enemies. unfortunately, their usefulness is limited and you will find yourself out on the field doing much of the work. one of the things i enjoyed about this game is weapon selection. sound effects are nicely done and you can feel a noticeable punch when you fire. there's no useless weapons--each weapon is ideal for a given situation and there are two firing modes. you've got a gun that shoots spiders(?); sniper gun with a scope that really zooms up close; grenade launcher with several different types of grenades; powerful shotgun that has an alternate firing mode that blasts your enemies on fire; and finally, my favorite, the ultimate weapon that fires mini-blackholes and sucks in your opponents. you are taken from mission to mission on different planets in your small space cruiser. this could have been a nice touch, but it's poorly implemented. the ship is merely used as a device for useless briefings and conversations with your three crewpeople that move the story along. like the story, the conversations are linear as well and frequently consist of 1) yes 2) no. there are no conversation chains; just a number for each 'tell me about' subject. much more could have been done with the ship. for instance, it seems as if the whole galaxy is after these relics that you are collecting and (anyone notice?) for some reason the ship is never in any danger while you freely roam the galaxy. some space battles or anything other than the usual FPS faire would have been nice. watch a few cheesy science fiction movies or games and you'll see where Unreal 2 gets its plot. as suggested earlier, you need to recover all 7 pieces of some ancient powerful artifact. regarding your mission, there's hints of a conspiracy and things are not what they seem. come on! don't insult our intelligence here. hasn't this sci-fi theme been played out enough already? AI is about the same as in Unreal. player movement is very slow (must be the power armor) and it's hard to dodge the highly accurate fire from your enemies. you spend lots of time running behind cover instead of jumping around and running circles around your opponents. no multiplayer. these days, this is inexcusable. of course, in the future, they'll probably sell a multi-player add-on for 30 bucks. sigh. game looks beautiful and runs smoothly at a nice framerate on my mid-high end system (P4 2000, Geforce 4600). though, i've heard some people have had problems with it crashing. music is not bad, but not memorable either. finally, the worst thing about this game is that an average player can complete this in 1-2 days. with no multiplayer, there's no replay value other than the next difficulty setting, but what fun is that when the missions are all the same? if you really want this game, you should rent it, wait until it hits the bargain bin or get it through other means. overall, a true FPS fan will enjoy Unreal 2 for a few days. players who enjoy this genre but are looking for something new or something unreal will be very disappointed; this is just by-the-book FPS.	-1
I kind of like "Gun Valkyrie", but after watching a number of friends and especially kids play it, I have to warn against spending $ on it.  Two reasons: 1.  The controls for flying/jumping are over-complex, and several missions cannot be completed without this move, so you get stuck, and ultimately bored. 2.  You cannot save DURING a mission, so if you get bored with trying the same jump over and over, you will have to go back to the beginning of the mission if you don;t want to leave your XBOX running all night.  This, IMHO is the biggest single mistake ANY manufacturer can make with a video game... As I said, I kind of enjoy the game, and my more dextrous gamer buddies have little problem with the controls, but a majority of "casual" gamers that I have watched play, get frustrated and even angry with the game.  So I would have to recommend against buying it.	-1
This very arcade-like game gets it's inspiration from Sega's own classic Space Harrier and it's story line directly from the animated 1990's Giant Robo series. A strange doctor discovers a new power source that radically advances society but mysteriously disappears thereafter. This review was re-written after many hours of gameplay and will highlight some of the frustration experienced five or six levels into the game.  Out of the box it's a good looking Robotech shooter, however, just start playing it awhile and you will see how this game can riddle you with anger.  If you thought playing Gotham Racing  almost broke your controller you will bash it to splinters with this one. Gameplay is teasing and very demanding. This is a jumping game first and shootem up second. More times than not you will find yourself just BARELY missing a critical jump to a ledge only to start again from the very very bottom of the board.  For that unfun characteristic, two stars get taken off an otherwise 4 star rating. Throughout the terrain you will find obvious surfaces you should be able to land on but can't. It's like a literal glass ceiling where waterfalls and vehicles are to look at  but can't walk under or land on. Not being able to save inside a 30 minute long mission means you will have to repeat your failures over and over again.  I'm surprised when they were doing the QA they failed to notice testers smashing the controllers and throwing their arms up in frustration because all of your progress can be lost with the slightest twitch. The control over your movements can be compared to a pinball bouncing  off rubber bumpers, your uncoordinated movements are like mere flippers keeping the ball on a wild course. The spastic nature of the jet pack will have you screaming at the TV.  I compare the sensation to trying to land a hot air balloon on a moving car. They made this game way too hard and the level designers were way out of touch with what the character is capable of physically doing.	-1
This game's a pile garbage!  The developers claimed that they wanted to create a game that lived up to the true innovation of real-life backyard wrestling.  Well if this game's any indication of what backyard wrestling's really like, forget it.  I rented this game the other day from my local video store.  After playing about 5 minutes horrendous gameplay, I soon felt that I was ripped off out of the money I paid to rent this garbage (thank goodness for rentals).  Here are some major downfalls of BW: The character models are poor. When characters talk, the mouths don't even move. Computer AI is extremely cheap. Computer has almost 99% perfect accuracy when picking up & throwing weapons from a distance at you, they almost never miss. Create-Character-Mode is cheap beyond cheapness. Replay value isn't great (after unlocking all the characters after one sitting, what's the point?). Especially creating characters.  The worst part of the game.  Fans of WWE Create-a-character modes will be woefully disappointed.  The player can't even create a character from scratch, all they can do is select a pre-made character and mobilize their stats and fighting style.  You can't even develope the character's costume.  All you do is choose a costume that has already been made (imagine playing a fighting game as your favorite character and choosing a different costume for them to fight in, that's technically all you can do).  There aren't even many move to choose from for your character.  Yes the game does have it's strong points such as taking full advantage of the X-box's custom soundtracks system, and there are some nice videos to watch in the media room (some of which have to be unlocked).  However, is it really worth playing through, just for videos?  What's worst is that the game doesn't even play like a wrestling game.  It plays more so of that as a button-mashing fightng game.  Take it from me, there are plenty of better wrestling games out there (I really feel for those who poured out their fifty bucks of hard earned cash on this title).  And to those considering buying BW, avoid this title at all costs.  Even WWF RAW is better!	-1
Tetris is awesome. I could play that time waster all day - but something is amiss with this game and it manages to make me not want to play.  It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to Tetris by adding strange "creatures" that speak a more annoying version of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.  I think the real reason is that they just botched it. Its Tetris in some ways but there's just something off about it.	-1
Ok here's the game in short and sweet terms. WEAK! I don't even begin to understand how some people say its another classic game like Baldurs Gate or Gauntlet. its NOTHING like them, and for Titus to market it as an RPG is just plain rediculous. This has no adventuring of ANY kind although you can customize and power up your guy along the way, but the repetetive and boring combat just doesnt make up for it in the least. IF you rent this game play it with a friend or two, that is the ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Otherwise don't waste your time with it.	-1
Why did titus software ruin this game. This game could have had a real plot. This a not an rpg this is a fighting game in which you gain levels for winning a battle. If you want to buy this game wait a year so it will lower down to [$$$} because it is not worth anything more than that. I am 13 and I could have designed this game better. But im not going to blame just Titus and say this game could have done better if someone else made it like THQ or EA. Most companies have been slacking off. I have played so many games that could have been made a different way or had some flaws in them. I think teens my age should be able to make these games.  After all we are the ones that play these. Well If you want some Ps2 rpg recommendations I can only think of two: Baulders Gate Dark Alliance( a little short but fun nontheless) and Gauntlet Legends Dark Legacy. Oh and if you want to hear of a good fighting game on Ps2  get Tekken Tag Tournament or you can wait for MK deadly alliance. Well I hope this review helps. ...	-1
The only good part of this game was the graphics.  After 1/2 hour of play, I completely lost interest.  No replay value, and a waste of money to buy or rent.  The other reviewers must work for the company that made this God-awful game.	-1
It's The Simpsons in a... skateboarding game? I thought it was pretty strange myself, but I guess it was brought onto the market because of how big The Simpsons are and how big skateboarding it. Sounds like a great match, of course, for me being a Simpsons fan and a skateboarding kid. Well it wasn't. The graphics were not good even for the cartoony look they had, the control was absolutely terrible, every trick wasn't fun to look at, the level design wasn't good, the lines characters say is repetetive, and there is just not a lot of characters to play as. I am a gigantic Simpsons fan, but that does not mean I like the video games. ( except Hit and Run and Road Rage. ) I definitely think you should pass this one up, everything about it is bad, which means NOTHING about it is GOOD.	-1
*sigh*.  This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played.  I went back to the video rental store and demanded for my money back after playing this...  If you have ever played Tony Hawk, then you will notice that the moves are opposite and slow.  If you haven't played Tony Hawk, get that instead.  If you have played Tony Hawk, run away from this game!	-1
I'm seeing a disturbing trend in games featuring the Simpsons. First there was "Simpson's Road Rage" which was Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters, which was half decent. But when they tried to apply the Simpsons to the Tony Hawk formula, they fell flat on their face, much like you will find youself doing quite often if you play this game. The controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable. The physics will not allow you to do what you'd like to do, making many of the goals completely unrealistic. The only thing this game has going for it are its graphics. Bottom line: If you are going to buy this game, make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the controls, because otherwise you will put it down after fifteen minutes and never have a desire to play it again. If you are a big fan of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series and big Simpson's fan, do not buy this game thinking you will get the best of both worlds because you will be very disappointed.	-1
The simpsons is one of the weirdest shows. they just got even worst. This game is also way too hard. The simpsons should be taken off the air so should all the other adult programs. Now the charecters sware even more, they get into more trouble unpurpis, and they just got evenb more violent.	-1
Yes,I like watching the simpsons on tv,no I do not like playing simpsons video games cause they're horrible! This has been going on since 8bit nintendo,and developers still can't make a decent simpsons game. If they really wanted to make a great simpsons video game,then they should release the original simpsons arcade game(the one you had to pop quarters into) on a console. I don't know why that hasn't been done yet,cause THAT was a simpsons game I had a blast playing esp. when 4 people could play at the same time! As for simpsons skateboarding,a big thumbs down!!	-1
Let me start by saying that I am a comic book fan, and I know my super heroes.  I was looking forward to this game ever since I heard about it, and I was extraordinarily disappointed when I played it.  Now, let me also say that this game is very beautiful.  The graphics are amazing, but everything else is completely mediocre, and most of the time just plain bad.  The biggest complaint one can muster is of the control scheme.  Seeing as how the controls drive the entire game, this tends to ruin the experience.  Amazingly stiff controls and not-at-all-innovative use of gadgets plague this title.  You try to punch a guy and you get shot by a hail of bullets, which causes you to fall to the floor every time, so you can't fight back.  This is on the first level mind you.  You try to execute a move and the camera suddenly switches directly in front of you, thus reversing controls and making you miss.  You try to jump, but the controls are so stiff and unpolished that you only go straight up.  Now, assuming you have enough skill and attention span to get past the horrible fights that occur every few seconds and get to a boss fight, you won't win.  Not for a long time anyway.  If you do, congratulations, you play too many video games.  The very first boss- Black Mask- totes double magnums.  You come near him- which is necessary to defeat him- and you get pulverized with three or four shots.  This doesn't even scratch the surface of the problems with this game.  Let's move onto the story.  I'm sure you've heard all this garbage about Final Fantasy's Kenji Terada.  Well, looks like he lost his touch.  You'll find more originality in a James Bond movie.  The plot goes something like this:  Evil, evil people have conjured up an evil-satellite-death-ray and are planning to take over the world, but "he" is going to stop them.  Make sure you don't forget to try and be dramatic by emphasizing "he" and "him" instead of saying "Batman."  You wouldn't want to sound normal.  Well, I've said enough.  Don't buy it.	-1
Unfortunately, I was one of those idiots who bought Gamecube over PS2. I bought SSB:M, Rogue Leader, THPS3, Spy Hunter, and Cel Damage. Spy Hunter is the worst game of them all! The levels are too dark. The graphics on the otehr hand aren't that bad. The weapons are too limited. The movies are horrible, especially the Saliva one! I bought this game knowing nothing about it. I regret I spent the [money] or so on this "game". The Multiplayer mode isn't fun at all. They need a deathmatch or something! I don't find killing a bunch of chickens fun (though I do find it quite amusing)! Trust me, this game is a total waste of money, no exceptions.	-1
I rented this game an couple of weeks ago, and was EXTREMELY dissapointed. The graphics are sloppy and the car handles like a 30 year old junker form the junkyard. It slides around on turnes, and accelerates very poorly. For some "super souped-up" spy car, it isn't very impressive. The gameplay is poor, and the weapons control is hard to learn between guns and defensive weapons. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  The movies between levels are very bad and OVERALL: 3/10	-1
Those 3 words are- sloppy,stupid, and ugly. After playing this game, I am so happy that I bought 007 instead. As you know both are ports of ps2 games, with one major difference- james bond has actually been improved on, and spy hunter has been cut up. It is an extremely sloppy port from the ps2 version. Graphics just plain stink, pretty much no real damage to anything at all, and it gets boring faster than the levels can load. There are driving levels on james bond, and, sad to say, they are better than this whole game! And you get to shoot suff and have multiplayer. But seriously, on the driving 007 levels there is real damage and all the weapons and gadgets of spy hunter, so just get it and have fun running into ped cars.	-1
After releasing the great Spiderman Mysterio's Menace for Gameboy Advance, I thought that this would be a similar and great game, instead Spiderman "the Movie" lacks any complexity and diversity. You are of course Spiderman armed with a few punches; uppercuts, wall clinging and limited web slinging ability (you actually need to find a building in web slinging distance), and finally wall clinging. As for Spiderman's other tricks like a web shield, web bullets and webbing bad guys those are special items that you need to pick up in order to have them! There are unfortunately no maze levels providing simple straightforward game-play against dozens of enemies per level. After every two levels a villain steps forward to challenge Spiderman. Unfortunately because this game is based on the movie, there are less than stellar villains. The Vulture and the Scorpion were never hit villains. The story itself for the game is very watered down compared to other Spiderman games, and the interludes are not comic strips or animated in anyway, instead its Spiderman talking. Something that does add to the playability of the game is the fact that you can actually take pictures by pushing the select button and you can view them at the end of each stage. This game is a letdown.	-1
Much of what I'm about to say has probably been covered by others, but I'll try my best to make things concise.  This game could have been quite good, but unfortunately has major flaws that make it more annoying than anything else. I found some difficulty with the controls.  While all games require an adjustment period to get used to the new controls, these are combersome no matter what.  To turn your character around you must actually walk him around in a circle, which can be quite difficult (and deadly) especially when getting attacked.  While other games have a rotate button for fighters in 3D environments, this does not. Next I found the cut-scenes to be horrible.  Not that the voice acting or animation were bad at all, but rather that you can't skip over them with a press of a button.  Obviously if you're into a game, you'll want to watch a scene once to follow the story.  But it's just too much to take when you reach a difficult point in the game and get killed only to have to watch the same 5 minute cut-scene over and over again until you figure out how to beat the particular situation. Lack of problem solving is another issue.  Why have a mature rated game with child level problem solving?  All problems are obvious and usually only take a couple of minutes to solve at the most.  The majority have a flashing beacon over the objective so you know exactly where you need to go and there's always only one very obvious solution to the problem. Finally, the gameplay just gets old.  I suppose because the rest of the game is so annoying that you just get tired of dealing with the same old thing.  There are difficult controls that once mastered make it easy to beat all enemies.  Tiresome cut-scenes that seem to never end and problems that are all to easy to solve.  And let's not forget the animation that causes many enemies (and some much needed weapons) to fall halfway or all the way through walls and floors.  I was amazed to see that enemies will end up buried halfway into walls or stairs simply because that's where they landed rather than bouncing.  If I didn't know any better I would think that this game had been made 5 years ago.  This last problem is a programming error (or laziness) that there's simply no excuse for. In the end, rent this game if you have to, but don't buy it.	-1
It's ok, nothing spectacular, and it feels a bit tried. A bit old. It features no new game play that takes advantage of the added muscle of the next generation systems; it seems contrived, essentially like a Playstation (one) game that has been rejigged with better graphics. Eidos has been bereft of new ideas for a while now, and the trend continues. One example, in a tavern in the early part of the game, I quickly disposed of all of the local townspeople, but could still hear the chatter and the talk of the crowd. Hey, there's nobody around. The AI needs work, since in many cases; some of the townsfolk can see the brutal murder and blood sucking of one of their "friends", as they continue to chat among themselves as if nothing happened. Come on guys. Also, block puzzles. Block puzzles? Seems like somebody doesn't have any new ideas. Finally, I have read that the Xbox version "is the only version" that comes with real time shadows. However, as you walk around a light source, close then further away, you would expect to see your shadow loom larger or smaller depending on your position. But in the game, nothing. Seems like a case of bad execution. The story is two-dimensional, doesn't offer a lot of suspense, and is essentially straightforward with no real twists. The voice acting, as usual in this series however, is superb. Not a horrible game, but just more of the same. I would strongly recommend Max Payne over this if your interested in this genre. If you've played that, then I would just keep waiting for some new ideas. This is not what we were looking forward to.	-1
dont waste your money completing the collection just isn't worth suffering even a minute of this POS.... horrible graphics horrible voice acting. buggier than you can imagine. its too late for me ive already bought it and now cant sell it but its not too late for you save yourself leave this page before you get sucked in by the blood omen reputation. i know the other games are classics but this one blows.i would give it 0 stars but it won't let me.	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT'S A DEFINITE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and in the end it's a game controller thrown across the room. Especially when you have to beat the bosses!!This is the end of the line for eidos games for me!!!!!! If you love eidos and you play this eidos game YOU WILL NEVER WANT ONE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!Fair warning "DON'T PLAY THIS EIDOS GAME" just clear it from your mind.(PS,it is fun at first until you get to a boss stage that is.)	-1
This series keeps getting worse.  The first game, for the PS1, was good.  The second in the series, Soul Reaver, was fairly entertaining.  The third, Soul Reaver II, was so-so, but far too short.  Blood Omen II is just plain bad.  On the plus side, the urban feel of the level design is a nice change from the rest of the series where the developers focused more on ancient ruins, canyons, and forests.  On the down side, game play is sluggish, at best.  The controls are not responsive, making fight sequences tedious.  The dialog during the cut scenes is totally off.  I don't mean by a second or two, I'm talking about voices coming from the wrong characters.  Sometimes the soundtrack is nonexistent.  On top of that, ambient sounds have a tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating themselves over and over, drowning out every other sound.  The only remedy is to restart the game.  I have also had some problems with the graphics.  On occasion, when I enter a new area, the entire screen, aside from Kain, goes blank.  Once again, the only effective remedy I have found is to restart the game.  I've used other discs on my console, so I know my system isn't on the blink.  Last, but not least, this game suffers from the curse of mandatory cut scenes.  I'm tired of having to sit through long, drawn out movies with no bypass option every time I replay a section of the game.  I really wish I could give this game a better review, seeing that the developers must have put some sort of time and effort into making it, but I can't	-1
This game was simply a waste of potential.  I am glad I rented this game first,because after completion, I had no further desire to play it again. This game portrays the vampire sub-culture in a very cool way.  The story was entertaining, but the voice acting is where the game really shines.  I sometimes want to play the game again just because of the great dialog.  UInfortunately the gameplay is terrible.  You fight with the same couple moves EACH time you get into a battle.  Punch, punch, grab, throw. Unless you have a weapon then expect chop, chop, big chop.  The only thing that adds diversity in the monotonous fighting is the few vampire ablilities you can use.  Even then, its still going to be the same silly fight after you use one of your abilities. They would be better off making a really intriging movie from this series, because the game itself offers nothing but linear gameplay and tedious fighting, puntuated with wonderful dialog and great voice acting.  Keep the directors and actors, fire the game developing team.	-1
"KAIN'S BACK FROM THE DEAD...AND THIS TIME, HE'S BORING AS ...AND LOVING IT!" Despite having a gripping, dark tale to work with, and superb graphics to match, this game sequel is just too pain-stakingly slow and poorly paced for effective and fun gameplay.  Here's some PROS and CONS, and, unfortunately, the CONS win: PROS: >>> Dark, creepy tale --- fun to jump into this world, if just for a short while. >>> Good graphics, voice-overs, and music.  Kain's jump and glide move is a cool way to cruise around town.  Also, the side-kick vampire chick is a hottie. CONS: >>> Slow, slow, slow.  I'm ready to play, but have to wait through seemingly endless hours of painful dialogue. >>> Awkward fighting.  I know this Kain guy can tear some action up, can leap 20 feet into the air, can suck blood, and vanish into the mist, etc. --- but he fights like a total ..., with a big, "...here it comes, I'm about to hit you with my claw, look out, ready..."  One would hope he'd be a little more coordinated.  "...wait, I'm turning around, wait, hold on, I, just, I..." RECOMMENDATION:  All in all, solid package, but not paced quickly enough to keep my interest --- finally, when the fighting does begin, it's just a little too awkward, and sucking blood out of these corpses tends to get old after the 23rd time.  Rent first, then buy.	-1
Eidos really dropped the ball here, folks.  As usual the story is great, although there are a few notable inconsistancies that will hopefully be explained in the next game.  However, the poor controls and obvious lack of beta testing kill this game.  First, to attack you have to target an enemy.  Usually not a problem, but while targeting, you cannot jump. You can also only dodge left-right, not back or jumping.  Second, while sucking blood, you're stuck in the equivalent of a very repetitive cutscene, where you are still vulnerable to attack though can do nothing to avoid the blow.  Third, if you die, you have to watch any cutscenes between you and the last checkpoint over again, no way to skip them. As for glitches, there are hundreds if not more.  Clipping is horrible, people fall through walls.  Not a problem, unless you wanted their weapon.  Well into the game, many people, myself included, lose the ability to save, by either getting a Save Failed message or a corrupt new file, which has led to a few people having to start over.  As much as I love the story, this hardly seems worth the hassle and frustration of playing a game Eidos and Crystal Dynamics failed so horrifically on.	-1
I have played all of the Might and Magic games over the years and do not believe I can really express how awful this game is.  Stay away!  You will be much better off with Wizardry VIII, a fine example of how a series should be ended.	-1
THE GOOD: New 3D engine from Lithtech (No One Lives Forever, Aliens vs Predator 2). Buildings and landscape looks good, and monsters look frightening. People and NPC's however, did not impress me much. Jagged edges on the humanoid models with mediocre texturing makes interactions feel like you're talking to a picture. Soundtrack is also pretty good, but a little repetitive. THE BAD: Long load times, movement and turning is not smooth even with a good video card and may strain the eyes, low resolution. MM9 uses paper dolls to represent your characters, the same graphic no matter how you equip your character. One of the pleasures that I have in playing RPG's is seeing my character all deck'ed out in plate mail, or seeing my character with a huge flaming sword. MM9 only has a sketch of your character depending on your class and gender. You'll never see what your character looks like with a shield, dual swords, etc... Another not-so-good aspect of this game is the lack of monsters. Monsters do not seem to respawn, which means that your exp and money is limited. The interface tries to be like a first person shooter, and takes a bit of getting used to. Personally, I prefer the classic mouse click RPG interface. Also, no potion making. BUGS: 3DO released patch 1.2 almost immediately after the public release of the game to fix a slew of bugs. There are still major quest bugs that have not been addressed, such as the Thjordgard Training Hall quest and the orb of linking quest. The game feels sloppy, and the broken quests may result in hours and hours of lost playtime. IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES OVER EARLIER MM: Trainers seem to be more abundant and accessible, so you don't have to travel the world to get trained in a particular skill. For example, both Sturmford and Drangheim have similar trainers. Quests seem to be easier (and very buggy). The world seems to get uglier and uglier - in MM6 and MM7, there were majestic castles, snowcapped villages, bright hot deserts. In MM8, there were lizard villages and dragon characters. Now, in MM9, there are half orcs, the game is often very dark and you seem to need a grandmaster mage to cast a decent light spell. I think the creators just don't want us to see (to cover up the ugliness?). Even at higher level, the light spell (torch) lasts longer and not much brighter. OVERALL: I would say that this game may be worth checking out. I have to admit, despite its shortcomings, I am having a lot of fun. Definitely a buy if you are a die hard MM fan and this game happens to drop [in price].	-1
I have always been a Might and Magic fan.  I thought 7 and 8 were great games despite the graphics because the graphics didn't get in the way and still set a good atmosphere.  I realize they were dated, but it worked. The graphics in Might and Magic IX so far are inexcusable.  Just in the training area there are a lot of clipping problems, and I have already gotten "stuck" in between textures twice already.  The mouse-look is exaggerated which makes it almost useless.  The text is blocky and choppy -- it looks like zoomed in text on an LCD panel running at the wrong resolution.  They really tried to take the faces on people and improve them, but they look very out of place against the jagged background. On the positive side of the graphics, the monsters do look good. The sound is quite good, however, so I'm hoping a good sound card and 5.1 speaker system can help set the atmosphere.  Although get to know your sound system very well - I was presented with seven sets of 3D sound options with no explanation of them or recommendations. The character progression model also looks entertaining, and it obviously has some nice M&M touches that should still make it enjoyable.  However, it is hard to get around the graphics. Also, as of April 4th, 3DO still does not have a support section available for M&M9.  That's right - no support.  If you're hoping to find an answer as to why the graphics look so bad or why the text is jagged, you're out of luck. So the pros: M&Ms have always been good in the past.  The story seems to have some interesting lines to it.  The character model look like fun mix without being overly complex.  Good looking monsters. The cons: Terrible 3D graphics that look flat and jagged -- their old 2D model looked more like 3D.  Numerous clipping errors including the ability to get "stuck".  Bad implementation of water.  Jagged text.  No explanation of sound options on install.	-1
Started a new game. Tried changing my character a couple times to see the different models available. After the 5th switch the game froze.	-1
Ok, as for the title of this review, I'll get back to that later. But as for the game itself...it's awful. You run through these maze-like levels, pounding the buttons, sometimes stopping to solve boring, switch/door "puzzles" (they didn't even bother with boxes). You cannot move the camera; the levels are so linear, your view so limited, that this might as well be 2-D.   Yet, creating a mindless, boring button-masher wasn't enough for Midway. They had to go and add "RPG elements". Which means that they take the ABSOLUTE WORST PART of the RPG genre--endless experience grinding. You see, merely mashing buttons is not enough. You must mash buttons through the same levels over and over in order to level up enough, otherwise your chances of beating the game are shot.  And also, although the rest of the game is ridiculously easy, you'll never win if you can't get the special items to defeat the bosses. Which, of course, are near-impossible to get.  Now that that's off my chest, I'll explain the title. This game stole dozens of hours of my friend's life. She can't beat it on her own, because the difficulty is ridiculous, so she just enters the invincibility code over and over, and blows through the game time and time again....She's over her "Gauntlet phase" now, thank goodness, but for a while there it was all she did...  Don't get this game. Seriously. Real gamers will be bored out of their skulls; casual gamers, like my friend, are at risk of getting addicted. Now go buy something better. Like a game by Nintendo.	-1
While Gauntlet offers a lot of levels, mosnsters and bosses, it will get boring really fast.  It helps to have friends playing but even then it will still wear off fast.  If you don't believe me play all the way through the game, then say it's still entertaining.  You almost can't do it.	-1
Age of Wonders I was certainly one of my all-time favorite games.  Highly customizable hero with fantasy creatures under your control in a beautiful fantasy realms.  It had high replay value and kept my interest for many months. This sequel did not live up to my expectations.  The leader customization revolved primarily around magic spheres, as compared to specific abilities, which was possibly the coolest feature in the original game.  The magic sphere customization system was not reminiscent to the first game, and definitely not as fun. This may be worth getting if you're just looking for another fantasy RPG/Strategy game, but if you're looking for a sequel, you will be very disappointed.	-1
Do you like button mashing games? Games where you repeatidly press the same button over and over until the next level? If so then you will like this game. The game is similar the nintendo 64 version but has added many more levels and characters. The game is one to four players. The game is at it's best when you are playing with four of your buddies, but if you are playing by yourself it gets very repeditive and well boring.   The graphics aren't that great and well if you didn't know this was the Gamecube version you would think that you were playing the 64. Also it is very frustrating when you just miss two or three gems and you don't know where. The people at Midway looks like they just rushed through this game to get it done.   There are good things about this game. There are a few good things about this game. The levels and all the different combinations and weapons will keep you playing for a while. My advice is unless you love these kind of games I would just rent it. I don't think it is worth purchasing.	-1
Opened up a new line of genre, very unique gameplay and expansive environment. But riddled with glitches and imperfections. Enough so, to make this very frustrating. Almost seems impossible at times. Fun for a few hours, but afterwards i wouldnt ever play it again. Not worth the money.	-1
Not the best game you gott a have a pretty much powerhouse computer to play it without lag	-1
I know there is a lot of hype for this game. The new GTAIII Vice City is supposed to be another hit with newer cars and things of that nature. But Aside from all the killing and blowing up stuff, is there really anything else that captures the immagination in this game? I've seen friends play this over and over again saying how great it is. So I get it and play it. After 20 min of missions of killing things and blowing stuff up with practically no sense of purpose and any form of variety in the missions, I had to uninstall this game. Its horrible!!!  If you love games where its mindless killing (filled with great codes I should add), then go for it. But If you need a plot with an actual challenge that stimulates the mind, then you might want to go another route.	-1
This game looked cool after I read about it a month or so before it came out.  I bought it and I do admit it was fun when I first played it but there's not much to the game after the first few hours.  The graphics leave much to be desired with simple polygons and such and the zoom levels aren't that good.  You start out with $20,000 or so to build your mall.  You will be lost without completing the tutorial which is tricky.  I needed help from the game's message board (provided free on-line) just to finish it.  You build walls, entrances, atriums and of course stores.  There are four types of stores to choose from with a good selection of products such as clothes, electronics, housewares, etc.  But once the mall is built it gets boring. There are only like 5 or 6 types of shoppers and it does not show them in your stores.  They simply walk up to the entrance, disappear and then reappear with bags.  I built an ATM and pay phones and no one even used them.  There are also basic repeating animations such as clerks inside each store which get very boring.  The game has little replay value.  It is a cool idea but could have been a lot better.	-1
This game had so many conflicts with existing drivers on my system I never was able to play it (even though my system exceeds all recommendations and requirements stated).  After spending 3 days writing exhaustive emails to so-called customer support, and downloading drivers for nearly every piece of hardware on my system, all their recommendations led up to the unsolvable error, "GTA3 requires at least 12MB of free video memory."  I have 128MB of free video memory, but the game cannot recognize this.  All my other games play with no hitches, but I will be returning this one.	-1
GTA3 is indeed an amazing game.  It has a large environment, decent graphics and decent gameplay.  But it's too often unnecessarily complicated.  Some of the missions are next to impossible to finish, which makes the game more frustrating than needed.  I really tried to like the game...	-1
I love simulation type games where one can make money and expand to build a mega mall but I was quite disappointed with this game. The graphics are cheap and there is nothing much of interest to look at while you wait to go bankrupt or spend hours changing the shop fees to actually make money. Nothing to write home about. Not worth the money.	-1
I received this game for Christmas, and I was very disappointed in the graphics and the game play. It's the worst tycoon game ever. I can't my family payed full price for this tycoon reject. Roller coaster Tycoon, Airline Tycoon, Sim city, Zoo Tycoon, etc, all have great game play and is very addictive, unlike this game.  On the box it says, "A completely 3D world." That is total false, it's basically has 8-bit graphics (the type of graphics that were on the super Nintendo video game consoles.)  Another problem I have faced was that the game crashed a lot! You have to save frequently, and it takes forever to save. It's just like The Sims, it take 2 minutes to save! I loaded this game on my Windows 2000 and would crash when you got to the preloader. Then I bought a Windows XP and it would crash every 30 to 60 minutes.  I hope I made an impact on your decision not to buy this game it's not worth the money and it has many flaws. If you want to just try the game buy it used.	-1
This game really stunk in the graphic's area....the people look like blobs, and mostly just float across the rooms. My two year old could have done a better job creating this game than whoever did...Do not buy unless you just really want to be bored and frustrated...	-1
I am a huge fan of tycoon games and this one is awful!  What few controls you have are not 'instinctive' and it's basically just.. boring.  You buy a shop, which is pre-made and plop it down on the plot.  That's about all there is too it.  Plus you can hire a few people (janitors and security I believe) and that's about it.  It's boring, the graphics are horrible and its a waste of money.  Believe me, I have played just about every single tycoon game out there, you will have a lot more fun with Zoo Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon, SimCity, the Sims.. even Restaurant Empire.	-1
Great concept, yet it was tourn apart by the terrible programming.  The controls are hard to get used to, and the animation is poor.  They messed up how the mall should be made.  It should have been that people came in and asked you to put their store in, but you have to create each of them.  All though this is a good point, it's also one of the bad ones.  I hate the animation, because the customers don't look like they buy anything. Word of advice to the makers of this game:  Think a bit more before you go and ruin something as cool of a concept as this.  There could have been so many more options and better graphics as well as sounds.	-1
If you are a fan of some of the better simulation games, like the SimCity series, or even Tropico, etc., don't buy this game.  The graphics are substandard, the gameplay is boring and unimaginative, and the interface is less than intuitive.  This game is a blatant attempt to cash in on the reputation of some of the more succesful and better-made tycoon games.	-1
Being a "Tycoon"/Sim Fan, I figured to ignore the warnings of other bad reviews and got this game. I like malls and shopping, I  love sims, so how bad could it be?...ya, its pretty bad. The graphics, although apparantly take a lot of system resources to run, remind me of the old Nintendo/Arcade game "paperboy". The movement and detail of the characters are about the same and look very underdeveloped. The game does have a lot of potential. There is a large variety of stores, products, and decorations you can select from to build several floors worth of mall. However, the purpose and goals of the game are vague. The in-game help and descriptions are limited and the play is not as user-friendly as other games in this genre. There is plenty of "scenerios" to play, but I have yet to win or lose one and not sure how to. You do have control of the store names and some details, but there is no control or details about the customers that roam your mall. After playing this for a bit, I decided to go back to playing "Sims:Hot Date", where I could build shops and enjoy a game with some purpose. Overall, with Mall Tycoon, I feel like I'm playing a beta version of a game and want the final product that I was hoping for.	-1
As a lover of Street, I was very excited to hear about this game and bought it immediately. To my surprise, its not even a tenth as good. This game is five on five with only street players (i had a feeling that was coming, with no NBA endorsement on the cover) and boring backdrops. There is just too much going on on the court in order to really have fun with street style moves. I also think the arial attack could be made more interesting. It plays like a generic basketball game with the addition of ankle breaking moves, which is a big step down from NBA Street, which was more like the Arcade NBA Jam style of ballin'. I returned this game after a day, and bought Slugfest instead. At least I can punch gayrod now.	-1
This is seriously the worst game ever made.  It plays like a ... version of NBA Live 2002, only it ... way more.  ...  ....  The graphics are bad, the sound is bad, and game play is bad.  I rented this game from Blockbuster, then took it back to them and demanded a different game it was so bad.  Don't even rent it if it's free.	-1
For the past three off-the-shelf versions of High Heat there have been bugs galore. I will name only the first three that come to mind... You can't watch your team play in manager only mode... if you try it will kick you to your desktop after the top half of the first inning. Trying to play Home Run Derby can make your computer hang. Yet again, snafu with transferring seasons from older versions of the game. I'm sure the game itself will be great once it is patched.  So do yourself a favor and wait until it is.  Even at the low shelf price it's not worth the frustration yet.	-1
I am a long time fan of High Heat and have bought every year's version.  This was not a pc game but a poorly executed console port.  If I wanted to play a console game, I would have bought the console version.  But, to get a console version that plays on the computer, well, is insulting.  As others have written, there is no mouse support.  I could live with that, if the interface was easy to use.  This interface attempts to be cool, which only leads it to being difficult and not at all intuitive. Often you get to a place and have no idea how to do what you want.  The help key is not very helpful, either. Without a mouse, it is hard to find what you want, or to get out of the wrong place, that you will find yourself often.  I felt insulted by this game. I should have listened to the reviews that downgraded the game.  I actually found the play at times fun, but the game crashed 2x out of 3 games.  Not good. That it crashed during the only enjoyable game I had, well, was not reasuring.  The addition of new pitch types was a good change.  The circles to assist fielding are WAY to large and intrusive.  The game often required six or more imputs to get it to accept the pitch selection.  (Yes, my sidewinder was calibrated, and works fine with other games.)  This totally interrupts the flow of the game, and is very frustrating.  The player graphics look like they were taken from an arcade game and not as realistic as some past versions.  Some of the animations are really entertaining. Overall, I was very disappointed.  Getting a console game, wrapped in a pc package to me is unethical.  The menus are flat out awful.  If you want a console game to play on a pc, well, this is fair.  As a pc game, it is poor.	-1
-1 star-Graphics-The graphics are terrible compared to any other game. Even of its not baseball, The graphics are inacceptable. All the people look the same accept for their race, and the outfit they are wearing. Half the players don't even have a picture. -1 star-gameplay-This game was SOOOOOOOOO poorly made. In the easiest difficulty i lost 8-5. With the same teams in 2 harder difficulties, i won 35-0!!Also, u ALWAYS get away with stealing from first to second, but u NEVER be safe stealing from second to third. -1 star- This game gets boring sOO eaily becuase it only has 2 good modes. There is practice, and exibition which is the same. Home run derby WHICH IS TERRIBLE BECUASE U CANT FACE THE COMPUTER!, and a season which is terrible because half way through the season u always get a roster problom which is impossible to fix. -1 star-Crashes easily and takes 25 minutes to instal- this game which is about 300 meg took 25 minutes to install on my SUPER good 1.2 ghz amd athelon pc. Diablo 2 which is 1 gig, 3 TIMES THE AMOUNT!, took 3 minutes to install. Also, when u play this and u forget to close ur instant messeges, and u get an instant messege, the game minimizes. ONCE IT MINIMIZES, SAY GOOD BYE!! cuase once u click on the game to bring it back the screen turns black and it freezes. Do not buy this game!	-1
This game gets old quick. Despite the list of weapons listed on the box, you really only use 1 (the heatseeking missles). This game as a whole lacks any options for jazzing up gameplay, and it's pretty easy to beat! The only good thing was you can unlock the '83 classic game and play it! You might consider renting this game, but there's no need to spend money on it!	-1
dont get this unless you have a specific intention for it. if you just want to buy cool gamecube accessories stay away from this!  it does not function for many games at all, and even though it is a cool idea, i sold mine as fast as possible after i learned of its minimal capabilities.  a product like this has potential, but definately wait until some good game comes out that supports it in a big way. don't let any review that says that its good without giving specific reasons of specific games that it is good for.	-1
Well I started playing this RPG game because I really liked Advance Wars and someone said if you loved Advance Wars you would like this too because it's also strategy. It's fun but it's also got major frustrations and disappointments. I started playing the game and thought: I don't like this game but maybe it will get better. It did get better and I started to like the game but I was never satisfied with the gameplay. Ok first what's good: It's got a lot of different types of characters such as humans of various classes and fairies, dragons, monsters of many sorts both male and female. It also has quiet a few spells to choose from for the different classes that use magic. The graphics are decent but not great. The fighting sequences are fun but get boring fairly quick and require a lot of clicking through confusing menus. What I don't like: The battle navigation is too long and requires you to make too many clicks to get anything done. You even have to point your character in the right direction after moving him or her to a spot. Even turning off some display options like the useless experience points notification doesn't speed things up enough. Now experience what a mess that system is! Every single battle you face the enemies will always be within 1 or 2 levels above your highest character and the same level or 1 level below him. Everywhere throughout the map. It's like everyone in the world keeps up with you and your training. You get more experiece for attacking someone a higher level and very little for attacking someone the same or below. So your characters are always advancing at the same rate throughout the game(except new weak characters who rapidly jump up in level until they reach the level as everyone else) So going up a level is worthless because you never meet whimps who provide quick battles and you only use it to grow enough to use new spells, change classes, or use new weapons or armor. This is not a game to really explore. The routes are preset. There is no walking across the country side but rather just select one road from one city or site to the next. Many times you find yourself just moving back and forth from one city to the next and back again waiting to be attacked so that you can get more money to buy something or convince someone to join your team. I played all the way until the very last end boss. GRRR. 5 battles each an hour long or more and you can suspend the game but never save it to a slot or go back to a city and get more supplies. Then the very last boss hits your guys and does trememous damage. I can't kill him and I don't want to even try again after 5 hours of battle just to get to him. And I had to create two teams to get through parts of the game I didn't like having to do that. Advance Wars I plan to play again because it was fun. This game is going into a drawer to collect dust.	-1
I first must admit I'm not a big fan of racing games, but I try to keep an open mind and decided to rent Rallisport Challenge for a long weekend.  I found this game tedious at best.  I thought the cars were very difficult to control using the standard X-box controller and felt very unnatural.  Despite hours of practice and employing several different driving strategies, I consistently got badly outraced, even on the simplest of courses. I must admit, the graphics, music, and car options were intriguing and kept me playing this game for awhile.  But these "sugar-coated" features can't really hide the fact that the game is a dud, and definately not worth purchasing.	-1
This is nothing but a bunch of politicaly correct,tree-hugging enviromentalist crap!! All you do is swim around and uhm swim around and ahhh...yeah swim around. Your "weapon" is that annoying,finger-nails-against-a-chalkboard skreetch:EEEEEHHHH EEEIII EEEEE!!! I purposely died throughout the game just to see him float belly up to the surface...Ecco the dolphin needs to stop making video games... and go get beached or caught in a net....	-1
This game has many flaws.  The graphics for one are basically just the same as driver for psone except for some cutscenes.  The controls are poor and there is no way to change them.  Apparently if u r going in reverse, u cannot use the e-brake.  The gameplay itself is original but it just gets monotonous with no real storyline.  U can build your own stunt arena and screw around there, but that is the high point of the game.  This game is basically driver with a limited amount of space and with your every move just yelled out to u.  RENT THIS GAME FIRST.	-1
This game is terrible. Let's start it here. You're a stuntman. You get to follow orders from a director who demands you do some of the most stupidly rigorous tasks to complete stunts. Some of the stunts are cool, but the game gets hard at about the 4th level. The first movie you shoot is like a tutorial. I rented this game, and never beat it. The first level of the first real movie in which your basically like dukes of hazards is tremendously hard. You have to do things in split seconds, and the game is so hard that it is frustrating. The game has no good points that I can think of. On one of the first missions I didn't barrel roll and I still won it. Another time I was suppose to hit a  board and spin sideways near a garbage can, I barely did it and I won. But once you get to the dukes of hazards type movie, no. It's ridiculously stupid. There are cooling towers in random places falling on your car. Then you have to jump through a train at the start which is kinda luck. Anyways, the game could of gotten things right. For one, the game is fun when your not all stuntman. Right after you jump over a house, you get to cruise for like 30 seconds, which is fun considering the environment looks good. The game though doesn't lay out maps for you and doesn't give you any help. The director almost wants to make this thing as hard as possible because he never edits the movies(like normal directors and stunt coordinators do) and he never attempts to tell you where to go beforehand. You will be flipping left and right going up and down with no sence of direction. One second costs you the match... The game is terrible. There are some extras. Trailers or some crap. The map editor is terrible. You can put about 5 items in and that is it. I never figured out mechanical cars(I just decided to use cheats to unlock the editor stuff) and I never found out if there were any extra maps to unlock in the campaign. But this game offers nothing except frustration and crap. Honestly, I would like to see the creators beat their own game. If they could do that it would be great, beacause not many people can.	-1
Stuntman puts you behind the wheel as a stunt driver in six films that lovingly knock off classics ranging from 007 to Indiana Jones to the Dukes of Hazzard. The best label for the gameplay is a cocktail that blends Pilotwings with Gran Turismo's license tests: Hurtling along preset paths, you must guide a vehicle through a precise series of jumps, swerves, and other hair-raising maneuvers. The requirements for success are unforgiving and demanding; if you lag behind even slightly or deviate from the path in the smallest way, it's stunt over, and you have to start again from the beginning (apparently, the directors of these films don't edit). As a result, this game is truly very hard, and the absence of difficulty levels or even checkpoints means no mercy for less-hardcore gamers looking for a break. Basically, Stuntman is about being perfect-and incessantly repeating a stunt until, at long last, you get it exactly right. Adding to the frustration, the game's physics sometimes feel wrong: Your car will often wreck in goofy, weird ways; fences that break in some places are impenetrable barriers in others; and the like.  If all that doesn't turn you off, bump the Fun Factor up to 4.0 because Stuntman deserves major props for its unique concept and thrilling stunts. The buzz of jumping a car over a moving train, whipping it past exploding gas stations, and then burning nitro to soar over a river just can't be denied. When you complete all the stunts for a film, you're rewarded with the trailer, which is a series of cinematics spliced with the stunts you performed-and that's just way cool. The game also supplies an awesome stunt constructor, which lets you create the craziest set of ramps, barriers, and obstacles you can conjure up, then attempt to survive it in the cars you've unlocked. Instead of that mode, though, what Stuntman badly needs is a practice mode where you could take your time and master the stunts. After all, don't real-life stuntman get to practice-or at least get a peek at a map-before the cameras roll? In the absence of those aids, your frustration will rapidly boil over as you struggle more to learn than to execute. In a delicious bit of irony, at one point a cinematic tells you that supercomputers have been used to model the precise speed you should hit a jump...but that speed is never revealed to you!  If you're the sort who likes to crack a tough nut, Stuntman has a pair cast in titanium. It's definitely not for everyone, but for the right gamer who can tolerate its flaws and appreciate its rigorous challenges, it's gold. If that's not you, rent it for a quick spin and check out its cool Driver 3 trailer.	-1
This game is by far the hardest one I have ever played. but I did beat the game it just took me a million times on each level to get through after ripping the game out of my ps2 several times and throwing it across the room. Buyer's beware!! this one is HARD!!!!!	-1
Too much crap to get through before you get to do any gaming. A boring game.	-1
I saw the commercials for this game and the game looked awesome. Until I bought it. I played it over and over again trying to just get past my first stunt. Some stunts are easy but if you go 1MPH too fast or 1MPH too slow or cut a corner too widely or not wide enough the blood vessels begin to burst from the frustration. Believe me, the only cool part about this game is the commercials.	-1
Yeah, we've all seen the commerical, "while all those pretty little actors are sitting in their trailers, being pampered, and fond over, the stuntmen are out having all the frickin' fun". Just that line makes you want to go over to Circuit City and buy this game. STOP! DO NOT DO THAT! This game is a horrible waist. Truly an awesome video game idea, but it could've been brought to life on a totally different approach. The first level starts off with a few simple tasks. Or so they seem. You complete the first task, "hey, no problem, I've got this nailed", then, almost immediatly, the director shouts out another task you have to do usaully within 5-10 seconds. Despite how terribly hard, annoying, and frustrating it is, I just have to wonder how the makers thought this would be fun? I mean, completing task after task after task. Now, in games like Grand Theft Auto, the whole task thing's fun. You can actully get out the car and do other things, but not in this game! You are strictly stuck onto one direct path for each level, and there is no time for rest. As I said before, all it is is do this, do that, do this, you failed, do it again, time up, restart level, do this, do that, do this, do that, do this, you failed, start over...". Please, spare yourself and rent it first. My friend and I both rented it and didn't even want to play it more than once. The first time we played was for about 2 hours (2 hours I could have been sleeping), and in that whole time, we did not even pass the first level. Now, to end this review, I'll be as frank as possibly: this game [is a mediocre piece of gaming].	-1
Stuntman is extremely overated.  The theme is interesting enough that I can see why some people defend the game so strongly.  Acting out stunts from your favorite movies is something anyone wants to do.  Yet poor design decisions and sloppy controls has made Stuntman much, much harder than it needs to be.  You MUST rent this game before you buy it, trust me. I just don't like being forced to do the same, limited thing over and over again in a game.  You have to perform the EXACT stunts the game wants you to, in the schedule it requires, and the slightest mistake means instant death.  Hitting ANYTHING in the level, any building, car, or even a fence or sign, and you are forced to restart.  Fall behind even 1 second and the game only gets harder.  And speaking of time, I don't like waiting 20 seconds for the game to load after just 15 seconds of gameplay.  When you are forced to replay a level 50-60 times, I would estimate that you've got 10-20 HOURS of load time to sit through.  It gets old fast. The game physics are extremely chaotic.  Collisions and jumps at any speed or angle can cause a flip or spin-out all too easy, and usually force you to restart.  Even minor steering adjustments can cause a spin-out and cost you a hard played level.  Hitting a small curb has actually flipped my car onto its back, more than once. The levels are tight and restrictive, with most obstacles appearing suddenly from behind a hill or corner, with no time to react.  You memorize this game, not play it, and as you play each level encountering something new will most likely kill you immediately. There will never be that magic moment you find in games like GTA3 or Tony Hawk, when you've learned the skills to start improvising, reacting to new obstacles as you encounter them and making up your game as you go.  No sir, not this game. Calling Stuntman "difficult" isn't accurate enough.  Frustrating, too restrictive, poor controls, and annoying are better descriptors.  I wouldn't even recommend renting this game unless you enjoy insane obstacles. Buy it with risk.	-1
Pros: Car handling is easy and responsive Cons: Lack of walk-throughs adds a needless level of difficulty to an already challenging game There are reload screens between each take I would have probably rated it 2 stars but the fact that Grand Auto Theft 3 is out there I gave it a 1.  Go to Grand Auto THeft 3.  You won't regret it.	-1
This game is frustrating. Each level or scene, has about 10 stunts to do. in the VERY first scene, u have to go FULL speed and do a 180. First, you have to have the right car or you will end up failing the mission. If you go a couple of mph less than the full speed of the car than you won't jump high enough and the director won't like it. Also, I found myself doing VERY close to a 180 but it didn't count cuase i missed by a couple of degrees. THE COMMERCIAL OVERRATES THIS GAME!!	-1
This game is super bad. It is difficult and very frustrating. Unlike some games where the challenge is figuring out the puzzle, this game makes you repeat and repeat the same move over and over. The load times are very long and very frequent. I'm sure if you spent years you could get good at it. In my opinion, a game has to be a little fun at first or who else but a masochist will want to play it. This game literally made me furious. To be fair, driving games usually aren't my cup of tea, but this game is a real turd. The graphics are good, not great, but solid. The only good thing about this game is that I rented it. If you like extremely hard driving games that take months to master, then this is right up your alley. If you like games that are fun and that you can play the first night without getting very angry, then stay away from this game. I hated it, I'm going to rent Way of the Samuri again, that is an awesome game.	-1
This game should have been great.  The graphics are there, the playability is there, the concept is there, and the originality is there.  ...  What I wouldn't give to have a day with the source code.  A few little tweaks, and you've got a four star game.  Too bad. This game is tough, but more importantly, it's annoying.  I realized that they were some serious issues with this game when I had to do the first stunt ten times.  First off, there is no walkthrough of the stunt.  You have to emulate a series of stunts, and they won't tell you what's next in the series until just when you're about to execute it.  This meant that you'd probably not have the right speed or angle going into the next part stunt.  That's not too bad.  What's worse is that the timing and accuracy have to be perfect for many stunts.  If you mess up a little bit, you run out of time and have got to start the mission again. There are six movies to complete, each with about three to six series of stunts to accomplish.  About half way through the second movie, when I went through a stunt 30 times, I realized that this was a waste of my time and energy.  There were more worthwhile things to do with my life - like watching grass grow, voting for third party candidates, evolving, watching Behind the Music of M.C. Hammer for the 42nd time - anything but this game was more worthwhile. .... In short - avoid this game.  I only rented it, hoping to capture the essence of Grand Theft Auto 3, and I still felt ripped off.	-1
It came as requested; however, it does not work on my old, big system but hopefully it will work on my brother's newer slimmer system. I hope so; it is a Christmas gift for him.**It did not work for him either!	-1
I heard Konamix was better than MAX, but bought MAX anyway.  I am a very good DDR player, I can handle most 8 footers (thats pretty hard, for those who don't play or aren't that good).  I play mostly MAX on PS2 and 5th- 8th mix at the arcade (8th Mix is Extreme).  Compared to these, I was disappointed with Konamix.  The songlist, save for Burnin' the Floor, Matsuri Japan, Afronova, Afronova Primeval, and B4U, was pathetic, IMO.  Plus, I noticed a 1/4 second lag between myself hitting the arrow and the game registering it.  Could be that the disc was scratched.  Is it supposed to do that?  Someone, tell me in a review. Get MAX, or wait till September 26 and get MAX2.  Trust me, its better than this one.	-1
Well this game is ok! But its way too hard. I rented it last night and dident mind about it. It is easy to crash and way too easy to run out of time.	-1
I lucky I rented this before I purchased it because the game is really boring and there is only a couple of vehicles to use. I almost blew....alot of money but,instead I got Super Smash Bros...The crashes are stupid,the hood gets a LITTLE DENT and the windows crack. I don't like games that time you either. I would recomend you to get Super Smash Bros. Melee or Starwars Rogue Leader or SSX Tricky,because those are the best games on Gamecube so far....there are lot's of new games coming out so just wait. When I rented Burnout...I thought that the crashes would be better,the graphics would be better,the sound would be better,the gameplay would be better,but all of it was WORSE! Graphics:4.5/10 Sound:3.5/10 Gameplay:2/10 dumb	-1
I got in the mood to play wrestling games, and it mostly stems from me having a lot of fun with them when I was much younger, and really enjoying them up to about N64, but that was also about the age that I stopped following wrestling, so I don't know many of the new wrestlers, about the time that the WWE was formed as I was much more into ECW and WCW.  Anyways, I got this game and I have to say that it just feels like it was rushed to marked on some sort of deadline, but without the team behind it that many big sports games like madden have, and I can't help but feel like if the developers had just put some more time into it, then it could have been at least something.  From what I understand, this was a really big wrestlemania, and it makes sense that they would want a video game tie in.  I have to say that since I am not as familiar with many of the names as some of the other reviewers, the game just doesn't look very good.  There is a lot of footage mixed in, which always signals to me that they had to put something there since the actual graphics are much to be desired.  There really isn't much of a story mode, and the create a wrestler features here are a joke, and the most important part of any wrestling game, the way that you actually fight, well the controls and the point just suck.  There is no other way to put it.  The matches just feel aimless.  Easily the worst wrestling game on the market.  Sure thee are lots of different kinds of matches and a couple of cool features, but maybe they should have focused on just getting the first one right and going from there.  Avoid at all costs.	-1
The year is 2002. President bush is plaining an invasion on Iraq because of threats of Nuclear weapons, America is entertained with American Idol. And the WWE just celebrated another Wrestlemania. In 2002 thq came out with this wrestling game. When I saw it I thought it was going to be one of the best wrestling games. But I was wrong. The controls are easy. But the game is bad. If your stone cold and you nail the stunner they get up right away. Just like on smackdown you can pop a finisher anytime. The Music is bad. And the story mode is god awful. If your champion you don't come out with the belt. My friends don't get Smackdown (err) I mean Wrestlemania X8 Get Day of reckoning. This game is very bad and should have never been created. Shame on you THQ For this game. Shame Shame Shame	-1
only get this game if it's free my friend and i both have gamecubes and we couldn't wait for this game. my friend bought it the day it came out (full price it's not worth it) it's is utter crap everything is crap about this game id have a sexchange b4 id buy this game	-1
WRESTLEMANIA X8 Let's be honest, this game is not acceptable by any means.  Whether ir be from a wrestling game point of view, a sports game, fighting game or even a video game in general, it is truly not good at all.  The graphics are sub par, the controls are really bad (even worse, in my opinion, than Psone and N64's WCW Nitro) and the sound is pretty bad too. First off, the graphics.  They're not clean and neat compared to the SMACKDOWN series on PS2.  Each character is barely individual as well.  They just have the clothes and the moves.  Other than that, most of the characters look fairly the same.  And let's not even start on the Create A Wrestler because that is also a pain.  The game itself is surrounded on the ring and the first few rows of ringside seating and nothing else.  What does that mean?  It means, you can only fight in the ring area.  You cannot go into any back areas and going on the stage still looks a little plain. The controls weren't working for me.  I couldn't get it down no matter what I tried.  Plus the motions and movements of each character are a little stiff.  The controls take a little time to get used to.  After some practice, it's not so bad but still, they're a little advanced for younger gamers. Last but not least, the audio is a disaster.  There is no commentary and there are no voices for the wrestlers.  The only sounds I heard were when you hit the mat and the audience noise.  And the some of the wrestler's entrance themes are off.  Perfect example, the New World Order music is not even the real thing.  It's some really bad guitar power chord and riff fusion and I assure you, it sounds bad. Unfortunately, I'd have to say skip this one and wait until the Gamecube gets another WWE game because WRESTLEMANIA X8 won't be worth your money.  Trust me, I had to learn that the hard way.  I bought this game and traded it back in 3 days.  If you're still looking for a wrestling game for Gamecube, check out LEGENDS OF WRESTLING II.  I'm not to fond of that game either but, there are a few improvements to that game.  Again, do yourself a favor and skip WRESTLEMANIA X8.	-1
Having loved the Aki/Asmik WWE games on N64 (Wrestlemania & No Mercy), i've been looking forward to this for a long time, & i've never been more disappointed by a game in my life. The game has been developed by Yukes, who did the Smackdown series on PS1 & 2' & while it looks very impressive when running on demo, it's awful to play. No story modes, no interference, a lack of some characters real theme tunes, a criminal lack of moves & the worst blocking system in the history of gaming. It plays like a very rushed, unfinished game, & is simply no fun to play at all. Avoid like the plague.	-1
I've bought many wrestling titles by THQ for the nintendo and have found them all to be great.  When this game came out for the GameCube I was excited.  Excitement quickly turned into disapointment.  Everything that was great about the previous THQ wrestling games is missing in this.  The controls are sub-par and the graphics in my opinion are not as good as the 64's.  The computer AI is annoyingly cheap, reversing your best moves when you are at full momentum.  Bascially this is a rental and not a good rental at that.  Hopefully they'll be able to improve this title in later installments.	-1
Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting. Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown: Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system. Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent. Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what. Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles. The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too. Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better "selling" of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the "sell time,"  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry. The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.  What is there of No Mercy in this game,  as we were promised?  Not much.  Attacks to the groin give a "ding" sound,  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of No Mercy.  However,  whereas there were dozens of possible counters,  including varied reversals for heavyweights,  light heavyweights,  an martial artists,  there is usually only one reversal to a move,  and most are shared among many,  many moves.  Finishers can be reversed,  however. Among the good are a wide variety of matches,  every sort of match your little heart could desire,  provided it makes a showing on WWF/E TV.  HEll in a Cell,  Cage,  Tornado Tag,  etc. To summarize the gameplay,  it plays like a cheesy arcade game.  In the early nineties,  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason.  It's return is unwelcome,  and its demise will not be mourned. Create a Wreslter:  Sadly,  the CAW works like the Smackdown series,  without the benefit of all the options.  Selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites.  The CAW system from Smackdowns 2 and 3 was a huge selling point,  even to people disappointed with the gameplay.  This is but a pale imitation of better systems. Wrestlemania X8 has remained a fairly big disappointment.  Some will enjoy this title,  but I'd suggest renting it,  even if you are a fan of the Smackdown series and this review has done nothing to sway you.	-1
"This isn't so bad... Is that a rabbit? I think it might be a squirrel actually... ITS EATING MY FLESH! IM DEAD! SPECTACULAR!" That's basically a short summary of this game. Talk about boring. You can die to the harmless butterflys if they touch you. Honestly, this game is terrible. To beat monsters you have to take damage or use up all your kai. To beat bosses you have to do some crappy solar flare 50 million times, hit them with 6 punches max, then run and do it over again.	-1
This game is hard and boring. U can fight many enemys and hardly ever lv up. One wolf can kill u in 4 turns and ud need like 10. It gets pretty boring scince u cant hardly do nothin'. Dont buy this game.	-1
The Dragon Ball Z cartoon series features awsome looking anime characters rapidly punching each other at 100ft in the air while flying at super human speeds and shooting out devestating exploding beams of god knows what. This game dosnt. This game has clunky piles of pixels that barely ever show any raid movement for characters, Two different attacks that all take time to charge up and can only be shot one at a time, 1 basic punch move, A main character that walks as if he broke his legs during a horrible standing accident, and background tunes that sound like what shrank your ears back in the days of NES. There are some neat anime senes in there sometimes, but still have the horrible background music blaring along with it. There are some moments with corny one-liners audio clips from the show but force you to look at the mudpuddle of a screen while listing to them. The graphics do feature some items and places that look alot like their anime counterparts in the show, but have a horrible looking ground of dots of sand/dirt color under them. The sound is also so bad, ... Come on? You can put more effort into games than that! This could have easily been done on a Game Boy Color. There are no pro's I can say here. I don't understand how anybody can like this game. You trudge slowly through the terrain in the four cardinal directions, no diagnols, and shoot anything thats behind, in front of, or on your left or right sides. Dont buy this. Dont even bother to illegally download it for free or go to the trouble of even thinking of it. I should have said only that this whole time. Other than my complaing, thanks for reading through my complaing!	-1
If you like DragonBall Z the show, and you bought this game, you would know exactly why i think this. EVERY single thing in it is off course to the show. The very first things you fight are wolves, but for some reason, they made it so the wolves can kill you in 2-3 shots when you have to punch them 50 times to kill one. Also, when you fight Radits, piccolo says "lets do this already" he dosen't do one thing to help you. He just sits there watching.   Another dumb thing about the game is that you have to do little side missions such as saving a boy in the forest. When Goku is going to fight Napa and Vegeta in the episodes, do you see goku helping people getting a toy boat or saving little boys in the forest. I THOUGHT NOT!   The Game is very short and easy too. You can go to a level of 25. There is one challenging thing in the game and you will find that out on your own.   This is the worst game ever. DO NOT BY IT!. It will make you hate Dragon Ball Z.	-1
I hate games that are based on movies and cartoons...thy put no effort into it. They just make it so hard core fans of whatever the show or movie is will buy it because they loooove the show. This game is pretty bad..it has a bad, and hard to aim battle system..i was thinking of buying this but i changed my mind after i tried it. and it is really short..i recommend Golden sun if you like Adventure/RPG games	-1
If you're a hardcore DBZ fan, egt the game because it has a great plotline, but otherwise, don't. It's extremly easy, you'll beat it in mere hours, and gameplay is too easy.	-1
Man, this game is sad. Graphics are palatable, but the controls kill what should be an otherwise awesome game. For example, the controls during lightsaber battles are so complex that you are required to stand still while dishing out your justice ...	-1
If you aren't a die hard gamer this game is likey not for you. The controls in side scrolling lightsaber mode are complicated and non-intuitive.  Example:  Stop moving, press the A (attack) button first, _THEN_ the direction pad to direct your attack.  With most games its simply attack in the direction you are moving.  While this may be life in the real world ("uh oh, I better get ready to fight, Attack, Go for the chest") it doesn't work so well in this game where the goal is to move to the end of the level. I didn't find the graphics to be all that impressive.  It's pretty hard to well show lots of detail on the small GBA screen. Honestly, take this game on a "test drive" (find a friend) before you shell out the hard earned dollars for it -- unless you're hardcore...	-1
Now there have been some bad Star Wars games, and this is one of them.  When I first saw screenshots of this I thought it would be a great platform game like the original Super Star Wars for the Super NES.  Boy was I wrong.  The controls are unresponsive, and while the characters are nicely designed, the background levels aren't designed very good.  The John Williams score is grating on the GBA's tiny speakers, and all that combined means that you will die, a lot.  And when you die, no matter how far you get in the level when you die, you start over right from the beginning.  All in all, I think Star Wars fans should use the force, and skip this one.	-1
I rented this game a while back because of it's innovative idea.  Control a mosquito, suck blood from members of a family of three, and stay alive through the summer.   Each level has you in a room with one member of the family, and has selected certain parts of their body for you to get a select amount of blood from.  You have to be careful not to be spotted, or they'll swat you and strike you dead.  Also, many of the levels feature obstacles like mosquito repellant and candles you have to watch out for.   But the problem is, that's the entire game.  About twelve levels like this, (some of which will take many tries) that will only last you about two or three days at most.   The graphics are poor, the execution is strictly alright, so all in all, this game is nothing more than an interesting concept.  Not really even worth a look, even for fans of weird games.	-1
THE GOOD: Not really anything good but the game is really original. It's kind of cool sucking blood. The mosquito looks fly. THE BAD: So many problems with the game it's tough to chose where to start. The controls are hard to get used to. Rotating the right control stick to suck blood gets is annoying because any button you press will cause it to stop and if you have big hands it happens a few times. The characters a poorly designed I'm sure that one bath scene is what lured you to want to get this game but once you see her face well I don't think you would want any of that, also the other family members look just as messed up. The battle type is really stupid and because of the bad camera angles is hard to master. The levels are super small. But most likly its largest problem is the fact that it's to repetitive the characters do the same thing over and over and over and over. SUMMARY: Over all a bad game. It may be fun and cool the first 30min but you'll get tired of it fast so my recondmondation is rent it from a video rental store or friend.	-1
On the positive side, this game is seriously beautiful. Just looking at the environments kept me playing when the gameplay didn't. But the control system--terrible. The way the world whips around constantly at the slightest mouse movement made me want to throw up. You'd think you could fix this tendency by altering the mouse sensitiviy, but you'd be wrong. At the lowest setting BO2 still resembles the jerky camera parts of Saving Private Ryan--and I mean that in a bad, unexciting way. Also, what's up with no strafe controls? You can't bind any keys to move your player sideways. When you get in a fight the keys that previously and redundantly (since the mouse does that already) rotated the character are mysteriously transformed into the missing strafe keys. Why Eidos would abandon the tried-and-true Quake-type controls in this game is a mystery. I suspect it's an artifact left over from BO2's console port. With its whacky control system, the hardest part about BO2 is keeping your lunch down. Also, parents should take note of the "Mature" rating for this game. If ever a game deserved an "M" rating (or worse), this one does. This is coming from someone who's enjoyed other "M" rated games like Soldier of Fortune which features gory, war-type violence directed at armed soldiers (with a penalty for killing civilians). But Blood Omen 2 takes violence in a very dark direction. As a vampire you're encouraged to view humans as food and feed on them wherever you find them. In practical terms, this includes walking up to old ladies and clubbing them to death as they scream for you to stop. They fall down and try to crawl away while begging for their life and you have to beat them to death before you drink their blood (necessary to refill your health meter). While I generally view "kills" in video games as cartoonishly entertaining, I found this level of violence disturbing. I suppose it's passed off as "natural" vampire behavior (though I wonder about the public response if these were, say, Harp seals being clubbed instead of people). Everyone's got their own standard regarding game violence. Mine's pretty liberal, but this is the first game that made me feel like I'd seriously signed up with the Dark Side. The Mature rating means someone out there thinks it's suitable for your 17-year old son. I suggest you make that call yourself.	-1
I bought this game by accident. I thought I was getting Star Wars: Jedi Knight 2 Outcast. Turns out it was Dark Forces 2 (my fault for not reading the description more carefully). Even so, I can't help but be dissapointed. Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2 is the sequel to Star Wars Dark Forces. It follows the story of Kyle Kataarn. A young Jedi straddling the line between the Light and Dark side of the Force. I realise that this game is over seven years old. But still when held against games such as Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (which was released the same year) this game looks graphically challenged. The characters are rather stiff and rigid looking and the environments are extremely bland. The gameplay fares no better. It esentially consists of running around blasting and hacking various non-descript bad guys (and later Stormtroopers) with little rhyme or reason. Occasionally there are Boss battles but those are often frustrating. Eventually you are rewarded with different Force powers, none of which seem to work very well. The controls will often have you fumbling to find the right key for the right weapon or Force power. Also, our man Kyle is not exaclty the heartiest hero on video game. He is often easily overwhelmed and collapses in a heap making you restart the level. The level map is not very helpful either. All in all I have to say that the game's biggest downfall is it's age. It just hasn't held up well over the years. Unless you're a collector or a Star Wars fanatic, it's best to stear clear of this game. It wasn't very fun to say the least. Spend a few extra bucks and either pick up Jedi Knight 2 Outcast or even Jedi Academy. One thing Dark Forces 2 does is let you see just how far technically video games have progressed over the last seven years. Other than that there's not much reason to play this game.	-1
Huh, probably most reviewers won't agree with me on this one, but I found this game extremely boring. I'm a Star Wars fan, so I can appreciate everything w/ a good story, decent visual, etc. I know this game is fairly old, but I still play old games (even ones from the early '90-s), so old graphics really don't disturb me that much. But the storyline should be MUCH better, that DF2's: I never felt any interest in the game, playing it was almost like playing Quake 3 Arena: pointless. Acting is almost horrible in this one - they should've gone with graphical cut scenes inseat of live actors: acting is actually so bad that it hurts. Most of the B movies have better acting than in this game. I'd say avoid this game at all costs, unless you're a really big Lucasarts/Star Wars fan. I got the game for a bargain price but still feel fairly dissapointed.	-1
This doesn't even worth a star. Just like lemans 24 hr. a game developer trying to hustle a quick buck. Don't touch this. Andre	-1
After watching a friend play this game and playing a little myself, it looked sweet. When I got it however, I found it far too challenging, even on the easiest setting. Question: WHERE IN THE MOVIE DO ANY OF THE BAD GUYS CARRY GUNS AND WHERE ARE THE ROBOTS THAT SHOOT MISSILES AT YOU? Answer: NOWHERE. So why put them in the game? Spidey really doesn't have a good enough defense for either of these and both do way too much damage. Also, they should have had more city levels where you swing from the sky around buildings and less indoor fighting levels.	-1
If you love Activision or Spiderman, and are sensitive, do not read any further. The goods: The graphics and animation are cool, but that's about it. Also, it seems that it does not work your computer's butt off, so that's cool. The bads: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't seem to brighten up the picture. The game does not let me. It seems that Activision and whoever they are working with, enjoy making life miserable for anyone who likes complete control of their character. There was a Spiderman before this and the controls were pretty bad. Infact, it feels just as bad. Well in this Spiderman (SM), there is an awkward feel to the controls. You move forward, SM moves forward, you move backwards, SM DOES NOT move backwards; instead, he turns 180 degrees and then he moves towards the monitor (you). In most first person OR third person games, the keyboard controls the character the way you want. The mouse is used as a pivot for the character's torso movements; however, in this game, the mouse control is completely eliminated. Instead, the mouse controls the angles. But wait! You don't really have control of the angles; the angles seem like they are randomely changed to disorient you. That's right, you are swinging left to right of screen, when all of a sudden, the camera angle decides to change by itself, and you are now swinging up to down of the screen. Cool eh? Um no. You beat up bad guys. And they just fall and dissapear. Not exactly fun. You are swinging in the air, but when there are no more buildings above you, your web is still pointing in the air as if they are attached to the clouds. It is a strange feeling. The "spidey senses" is not always accurate. You follow it to the best you can; however, sometimes the target is right under your nose, but the "spidey senses" tells you it is "that way" or "this way". The tuturial is also annoying. You get this voice (Maybe the movie actor himself, I can't tell) narrating the instructions to you, but he throws in a bunch of Bob Sagat jokes (if you forgot who Bob Sagot is, he is the father in the old sitcome "Full House"). I want to learn how to play, not listen to some guy try to be funny. When you fall from buildings, there is an invisble barrier where if you cross it, you would die. You cannot climb down the building and walk among the crowds. The invisible barrier stops you. Not exaclty a complaint, but a warning for those of you who have to get their nose in every aspect of a game. If controls are important to you, do not buy this game. If you want a good single player game, get maybe Jedi Knight 2; it has great controls and even greater multiplayer. Activision and its partner(s) could have done a lot better. It is ashame the graphics were negatively countered with poor controls and interface. I gave it 2 stars because they neglected what is so important in a PC game - controls.	-1
I would rate it zero stars, but there is no such option.  Just as you are about to conquer the world, almost every single provence revolts.  Even if you have two spies in every provence.  Any loyalty of above 150.  Even if the enemy king is 78 years old, and all of his fellow horse men have been killed, he can rout 240 archers that have him surrounded, then kill your 30 something year old king and his three fellow knights.  The game has internal logic but it stacks the odds against you in ways that are oddly illogical.  It is just a frustrating game.	-1
Words cannot express how much I hate this game. There are very few games that I flat out HATE, but this is one of them. This could actually be the worst game I've ever played, so that's saying alot. The game tries to be a "choose your own adventure" samurai story set in the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate era of Japan, but completely fails. Here's why:  -Even though there are multiple paths you can take through the game, you can beat the game in about 45 min. either way. Not even most 16-bit games are that short, and those are certainly a helluva lot more fun!  -The swordfighting is boring, due to the slow pace, lack of moves, and under-evolved fighting engine. And since that's the main gameplay hook, it leaves you with little reason to play. Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry both sweep the floor with this one.  -There's no voice acting. Just grunting and giggling sound effects. For a game that wants to have a story, this sure is a raw deal...  -The save system is just messed up. Period. There were occasions where I'd save my game, die, and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased. And a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me I'm not alone on this one...  -The black guy with the afro. Seriously, what the hell is this guy doing here? Maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while, it'd be pretty neat, but as it is, he has no personality, and seems to just take up space. Leave him alone.  -The game world is tiny. It consists of 9 (I think) areas, that are each about the size of a football field. For a game that wants to have adventure game elements, this totally destroys everything, and is the final nail in this game's coffin.	-1
Here's my Haiku: Great Idea Original and Unique Very Badly Done I rented this game with no instructions.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a tutorial.  This tutorial was slow torture, but I learned some things.  Then I started the game.  The Graphics were pretty good, and I sensed that some great stuff was going to happen.  I started off nicely, explored around, and I got killed.  So I started again, explored some other parts, and got killed again.  This time I decided to avoid getting killed. That's when this game got dull.  Really, really dull.  I played for two hours, painfully walking from one place to another.  The fighting, though interesting at first, was monotonous.  The setting soon became boring.  Worst of all, I wanted to save.  For the love of Goodness I kind not find out how to save.  The controls and tutorials taught me everything else but how to do.  After playing for three hours straight, I turned off my PS2, hoping the game was saved automatically.  It wasn't, and I wasn't going to repeat those three hours of gameplay, so I said forget it. I promptly returned it to the video store, hoping that the few hours that the game resided in my house didn't lower my property value.  This game was cheap.  First of all, there were no voices at all.  Voice actors are not expensive, yet they couldn't even afford that.  Secondly, there is no compass.  Many times I would want to go north, but I could only hope I was walking there.  I could only check when I reached a new area whether I went north, south, east or west.  Finally, you can not save immediately.  Granted, I could have looked it up how to do it on the internet, but by that time I realized this game wasn't even worth it. It's a great idea, terrible execution.  Avoid this game at all costs.	-1
I really wanted to like this game, but ended up returning it after a few days of gameplay. Since other reviewers have gone over the good points, I'll just highlight the bad points that killed it for me: 1. There's only one save file allowed and this file is erased as soon as you start playing. Maybe the designers did this to emphasize the "story" or "seriousness" aspect of the game, but it prevents you from saving at a decision point in the game and efficiently checking out the what-if's. I didn't have the patience to play ALL the way through the same point over an over to find out how things change based on my answer to the 4th question in a conversation late in story. And especially not when it takes me a good 30-40 minutes of walking through mostly-empty environments punctuated by careful combat to get to that point. 2. When you die, the swords you took with you from your warehouse go away permanently. The game boasts something like 20 different swords with 400 possible moves among them. Great. But are you going to take your best life-enhancing, attack/defense-maxed swords into the story with you knowing you'll lose them if your character dies before reaching one of the story endings? (Note: there's at least one path that leads to premature death and it's not in combat, so you have no chance if you make the wrong decision). Also, losing the sword means losing all the advanced moves you've learned for it. If you start the game with another sword of the same type, you are forced to unlock the moves all over again! Like the save-game system, this seems like an arbitrary obstacle to really exploring the depth and richness of the game because it forces you to be very conservative about your choices. They should have made the sword skills part of the character instead of attaching them to the specific swords to encourage people to try out the other weapons. It's a painful choice: you don't take your best, well-used sword for fear you might lose it and you don't take a new fancy-schmancy sword you just got because you don't know any moves for it and you'll get killed (and lose the sword) by the first grunt. What's that leave? Well, I got very, very good at using the basic moves of the default sword.... 3. You can't skip or fast-forward the dialog scenes. Let's face it, by the time you're trying to hunt down that last elusive story path, you'll have read the same dialog bubbles a hundred times. Since they don't change and some of them take a loooong time to unspool, you'll be futilely mashing buttons to try to get them to go faster. The inarticulate grunts that were inserted in place of actual speech don't make these passages any more palatable. I figure they account for about 10 minutes of inactivity during any given 30-40 minute playthrough of the story. Given that you'll have to play the story many many many times to get all the story arcs and sword skills, that adds up to a lot of wasted hours. Too bad. There are a lot of cool story arcs and side-plots in Way of the Samurai and much replay potential in perfecting one's sword combat with each weapon. BUT, the game designers seem to have done everything possible to _discourage_ you from exploring the game. If your idea of "finishing" this type of game was to get all the story endings and all the swords with all the moves, then be prepared for a long, tedious journey that has purposely been made much more frustrating than it has to be.	-1
The graphics in this game are *gorgeous*.  The formula seems to be a winning one:  half-strategy, half-roleplaying, this takes a typical Blizzard game like StarCraft or WarCraft and turns it on its ear by giving you characters that not only interact through the various chapters' cinematics, but whom you get to control.  Just like Diablo, they have health and mana, and can carry a limited number of items.  Neat!  Now you have one character who can customize his skills, rally the troops, and help you feel more directly immersed in the game, instead of just hovering over the world map. Now for the problem:  the game mechanics.  While the point-and-click interface works well, the missions I've played don't seem to show any true A.I.  Enemies just hurl themselves at you and the winner is the one with the most firepower:  no careful deployment of archers here, knights there.  Worse yet, the A.I. behind the scenes isn't operating on your level.  You have to build your town, make soldiers, etc.  But your opponent doesn't do the same thing:  enemies appear out of nowhere.  They attack when you do one action, but save, restart and prepare for the attack, and it'll never come.  Why?  Because the troops don't exist until the program decides to throw them at you.  You don't really feel like you're facing an enemy so much as you're playing through a "choose your own adventure" scenario.  One wrong choice and it's off to reload.  And most of your choices involve bashing your way through:  on one early mission in the human campaign, your sterling hero turns against his allies and it's your job to help him lead men through a village, slaughtering all the peasants and burning their houses.  Hurrah.  Some enemies might show up to relive the monotony, but it doesn't help when they don't have much in the smarts department.	-1
Fifa 2002 was a great leap for a soccer game since Fifa 98, but the World Cup 2002 hits a new all time low. I thought that it was going to be the same as Fifa 2002 except with the world cup included and maybe better graphics but I almost threw the game in the trash after i played it for the first time. First of all, and most important, there is significant slow down in the game especially when you pass midfield. The camera stutters and it makes the game very difficult to follow. Second, you can only play with teams that have qualified to the world cup, if your national team didn't make it well tough luck. One of the main reasons people buy this game is to play with their national team and clasify them to the world cup, but now you can't even pretend that your national team is any good. Third, the people at EA added some special effects when you strike the ball it looks and feels like your playing NFL Blitz but for soccer, not very realistic! I cant even begin to comprehend how they let this game come out the way it is. With problems like slow down make the game simply unplayable. I so mad they did such a poor job with this game I really do hope they fire some people at EA. Trust people, stick to Fifa 2002, its true there is no world cup but at least you won't have a seizures while playing World Cup 2002.	-1
This is, as you can probably fathom, a port of ID Software's 1992 classic Wolfenstein 3D, scaled down and put into cartridge format for play on your Gameboy Advance.  First off, I want to say that the studio who ported it did a pretty good job overall. The graphics aren't as clean as they were on my IBM 386 back in the day, but I can forgive that kind of thing because the game feels the same. You move at the same rate, shooting feels the same, the only thing missing as far as gameplay goes is a keyboard.  The levels are faithfully reproduced- every secret door is where I remember it was, which is always kind of fun for those looking back with nostalgia. It contains all 6 original episodes (although you'd think that, barring some sort of legal entanglement they could have included its sequel Spear of Destiny).  There are two central problems with this port which are the main reasons I can't rate it higher. First, you can't save your game wherever you'd like (which you could do in the original). You can only save at the beginning and end of levels. Nothing sucks more than to make it almost to the elevator when an SS guy comes out of nowhere and guns your last 10% of health away. My other problem is the game's lack of music. Hey, what gives? The original had some classic MIDI tuneage courtesy of Bobby Prince, who also scored the Commander Keen games, DOOM, and Duke Nukem 3D. It's just not the same. Ever tried watching Star Wars wthout the music? It's like there's a key element missing.  A good port, but incomplete without music and frustrating without a save-on-the-fly feature.	-1
The worst FPS available for the GBA is Wolfenstein 3D.  It's not the worst by much, Medal of Honor; Underground is pretty darn close.  Wolfenstein 3D was the fifth FPS for the GBA but the first FPS ever to be released for any system.  Bringing this title back from the dead probably wasn't such a good idea with games like Ecks Vs. Sever competeing with it.  Doom and Duke Nukem were old games coming back to life on the GBA but those turned out so darn good.  Those games featured beautiful graphics.  Wolfenstein 3D's are just plain outdated and ugly, however not as ugly as Medal of Honor: Underground's.  The game features the original 60 levels and 4 weapons.  Only 4?  Yes, I know, there were only 4 in the original but that is to little.  This game is even outdated on the Game Boy.  The game is still fun but there are a lot of better choices in the FPS genre for GBA.  Trust me.	-1
Listen people take your money that could buy this game, and flush it down the toilet, cause it would be better spent. This is one of the WORST 10 XBOX games that has ever been created so far. I mean it seems alright at first. Then you get to playing it and there are more and more enemies, until you're extremely out-numbered. Than you die and its hard to earn more lives. Then the story line just seems to disapear for a while. This game is POSSIBLY worth thinking about renting, MAYBE! But I wouldn't even rent this game if I would have know how bad it is.	-1
I bought this game. It had a good start with the cutscene at the beginning. It really had an interesting plot: A prison is torturing inmates by experimenting on them or something so they come back from the dead and try to kill off the town, along with other creatures working with them. The game also had a dark atmosphere and that's a high point. Unfortunately, most of the levels require you to kill zombies and rescue people. Because of this, the game gets old.  I actually enjoyed the cutscenes more than playing! What could have been a great game is destroyed by pointless objectives and the storyline is ignored.	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Yes, yes, it's so special, the original fps. Although a good game it was dwarfed by games like doom and nothing compared to console fps. But what do you expect for gameboy anyway right? Wrong. Matter-of-factly, this game is outdated, and its not even updated! I don't want to be too harsh on the first fps, but if you want to play this, just have a friend with old games e-mail the shareware pc version to you, because its the same and the control is better on pc. Bam! Entertainment does make good games though, so get the other fps they made, Ecks vs. Sever; it is definitely the best fps for gameboy.	-1
Its too bad.  I was actually pretty excited about this game initially.  Why not?  It has a pretty intriguing story, admirable spooky, misty graphics, and a variety of cool playable characters.  So why is this game such a dissapointment? There is no stategy or gamemanship required, whatsoever!  To make it through the entire game (which I did) requires nothing more than constant movement of your character and a quick (and strong) trigger finger.  This is more of an arcade-style game of the "Space Invaders" genre.  Hordes of bad dudes constantly chase your character and you shoot them until your finger falls off.  Its fun for the first hour or two and thats it.	-1
We only gave this one star because that is as low as we could go. If we could go any lower we would give it a -5 stars. Do not waste your money or time on this game. It [stinks].	-1
I was bored of this game within a few minutes.  It seemed like it would be a better Gauntlet and looked like it was going to deliver.  The opening screens are amazing and graphics during the game are great.  However, gameplay just isn't interesting.  You pick your character and then run around and kill hordes of creatures with a variety of weapons.  That's it.  To make it more annoying, the camera doesn't move well with you at all, making it difficult to see what you need (want) to see. Although Gauntlet falls far short of Hunter in the graphics department, it is much better overall game.  I'll stick with that.	-1
This game is hours of mindless frustration, and boredom.  If you don't love slasher films, this game is gonna [stick]!  The camera angle is terrible and you have no control over it, which makes aiming nearly impossible.  The bad guys(zombies with guns)pop out of nowhere continuously like Night Caster, and i have OFTEN gotten so many enemies on the screen that the game bogs down.  While the glorious xbox does its best to make the game pretty the animation is terrible, and cut scenes look like the PS one.  All in all this game isn't worth [the price].  Hang onto your money and wait for the price to come down-way down-like used.  Or buy a good game, HALO,JSRF,Gotham Racing,GunValk,BloodWake. Im taking mine back today.	-1
I bought this used so that I could introduce my son to gaming on the original XBox.. But the controller stopped being recognized by the system shortly after purchase. It worked for about 4 hours before it started intermittently disconnecting and eventually no longer being recognized by the console. The other controller works just fine in all ports, so the system is not the problem. It is unfortunate, but I'll learn from my mistake and buy new next time.	-1
The controller arrived with the wires wrapped around it and it was filthy, like it came out of a yard sale. When tested, the controller didn't work.	-1
I purchased this Xbox Controller S used. The description by the seller was condition near new. However the way the controller's wires were wrapped suggested otherwise and the controller only lasted 2 weeks before shorts and freezes began during game play. But for $12 bucks, there is not much to complain about. I still have one of the original Xbox controller S from the 1st launch and it still works flawless. Oh well time to pony up for a 3rd party controller.	-1
The buttons take a lot of pressure to push, the deadzone is very wrong, and the buttons are facing the wrong direction. It just sucks, but unfortunately there's not a lot of options for original xbox controllers today.	-1
My old controller was constantly having a problem with the wires and the game would tell me it had been disconnected so I decided it was time to purchase a new controller. The new one worked okay for the first month or two, despite a problem with the black button trying to stick quite a bit, however it started having the same problem and now if I move the controller the slightest bit, the games tell me the controller was disconnected and I need to reconnect it. This happens every few seconds and it makes game play extremely difficult. I don't know if it's possible to find an good controller anymore for the old Xbox or not but it sure would be great if I could find one!  To add a note to the problem... the wire is all straight and not twisted and I have no idea why it keeps giving me the error. This is just yet another example where Microsoft products are nothing but trouble....	-1
That's right.  If you found this controller more comfortable, you have little girly hands (obviously not an insult to female gamers out there).  I never saw anything wrong with the original controller, and still laugh at all who own one of these 'controller S's because they can't handle a 3lb controller that fits adult hands well. Don't get me started on PS2 and GC controllers (a camera button??), but I think the Xbox was innovative in designing a controller for someone with hands bigger and stronger than a 5 year old's.  They're durable, too.  I threw mine out a second floor window onto concrete (I don't take losing well) and it has barely a scratch.  I accidentally broke my friend's PS2 controller by just shifting it in my hands wrong (ultimately not my fault, for my hands were much stronger and versed to useing a tough controller). So, while technically this controller does the exact same functions as the original, I couldn't see myself wielding one anytime soon.  Cheers to those who whined until Xbox put this out.  I only wished you whined for something that really mattered, like more RPGs or less Sports titles.	-1
Why on earth are the start/back/little buttons placed so that trying to reach them gives you carpal tunnel? The Japanese sure have some incredible thumbs...	-1
I bought an S controller at the same time I bought my system A: to have a second controller, and B: to see what type of controller I like better. As long as your hands are big enough for the original controller (which most of my friends and my hands are), the original controller is actually better than the new S controller.  About the only good thing that thet S controller has is rearranged A, B, X and Y buttons, but the other repositioning is very, very bad.  The Start and Back buttons, and the black and white buttons are right underneath your hands when you are gripping the controller, very awkward to have to bring your thumb back that far when you are trying to play a game.	-1
Average graphics, slow gameplay, insanely shallow dialogue, and cheesy music. Need I say more?	-1
Jane's Attack Squadron gets one star from me only because I can't figure out how to give it zero stars.  Putting the "Jane's" name on this turkey is like nailing a Porsche badge onto a half-built Excalibur kit car. As far as I can tell, here is what happened.  About five years ago, Jane's was associated with Electronic Arts.  In one of the greatest marriages in flight simulation history, a company with possibly the planet's most talented game designers cooperated with the world's premier source of military equipment data, and produced what will go down in history as one of the greatest combat flight sims of all time, Jane's WWII Fighters. At some point after the release of that peerless masterpiece, there was a falling out between the two partners.  Perhaps somebody from the "Jane's" side spilled coffee into an EA designer's keyboard, or maybe EA started to get jealous of the acclaim Jane's was earning using EA's talent. Whatever happened, the geniuses took a hike, and now the Jane's name is being tacked onto products (I won't call them "software") that have evidently been designed by hacks, wannabees, moronic nuts and monkeys.  With all due respect for monkeys, the Jane's name alone isn't going to raise the prestige of this trash, and in fact junk like J.A.S. is eventually going to pull the Jane's name right down into the gutter. My advice to Jane's, is if you want to be involved in the PC gaming business, buy some kneepads, suck up your pride, and crawl back to the people who designed WWII Fighters and beg them, bribe them, do whatever it takes, to get them back on board.  I know for a fact that programmers and designers can be bribed with stacked boxes of hot Captain Tony's pizza and cold liter bottles of Shasta spiked with Cutty Sark or flat Bartle's & James coolers, which ever happens to be available.  Lacking those, a fair and equitable compensation package reflecting the creative talent's true value to your company could be used as a backup plan. In the meantime, for everyone who craves the feel of piston speed, the rush of wind past your canopy, and the sight of your orange tracers pouring into an FW-190, lighting it up in flame and sending it tumbling into the clouds below, buy, borrow, copy or steal the original Jane's WWII Fighters, load it into your super PC, crank all the sounds and details up to max, and prepare to be awed again and again.  The bigger the dogfights, the more WWII Fighters stops looking like a game and the more it starts looking like a masterful aviation painting in motion. Having said that, why can't I buy it anywhere?  My original copy is now a cherished possession that I guard carefully, and if you can find it, it's definitely worth whatever you're willing to pay. But don't buy JAS.  Instead, demand a Pacific version of WWII fighters, designed by the original people or at least people who know code from toejam - we've been waiting more than 5 years for Corsairs and Zeros, COMON JANES, GET IT TOGETHER!	-1
I bought this game about 6 months ago after having played the demo about 1 1/2 years ago.  I remembered that the demos (2 differnet levels) were fun and the graphics were pretty decent.  After buying the game and attempting to play it several times on the second level, I finally uninstalled it and put it away.  The levels can be hard since there is a lot of sneaking around so you don't attract attention.  The problem is that when you do attract attention, every guard comes running at you and the AI is pretty decent.  Herein lies the problem.  You cant save the game through the difficult parts and continually getting killed is so frustrating and annoying that I finally said heck with it and put it away.  The game play is fun, the graphics are fairly decent, and the AI isn't terribly retarded.  This game reminds me of Alien vs Predator, which you couldn't save between automatic check points until the patch came out which fixed it and made it fun.  There is no such patch for IGI2.  Dont waste your money unless you like to punish yourself.  Good game but maddening.	-1
Despite several conspicuous flaws, Codemasters' Project IGI 2 (Im Going In) is a reasonable 1st person shooter with an emphasis on stealth. While the storyline is disjointed and at times incredibly clich, in a 1st person shooter the plot often plays second fiddle to gameplay, and it is in this area that IGI 2 is strongest, though certainly not groundbreaking or incredibly entertaining.  The premise is simple. Ex SAS operative David Jones, working for the mysterious (and fictional) "Institute for Geotactical Intelligence" must sneak his way through a variety of different levels, naturally accomplishing objectives ranging from sabotage to infiltration.  As a stealth shooter, David Jones must be navigated through a series of extremely large levels, disabling guards and infiltrating deep into facilities. With such large, sprawling levels, loading times are long, and it often takes more than an hour to complete a single mission. The game features the usual assortment of weaponry, all of which sound suitably powerful, though often most of the level will pass without issuing a single unsilenced shot. While all this may seem terribly suspenseful and interesting, several flaws greatly detract from what could have been a great gaming experience.  Firstly, the lack of a proper savegame feature prevents players from saving until the end of a level, which can be frustrating, especially when a single alarm usually results in an unrelenting storm of hostile enemies. Secondly, there is little in the game to justify any other weapon than the silenced pistol. Hideously overpowered, the pistol is just as powerful as a submachine gun, possesses greater range than a rifle, and, when fired, does not kick. Since many of the other weapons are not fitted with silencers, most of the levels can be completed with the aforementioned handgun rather than its more powerful counterparts.  Thirdly, the enemy is unbelievably accurate. There are few situations more infuriating than coming a few minutes from the end of a mission and being taken down by a few highly precise submachine gun rounds, thus forcing you to restart the level again. Likewise, it is incredibly irritating when, after having guided David Jones to hide behind a conveniently placed tree, the enemy lets loose a few rounds that pass through the trunk to eliminate the unfortunate operative, much to my chagrin. The game thus evolves into one in which David Jones must crawl from shrub to shrub, snapping off a few well placed shots and generally attempting to escape detection.  On a more positive note, the music is suitably suspenseful, and the voice acting is generally very sound.  In conclusion, Project IGI 2 is at best a mediocre 1st person shooter. The lack of a proper savegame function, a palette of boring brown/grey visuals, long loading times and several flaws in gameplay culminate in a frequently exasperating gaming experience. For every sense of satisfaction after a completed mission, I experienced episodes of intense frustration.	-1
IGI 2 the sequel to Project I.G.I: I'm Going In is not a great sequel to the orginal. The first game was great though it was very hard due to lack of save games for extra large levels. The sequel has limited saves. The levels are nicely desinged but some of them are very hard and become repetive. You play David Jones, a covert operative. There is not much of a storyline. Weapons are great but can carry only two, a hand gun and a large gun. The main problem is the AI. Enemy soldier will know exactly where you for the mild noise you make. The game seems to cheat a bit. Once the alarm goes on everybody knows where you and start shooting at you with perfect aim even if you are are crouching far away. An enemy soldier was snipping at me with an Ak-47 from a watch tower when i was 100 meters away. The AI is really bad. Try this, when the alarm goes on, run into one of rooms or hide in a spot where they cannot snipe you from a far, almost every enemy soldier will come running to that spot to kill you face to face, you can shoot them all one by one till they stop comming, check your map to see if anyone is moving. This way you could kill almost every one without losing any health. The best change from the orginal game besides the save game is there is no enemy respawn. IGI2 is not optimized to run great. I have Win98SE, P4 2.4Ghz, 512mb Ram and GeForce Fx. I did not face crashes or hangs but it was quite laggy and the framerates drop too much sometimes. Initially the game runs great but once the alarm goes on the framerates drop drastically.	-1
This game should be called IGC: "I'm Going Crazy". This game isn't hard for any legitimate reasons. Anyone can build a budget game that has a buggy save system, the main character's aim is so bad it seems like he just stopped drinking the day before the first mission started and enemies that can cut you down with a pistol from orbit. But this is supposed to a high quality game! Buy Soldier of Fortune, Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon instead.	-1
Watch out if your on a high end machine. I built a high end machine with 3.06ghz 2gigs of Ram on a ATI 9700 Pro using windows XP PRO, and I got a virtual memory error but only with this game. All my other games work awesome, Wolfenstien, medal of honor, battlefield 1942, unreal 2, UT2003,and soldier of fortune2 to name a few. So its definatly not the machine, it runs all of them at the highest settings like a dream except this one. This is just a word of warning, oh yea this game ran good on my old system p3 550 with XP home on it. So just keep that in mind. I hope Black Hawk down runs good. It better with this much power.............................	-1
its a bad game with an original concept. use cards and points to battle foes. the cards come to life similar to baten kaitos, and phantasy star online 3	-1
this has to be  by far the worst gamecube game ever made	-1
Ah, Resident Evil for the Gamecube! How exciting! Or maybe not so exciting.  The re-make promised many things, and did deliver to some certain extent. However there are some things that make me rather agitated, and other things that make me downright mad.  DIALOGUE - While much better than the original, it still lacks grammar in some spots and still sounds sketchy at certain cutscenes. Why we couldn't perfect this, I have no idea. You're a multi-million dollar company, CAPCOM - and we're in the 21st century. I think you probably could have hired better actors or at least done more interesting overdubs. I'm sure you certainly have enough funds to do so.  GAMEPLAY - It has its ups and downs. The puzzles are somewhat more simple, but also more difficult at certain points. The character movements are more fluid...but almost TOO fluid. Tapping the B-button and directional button simultaneously to run finds you stepping ahead more than you wanted to, sometimes running past a door or even stepping right into a zombie. You can master the controls, but it takes awhile - which is quite frustrating.  The color scheme of the game is very dark, which makes it hard to see things. Plus the added fact that you can't really see if a zombie is around the corner or not (save for the rooms with the mirrors which helps) so you end up running right into the grasp of a feisty friend.  DIFFICULTY - If you were hoping that the RE-make of Resident Evil was any easier than the original, keep dreaming. It's actually more difficult; and being that the original was the toughest in the series (up until this), I'm sure many were hoping that the difficulty on the remake was a bit more easy to handle.  Some very frustrating things about this game is the limited ammo you get (in the hard mode, you barely have enough to stay alive and have to use the knife half of the time, even if you ARE experienced with the series and know how to save ammo), how fast your health deteriorates, and the all of the god-awful backtracking you must do.  Your enemies may also choose to come back to life if you do not eliminate them by burning them.  Chris (the stronger of the two in the game) can only take three bites before it's "lights out". That includes the ankle munchers. The ammo supply is very short limited, which forces you to use the (very weak and almost useless...ahem) knife throughout the first portion of the game. The characters do have new defense weapons, however, but you must find them (like items) and pick them up. Unfortunately, they too are in short supply.  ENVIRONMENT - Okay, we all know that the environments have changed for the remake. So has the mansion. While the brilliantly colorful post-rendered backgrounds may catch your eye, there's several downfalls to the new environment. The rooms that you always remembered never lead to each other. Room A does not lead to Room B. Room A leads to Room D and a half; way down in no-man's land. Which can be both a curse and a blessing; for those who have played the "original" every spare minute of their life, this may be a breath of fresh air. But for average players like me, it's rather frustrating. The puzzles have been switched around a fair bit, and there are more enemies.  The environment of the game is very dark, and you can't see as well as you'd like. I find myself subconsciously looking for a light switch on the wall every time i enter a new room. With the added danger of zombies and dogs, it's like fighting your way out of a paper bag.  I find this game quite frustrating and difficult. I think in the late 90s, the reason Resident Evil 2 seemed more popular and likeable than the first Resident Evil was because they toned down the difficulty without sacrificing the suspense. Just like Resident Evil Zero. Excellent game, totally A+. This game on the other hand, I would rate a C+ or a B-. Graphics are great, environments are great; but those with weak hearts and irritability should probably steer clear of this game.  ~Jared	-1
I bought this game a few years ago for the SNES after playing BOF1.  I was looking for more of that wonderful gameplay in the first classsic game.  I was terribly disappointed and I endorse the comments of the other reviewer from Valencia, CA USA.  I quote them immediately below. ******************* "The sequel to one of the best rpg games with the best story line is a total and complete flop. breath of fire 2 does not follow anything even remotly like a story and is not in any way realated to the first game.the game should have had some thing to do with defeating Tyr after she comes back at the end of Breath of Fire 1. the fighting is different and when i tried to select a enemy to fight out of 3 enemies, i ended up shooting myself. what is probably the worst part about fighting is when you meet a new enemy. you can't see how much health they have so it is frustarating not knowing how long until you kill them. the graphics are horrible and are worse than any game i have ever played. the hunting in this game is extremly disipointing and you spend the time waiting for a deer or boar to come out of the grass. if you are looking for a good RPG, play Breath of Fire 1 or Golden Sun" ********************* Additionally, the storyline (what there is of it) is horrid.  It is not even a true sequel, but seems to be an attempt by the company to simply capitalise on the success of the first without too much effort.  In short people.  Do NOT buy this game.	-1
the games controls are the worst and this game is really hard!! yes the graphics are some of the best thats not y u should buy this game its not worth is buy eternal darkness	-1
I see why other people like this game but it's not the type of game for me.  I think I decided to buy it because I was so amazed that they made a remake of 3D game.  When i was 7 or 8 i bought the first resident evil used at a rental store.  I thought you would battle zombies in a enclosed area.  I was terrified the first time i played.  I remember when jill's freind shoots off the zombie's head.  Maby the zombies should die this way.  This is one of the parts where the game is stupid.  In the new game a zombie backs you into a corner.  So what does you charachter deside to do?  Fall down and trip.  That was a great idea!! Lets do it again and again and again.  Maybe house of the dead is more my type.  In RE is you try to turn around and run away and when the zombie finally gets near you you have to turn around as slow as a blind cow with a broken leg on sleeping pills whose drunk.	-1
This game is terrible! you move way to slow, your attacks don't even kill beginning monsters, and the graphics look like a playstation one game. Don't even rent it it is terrible, but then again so were the other king's field games.	-1
It's an okay game but is very watered down and simplistic. It will quickly bore anyone with much intelligence or above the age of 13. It's a lot like D&D heroes in that sense.  Add to this that the people online are all price gouging right now when you can buy the same game used in real used game stores for $8.00 as of the end of January. I saw a store with 20 copies of them at the $8 price and they say they have just as many at their four other branches. I bought one for my nephew who is 4.	-1
I am not a fan of first person shoot em up games, but after reading reviews of this one, I thought I'd give it a try...  Mistake.  It was a very beautiful game as far as graphics and scenery, but the play control was CRAZY DIFFICULT!  Options weren't easily accessed, and jumping is near impossible!  If you aren't a fan, but think you'll give it a try, don't waste your time.  I took mine in to a trade in video game shop and got Arc The Lad, instead.	-1
OK I am judging this game on the other Turok games. Turok one was a great one player game, Turok 2 was also a great one player game with decent(not fantastic) multi-player. This game is NOTHING like them at all. you spend WAY too many levels flying a stupid bird in meaningless missions that drag slowly by and all the levels are WAY too similar. Instead of having like 8 worlds and portals like the other ones you have ten thousand short levels that pretty much all have the same objectives. I got sick of this game after getting to the 5th stage. At the end the boss is dissappointing as well, its a guy riding on a sort of t-rex type thing with guns on it. LAME!!! What happened to all the BIG HUGE Bosses like in the previous Turok games? the boss in this one is small and stupid looking and easy. all the bosses are. Definitely rent first Don't buy without trying. like i said it is NOthing like the other Turok games AT ALL!!! THE WEAPONS SUCK TOO! I cant figure out why some other reviewer said they were cool, they are lame andyou only get to use the three or four weapons that are in each level. If you found the rocket launcher in level three, you won't have it in level four! I gave this game 2stars because graphically it is cool and it is a Turok Game. Definitely not worth buying in my opinion. But try it for yourself by renting first.	-1
I've played enough first person shooters to know that this one wasn't worth the time or money I spent on it. Graphics are so-so. Level designs aren't much better. The game play seems to drag and skip whenever the action heats up. At first, I thought the flight sim sequences were a novel idea, but the moment things started to get exciting, the game paused to load the next section which totally broke the game rhythm. Switching weapons also happens to be sluggish, making combat sequences far more difficult than they should be.  Considering the quality of most games Acclaim puts out, this one was a major disappointment. If you're in the mood for an entertaining FPS, I would strongly suggest something like Deus Ex: The Conspiracy. The Medal of Honor and Red Faction series are also strong. I wish I could put a finger on what really irritated me about this game, but I can't--some games are a challenge while others are a chore to get through. Simply put, it's not fun.	-1
Like a lot of people I ran out and bought this much hyped game immediately, and like a lot of people I was sorely disappointed. This travesty ranges from the mediocre to the just plain bad. Most of the levels in this game are average at best and that's not including the horrible flight missions. The graphics are weak and the multiplayer is a freaking joke (on the PS2 anyway). Overall I'd probably give this game one and a half stars but I can't, and to tell you the truth it doesn't pain me that much to have to settle for one star.	-1
This game ... It says it is 1-4 players simultaneosly, but it isnt. It is only 2... so it ... if you have friends and want to play. Either that or my multi taps b, c and d ports are messed up. Also the single player is too linear. You can barely explore or anything. The graphics are ok, but the sound effects ARE VERY BAD!! Everything sounds so cheap and inhuman. I rented this at blockbuster, I hope the game is messed up or something because it stinks. Turok 2 was alot better. I think gaming companies are all about graphics now and not gameplay; which is really sad. Some where I read that this game was going to be awesome, I totally disapprove. All the reviews I read anyways only talk about "what they heard and saw" Do not rent this game!! Wait for armored core 3.	-1
I would have added more stars if the game allowed you to buy weapons and actually be able to keep it and use it more than a 30 seconds. Weapons and magics disapears after a quick 30 - 60 seconds. You gain a new look after every 10 levels. All attacks are missile attacks, no matter if you are an archer or a knight. This game is sort of easy and not as challanging as it may look in the cover. All the more reason not to judge a game by its cover. Don't get this game unless you know what you are going to get.	-1
I am a total hardcore action/adventure/RPG fan, and thats what this falls into.  I'll play almost any game, and mostly like it, but this game disappoints].  The graphics are really nasty, seriously, they are really cartoony.  The voice acting is soo bad, and there are plenty of glitches in what he says.  The storyline is...what is the storyline?  You're not an important character at all.  The gameplay is the only somewhat good part.  It's just really [bad] that you throw your weapon around.  You can go into hand to hand too.  If you don't have 4 controllers this game is even more stupid.  If you are an RPG gamer, or like action/adventure, this game is NOT what you think.  If you liked all the gauntlet games, this is for you.  But I think this game [DISAPPOINTS]...	-1
I love this game. The copy I got was terribly corrupt. It could not save after the second mission. I could not return it. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALER.	-1
Do not buy this game. Even though it is only 5 bucks on Amazon, and probably cheaper elsewhere the shipping wait is not worth it as you will put it down in the first hour or so. When i got it it was lame when all you do is shoot tiny little dinosaurs that could easily be stepped on. All the weopans suck and the only one i wanted was the nuke that you only get once(if you don't use it, it doesn't carry on  to the next level) I wanted to see the end of the game but i despised it too much to bother playing it so i used cheat codes, the end almost sucks as much as the game. Multiplayer blows and the controls are retarded.  Save yourself the frustration of looking at it next to your xbox	-1
I owned Turok 1 and 2 for the old N64 and thought they were great, so I was really looking forward to this game. Unfortunately, this one isn't even as good as the old N64 ones. The graphics may be a little better, but the game itself isn't nearly as fun. Plus, the things that they added to "improve" the series are just plain stupid, like the flying missions (you have a pterydactyl that shoots missles and machine guns). I am going to trade this one in toward Timesplitters 2.	-1
You would think that with the 128-bit era of Xbox, PS2 and Gamecube that we should be reaching the peak of Gameplay, but as of recently what were getting instead are games that, granted, amazing looking but someone forgot something: the game. To be honest I shouldnt have necessarily been thinking Turok would be a great game. The first two Turoks for the Nintendo 64 were well done, but far from perfect, and Turok 3 basically [wasn't good]. So the track record was far from perfect, but still there was no crime in wishingI suppose. But ultimately Turok is a bad way to start off the fall, its one of those big name, big budget games that looks promising, but ends up falling way too short.   For fans of the original series, youll find your typical Turok gameplay has remained unchanged, from the Tek Arrows to scaling vines and the terribly out of place platform jumping areas. Now this style worked for the Nintendo 64, but Acclaim should try evolving soon to join the rest of us in the new millennium. The biggest problem here is that the shooting just isn't fun period. Blasting lizard men, baboons and dinosaurs gets about as fun as stacking blocks in Tetris, its all the same. The weapons have been seriously downsized from the other Turoks, theres maybe about 10 weapons to choose from and all of the classic military weapons have been ditched, theres one machine gun, and the shotgun and pistol completely [aren't good] so you won't even use them. There are still the bows and arrows, axe and your space age weaponry that amazingly rips the space/time continuum in half or something, but cant kill the powerful enemies, if you're into that kind of stuff. I prefer guns and lots of them.   In fact the only new element to the Turok series is the flight levels where you hunter rides a giant winged dinosaur and blasts everything in sight. I would maybe applaud it if it had been before Panzer Dragoon, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Sky Gunner. I bought a FPS damn it, I don't want to fly, I want to shoot, and the problem here is 25% of the game is flying! Again, this is the only new feature in Turok; this is the exact same game youve been playing since 1997.   The more and more I played Turok hoping hood things would result, the more I was disappointed. Acclaim promised genius enemy and partner A.I. and instead we have the biggest group of idiots in the world. Even on the back of the box they claim enemies take cover and establish strategic positions. Well a perfect example of this was when I shot at an enemy he ran in circles numerous times then dropped his gun and ran away, I guess he figured if there wasn't a hiding place within 3 feet hes doomed. Another enemy who heard my gun shot started climbing up a ledge making him the easiest target in the world. Im not military mastermind but isn't it a little dumb to climb something when someones shooting, a place that offers no cover and manoeuvrability?   And when you finally do get allied soldiers, they try to be like Halos marines, but instead their most brilliant move is to run straight at an enemy and wait until they're in two feet to begin firing. In fact this is the worst A.I. Ive seen in a long time, these enemies need to go back to kindergarten to learn basic movement like run when someones shooting and maybe also learn not to drop their weapons and flee like so many enemies do here.   Turok is the first flop of the season and is going to fall off your top games to try list like the leaves of fall. Its something that couldve been great could have utilized technology. Also funny is the aging gameplay system despite the games title Evolution perhaps they should check the dictionary. It would be in best interest of first person shooters everywhere if Turok would go extinct.	-1
Turok: Evolution is the next-gen update to the popular first person shooter series from the N64. I've played none of the games in the series, but if this game is suppose to represent why these games were so popular (and as I've heard, good), then I guess I didn't miss out on a whole lot.  Turok: Evolution was a highly hyped title, but unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its great expectations.   For the record, I played the Xbox version of this game (it's also hitting the Gamecube and PS2).  Obviously, this game (as well as Acclaim, the game's makers) hopes to dethrone the current FPS champion, Halo, but it sadly doesn't come close.  The graphics have some nice effects, such as the beautiful looking water, but the character models are only OK, and the some of the jungle foliage, particularly the bushes and jungle brush, were flat, 2-D models that look just embarrassing for an Xbox game.  The load times in this game are only adequate, but what really offended me was that the game takes 2 to 3 seconds to load even a simple menu (i.e. the Options menu).  On this console, I expect to press the button and go to the menu almost instantly.  Even The Simpsons: Road Rage, which had the longest load times of any Xbox title I've played, didn't stutter when you accessed menus.  It may sound here like I'm complaining about something stupid, but it really got on my nerves.   The game's sound is good.  The voices are adequate, the gun shot effects are realistic, and the game's jungle style music fits well.  The controls are decent for the most part, but some things bother me.  It's easy to move, look around, shoot, jump and switch weapons, but it can get to be too hard to hit enemies.  At certain times, you have to kill groups of ravenous small animals to proceed.  You have to look down to see them, and it's very difficult to shoot them with your guns. Even with your spiked club, you sometimes swing it at them for what would look like a direct hit, but miss.  It's a real pain.  Also, sniping enemies is just painful.  When you activate the scope for your pistol, your sight seems to move around on its own.  You may be thinking that I'm just complaining about a head roll effect similar to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, and that I don't like it.  On the contrary.  I didn't mind the head roll effects in the games I mentioned because they didn't turn the scope all the way to one side, like it does in this game.  It's like the scope is possessed by the devil or something.  This glitch makes sniping so difficult, that you'll never want to use it.  All the better, I guess, because it doesn't help a whole lot anyway.  I do appreciate that enemies die when you shoot them in the head in this game, though; I'm sick and tired of shooters where the guy is still standing from a head shot.  However, I don't believe for a second that these guys could possibly die instantly by having their leg or arm amputated by your arsenal.  They would be in extreme pain, obviously, but they would die a slow and painful death from excessive blood loss, not just by the dismemberment.   That brings up another point.  This game is really, really violent.  Heads, arms, and legs, are all lopped off by Turok's weaponry, and when this happens, the enemies bleed excessively.  His spiked club even gets blood on it after you pummel an enemy with it. This is probably the most violent game I've ever seen, and defiantly deserves its Mature rating (ages 17 and up).  In other words, don't let your kids play this game. If you're a kid who's complaining that you're not allowed to play this game, don't worry, you're not missing out on much.   To spice things up, Acclaim included a flying segment to break up the pace, but it's just awful.  Here, you ride on the bad of a flying dinosaur (I'm not sure if it's a pterodactyl or not), and shoot down enemy bunkers, gun turrets, planes, and anything else that these guys throw at you.  You're told in the story that riding one of these things across the Lost Land is the fastest way to get there.  However, the control during these sequences are so jerky, I'd rather just walk there on foot for a week or so.  Also, you'll die so much during these sequences, you'll be begging for mercy.  Well, you'll do that, and belt out a string of profanities so strong that Chris Rock would blush.   The cardinal sin of this game, though, is that it's really boring.  You run around levels, graphically ending enemies lives, and either get to the end or die.  It can be fun to kill enemies in such gruesome ways for a little while, but it soon gets old.  Also, there are no checkpoints during long levels, so if you die at the very end of one, you have to start all over again.  One thing that I really didn't like about this game is that the levels feel so linear.  They're pretty much just 3-D tracks, and let you do almost no exploring whatsoever.  You also barely get to interact with the environment.  Sure, you can knock down trees with your club (which is pretty cool) and kill wildlife, but there isn't much more to do than that.   The game also has a mutiplayer mode for up to four players, but since I did not test it, I can't tell you about it.  If you're hoping that this review will tell you whether the mutiplayer mode is worth anything, then you should find another review that discusses this mode.   All in all, I was very disappointed by this game.  It's not a terrible game, but I still can't recommend it as anything more than a rental.  If you want a good FPS for your Xbox, get Halo if you haven't already, and if you have, wait for another anticipated shooter to come out (like maybe Unreal Championship or Brute Force), and pray that it will live up to the hype; something that sadly, Turok: Evolution couldn't do.	-1
The main reason for this game getting such a LOW RATING is because the control configuration is REALLY MESSED UP. You have to play with one of the two ways they give you which are basicly the same. And also the levels are easy to get lost on. IF you don't already have HALO buy it instead of this garbage.	-1
I should start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the first-person-shooter (FPS) genre. Unfortunately this game sorely fails to live up to any expectations. The game play is sluggish and unappealing. The graphics are sorely lacking, especially given the X-box's potential. The 3rd person flying mode is also uninteresting. Like the 1st person shooting mode, the flying mode has sluggish game control and boring graphics. Sadly, if you want a good FPS game, all you really have for X-box right now is Halo.	-1
I rented Turok Evolution ,And boy am I glad I did. It saved me money buying such a lousey game. The first chapter is ok but after that it goes down hill. They give you a scope for the gun that drifts and the enemy is already lobeing gernades and fireing at you befor you get there.then they give you only one way to go but your ememies can still sneak up behind you and surround you on all sides.you can never sneak up on the enemy they know your comming before you do. Do not buy do not even rent this it is a waste of your money and time	-1
NOTHING SPECIAL, but i don't hate it so it gets 2 stars	-1
I love first person shooters, and when I saw some of the screen shots for the new Turok game I was excited.  I rented this game last weekend and I was thourghly disappointed.  First, the game takes forever and a day to load up, which I have never experienced before on a console.  Second, while the graphics are not bad, they are not a great use of the gaming systems capabilities.  As for the game play, well, it's horrible.  It takes one forever to get used to the controls and then the play is unispiring and boring.  The game goes from insanely difficult and times to just plain easy.  The AI is also sometimes too hard, then just too easy.  I did not like the flow of the game or it's style.  While I did not get to use the multiplayer function, I'm assuming it to not be bad, so this maybe a good rental, but if you are looking for a good first person shooter, don't get this.	-1
For PS2 or XBOX I'd give this game about 3 STARS (3.7 Stars on a REAL 1 to 5 scale) The main thing is that on XBOX and PS2 you can choose the control button configuration that you prefer to use or are good at using. On Gamecube you are stuck at using the one they give you or you can just reverse the way they give you. But the game with that exception is a 3.7 stars. I suggest buy it for XBOX. Or maybe PS2. But if you can't get an XBOX than if you can live with the controls it's worth BUYING, IF you don't have any better First Person Shooter games. If you do have some other shooter games that are as good as Halo or even on that level I say rent it and then decide for yourself if you got to have it or if renting it will do it for you.	-1
i found some elements of this game good, and some bad. i was impressed by the weapons selection (the knife was awesome) and the graphics, but the overall game play was kinda rotten.  pros: great graphics awesome weapons good storyline cool death animations  cons: horrible melee combat 'sluggish' gameplay hard controls  overall, i would not recommend this game, as there are many better games out there.	-1
Soldier of Fortune II : Double Helix is a fps set in the real world. You play John Mullins, a black-ops soldier taking on an evil organisation which tries to spread a deadly virus. The game takes place in different parts of the world from dense colombian forest, snowlands, a ship, an aeroplane ect. The multiplayer gameplay is great and fun online but the single player gameplay is dull with poor level design and dumb enemy ai. The game is very hard because the enemies are very strong and the hero takes a lot of damage in a single shot. The game seem to cheat a bit, i don't know how the alarm goes on in the stealth missions and some enemies seems to be in god mode like the snippers in the first mansion level. The hero also keep of playing with his weapon, like he throws his shotgun in the air and catches it which makes me very angry. The random mission generator is boring and unplayable because it does allow save games. Sof2 is built on the quake3 engine, i played it on the OpenGL video mode and it runs great. The graphics and sound are great, the swimming pool in the mansion level is very beautifull, but most of the game is brown in color. The load times are very long and unlike other q3a games like rtcw and mohaa the quick loading is not instant. Sof1 was a great game and i have even played the game till late night, this one does not even come close, It is very boring and dull. Soldier of Fortune II's single player is disappointing but the multiplayer is good.	-1
I agree with virtually everything va_dave wrote in his review, but nonetheless I came away with an overall sense of having enjoyed myself. For a while. I liked the single-player mode enough to finish it. It reminds me a lot of Deus Ex (in part because of the voice-over actors.) I wish they would have included Deus Ex's weapon carrying limit. On one hand they try to emulate realisim with super-graphic violence, but then they let players carry fourteen rifles. Silly! It's VERY linear...so much so that I couldn't finish certain missions without having to go back into the house to exit through a specific window (in Colombia.) The AI is not great, neither for your enemies nor your team-mates, and I wish I could move more things...nothing but trolleys blocking your way in the hospital, which seem nailed to the floor. The game looks good, as you'd expect from the Q3 engine. Unfortunately, I ultimately got stuck in a level called Kamchatka, and could not leave. I killed everybody, took out the safety grid, but was not able to complete the last task. I spent twenty minutes at three different times running around the map...no way out. Stupid. I can't help but wonder what I missed, and believe me, it couldn't have been obvious. Like. I play a lot of these games, virtually every FPS that coems to market (everything from serious Sam to Jedi Outcast to No One Lives Forever.) I can't stand poor level design. Sigh. The violence is gratuitous, no question about it, but you knew that before you read this review. Multiplayer feels Quake-like. I still prefer (the very tired) Counter-Strike, and I'm surprised they didn't emulate it. Limit players to one main and one back-up weapon which can be bought at the outset of the round, or picked up in the game. I really enjoy First Person Shooters, but would enjoy something new as well. Let's face it...we're all waiting for Duke Nukem to return, and show us how it's done.	-1
First off why does this game look so much worse than MOHAA, RTCW, and Jedi Outcast? Anyways the missions are boring and repetive. It has an outragous storyline. The missions don't have any real purpose until you beat the game and acually think about what you've done. The weapons are pretty close to real life. But the best feature of this game and SOF 1 is the gore. This game would be very boring without it. The muliplay is good, but it adds nothing new or revolutionary to the multiplayer enviroment. Overall is a VERY average game.	-1
In their quest to crank up the realism, activism forgot to make this game even half as fun as the first SOF.  You die constantly by unseen forces (a grenade from above *POOF* you're gone) which I'm sure is pretty realistic for one man taking on armies, but the net result is you spend A LOT of time looking at the loading screen (and if anyone tells you they don't spend a LOT of time with that screen, they're lying).  I don't mind dying if I blow it or the AI beats me, that's the mark of a well-designed game with appropriate difficulty.  But constant, random death isn't "difficult", it's boring.  Also the aiming is terrible--totally lacking the violent satisfaction of the first SOF.  You can shoot at the same guy forever and not know whether you got him untill he blows your head off (even on the novice setting).  Pumping whole clips into a baddy only to have him pop up and ice you with the same model of weapon you just emptied at him is nothing but frustrating.  Most of SOF2 feels like the tedious part of Allied Assault where you're being sniped by unseen enemies.  Some people got off on the "realism" of that level, but most people who have a life and play video games for FUN (what a concept) hated slogging through that die-a-thon.  For those of us whose grin muscles still ache from playing Jedi Knight 2, it's one helluva comedown.	-1
If you've played the 1st Icewind Dale, you may be disappointed by this one. While it has a superior character system and UI, using 3.5e rules instead of 2e, giving you far more customization and choice when leveling up (feats, talen points, etc), the rest of the game is a bore.  First of all, it lacks the atmosphere of the first games (and of all the D&D games, from NWN to PS:T to BG). The sound effects, for some reason, just aren't very good, and the music sucks. Soule's music was much better than Zur's.  Second, the combat isn't as well-balanced or exciting. In IWD there were many epic and well-done fights, such as Yxunomei.  Third, the plot is one of the worst plots in a video game. There is nothing to it, seriously. No twists, no turns, no depth, no climax. The voice acting and dialogue are cheesy and awful.  Finally, the dungeons and environments are extremely boring and uninspired. In the first game, you had gorgeous dungeons such as Dorn's Deep and the Vale of Shadows to explore. This game reuses too many of the old dungeons and somehow makes them worse than their former selves.  I just WISH they'd remake Icewind Dale 1 and Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 with 3.5e rules. Sadly, they've already remade the latter into "enhanced" editions, which suck and are still in 2e rules.	-1
While this game is a critically acclaimed RPG for its gameplay it fails to meet minimum graphics standards. This has to be one of the ugliest games I have ever played, despite the fact that 2002 (Neverwinter Nights, Morrowind, Arx Fatalis)was a strong year graphically for many great RPGs. Why settle for Icewind Dale II when you can get so much more for the same price?	-1
