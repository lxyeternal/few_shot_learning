These are really cute and I love the education concept, however they are a little hard to open. I have a four year old and one year old and they are always coming to me for help  "Mommy help. Open these." It can be a little frustrating when you can't open them yourself and they are "patiently" waiting.	-1
My son loves this toy.  He got it at about 16 months and loved it right away - he is 19 months now and still loves it and so does his 2 year old cousin.  I am happy because someday when he doesn't care about putting the shapes together it can just be eggs for his play kitchen.  The carton is hard to open, so we just don't snap it shut.	1
Small packaging,  plastic outer part broke within 2 days and is extremely hard to open	-1
What an adorable gift!  I purchased this for a little girl who just celebrated her fifth birthday.  She was ecstatic!  Her mother thought it was a really neat gift, as well.  I mentioned it to one of my girlfriends, who went out and bought one too...but for her two year old.  I think it would be a great gift for all sorts of ages.  I may just get one for my two year old, too.	1
I ordered this butterfly net to house caterpillars we found in our garden. So I will update more once we use the voucher and receive the caterpillars.  As for the net, it seems to be exactly what I thought it would be. The quality is exactly what I would expect for a kids toy.  My 6 and 5 year olds are enjoying checking in on their cocoons every morning. :)	1
My 5 year old neice loved to watch the butterflys grow, it was nice to have indoors so she can see the changes everyday. upon opening the box youll find a voucher for the catepillarswhich will take some time to arrive so don't get this if you excpect to grow them within the same week	1
This was very very cool!! Fun way to watch every stage of growing!! Very easy to take care of ! I would def. buy this again!!!	1
I do daycare and my kiddos were in love with this project. Such a fun time to watch the changes, and then release the butterflies.	1
Awesome tent! Super easy to put together, lightweight and compact when packed up. Great for using for indoor play (pretending to be camping or whatever) and outdoor use as well. Its really lightweight when assembled so use rocks or something heavy inside it so the wind doesn't blow it away if no one is in it. We've had this for years and its still in great shape.	1
Love our tunnel!  the only bad part is this extra flap thingy that I guess is for attaching it to something else.  It gets in the way, otherwise it is awesome. long enough for 3 girls to fit in and then play peek a boo throught the mesh windows!!! LOVE IT!	1
We got this for the kids (3.5 and 8 months) for Christmas, but I don't know who enjoyed it more: Uncle Phillip, the cat, or the kids. It was rolled in, jumped on, worn, clawed, and chewed on. It's durable and easy to collapse. It's fun to pop it out when the kids are bored and then put it right away before bed.  I could really use about 3 of these, velcroed together end to end in a big circle with the kids trapped inside. It might give me a minute of rest!	1
I bought this toy when my son was just over 6 months old and crawling. The tubular construction is padded so it is easy on the knees.  Another thing that made it a great choice is the peek windows that allow the child to see you or crawl towards where they hear your voice.  My son is now almost 5 and it is still one of his favorite toys.  He and his friends pull it out and have a blast.  The best thing is that it is so well made that it is still in great shape.  My son was a late in life child so we are able to buy just about anything we want for him, and we do. (Although we do rotate and give to charity quite often to keep him from having too much) So when I say this is in the top 5 of all the toys ever....it is saying something.  So much so that I am ordering another one for our 7 month old nephew for Christmas.	1
Great Buy!	1
Nice quality for the price	1
The closure on the carton is very flimsy. I can see it breaking in the near future and the eggs are pretty hard to open but my son still loves it!	1
There was mixed reviews on this toy, so I thought I'd share my thoughts on this since I just got it today.  Pros- FUN toy for my 2 year old to learn shapes & matching them up together. Also great eye-hand coordination. So far, my daughter is loving it!  Con - the box is a bit hard to open and close. Once I figured it out it's a bit easier, but near impossible for my 2 year old. I figured I can eventually throw out the container and put the eggs in something else.  Overall- glad I bought these! Like I said, my daughter likes them! :)	1
My grandson loves it	1
Good gift for my daughter! She loved them	1
Excellent product! My son loves matching the shapes and colors.	1
Used this a few time when we went out with baby, then it turned into a play tent as she got older. Worked great for added protection from the sun, then she had a blast with it as she got older! It has really held up well for the 3 years we've had it, too!	1
I haven't used it but once. It came in handy, and the mat that it comes with is great for that comfort from hard floors!	1
Much better deal than original Lincoln Logs	1
Bought this for my grandson and he loves it.	-1
My 3.5 years old at the time I've bought this set loved it and played with it. Now he is 5 and still like to make more sophisticated construction on occasion.	1
This was awesome!!!	1
My 3 year old LOVED THIS!	1
We bought this tunnel over a year ago for our then-crawling almost-one-year-old. I figured it would encourage her to crawl more, which it did--she loved it!  Now she's a running, screaming, jumping, independent 2 yo who still drags this tunnel out of the back corner of the play area (where I've tried to hide it) and squeals excitedly when we pop it out for her to play in.  Her older sister, who is now 3 1/2, also loves the tunnel. She copies her aunt's ideas and stands upright in the tunnel to pretend she's a monster, or hops with it around her and pretends to be a caterpillar or a frog.  We don't yet have any of the tent accessories, but we build our own tents with sofa cushions and sheets, then stick one end of the tunnel in a gap, and you have a secret entrance to a special hideaway.  This is one of those classic toys that children of all ages can find lots of uses for--it sparks creativity and imagination, and gives Mom a few minutes' break to go clean the kitchen. ;-)  UPDATE: We've now had this tunnel for several years, and despite much use and abuse, it is still in great shape!! My oldest was 3 1/2 when I wrote this original review. She recently turned 8, her younger sister is 6 1/2, and they now have a younger brother who is about to turn 3. They all still LOVE this tunnel! It gets dragged out every so often for everything from building tents to pretending to be dogs in a doghouse to walking around with it over them like a sock and pretending to be a monster. This is probably one of the most useful, long-term toy purchases we've made. I can't think of any other toy we have that has been used this often and has retained this much favor with kids of both genders over so many years and ages and interests.	1
Best game ever, love this version.  My old sequence game has the regular cardboard game top and it's getting worn out.  I wish the company would sell the cards separately as mine are getting so worn	1
Good idea. Bad design. The eggs are hard to open (even for adults). The case is cheap plastic. The latch is tricky to use. My child wants to like this product, but she keeps getting frustrated.	-1
Fun	1
Wonderful toy!	1
These eggs are a HUGE hit with any child I have seen play with them. I will buy more.	1
The eggs are difficult to get apart and whilst younger kids may be able to match the shapes they do not yet have the dexterity to get the eggs apart and back together again. My daughter is four and has difficulty getting the eggs apart. She does use them in her pretend kitchen though. The colors are nice and they look like real eggs - so it is basically a good product, but if you are thinking of them for a two year old think again - they will only get frustrated. Better to wait until they are older unless you can assist.	1
Who doesn't love Frontier Logs?  These must be a part of every child's memories.  Everything was as advertised and was a fast delivery.	1
Our grandson loves to build with this set we recently got him. He became familiar with these at a hospital we visited. We saw he liked them. I have a Lincoln Log set when I was a child & incorporated along with other toys while playing which he seems to do on his own. it has a lot of the small log pieces, so I would recommend keeping everything together in the box when playing is finished so that the next time the child wants to play with it, it will all be there!	1
Good value for what you  get.  Pieces seem strong and durable, but 2 or 3 of them are slightly damaged.  It's like corners were broken off on original cut or something, but they're all smooth and don't really affect the logs or the building fun.  If I could rate 4 1/2 stars I'd have done that because the "damage" really isn't much, but still warrants a non 5-star rating.  Other than that, they're just like the classic lincoln logs so no big surprises.  Value seems really good to me, compared with other logs and also compared with what you'd get for this price when buying some legos.	1
Best birthday gift for a 4 year old boy. He LOVED it. What an amazing idea.	1
Great gift - my niece is still enjoying it.  Gives her something to check on each morning - and helps environment. She is excited.	1
My toddler loved this- it will defend become an annual tradition	1
I bought this for a beach trip for my 9 month old baby at the time, but we never got around to assembling it while we were there.  I just recently broke it out for playtime for my now 14 month old in the basement and ... wow! I'm so confused as to why I let it sit around unused for so long!! It's a snap to put together - even for the directionally & manually challenged. My daughter likes it - one thing I can say is that when closed up, the airflow is obviously a bit stuffy, but she can easily tear down the front flap when she wants - she quite enjoys it.  (I have not yet used it outside so perhaps the airflow factor is a good thing in the cooler weather months.)  I will say that if you are using it on slick or tile floors, to watch the smaller kids getting in and out of it - she's slipped up on it a few times as the mesh becomes almost hazardous against the slicker tile flooring. I can fit inside of it with her at the heigh of 5'6 if I sit / crouch.	1
I found this easy to put together and it was perfect for the beach.  Enough room for my 1 year old granddaughter to either stand or lie down.  The only down side would be that it doesn't come with anything to secure it down, so I bought separate stakes, but other than that, I loved it.	1
Got this for our grandson for shade at the beach/park.  Works well, but there could be a bit more shelter from sunlight on the sides.  Overall, a fine pick, though.	1
Cute tent we took it to the beach for our daughter to sleep in the only thing i wish i would have gotten one that popped up alot of assembly	1
Tunnel is great for multiple kids cuz nobody is fighting over different parts. Entertains for a good long while. Folds up easily & small & stores out of sight. Very durable - we drag kids around the house in it - no tears.	1
Great Family Board Game.	1
Great game good board quality	1
Great	1
Every bit as good as Lincoln Logs, and at a way better value!  Yes, kids CAN break them, but only if they're playing with them like out-of-control beasts.  These stand the test of time. Refreshing change of pace from the electronic, blinking, noise making, cheap (but expensive) plastic toys.  It's nice to buy toys that DON'T do all the imagining FOR the kids.  Too much built-in detail in most toys today teaches the kids to depend on OTHERS' imaginations, and retards their OWN creativity and problem solving. two thumbs up for frontier logs.	1
We have now grown butterflies with this for 2 springs and it is in good enough condition to hold onto it again for next spring. You do have to buy the caterpillars each time which are ridiculously overpriced. But I enjoy it and so do my kiddos.	1
This is our second purchase of this kit.  I ordered 2 this time so that each of my kids (7 & 9) had their own to use.  Clear instructions and everything you need to grow your own butterflies.  Great learning experience for my kids.  Highly recommend this.	1
My 4 year olds learned about butterflies in school this year. They have been obsessed with the little insects for about 9 months now. This butterfly habitat is great for them to see the life cycle up close, with all the instructions on how to keep them alive! We have bought this for several birthday gifts for friends and family as well. It is always a big hit. I like that you choose when to get the caterpillars, so that if you have a vacation planned, the little guys aren't frying in your mailbox waiting for your return. The instructions are easy to follow and they guarantee that at least a portion of the creatures will form a chrysalis and emerge as butterflies. Every one we have purchased has been successful for all 5, so far, so I have not had to contact the company if there is a failure.	1
Birthday gift for my 4 year old granddaughter---SHE LOVED IT	1
I got this for my almost 3 year old son's birthday- he's absolutely thrilled!  The eggs are kinda hard to pull apart while it's new, but once the initial stiffness wears off, this is the most awesome toy- I knew after watching my son go for this same toy in every home, school or office we visited that had them, that this would be one of his favorite Christmas presents... and it was and still is!	1
The eggs are great and will likely be a staple toy in the play kitchen at our house for a long time. The case broke really quickly though. I love that the eggs are fun for pretend play and that there is a shape and color matching element as well.	1
My MIL had some of these from when my husband was just a wee one and the grand kids still love them so I was thrilled when I found them. the kids love the puzzles and also play pretend kitchen with them.	1
My kids got these in their easter baskets this year (2 & 3). They have fun playing w/them and matching them up. The carton is hard for them to open & close, so I have to help w/that. Cute game.	1
My kids ages 2 1/2 and 18 months LOVE this tunnel. We got it for the kids for Christmas and keep it put away and bring it out about 3X a week in the evenings when we have had a slow day and the kids didn't get any energy out. They go CRAZY, they play and run and scream and crack up! My husband drags them through the house super fast and they sit in it and laugh their butts off. You can play peek a boo, or roll balls through it, the possibilities are endless! It's by far the BEST gift. The kids don't fight over it, no one gets hurt, it doesn't break, it's SO cool ! It folds in no time and folds so small, it doesn't take up any room. BUY THIS!!!	1
My 8-year-old son has been using (and abusing) this tunnel for six years now.  He doesn't just crawl in it... He also throws it around the house and yard, walks around with it over his body like a Mummenshanz puppeteer, and bends it, hooks, it, stuffs it, and otherwise tries his darndest to wreck it.  And you know what?  The tunnel has held up perfectly.  No rips, tears, holes, broken hoops... It seems almost indestructible!  Definitely one of the best investments I've made in my son's play life.  Since I first wrote this review, my daughter started playing with this tunnel.  She's five now, and is just as rough on the thing as my son is.  Still holding up, still great fun.	1
We used this for our son at 7 months old. Just have to make sure you have something heavy inside otherwise the wind will blow it away. Otherwise, it worked for us.	1
This was a very fun activity for summer with my preschool-aged boys. The net cage is high quality. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. We ended up adding on an extra cup of caterpillars at a discounted price and 10 out of 10 are now butterflies. I could not be happier with the experience!!! (Side note: while there is an included voucher for the caterpillars, you will have to pay a $7.95 shipping fee. Not a big deal, but I was not expecting that when I placed the order.)	1
Great game	1
This is great for memory and also can be used for thematic play.  We use it to crack and pretend that we are baking.  The pieces are a little tight but kids can separate the egg halves.  The eggs sometimes can stuck in the case if they are put in there separated.	1
My one year old loves eggs, so when I found this I thought it would be a great toy for her.  And I was correct, she took to it right away.  She loves her eggs and has hours of fun taking them apart and putting them back together.  It helps her with her colors, matching skills, and shapes.  Also, it helps her with her hand eye coordination.  I give it 4 stars because some of the eggs are a bit too hard for her to pull apart and some that come apart with barely a touch.  The round shape had to be glued back in.  Overall I recommend this toy.	1
My girls love this.  It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well.  I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead.  The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic.	1
The garden is very nice and will keep all the butterflies very happy as you watch the process.	1
Bought the cup of 10 along with the book "The Hungry Caterpillar" for my 3 year old.  Most of them didn't move at all.  l gave it a few days, but it was clear, out of 10, only one was moving, eating and growing.  That one did end up being a chrysalis and turning into a butterfly.  The other 9 were clearly dead on arrival.  Amazon made it right by sending us another kit. This time from arrival, you can tell right away that most of them were alive as they were active, except 1. So 9 caterpillars.  They all ate the food in the cup and became very fat...  They turned themselves into a cocoon. One fell down early, so 8 left.  3 more fell down, so we reattached them to qtips.  Then we waited and waited.  1 emerged, but then fell down from the qtip while it still had to unfold it's wing, so it became deformed and died.  1 got stuck trying to emerge... And after struggling for literally hours (it would appear dead, but when I checked on it, it would flutter... Then go still again) it finally succumbed and died.  Two appeared much darker then the other chrysalis and I thought they were dead too, but nope, they were still alive, and became butterflies along with 4 other... So we got a total of 6 butterflies.  Honestly... I don't know why... But... These butterflies aren't like normal butterflies... Maybe the way they were hatched, lived and grow or what... But even after the first day of emerging... You can tell they would never survive if we let them go because they don't seem to be "flying" normally. Flutter yes, but they would fall down after a few feet.... Kind of deformed I guess.  I gathered some flowers, and made the sugar water for them, and they did seem to eat....  All in all, I think it was a cool experiment. Kind of expensive, so it was a special treat. I don't think it was anything we did that made them "special" since in the 2- 2.5 weeks it took from arrival to butterflies, we were out of the house for more then half that time. The other times, it was on a dresser drawer away from the kids.  She likes to look at them Occassionally, and I would hold her up to see them, but she wasn't that interested as it was just a chrysalis for the most part, but when they emerged to become butterflies, she was super excited and got to watch so that in itself was worth it.  Thanks to Amazon though, I rate it 4 stars	1
This is basically the net cage, a pipette, and a half price voucher for the cup of caterpillars. THE PRICE OF THE CATERPILLARS IS NOT INCLUDED. They haven't even told me how many I should expect. But. My 5 year old is super excited now and I pretty much have to buy the caterpillars for "a small $8 fee for shipping and handling".	-1
We bought this for a camping trip.  Great to contain my not yet crawling infant.  Wish the velco for the screen was a zipper.  If that was the case, this product would have gotten a five.	1
Took it to the beach for naps for my 9 month old granddaughter. Worked well for a changing zone (less movement due to fewer distractions). My daughter sat inside to nurse her because of fewer distractions when inside. We did set it under a canopy to keep temps down. Easy to set up and take down.	1
great game	1
Caterpillars came in time as expected and all 5 survived. They are very lethargic for the first 2 days I even thought they were dead but they perked up. My son loved watching them grow!	1
My daughter informed me she needed eggs for her kitchen.  I bought these simply because they opened . . . but, she is going to go crazy when she realizes they are like a puzzle too.  (she loves puzzle and to organize) Can't wait to giver her these for Christmas!	1
I bought this for my 2 year old to help her learn her shapes.  She loves it and it does a great job serving its purpose.  A must have.	1
We had these eggs 30 years ago when my children were babies, and I was so happy to see that they are still available for my grandchildren to play with. Perfect for kitchen play, these span a wide age range.	1
The squeaky egg set comes apart instantly, the eggs are very shallow. These eggs are bigger, stay together longer, there are actual shapes that matter. The squeaky ones have a shape only on the bottom of the carton which is just annoying. More to do with these eggs, and we have chickens so good play eggs are important!	1
My son just loves these eggs! I really like that he has to match up a shape and a color to get the eggs put back together. One thing that I don't like about other shape sorters is that kids can shove the wrong shape through different holes and then you completely miss the point. With this sorter, the only option is the RIGHT SHAPE! Otherwise, the eggs just won't fit together. Great idea!	1
We loved this experience so much and we are already planning on doing it again next year! All around an amazing experience for kids and adults.	1
The caterpillars are free , but there is a $15 S&H fee.	-1
My daughter's friend was excited to receive it on her birthday.	1
Got this for my 5y/o grand daughter. We are near the time for release of the butterflies & I know that will be bittersweet for her.	1
Infant tent was easy to assemble. The size is perfect for infant (ours is 6 months old) Would recommend for quality & price.	1
Excellent game for family play and friend entertainment. Highly recommend	1
Very fun game!!	1
Great gift for kids	1
My granddaughter loved this garden. Caterpillars (5) came quickly ....and all turned into butterflies !	1
Our 5 month old loved this when we went to Mexico.  It lets a great breeze through and is sturdy	1
Bought this for a beach trip with a toddler and an infant. Did what it was supposed to do, however not as easy to setup as I'd hoped. I'll give it this -- very well made. I'm sure we'll use it again, especially now that I have it figured out. The instructions were a bit lacking, and quite honestly probably what made it difficult for me to setup. Don't over-think the setup and you'll be okay. Just do it. It's not all that difficult after the initial setup. Might try setting up a time or two at home for practice before needing it out "in the field", so to speak!	1
Kids love science, and they love to watch things grow. Great product to watch butterflies emerge from their chrysalis. Highly recommend for school aged kids.	1
Worked exactly as expected. All 5 of our butterflies hatched. Only one was not able to fly away. I would and will buy more butterflies and do this again!	1
We purchased this tent for a recent beach trip with our 2 year old. The assembly was super easy and it folds up small enough to fit in my beach tote. I would suggest planning to place something heavy in the bottom to avoid being blown by the wind when the child is not inside, but otherwise, it's perfect!	1
I'm never a good judge of the size of things when I look at the spec's I'm a more visual person so I was really wondering if this was going to be big enough for my 8 month old nephew. But when it arrived I was quite happy and surprised by its actual size. I'm a medium build 160 pound women and it fits me and the little guy with some room to spare if I'm sitting cross legged. Its extremely easy to set up and take down and light weight to carry around the yard with him on my hip. I bought this one because it also has a thin foam mat insert and not many of the others had that. I do wish that it was a little thicker for when we're on hard ground but I usually just put a pillow in behind him as well. It keeps him well shaded and visible while we work in the garden. My only complaint is that I wish the door zipped up instead of having velco because it only took my nephew 5 minutes to learn how to pull the door open and reach out to grab a handful of dirt which is what we didn't want him to do. But if we put his back to the door and spread out all his toys infront of him it usually keeps him busy.	1
I purchased this for my daughter with my grand daughter to use while on beach vacation.  My daughter loves this tent. The well ventilated play tent is the perfect place to shelter a baby to nap or play under the sun at the beach. It's quick and easy set up.	1
This whole process was so fun!  All 5 of our catepillars turned into butterflies, my 3 year old was thrilled.  We'll definitely be doing it again!	1
We love doing this year after year.	1
Days of fun!!	1
Great product but terrible customer service and overpriced	-1
Works great. Just don't make the same mistake I did (my own fault) - you have to order the critters separately.	1
Amazing!! Easy steps to follow- all five caterpillars turned into butterflies. We even got to watch two of them actually hatch! Watched them for about a week, then released them. Couldn't have asked for anything better!	1
great family game a big hit here-easy to learn how to play	1
Very satisfied!	1
This is a functional play tent for our little ones (have a two and a half year-old and one-year-old twins) and for the most part, we're liking it. Set-up is a snap and takes maybe 5 minutes. The tent itself holds its shape well and the included pad provides decent padding on the floor of the tent. The only issue we have with it is that there's not much weight to it and if only one child is in there and stands up, they could actually tip it over (luckily it was within arm's reach). We've largely taken care of that by adding additional padding underneath the included pad and positioning, but it would have been nice to know about beforehand. All-in-all, it's a nice play tent for the price and fun for the little ones.	1
Doesn't contain child, just Velcro closures.  But cute for the beach to keep them out of the sun.  My boys seem to like going in and out the most.  Keeps sand out of the food if they eat in there instead of on a towel.	1
Wish we'd known that the cost of shipping the caterpillars adds another $7.95 to the price. The size of the habitat has also decreased by 50% size we last purchased this set, which was about 5 years back.  Overall,  a beautiful experience. However, in my opinion,  a very small pop-up net should not cost $20.	-1
This was an inspired choice of Easter gift from my mother to my four year old son. I must admit I was horrified when it arrived, but we diligently set it up and used the included coupon to apply for the cup of caterpillars. When they arrived they were tiny and barely moving - I thought they were dead. They slowly started moving more and more. Then one day we thought one of them had been eaten by the others! He was all in chunks!! Turned out that was the first time they shed their skins. They kept doing it, until they were enormous. I shuddered whenever i saw them, they were so disgusting. But my son was busy reading the national geoepgraohic live cycle book my mother had sent him (I reccomend getting this) collecting them leaves, and tending to his caterpillars. Eventually they grew very big and started building their chrysalis's. Still disgusting!! We then rearranged the cup lid so they hung down from it. Then yesterday we watched as five beautiful butterflies emerged. My son was delighted! It was truly incredible, their crumpled wings opened up and slowly turned from brown to beautiful colors. We fed them pineapple, watermelon and orange and they all feasted. This morning we collected fresh flowers for their breakfast, then went outside and set them free. They emerged one by one and did huge shaky loops of the garden as they tried out their wings for the first time. They soared around us in bigger and bigger loops - it was incredible.	1

It was very fast shipping once we ordered the caterpillars.  It has been so fun watching them grow and develop.  My 5 and 7 year old daughters wake up each morning excited to see what changes have taken place overnight.  We are sad to say goodbye to them tomorrow, but it's really awesome to know that they may lay eggs nearby and will hopefully visit our flower garden.  We will definitely keep the kit and purchase additional cups of caterpillars in the future.  In the video I've attached, you can see the cup of caterpillars and how very, very tiny they are when they arrive.  There is a guarantee that at least 3 of the 5 will grow to adult size.  We had 4 from each cup grow to adult size.  You can then see one of the first to come out of the chrysalis.  It isn't great quality video at that point because it can focus through the net, but you can see the entire garden and can start getting an idea of how big everything is.  After that one came out, I just set the camera up on a tripod and recorded until the one above it emerged.  It's pretty cool to see it from start to finish!  Overall, it's incredibly simple to care for this kit, the caterpillars, chrysalises, and butterflies.  What an inexpensive and fun way to engage with young children and teach them to really appreciate the beauty of nature!  I hope this review has been helpful for you!  If so, please press yes.  If you have any questions about this product, I'd be happy to help answer them.	1
The price keeps soaring along with the butterflies!  I've purchased these kits for our kindergarten class for at least the past 10 year but based on the increase this year - Caterpillars went from $5 to $7.95 and the kit went from $12 to $19.99 - we will do more of a Do-it-Yourself Science project.  It's definitely not worth that price!	-1
Loved this for my nephew!	1
This was SO much fun, and worth the experience with our kids.	1
We loved this!!! All of the butterflies hatched. A really cool project!	1
We tried out a tunnel at a Gymboree class and she loved it. I like the mesh so I can see what she is doing without sticking my head in. I have it propped between pillows so it doesn't roll as much. My daughter is 7 months old and it looks safe, I am not sure what small pieces they are referring to on the warning label. My sister gets in the tube with her and chases her out. It folds down easy and doesn't take up a lot of space. Using it indoors when we are forced to hibernate for the winter!	1

Our daughter loves to crawl through the tunnel so that she can "explore" the other side - and so does our cat. The tunnel is lightweight and can collapsed so that it takes up very little room during storage (see the video). it takes less than a minute to open and collapse the tunnel - so set-up and clean-up is a snap!  Pros  - You can see through the tunnel, so it does eliminate a potential hiding place - Set-up and clean-up is a snap (although be careful when you "uncoil" the tunnel it does unleash with a bit of force). - Takes up very little room during storage - it is fun!  Areas for Improvement  - The mesh can snag - not too big of a deal, but you should expect a few snags.  Final Verdict - A nice option if you are looking for a tunnel for your child to crawl through!  4 Stars	1
So excited for my grand daughter to use.  It's great	1
Bought it to take camping when our baby was 9 months old. We used it for outdoor naps. Roomy and comfy. Great way to keep baby safe and out of the sun.	1
Great for beach or playing in the yard all day.  Nice coverage, pretty easy to get up, not really a "pop-up" though.  Will not keep all bugs out but will keep most of them away.  Great for if you are working outside in the yard and the infant is playing or the baby wants a nap.  Then they can get fresh air and you can get some work done.  Also good for beach, travels small, but there will be sand inside and again, not a "pop-up" so if you are on a beach in the sun, get ready to sweat.	1
The Description Says It is for kids up to two years old, but my child easily tips this over at sixteen months by pushing on the walls, not safe at all. If the tent had not been sitting partially under my kitchen table, my kid would have slapped his face right into the tile floor.  Reading one of the other posts about this product containing lead, it's going back for sure.	-1
I really like this tent, but we broke it after just a few months' use.  I like the removable mat; it's thick & offers lots of cushion.  The price point was good for us.  We used it in the living room, the yard, and the beach with our ~1 year old.  Unfortunately, one of the plastic tubes of the poles bent and now the tent doesn't work quite right.  I will investigate getting a replacement.  Given that as an adult trying to be careful, I easily messed up the pole, I'm not sure how well this tent would stand up to abuses by older kids.  It's a cute tent, but be careful when you're setting it up & taking it down.	1
fun little toy for the kids	1
We love this tunnel!!  My kids love it & it is big enough for Mama & Daddy to play in it too.  We've had ours for a year & a half or so.  My only beef is the velcro straps that are used to keep it closed can snag the mesh if not very careful, but so far no holes from the velcro, just very slight snags... I may cut it off & tie it closed w/something else that doesn't have the snag risk, however, I haven't yet done so because I honestly don't want to leave something separate laying around when the tunnel is in use... just a choking hazard & something to lose.  I may end up taking the hook part of the velcro off of the closure strap & adding KAM snaps to the straps instead.  We bought two of these as gifts after seeing what a big hit it is w/our kiddos!	1
Bought this for my kindy this year so we could watch the lifecycle of a butterfly. It was amazing! The net is easy to clean, very lightweight and portable, and the perfect size for 4 or 5 butterflies!	1
Very fun	1
great for the kids	1
My little guy (10 months old) screams when I try to put him in this in our backyard, which is a big reason I bought this, to keep him protected from sun and bugs while his older siblings played. I even put a blanket down in it and tons of toys. So keep in mind that if your baby is mobile they might not think much of being 'trapped'. I will say for some reason he did okay in it at the beach, once, and my older kids love it so it was't a complete waste of money, it just won't serve the purpose I bought it for.	1
This tent is really cheap, and I dare to say it's dangerous for kids, it arrived with brown stains (like it was used) and one of the poles set was broken, it went directly to trash because I don't want to return it and make them able to send it again to another kid. Awful, awful, awful!!!	-1
Put this out in the hall at my son's first bday, and all the kids LOVED it, walkers and crawlers alike.  It folds down easily enough to take it to a friend's house, and even more sensitive kids aren't afraid to get inside since it's transparent.  Even my 15 year old cat likes to play in it.  The velcro  for the storage straps can get caught on the walls of the tunnel if it is latched carefully, but so far no holes.	1
I actually ordered these to protect my sofa from my dogs--they've got full access to the house and yard when we're away; but after two sets of destroyed sofas, I decided something had to be done. So I ordered these and placed them on the sofa and it keeps them off! Cost much less than the Sofa Savers at Petco!	1
Our son loves playing with this.  He loves going back and forth in it and playing with his toys dragging them with him through the tunnel.  Can't wait for our new baby so they can play together with this.	1
Best. Gift. Ever.  So cool.	1
This was slightly disappointing! I opened the box to get the Boucher so I could send off for the caterpillars and hopefully receive before Easter and there wasn't one!	-1
Easy to put up, great for indoor play. My 1 year old son loved it when he received it, and still does 6 months later. My dogs also like to think of it as a big dog house. I sometimes remove the tunnel and collapse it to save space, so that's really a nice feature. It's a cute way to give the little ones a small space of their own while still being in the room with you. Also has helped some gross motor skills with crawling through the tunnel and learning to duck in and out of the front door. Would recommend to someone who has the space to have it inside in a play area.	1
I wanted a tent I could easily pop up & take down for my toddler bc we live in a small house. This tent is very easy to assemble, and has also done just fine with my 7 month lab puppy bolting through it.	1
My 2.5 year old and 11 month old love this tunnel. The closures are easy enough for my oldest to undo and it folds up small enough that I store it underneath my youngest child's crib (which is currently on the lowest mattress level.) Great product!	1
my son absolutely loves this tube it is very easy to put away and to store away. it is made to last can't wait to bring it outside	1
I have a 10 month old grandson and a 3 1/2 year old grandson and I wanted something for both boys to be able to play with either by themselves or together.  The Fun Tube is just the right toy for this.  The 10 month old crawls through easily and the 3 1/2 year old crawls after him and vice versa and lets them play together for a while and seems to break the age difference down.  They play wonderfully together with the Fun Tube!!  The tube itself if very durable and is big and long but it can quickly store away easily into a small, flat circle that keep together with Velcro strips.  It can be used outside or inside and is very light weight.  Lots of fun for the boys!	1
My grand daughter is 16 months old and loves this tube. She sits in the middle of the tube and giggles.	1
I gave this to my 1 year old for his birthday and his 4 year old brother seems to be just as entertained by it. It had a very strong smell when it came out of the package, but it seems to be airing out quickly. Folds up easily and takes up very little space.	1
I have not even opened this yet, but I will update you as soon as my son goes to play with it...but it shipped and we recieved within two days or ordering it! Hope my soon to be one year old will enjoy this as his first birthday present!	1
really enjoyed this set.  the first set of butterflies didn't hatch, but the company quickly sent out replacements at no charge.  the 2nd batch yielded 5 butterflies.  the kids loved waking up each morning to check on progress.  would recommend.	1
Didn't like the fact to send out mail plus $5 for larva, but anyhow we captured our own and watched the whole cycle. It's smaller than I expected, we had about 7 caterpillars and was a bit cramped for them. Regardless, it's neat lil cage net for them:0)	1
I prefer this butterfly net over other brands (where the drawstring net has to be hung on a base with a hook). So much easier to use this! Price is great too, such great value. This is great for classroom, the kids are enjoying seeing the butterfly's life cycle! Insect Lore has never let us down!!	1
We've used ours a few times now (order the caterpillars from amazon, they're cheaper after using the initial coupon). My boys love it every time!	1
Ordered 12 of these for favors for my nature-loving daughter's butterfly birthday party.  The guests loved them, but will have to wait to order the butterflies.  The butterfly habitat itself is a good size.	1
3 or 4th time ordering. A must have for Spring.	1
I purchased this for my infant son to use while on a beach vacation. When it arrived I put it up, by myself, in my living room. The assembly is simple with only 2 poles to insert into the pockets on the tent- it probably took me 5 minutes total. The pad that you lay on the bottom is a really nice feature as it will provide a comfortable place for my baby to lay instead of having to lay on the hard ground. Taking the tent down is just as easy. The tent and poles fit in the provided storage bag, but the pad (which is like a kindergarten sleep mat) does not fit in the provided bag, so you will have to fold it up and find somewhere else to put it when you take the tent somewhere. This is not that big of deal, but I thought I would mention it. The entry door to the tent has a velcro closure. It does not come with any stakes or anything else to hold the tent in place, except the weight of whatever is inside. This is an easy fix- I am just going to bring some camping stakes that we have with us in case it gets windy. The colors are cute and the tent seems to be of good quality. It will work perfect for what I needed it for and I am glad I made this purchase.	1
We took this tent on vacation with us for our 9 month old son to use on the beach.  We needed something to contain him and keep him out of the sand.  Super portable and fun for him and his brother to play in.	1
We love this game!  We've given it as a family gift too and it's a hit every time.  Even though it's a real game of strategy it's easy to pick up and the games don't last too long.  We play it often.  Highly recommended family game.	1
If this is a cushioned surface I'd hate to see what a non cushioned surface look like. I'd also like to see 12 players crowded around this tiny little board. That WOULD be a sight. Four players max. I think I'm going to glue to a hard surface	1
I bought this for my grandson's second birthday, and it was a big hit with him.  I'm sure he could have used a smaller tent, but I knew his sisters would try to get into it too, so I went for a pretty big tent for a 2 year old.  He loves to crawl through the tunnel to get into it.  His older sisters like to take a book inside and read to him.  The tent is easy to assemble and move around.  It's study and the colors are great.  Very pleased with this product.	1
This tent is so much better than a lot of the other ones on the market.  It doesn't bend and fall over constantly like the cheaper ones.  So far it is durable and really good quality too.	1
As soon as I open the box the smell was too much! Did not even took it out of the box, that cannot be safe for children!	-1
My daughter loves playing with this.  It is sturdy and kid proof as well.  Kids have fallen onto it and it springs right back into shape ready for action.  My favorite part is that it easily folds flat for simple storage.  The clear mesh made her a lot more at ease about crawling through the tunnel I think.	1
I bought this in addition to the tent, but this tunnel is just as fun by itself. My one year old loves it.	1
This is a wonderful product.  Our entire family enjoyed this project.  Our children, 5, 7, and 2 even used it for a long time after to collect other bugs and observe them for a few days and then release them.  It did get a hole in it because of a stick used for a katydid habitat.  But I'm planning on ordering another one to replace it.  This time maybe the bigger one.  It is really a great way for kids to observe and learn about nature.	1
We had so much fun doing this! My kids LOVED releasing the butterflies in our backyard once they were ready. Very fun process. Didn't take long to get the caterpillars (or whatever they're called) at all. My sons teacher did it and told me about it, their entire class loved it too!	1
Very fun.	1
I experienced this life cycle when I was 5 and in kindergarten my teachers got it because we were learning about the life cycle of a butterfly I loved going to school to see how big they got over night then the special day that the cocoons hatched some of the parents came (including my mom) we all stood outside and the teachers opened the net habitat thing and we watched them fly away but it was 4 years ago so I don't remember if the life cycle happened fast	1
Great experience watching the life cycle of caterpillars to butterflies.  My daughters were in tears watching their butterflies fly free!	1
amazing experience for my kids. Highly recommend.	1
Bought this for my autistic nephew. He loves it and will sit inside for quite some time providing his mom a break. Worth every penny.	1
I got this to replace the fort my LO (13-mo) created under a table I had temporarily setup for a party. She loved peeking out from under the tablecloths and taking toys under there to play.  PRODUCT DETAILS The product I received is as pictured expect that the "corner pockets" on mine are black rather than the red shown in the product picture.  When I first opened the product I was concerned with the smell. After putting it together I let it air out a bit outdoors.  There are (2) side windows: one is located in the rear, the other is on the left side (from the outside, looking at the front of the tent).  The floor of the tent is like a tarp. I think it will be easy to clean, though, the sides of the tent may stain if there are accidents.  The "corner pockets" aren't very deep and I suspect I way experience a pole slipping out if play gets too rowdy. They are, however, made of strong material and I do not expect any issues of the poles poking through them.  The interior of the tunnel makes for a smooth crawl (even where the rings are). I don't expect any issues of skin irritation from rough material while using this.  Given that there are no tie downs for this and the bottom is not weighted in any way, this is quite flimsy and blows a bit too easily in the wind when outside.  ASSEMBLY I was able to assemble this in under 10-mins (including distractions from a toddler)solo. The instructions are easy to follow.  The tunnel does not use any type of straps to secure it to the tent once attached. it is made to fit IN a window. Due to the orientation of the tent in my space I set it up to have the tunnel in the front opening. It seems it will hold well, but will need adjustments at [and sometimes during] play time.  USE I am quite tiny so fitting in this with my child was comfortable. I could also fit comfortably with one more child similar in size to her. I think she and two other friends would fit comfortably with toys and have room to move and play.  I intend to order some sort of floor cushions to place inside to add a bit of weight and soften the surface inside. On its own, the floor is not uncomfortable, but given how my LO will use the space (tumbling a bit, possibly falling asleep) a bit more cushion would fit our needs. The tarp is not sticky and is a fine play surface on its own. This adjustment is purely for our preference.  The mesh sections allow for adequate light to filter through during play.  I was able to get enough flex w/o removing the poles when trying to fit it through a doorway to place on balcony.  BOTTOM LINE For this price I would like to see them include some sort of mat/cushion to go on the tent floor. I think this is good for indoor use, but seems too flimsy to comfortably use outside. My LO seems to be comfortable inside it and handled the tunnel with ease. I recommend this for indoor use.	1
This is great! Lots of fun and super durable. It's durability may be its only drawback because the wire that provides the structure for the tube is uncomfortable to lay on. But that is the only drawback. It doesn't slow our girls down much from enjoying this fun tube!	1
My granddaughter (4) really enjoys  this tube.  It became her "chrysalis" and she became a "butterfly" (her Mother is into butterfly herding).  She also likes to walk around in it with her head sticking out so it's on it's way to being a costume of some sort.  She liked it so much I bought one for another of my grandchildren and am awaiting feedback.  The tube lends itself to a lot of imaginative ideas and creative games.  I had seen similiar ones in a preschool setting but not as colorful. I'm glad I got it for her.	1
Love this game! Super easy to learn and super fun to play. I'm a heavy board gamer, I was surprised to see a game that I find in a typical toy store THAT interesting! You can play this game with almost any number of players, and its replayability is still as interesting as the first game. Highly recommended.	1
Bought this to play with grandchildren. Looks interesting.	1
I don't know why people believe this tent tips over.  My son has tried...and tried...and tried - from all sides!  It holds its own very well against my toddler.  We use it inside as a little play tent and he loves it.  He will drag his toys inside and play.  I put a blanket at the bottom (which may be why it doesn't tip over) and he will sit in there for quite some time.  I consider it his little home away from home - at least until he is old enough to have a real tent.  Very easy to put together and break down.  Instructions are simple and they even provide a little storage bag.	1
We love the butterfly garden at our house. This is the second one we have bought as the first one was used so much it developed holes. We love watching butterflies grow and putting all different kinds of bugs inside our very own butterfly garden!	1
Great butterfly habitat. All the butterflies that were delivered lived and we were able to release. We also raised some monarchs who's eggs had been laid  on our milkweed outside.	1
Love this game, only wished I had gotten the Jumbo model, it is Larger writing. Product was new and came in great condition	1
Love this!  Got this for my daughter's 5th birthday, as she is obsessed with butterflies and it's such a great way to learn about their process.  When we received the box I was grateful that the mail in voucher reminded that as soon as it is sent  the live larvae will arrive shortly.  We were just about to leave for vacation so we waited to send it in.  Once we did, we received 6 larvae and 3 of them turned into butterflies.  My daughter loved checking in on them and watching their progress. I was a little nervous about transferring the lid to the pop up habitat but found this helpful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt20TOkBCXY.  The transfer was fairly smooth but one did fall off in the process and, as expected, didn't transform.  Overall I would get this again, in fact my daughter has asked for this exact gift for her next birthday.	1
My 4 yo loved this!	1
Got this for a winter corriculum for home schooling, the only down side is you have to order the catpillers from another web site and it's another 5 dollars	1
Amazing for children to watch and discover.	1
The butterfly garden is such a wonderful, up close and personal way to really observe the stages of a butterfly. It's difficult for younger children to understand just from a book. This brings the "ahah" moment to a child in a fun way and fascinates them! This one was a gift for a special needs boy. Look at that smile on his face!	1
These are super fun for the kiddos.	1
We took our 9 month old baby to the Jersey shore this weekend and the tent arrived quickly and worked out great. It sets up easily and I like that it comes with a pad for the bottom. My baby girl enjoyed playing and sleeping in it both at the beach and in our living room when we set it up the first time after it arrived. We were really glad to have it to protect her from the sun AND the biting green flies that were really bad this particular day. They were biting all of us, including the baby, and we quickly got her in the tent and velcroed it close. We all wanted to get in it at one point, we were getting bit so much! The mesh sides allowed the breeze to get in there and it was shaded nicely. Baby seemed to keep cool and comfortable.	1
We just got this tent and set it up, I am very impressed! Good quality, easy to set up, love the side vents and the front velcro closure. Also love that the bottom is waterproof. We plan to take this camping and will be on beaches, I think it will be great with a blanket in it for baby naps. Love that it will keep the sun off and the bugs out. Love the price too! My only negative is that I don't like that it says Lil' Nursery accross the top, I wish it was blank, or said something else. Or just had a picture or something. Oh well!	1
This is a really fun tent! It fits all three of my kids at the same time. They love to take it outdoors and play with it, which is nice with the SPF protection on a hot and sunny day. My eight month old loves to play with it too, which is useful since its been too hot for him to be in the sun! Its also very easy to put up and take down, and comes with a bag to store the tent. I only wish it were available in more colors rather than just purple/yellow! Overall a great buy! Glad we got it for our beach trip.	1
As described, however, I wish it came with some type of tie down or method to secure it. We don't have a lot of storage space, and have been leaving it outside, but I have to use rocks to keep it weighed down. I put my 4 month old in it on a blanket if I am going to be gardening for a while so that I don't have to leave her inside and use the baby monitor. She gets to be outside in the fresh air, but is protected from the sun.  Update- used this again at around 8 months on a camping trip. My daughter sat and crawled in it for chunks of time and it kept her safe and off the ground. Now she is walking and summer is around the corner. I can see her still using it as a fun play tent in the yard. All in all, a good baby purchase with multiple uses,  which is nice when most of what else you buy is being discarded every few months!  Update again! - My daughter is 14 months old and walking! We have this outdoors in our yard and she enjoys going in and out when she is playing. I plan on taking it on a camping trip in May for her to hang out in.	1
My daughter loves this project we do every year!	1
Ordered the catepillars and did the 14.99 shipping so that I knew they would come alive.  Can't wait to see how they grow.	1
This was a lot of fun for our family. Its a bit of a process but in the end it was a nice lesson about life and change. You must make sure to follow the instructions very carefully since these are living creatures and depend on your care to survive. I would highly recommend for a family project, for homeschooling or in the classroom.	1
Great product!	1
Good quality educational gift for youngsters	1
This product was perfect.  We received our caterpillars.  The students loved watching them transform.  We were able to go to our playground and release the butterflies.  It was a wonderful experience for my students.  Great quality kit.	1
I read so many of the reviews on this Butterfly Garden. I was buying either way but I wanted to be prepared for how many Caterpillars would be dead upon receiving the shipment. I was so happy to see that all the tiny Caterpillars were alive! We have loved this product so much we have bought them as gifts for all our kids' friends. They are so much fun and a neat learning experience. I highly recommend getting this for your kids.	1
7 year old had this in his preschool few years ago and all the kids loved it. Now he wants one for the caterpillars he finds (which i think are moths). Im sure we will order a batch  with the included order form too	1
We had lots of fun with this kit.	1
We loved ths tent.  Our toddler is the type that needs structure and when we travel he has a hard time sleeping.  The tent gives him the structure that he needs and loves.  He used it for nap time and for sleeping at night.  We used the pad from our pack n play that he out grew to give him more comfort.	1
had fun watching butterflies hatch!	1
I had a set like this when I was younger and I knew my son would love it.  We ordered this as a birthday present. It arrived on time, and caused a great deal of excitement; however, there was no caterpillar voucher anywhere in the package. I even dug the box out of the garbage to double-check. It took me over a week to get in touch with InsectLore to have the situation rectified, and when they finally sent the caterpillars another week later, they arrived dead. After contacting them about this for FOUR days in a row, and sending them a million pictures of the caterpillars to "prove it" to their sales representative, they repeatedly told me to "keep watching them, they're fine", even though they were clearly dead. On the fifth day, I finally received an email code for a new batch from a completely new customer service rep, however, by the time this got worked out, my son had really lost interest in the idea. So now I have this mesh container collecting dust in the back room and an email voucher unused in my inbox. Maybe next year.	-1
Its cute, great for outdoors and inside...I have it set up inside my daughters room and she loves to crawl in and out of it. But...it doesnt have stakes or anywhere to use stakes...so cant use it on a windy day without something weighing it down...besides that its great.	1
We got this tent specifically for the beach since our pediatrician recommended we don't use sunblock until baby is 6 months. Until now, we were taking our big, bulky, adult camping tent and setup was a huge hassel. This play tent is simple to setup and it does block the sun very well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the velcro closures are cheap and the netting is very thin.  Our baby is stil little, immobile and not able to pull on the tent material.  I am sure he will be able to bust out of this easily once he can pull himself up and push.	1
A family favorite bought for the next generation!	1
Perfect project for the kiddos!	1
Wonderful purchase, so happy	1
hubby likes it	1
This is an absolute favorite game of mine, and I play a lot. This Deluxe version is really nice! The roll up mat beats the heck out of the folding board original version I also own.	1
Grandsons will love this when they get to open it. I didn't realize that they got to let the butterflies go when they were done. So they won't get to open this until springtime so the butterflies won't die since it's late fall here now.	1
Kids loved this activity and still use the net after releasing the butterflies. Very durable!	1
pros: great product, we got all 5 butterflies, my girl was watching it every singe day the see the progress, the butterflies were beautiful. we kept everything (needed to wash it in the washer) so we are going to do it again in spring 2016!  cons: needed to pay extra money for shipping of the larva, which I think should be included in sale price... nobody like to receive gift that they have to add $ to it.....	1
This was pretty impressive.  Be aware that it does not come with caterpillars.  It includes a certificate you use to order them online for a small fee ($6?). They arrived quickly, but it's delayed gratification if you expect to start growing immediately.  Those caterpillars really know what they're doing.  We kept the grow jar in the kitchen and they all grew into butterflies -- 5 or 6 of them. Only disappointment -- the ingrates didn't linger upon release at all.  They were outta here....  I'm sure some of you with kids can relate.	1
Ordered as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend last Christmas - something he said he played when he was younger. He loved it! It is a great game for young and old!	1
We spent the summer doing a different learning project each week (I have a 5 and a 3 year old). This was a very good learning experience! Note - you have to use a code to order the caterpillars separately, so don't expect to open and start, unless you order the kit directly from the original company. The kit was easy to follow along with and all but one butterfly was successful. Two things I was not prepared for - the blood when the butterfly emerges and one butterfly was born with a deformed wing and was unable to fly away. That was hard to explain to the children. The only con was really that all our butterflies emerged at night, on different nights and the kids really wanted to see it. I set up a time lapse video on my phone to record it.	1
My son loved this product.  The only thing I would say is beware of the season when you purchase the item.  The caterpillars are shipped to you when the season is to right. So keep that in mind when you order this item.  My son was very upset because we didn't get our caterpillars because it was to hot.  But the good thing is we were able to find some on our trial and put them inside this butterfly habitat.	1
we had so much fun with this--several friends have used it since we did.  every kid should get to grow caterpillars to see how interesting it is.	1
This was smaller than I expected.  It has a zipper to close it, which I like better than the velcro tab on my other enclosure.	1
This was my daughter's favorite "toy" over the summer.  We raised many, many, MANY caterpillars in it!  The ones that came with the garden did really well.  I was not about to spend $20 or whatever to order more, though, so we found our own outside.  Just know if you find your own that caterpillars only eat one type of food, so you need to feed them whatever plant you found them on.	1
Great customer support. My daughter loved it, received 6 caterpillars and all turned into butterflies!	1
I took this on a plane packed in the checked suitcase back and forth to the Outerbanks and it was untouched.  We still use it in the yard and just to play in the kids room.	1
I bought this when my daughter was barely 1 in hopes to use it at the beach or outside with her.  We never used it until she was about 1 1/2 and I set it up in her room to play with which she found entertaining.  However, a friend has borrowed it several times for her 4-6 month old.  It works great for her to use in the yard while hanging out with friends & family...kinda a bug-proof, crawl/roll away proof, semi-shaded playpin!	1
This was a really gross fun thing to do with the kids.	1
Gave this to my daughter for her 4th birthday. She loved it! We had to use our voucher that came with it to order our caterpillars. This built up the anticipation of the whole thing. Once they arrive they are already in a cup with food. All you do is watch them, easy! Once they form their chrysalis you move them into the net habitat. This was a little tricky, we rigged a couple branches to attach the paper disk to rather than pinning it like they suggest. My daughter checks on them many times a day. Anxiously waiting to see her butterflies!	1
We have purchased butterflies for our butterfly enclosure two times. Our son loves watching the caterpillars grow into butterflies! The only hard part is letting them go! He always gets a little sad	1
Great game. My hole family likes it.	1
hard to clean but a great product	1
This was really fun for my kids.  I was happy with everything except for the deceiving "free butterflies" that you get to pay an additional $5 to ship.	1
Lots of fun!	1
Love this game.  Addictive.	1
We bought this last summer for a trip to Destin, FL for our then infant son and toddler daughter.  It didn't get much use in Destin (about 10 minutes) only because we didn't end up needing it, not because of any defect, so I can't rate it much on its use at an actual beach.  However, I can say the ease of setup and complete portability (the bars have a very ingenious, snap and lock way of folding down to about a 1-1/2 foot length, and it actually *fits* fairly easily back into its over the back travel bag) make it an A++ child's product in my book.  It's very well thought out.  We have it set up in our library now, with pillows and blankets and the kids love reading in there.  Some pros: 1.  It's extremely easy to set up and take down.  Takes one person about 2 minutes. 2.  Nicely portable.  Folds up tiny (will fit in most diaper bags), and inside a carrying bag, with a strap that allows you to throw the bag across your back, making it easy to carry it AND your kid(s).  A must for parents with diaper bags and sippy cups and snacks etc.  A lot of thought was put into this aspect of the product, for which I am very grateful. 3.  It's fairly roomy.  I (smallish, 5'2 mom) and both my kids can fit in there if I'm sitting up and reading to them.  I can sit straight up if I'm in the middle (a little hunched, but still comfortable on the side).  Right now we have about 4 blankets, 1 boppy pillow and 4 toss pillows in there and they still manage to fit themselves (3 y.o. and 1 y.o.) and a boatload of toys too.  In a pinch, it could be used as a outdoor napping area, perhaps for even up to 3 toddlers. 4.  Ventilated sides, so they don't get too hot in there. 5.  Bottom is lined, to protect against hot sand. 6.  I find the design to be pretty ingenious, both when folded up for storage and when set up.  The collapsibility of the bars help ensure that rough toddlers will just maybe unsnap them out of place rather than break them.  It's a neat little setup.  Maybe I'm just easily impressed.  A few minor cons, which are to be expected considering the low price: 1.  The bottom is crinkly with a waxy surface.  I realize it's for water-resistance, but it's a bit noisy.  We've limited the noise by piling up blankets on top but still a little annoying. 2.  Fairly cheap tent material.  But to be expected. 3.  The mesh door folds down, where it can be held into place by little velco straps.  When you have a young baby learning to walk, these little obstacles can be a minor nuisance.  I think it would have been better for the door to fold up. 4.  The dome design requires some sort of weight to be put inside when using outdoors, otherwise the wind will take it away.  Anchors would be nice.  I'm really happy about this product and would recommend it, and other Pacific Play tents to other parents.	1
We keep this tent in our back yard as a break from the sun/wind.  It needs weights or it will fly away.  But my girls used it a great deal last summer, we hope to get more use from it this summer.	1
Just as all the other reviewers said, it's great. Serves it's purpose and it's fun too! Easy to assemble and carry	1
The toy is great but description deceiving box is non sealed cardboard box , useless for future storage.love the toy glad I bought it, description should be changed.	1
I was a little worried about buying this because of the age range from the reviews, my son is 9 years old. But I bought it and he loves it, he uses it with his john deere logging equipment and builds a logging company. Great toy and it is made of real wood, not plastic.	1
LOVE this!!! So great to watch them grow and release, we cant wait to do this again.	1
Purchased the butterfly Garden and a cup of caterpillars.  This project is AMAZING!!!  Our 3 yr old grand-daughter LOVED to watch the transformation.  We read & followed all the directions and had 6 beautiful butterflies to release!  Highly recommend!  I like how this enclosure is soft, it didn't scratch my coffee table.  It is light weight, we could move it around easily.  And it is collapsible, for easy storage until we use again!  Love it.	1
My daughter LOVED seeing the process. She can't wait for more butterflies. It was quite disgusting for me to help her hang the chrysalids. Beware; they wiggle. I had to enlist the help of my oldest child.	1
The loom is a bare-bones loom, and the instructions are difficult even for an adult to understand. My daughter weaved about 8 lines with my help and just lost interest as you constantly need to rethread new yarn because it comes in strands rather than a continuous loop. Waste of money.	-1
My 10 year old daughter wanted to try it out. This is just the right size for her, easy to use and sturdy enough. A good toy.  cheers --jsd	1
It's a net basket, it holds butterflies and other small insects. It's easily accessible for placing the animals and their food needed.  We have raised 1 group of butterflies so far and this worked great. All items are easily visible through the mesh.  It is as pictured and ours came wit ha certificate for a free bunch of caterpillars (+S/H). We have not used that yet as we already had some ready for use.	1
Very happy with our purchase.	1
grandsons, 4 & 6, LOVED this...	1
Don't remember	1
Arrived in box not damaged, but inside the package there were many broken pieces and very rough edges. I gave this as a gift and it was just outside the return period when it was opened and discovered to be faulty. $22 wasted. So many better building options out there, stick with the original Lincoln logs for the best value and quality.	-1
These logs were just as good, or better than Lincoln Logs!!! Grandkids LOVED them!!!	1
A classic toy that is tons of fun.	1
I purchased this hoping my elderly dad and my grandchildren would play with it. Sadly, no one has shown any interest. I built the structures shown on the front of the box trying to get them motivated to no avail. The kids did use some of the small logs to fill up the back of the toy dump truck.  The pieces fit together well enough. The set contains a large number of the really small logs and very few of the longer pieces. That's standard but disappointing.  The logs arrived with a paint or stain odor. I found that troubling since it is a toy.	1
Great blocks my daughter loves them. Not made like when we were kids but not too bad. I wish I bought the bigger set though.	1
We chose these over Lincoln Logs because you can get more pieces for the money.  We had a set of these already, so we knew what we were getting.  They are almost like the Lincoln Logs.  Also, both grandsons already had just a small set of these, and we wanted to purchase more to give them more play options.	1
good for educational play its a little old for my 4 year old but the older nieces and adults enjoyed helping with it	1
We really loved it, no complains. I am glad I read the reviews and knew that caterpillars should be purchased separately. We ordered them and the came within 4 days, pretty alive, will see how they grow. I am ordering another 2 for gifts. Very happy! Amazing product!  UPDATE 4 weeks later: We ordered the other set for us. got 7 caterpillars, 1 was dead which leaves us at 6 caterpillars forming 6 cocoons and 6 alive butterflies! We let them go today. Very exciting! Will order another cup of caterpillars!	1
So much fun! My 7 year old loved it!	1
This is such a great idea! It was very informative for my niece, and she spent hours every day hanging out with these caterpillars and larva as they grew into butterflies. She loved releasing them into the wild, and learning about the development of them. I also love that you can order additional larva in the future to watch more butterflies grow.	1
I bought this when my son was very young.  It's great for camping trips or any time that you need to spend time outdoors.  It provides a safe place for them to play and nap while protecting them from the sun, bugs and dirt.  Works great in the house too as a play tent.  Easily kept in any car for those last minute trips.	1
I think my granddaughter will enjoy this. We have not used it yet,it is a Christmas gift - but it looks very sturdy, and she loves crafts, and I believe she will be able to do this and enjoy it.	1
Very nice loom!	1
Perfect way to teach kids an easy craft	1
This is a really good kit, but beware of the hidden costs! The price of the kit does NOT include caterpillars. If you buy the kit, they give you a code to purchase caterpillars for free, but you still get charged about $5 for shipping and handling, plus more if you want the caterpillars expedited with 2 day shipping, which they recommend so that your caterpillars don't die in transit. I chose not to pay more and chose regular shipping, and my caterpillars arrived within 3 days in excellent condition. If you want another batch of caterpillars you have to pay about $15 for the caterpillars plus shipping. So buyer beware!  But in spite of that, this is a GREAT little science kit. My 4 year old son was fascinated by the caterpillars that arrived. They come sealed in a little plastic tub with a layer of food on the bottom, so you don't have to feed them or tend to them at all, just make sure they are neither too hot nor cold, and watch them grow! They eat the food on the bottom and hang on the top and turn into chrysalises. About a week later they turn into butterflies, and then you can feed them fruit or sugar water, which is a lot of fun too.  We received 6 caterpillars and all 6 of them turned into butterflies. So beautiful and really great learning for the little ones (and us big ones too).  A note: Make sure you are going to be home for at least 3 weeks when you order the butterflies. If you go out of town you might miss the transformation, and also once they turn into butterflies you need to be home to feed them.	1
My son (3 years old) has adored watching his caterpillars grow! It's the first thing he wants to do when he wakes up and wants to show everyone he sees! Our caterpillars came safe and we even got an extra 6th one. Very fun for the whole family.	1
perfect butterfly house!	1
Shipping was really fast.  We received six caterpillars.  They didn't move much so I couldn't tell how many were alive.  I drew lines on the outside of their tub where each one was so I could see if they moved.  It turns out all six made it alive.  They grow really fast.  It was fun to watch them, but I wish we could have held them.  One day five of them went up to the top and made their chrysalis.  The next day the sixth one did it.  About a week later five of them hatched.  It happened really quickly.  We didn't even get to see it.  We put fruit in for them to eat.  The next day the sixth one hatched.  We kept feeding them fruit for a few days.  It was tricky changing out the fruit without letting them escape or squishing them. Then we took them outside to set them free.  None of them wanted to leave their little house.  Eventually five of them flew away.  The sixth one hung around and let us hold him for awhile.  That was nice because none of the others wanted to be held.  We can't wait to order some more caterpillars and do it all again.	1
Wonderful gift for my 4 year old whouse LOVES butterflies!	1
This toy was very dissapointing for my son who loves Thomas toys and the show. It is poorly made, do not mistake it for the other train sets of Thomas that you are used to.  This is a cheaper version, and the wooden cars will not work with this track. I do not mind that it is plastic, what I do mind is that it does not work. It did not even last 1 hour with my son and I before it was completely unusable. The pieces were poorly made, do not fit together properly, and do not work. Keep looking for a better Thomas set.	-1
We got several board games for Christmas this year, and have really enjoyed trying them all out. This game is definitely one of the BEST games so far.  It states for ages 8+ on the box, and I feel that's about right if you're looking for a family game. We're just a couple in our late 20's, and it's challenging enough for us to enjoy. It's great as a 2 player game. The rules are very simple, only took us about 10 minutes to get it all figured out and start playing.  If you get this game, you'll want to play game after game after game after game! We love the use of the Jacks in the game too, a fun little twist. Overall, Sequence is a keeper, and we'll be enjoying this one for years to come.	1
This is a really fun and easy game.  I bought it for myself, gave it for a gift.  Now I am buying it again to keep for myself.	1
I normally buy two or three new board games every year as holiday gifts, and we often find a new favorite each year.  This one is no different--once you know the gameplay, this game moves fast, is easy to follow, and is a lot of fun.  We do not like games that require us to "overthink" everything, yet not be so simple as to insult anyone's intelligence.  Think of this as sort of a variation on tic-tac-toe or bingo.  Keep in mind that the game requires two or three players, or teams with players in multiples of two or three (two or three teams of two players each, for example).  The "board" is actually a vinyl playing surface that unrolls, which is actually a nice alternative to an actual game board.  It comes with two nice sets of cards also--material quality is quite good.	1
Works great for a baby that is not yet mobile.  Now my baby will sit in it for a few minutes with some toys, but wants to be out with everyone else.  This was great when she was smaller though.	1
We used this a lot when our daughter wasn't moving around a whole lot--now that she does (8.5 months) we don't use it as much.  A great buy for the price, though.	1
My 28 month old grand niece loves this.  We tried it out in the living room before the we went on vacation to the shore.  It works great in both places.  It does not even sway in the breeze!  She loves to play and nap in her tent!  I ordered this through Target, which had a link to amazon.  It took over three weeks to be shipped.  Five stars for product, one star for shipping.	1
How can you not love this?  You get to see the process of life right in the comfort of your own home.  This is a great little project to do with your young children.  My son LOVES this thing, especially when he gets to set them freeeee!	1
My students LOVE this. I use it every year.	1
My kids simply loved this experience as did my husband and I. The kit arrives with a code to send off for your caterpillars so don't expect them all at once but this is for the welfare of the insects so I'm fine with that, Also be prepared for an extra $5 postage charge to get your caterpillars but I still think its worth it.  5 very hungry caterpillars arrived and it became a daily event for us all as a family to sit and review their development. This will teach your kids more about the life cycle of butterflies and metamorphosis than 100 books or art projects or videos on the subject.  5 beautiful butteries emerged about 2 weeks later and we released them all into the garden.  Highly recommended and the garden can be reused with new caterpillars in future so even better value for a classroom	1
Bought as a gift.	1
best thing ever!	1
kids love it catch & release	1
Always one of the first games we grab from the closet! Easy to play for two or four players. Lots of fun with a nice mix of luck and simple strategy. Great for non game people since it only take a minute to learn.	1
With the humidity here in NY it's hard to offer much help to a baby like mine that doesn't like the heat, but this does offer some relief. I keep it in the car so if I go to someone's house and we are bbqing or whatever I can set this up in the shade and let the baby sleep.  It folds up very very small into its own little drawstring bag so it's not a big deal to carry along with you.  It is large enough to fit a few kids--my nieces age 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 cannot stop fussing over my 3 month old and they get in there with him and poke at him when I set it up. It is very easy to set up, but I would suggest you bring a big towel or pad to put at the bottom because the vinyl/plastic/nylon (?) it is made out of would not be comfy for baby on the ground.	1
It is really a nice tent. Durable and roomy.  I have a 10 months and a 2 year old one and they both fit in there. And some toys.  Now that doesn't mean they stay in there. ;-)  The first time I put this tent up I was worried that it will be difficult. Of course I had onlookers smerking at me including my husband who thought this was a waste of time and money. But then enjoyed this for his kids.  But it was easy to install and also to take down later on.  And the kids enjoyed a little area of their own. They were protected from the wind and also could see outside.  I put a towel on the floor to give it some cushion. My kids don't sit still much so they/we get use out of it but not like others write where they kids sit and play for hours.  That is not us.  It folds neatly together and fits into this small carry on bag it comes with.  A nice little arrangemnt. Now, the material for the floor is not thick and it even says on the package avoid putting it on hot surface. So you need to put a towel in there or some matt or something that the kids can sit in it. Beachsand can get hot. But that is normal and no big deal. You don't sit on the hot sand neither, but put a towel on it.  I can recommend it.  I haven't seen any other on the beach or at the pool. As a matter of fact I have never seen anyone else so I can't compare how it hold up to the other tents offered on the market. BUt it is nice and works well.  Enjoy.	1
I bought one of these tents last year when our daughter was 10 months old, and we wanted to work in the yard.  Unfortunately she was a little weirded out initially by the tent, and us zipping her in.  I then decided to move it indoors, and then get inside with her, and then play with her.  It has never gone outside again.  She and all her friends love playing with the tent.  I think she would go inside it again if I had put it outside, but it was easier to keep it inside.  The one concern I have with these tents is the siding.  It is good that you have mesh (so you can have some air flow through the sides as well).  When we first used the tent, it was in the middle of the HOT TEXAS summer, and honestly, she was not getting much airflow into the tent. If you don't have a good breeze, those tents seem like a hotbox (just without the direct sunlight).  I would recommend using the tent indoors before using it outside (especially for those under 12 months), and make sure you have some air-flow.  Educational value of 2 stars because the children learn how to zipper the door open and closed.  These things are pretty durable, good sized, and easy to break down and pop up.  I really recommend, as long as you take precautions.	1
A great starter loom. I wanted something I could try out weaving with and this was a great choice.  Small enough that it doesn't take up considerable room but big enough to create adorable wall hangings. A great buy for the beginning weaver!	1
Grandkids love it	1
amazing experience for the kids :)	1
Great birthday gift for kids	1
My niece was absolutely ecstatic when she got this for her birthday. She loves butterflies as much as I do, so I knew she would love this when I bought it for her. It's a perfect size for her to grow a few butterflies at home that I'm sure will intrigue her for hours.	1
This is a very nice product for the price (we got it on lightning deal).  Daughter enjoys using it.	1
I bought this for my grandchildren as birthday presents because I thought they would really enjoy actually weaving a piece of cloth.  They first had the potholder loom and that was a big hit so I thought this would hit the spot.  I also purchased extra yarn for more weaving possibilities.	1
As described thanks	1
Great net!  Our first set of caterpillars didn't make it but I sent them back and amazon mailed another cup right away!  All 4 caterpillars turned into butterflies!  My boys (2&4) loved the experience!  We will do again in the fall when it cools off!	1
I bought 5 of these. Seriously love them. 5 Caterpillars come quickly(certificate is in garden-you pay 5$ to have them shipped). One batch of caterpillars only produced 4 butter flys but such is nature.	1
This made a very fun, family science project!	1
Got this for granddaughter's 10th birthday ... she was ecstatic!	1
2 year old grandson loves it.  Have ordered two rounds of caterpillars already	1
This is absolutely amazing.  My grandchildren ages 5 & 7 watch them morph into butterflies. They were set free in the name of my recently deceased sister, what a heartwarming event.	1
We got this train for our daughters 4th Birthday and when we took it out of the box the main train that pulls the rest was broken. We tried to figure out how it goes together and never did so she has not got a chance to play with it! The box was in great condition so I really do not know how it was in so many pieces when we got it! I am not happy about that, but as far as fun...can't say due to it never working!! I hope others that purchase this toy have better luck that we have had.	-1
This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps "enough" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a "genuine" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated.  Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they "magically" form!)  Two extra parts are "missing" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get: (1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork.  The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a "lap loom."	1
Excellent learning tool for kids and grown ups!  What an amazing experience this was to do with my kids.  Highly recommend this and will do this every year in the spring with my kids.  Bravo!	1
Absolutely love it! What a Great price!	1
Once you figure out the assembly, it's a really neat little tent.  It keeps the sun and wind off my baby and I get to enjoy the outdoors.	1
We liked this little loom. Be aware though it does take time and practice. The hardest thing to do is not pull the yarn on the side too much. You have to be very careful or else your project will start out ok and then get more and more narrow. We did order the Harrisville Designs Wonder Wand and that made it much easier to do the weaving. One thing I do wish Harrisville would do is to PLEASE put up an instructional video for kids on how to tie off the end of the project when you are finished. I think it would be help them sell their product to put up some youtube videos for it, as well as help kids learn how to finish it off.	1
My son received this toy as a Christmas gift, and we were disappointed with it. Once out of the box, we were frustrated with the number of small parts, such as the tiny plastic balls which are used in the loader.  These could be considered a choking hazard for younger children.  Also, there is very little room for "hands on" play.  The trains merely move around the track by themselves.  My son became very frustrated with this and wanted to push the trains himself.  I had to tell him that he would break it if he pushed them.  I recommend that you purchase one of the excellent Thomas wooden train sets.  They are much better than this set and allow for much more interactive play.	-1
it was not clearly described that you have to remove one heddle then reinsert it onto the warp. my granddaughter has difficulty in doing this step.	-1
good purchase	1
I've now seen four people ages 5, 7, 27 and 67 become intrigued with weaving thanks to the Harrisville small wooden pegloom. The kit gives adequate instructions and helpful suggestions for first time weavers. The yarn sent with the loom is of deep primary colors. Surprisingly, the pegloom is sturdy and can even survive inventive little boys!	1
Thomas and his friends, Percy and Terence, they load, fill, scoop, haul, and dump their cargo of "rocks" around this bustling construction site. The vehicles move backward or forward, it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next. A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks. It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it. There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward. I don't think it is a good, stimulating toy for my son!!!	-1
SAVE THE BOX: excellent to store loom and tools in, and for the times when you need a lap-table to work.  Purchased this for a 9-year-old who wanted one: they love it. I would not invest in one for a younger child unless they have tried it enough to know that they want to do it: It is a slower, more patient craft, but very relaxing. It also keeps one busy for quite awhile. I would definitely recommend getting the wooden spacer (looks like a wood comb): it really does make it easier and takes the tedium out of the process. The additional colored yarns are beautiful, but cheap yarn from a craft store will do the trick, especially until the weaver becomes experienced enough to really start planning pieces. It's good quality yarn, just expensive for beginner projects.  Really fast to set up: it arrives as shown, all you need to do is knot the yarn at one knob and then wind it across the loom as you loop it over the pegs. Then you are weaving. Instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The only problem is that now I want one, too.	1
A wonderful loom kit for beginners and more experienced weavers alike! The loom comes in a box that is reusable for storing your project and the smell of fresh wood waffles out when you open it :) Very well made, comes with instruction booklet, project sheet, plastic tapestry needle, two shed sticks, stick shuttle, quality warp string and enough quality yarn to complete the project on the project sheet. We also purchased a set of three Vidal Sassoon Purse Hair Piks to use as beaters for our loom kit...they're PERFECT, don't snag and are rather affordable too :) Relaxing and FUN to learn/make...this lap loom kit is easy to use and won't let one feel daft over which is warp or weft :D Highly recommend for younger and older folks alike!	1
we bought this for my daughters 5th birthday. She absolutely loved it! The only thing is that you need to send in for the butterfly larvae right away! The wait was hard as she wanted to set it up as soon as we have it to her. The caterpillars all arrived alive and everyone one of them hatched into butterflies. Very cool experience and releasing them was neat as well.	1
My children, 7 and 10, love the Insect Lore Butterfly Gardens. This is the second one they've had. I especially liked that this time around you could order the caterpillars online instead of mailing a postcard which made the wait for the caterpillars even longer. But the caterpillars arrived fast. The kids waited with baited breath for them to form a chrysalis and turn into butterflies. It took 3-4 days longer then the instructions said for them to emerge but they did eventually!	1
I would give this tent 5 stars except for two reasons: be careful if your child tries to pull him/herself to standing while in it because it can tip over. Also, I wish it had a shoulder strap to make carrying it easier. It is featherlight though so even without the strap, you can stick in a bag and carry it that way.  Overall, we love the tent and it is the best value for the money spent!	1
I bought this as a gift for my mother, who played her original sequence game enough that it completely wore out.  The original version which she had wasn't poorly constructed, she just played it quite frequently for years and years.  This version I can see lasting much longer than the original version.  The build quality is similar, but the board is more mat than board and will definitely last much longer.  The cards are still standard playing cards, and as such will wear over time.  The chips are plastic, and I like the "King" sides of them making sequences stand out easier.  A great version of a great game that will last much longer with frequent play due to build materials.  Possibly the best version of the game, as I know of none better.	1
I ordered this for my kids (7 and 10 yr old) because they love nature. As indicated in the description, the caterpillars don't come with the cage, You get a certificate for the caterpillars. I went on their website and entered the code for the caterpillars plus paid $5 shipping and handling. I didn't pay the extra money for the faster shipping. I live in VA and it took about 4-5 days to receive them. The first shipment only had 3 living caterpillars so I did a live chat with their costumer service on their website and told them about the problem. They apologized and indicated they would sent out more caterpillars immediately. They came as promised and there were 5 this time, all living.  It was a lot fun to watch the caterpillars grow and turn into chrysalis and then waiting for them to emerge into butterflies. The kids, 7 and 10 yrs old, enjoyed watching each stage and feeding the butterflies sugar water. After 3-4 days, we released the butterflies, except for 1, which had a damaged wing and couldn't fly away. This was definitely worth the purchase!	1
DOES NOT COME WITH CATEPILLARS HAVE TO ORDER THEM. LAST ONE I BOUGHT CAME WITH THEM.. EITHER WAY REALLY GREAT PRODUCT	1
Easy and fun, great science. Nothing died, no kids cried.	1
Absolutely loved this...really needed just the caterpillars as family already had a kit from previous years.  But caterpillars so expensive it was just as cheap to buy new kit with caterpillar certificate. Had a lot of problem dealing with the Insect Lore company, though.  No website, no telephone customer service on weekends (weird!) and really poor service.  Would not deal with Insect Lore company itself anymore.  but happy with the kit though Amazon that came from elsewhere, even though it was an Insect Lore kit.	1
We successfully grew all five painted ladies and released them!  They were beautiful and we will do this again	1
b-day girl was thrilled!!!	1
This doll is so beautiful.  The reason I wanted it and bought it was because of her raven black hair and her beautiful red lips.  She is just so pretty.  I've never seen a barbie doll like this before and that is why I had to have it.  I'm so glad I have it.  The only regret I have is opening her but her costume is so pretty and her bodice is nice and velvety and I like how she has long raven black hair.  She is just a gorgeous doll.  If you have the means, I definitely recommend that you buy this doll and showcase her off as a proud owner!!  Love it!	1
If you are looking for a fun game that requires strategy then I highly recommend Sequence. It is great fun , easy to learn , and provides hours of entertainment.	1
We got this bed for Christmas and our little car guy loves it!! We haven't had a problem with him falling out, but we used his crib (without the front rail) as a toddler bed first and after several nights of falling out, Eric found the boundries of the bed. Every child will probally fall out until they realize where the edge is. The bed is so adorable, but I wish that it came with more stickers. You can buy them for $30.00, but it would have been great if they were included. Overall Eric loves it and can't wait to go to bed!! It's a great bed for little racers!!	1
We recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend's child who used it until he was eight (would not give it up sooner). My son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four. This bed is durable! The bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new. It is so easy to wipe clean. My son feels that his bed is special and just adores it. He sees "regular" beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car. I have a feeling he'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end. Five stars!	1
Recently bought this for my son and he LOVES it! Now, it wasn't such an easy transition for us from crib to bed but that has nothing to do with the bed. We are still trying to get him to sleep in it but he is young and feels a little scared not being in his crib but it's just a matter of time. My son loves to play with it and read his books on his race car bed and loves to bring people in his room to see it. It was easy to put together and very well made. Our crib matteress fit great there are very very slight gaps but no big deal at all and I just stuffed some baby pillows anywhere I felt that there was a tiny gap. It's a really great bed and there is no doubt in my mind my son will love it for quite some time. I had also considered the fire truck bed by step 2 and SO glad I did not get that one. My son likes me to lay down with him at night and read him a story and there is no way on earth either my hubby or I would have fit in that one, this bed I love it's ultra comfy!	1
I bought this bed for my son when he was about 18 months old because he just would not sleep in his crib. It did take a little elbow grease to put together but not too bad. He slept in it perfectly from the first night and never fell out. I used the mattress support from his crib instead of a board; there were no boards at my TRU and the salesman suggested I use the mattress support. I don't know why that is an issue. My mattress fit perfectly and there were no gaps. This is a great toddler bed, however my son is now three and he is constantly hitting the sides at night. i feel he has no room to move in it. I am disappointed because I was expecting to get lots more use out of it! From the other reviews I read, this does not seem to be a common problem. Perhaps my son is just a restless sleeper!!	1
I am a teacher and this was a perfect addition to our butterfly unit.  The students loved keeping an eye on the butterflies and watching each stage of metamorphosis.  We released with the other 3rd grade classes and the students loved watching the butterflies take flight.	1
Fun for the whole family! Don't buy the caterpillars just wait for your house to arrive and use the coupon for 5 free...You will have to pay $5.00 s/h but well worth it. It was an unbelievable transformation and such a learning experience for the grandkids. Also bought the book to help them see what was going to happen to our caterpillars. Below is a picture of our 3 Painted Lady butterflies in their house, enjoying fresh fruit and flowers.	1
So much fun for both kids! What a fun way to learn about nature and understand life. They enjoyed watching the caterpillars eat and grow.  Such a neat process to view and especially when they turned into chrysallides. The letting go part was fun too, even though the kids were a bit sad it was over. The only negative thing i can recall, was when they arrived in the mailbox, there were ants ALL OVER the caterpiller container, it could have been the food inside attracting them, not really the companies fault. I think the ants were just attracted to it, they may have been in our mailbox when it arrived.	1
We bought these for our now 3 year old b/g twins after they outgrew their cribs at 21 months. They would have been dwarfed in their full sized beds, from the cribs. They picked this one out (in navy) and they loved them. The fromnt hood opens up and my kids keep bed time things in there (books pillows blankets ect.) They also enjoyed playing race car in them. These beds can take alot of abuse. My twins would literaly beat them and jump on them and really bang em' up, but not one dent. They felt safe in it and because it was so "cool" it got them through bed time. Now that we re-did their room from sesame street to light blue walls and one pink and light blue plaid bedding and one green and light blue plaid bedding we got bunk beds, though they are not stacked yet, we will do that eventually. I am sure these beds could last much longer, but my kids started to feel like "babies", and they are going through the "I am a big boy/girl" phase. They were really easy to assemble, and dis-assemble, as we plan on using them for thier 8 month old twin brothers later, and hoping that they will get more use. All in all I think this bed is great for any toddler in withdrawl about sleeping in a bed and ditching thier crib, kind of like you cant go from diapers to underwear, you have to have the inbetween, so this bed served as our toddler bed. This bed is great, for boys and girls and your kid will love it too!	1
We used this in our homeschool and my daughter loved it. What a treat it was to watch this process!	1
Do t like.	-1
This truck is very well designed. My grandson love it.	1
Prompt delivery.  This is third one of these that my daughter has ordered.  It's a nice kit and all 5 butterflies made it through the entire life cycle in ever kit.	1
kids loved it and we can use it more than once.	1
You have to play it in multiples of 2 or three.  It is very fun for adults and children.  It makes you think.  It has a very durable board. It won't ruin.  GREAT GAME!  A must have.	1
My daughter is still pretty young, but I am sure as she gets a little older she will play with it more.  In my opinion it was money well spent. I was just concerned however on where it was made (ie China etc..) I couldn't figure it out for some reason.	1
We purchased this for my daughters 4th birthday. We loved it so much. All 5 caterpillars turned into butterflies. The kit comes with a certificate to order your caterpillars. You do have to pay $5 shipping and handling when you order them. Very worth it.	1
My classroom loved this. Highly recommended.	1
Another favorite truck for a 3 year old child.  The magnet is nice and strong.	1
well made	1
Grandchildren enjoyed this.	1
Fun	1
I used this with my classroom of students. We kept a diary of the changes every day as we watched our butterflies go through their life cycle. It was great. All 5 of the caterpillars hatched. :) I will re-use the garden next year, and just order the caterpillars.	1
This was a great way to start educating the kiddos on the life cycle of the butterfly. We followed ALL of the directions and all 5 of our larvae hatched into beautiful painted lady butterflies. Just be sure to release them within a couple of days of emergency from their chrysalides.	1
Arrived exactly as described, and works well with the Insect Lore Liv Butterfly Culture.	1
son loves bus	1
Great idea for a little guy and the size of the pieces fit in his little hands just great.  He really likes it	1
A good learning puzzle for children to put together, due to the picture is right beneath  each piece.  This adds to their success.	1
Good but I got it for the reason that on the picture shown it shows behind the puzzle piece its blank, but the one I got it has the pictures behind it. Good puzzle but misleading picture.	1
he loves it  knobs are easy to grasp for a 2 year old. quailty great will last a long time  nice size,	1
Sequence is a enjoyable game for all ages.  Deluxe sequence is the best format, because you don't fold the board, so it doesn't have all the folds to deal with.	1
very nice,	1
Great for grandparents to teach our grandchildren.	1
We got off to a kid-distressing start with our kit, since the company said they would email us when the caterpillars shipped and we never received the promised email, which meant our caterpillars were housed in the metal mailboxes baking in the sun for who-knows-how-long before we got our mail.  The caterpillars all survived, however, and we were able to release all five butterflies.  This was a pretty cool project--I may have been even more excited than the kids.  My one frustration was that our caterpillars did everything in about 2/3 the supposed minimum time frame, so from the time we received our caterpillars to the time they emerged as butterflies was about a week.  I guess this was fine from the kids' perspective--not much waiting--but I was trying to emphasize how we learn about creatures by observing them, showing my kids that our critters were just as described in the booklet because scientists had studied and learned about this kind of caterpillar and knew how it would behave.  So much for that lesson.	1
I didn't realize that the butterfly's had to be ordered after this package arrived, otherwise I would've opened it prior to giving to my daughter and had the caterpillars ready to go, but it gave her something to look forward to.	1
Kids love to see the stages of caterpillars becoming butterflies.  Best part was releasing them.  All 5 made it.  I enjoyed myself!	1
WARNING: Our credit card number was used to purchase round-trip plane tickets from the state where the live caterpillars are shipped from, the day after paying for the caterpillars. Our card company notified us immediately and said that this issue has happened many times before with this company - in fact, it is flagged in their system. This is how the rest of our experience with the Insect Lore kit went: We bought 2 kits, 1 for us and 1 for our neighbors kids - the kits are so cheap that we thought it would be fun to do them together. Then they arrived - despite being described as "including live caterpillars" on the boxes we ordered, we had to order them online. So much for it being a great gift. We pulled our neighbors caterpillar "coupon" out so we could order it for them (bringing the total cost for 2 kits to close to $40!). FYI, the website will not allow you to order multiple cups of caterpillars to the same address or use the same credit card for multiple orders. Despite the fact that the shipping boxes are designed to hold 4 cups of caterpillars. That being said, it's for the best that the caterpillars are shipped to you separately, or they may sit on the shelves for too long and die. Both sets of caterpillars were set to arrive on a Wednesday. Our neighbor's did arrive, but our didn't. They arrived to my husband's office on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, while we were out of town. Luckily, we were able to pick them up Sunday night and they were still alive. After 1 week of chowing down on the green goop in the cup and wallowing in their own excrement, they have formed chrysalises. Unfortunately, some of our caterpillars were not satisfied with eating the green goop and they also ate half of the paper liner at the top of the cup, making it nearly impossible to transfer them into the mesh enclosure. We're on day 3 of our butterfly watch. Our daughter is fairly interested in the project, although she'll probably be the most excited when the butterflies hatch. If this review was just about everything that happened once our caterpillars were safe in our home, this would be a 5 star review. However, having our credit card stolen by the livestock company loses this product 4 stars (more if I could). Amazon, you owe it to your customers to tell this company that you will not carry their product until they institute safer payment practices. Read the reviews!	-1
Very engaging for my daughter (age 5). She was interested in learning about the different stages of the butterfly and was excited to wake up each morning to check out any differences in the habitat. Also great for exercising patience! She loved releasing the butterflies at the end, and asked to do another round since the habitat is reusable. Would recommend as an alternative to electronic toys!	1
Bought for my sons kindergarten class. They LOVED it!	1
we had a fantastic time with this!  Love the entire process, great idea for older preschool/school aged kids.	1
Love love love! We just set our butterflies free. My kids had a great time watching and learning about the life cycle of a caterpillar and butterfly. For someone who is bug-squeemish, this wasn't so bad	1
Warning this does not come with the caterpillars or food. You will need to mail in a certificate and $5. Not worth the money.	-1
Fun game!	1
My 2&3 year old boys love all these big metal Tonka construction trucks, and all the children at the park come running for them when we bring them.	1
fun game.  a little hard to fit the ice skater guy In the cube and make him stay up	1
Shipped on time, exactly as described.	1
Super fun game. We play this often. My son is 7 and still enjoys it.	1
My granddaughter loved this.  It is fun to play	1
bought for the grandkids, grandma nailed it!  :)	1
Loved this game as a child and my kid loves it too. We bought it and took it on a weekend trip where several families stayed in a cabin. The adults were playing this after the kids went to bed. The only problem is that I lose patience with reassembling the cubes. It takes as long to set up the game as it does to play it.	1
Toddler loves it, but he's done breaking the ice in under a minute.  Set-up takes longer than the time he plays it, and requires an adult to wedge the plastic ice cubes back into the square frame.  It gets old quickly putting it back together over and over again.	1
So I guess this is a decent item but comes with draw backs. First one died which was hard to tell my 5 year old. While the process of watching all this is fun it is terrible when you put the time in and are not there to see them hatch. You have to except that you are basically buying a caterpillar that will become a butterfly when you are at work and your child will be angry he missed it, upset when they have to leave and confused when one "just keeps sleeping".  Not worth it if you ask me.	-1
The code to receive the live butterflies did not work. When I tried to contact the company- it was impossible to get someone on the phone and got no reply from the email I sent. Waste of money.	-1
Still playing this game. If you don't own it yet SHAME ON YOU! i play it with my 4 year old a couple times a week! FAMILY FUN!	1
This game was one of the cornerstones of my childhood. 30 years later, my two and six year old love it as much as I did.	1
A classic. Great for youngsters who are just getting into game playing and the 2 year olds who can't help but touch and pound out the ice. It also builds hand eye coordination and dexterity.	1
great fun	1
Great game, kids love it	1
Just like I remember playing as a kid.  Same hard plastic ice and mallets.  Fun game, sometimes the ice pieces seem loose so you can just move them to a different area and it seems to help them fit more snugly.  The little character that stand on the ice cube doesn't stay put very well but that does not affect the over all fun of the game.	1
It does the job.  I just wish they made the games like they used to when I was growing up.	1
Good turn taking game	1
I had this when I was a kid and got it for my children hoping they like it as much as I did. They did! They had no idea what it was but after playing it they had a ton of fun. Has earned its place in our family game nights!	1
Our soon to be 11 yr. old Grandson wanted this as a birthday gift. We were so surprised to see this on his wish list as opposed to something techy or electronic so of course we got it for him. We used to have this game at our house for all the kids to play but we gave it to some kids that used to come to visit that didn't have much. The Grandkids have been missing it every since. we are glad to see some of the Old school games are still around.	1
Bought two of these and gave to my grandchildren (two families).  The butterflies hatched and we let go.  My 4 yr old grandson shed a few tears but all of the kids (ages 2 to 6) had a wonderful time watching them turn from caterpillar to butterfly.  They are ready to order more!	1
Grandkids (ages 4 and 7) were fascinated. We received 5 Painted Lady caterpillars. Kit includes everything you need.  One caveat: while you can get the caterpillars shipped to you for additional $5 as advertised, they highly recommend 2 day shipping for $13.75. We took this option as we wanted to make sure we got healthy specimens.  Addendum: Shortly before we released the 5 butterflies they laid eggs on the flowers we placed in there! Bonus feature! Circle of Life.	1
Great hand strengthing game for little ones when setting up the board! We enoy this one on game night for our family!	1
Bought for my soon to be 3 year old granddaughter. She is loving it just as I did when I was a kid.	1
Lots of fun to play!	1
Cute way to teach little ones. My three year old loves watching the caterpillars. It's probably a bit overpriced for what it is - a mesh pop up habitat.	1
Kids love having a place to hide, and tents like this one let you provide a safe place to hide that you can still keep an eye on. It's not a terribly rugged unit, but for the intended age group is sufficient; just don't try to use it outdoors. It's best used on a carpeted surface in a family room or living room. I like the vent on the top- a good safety feature that keeps air flowing in- but you still want to keep a close eye on kids in ANY play structure, particularly the younger ones.	1
This is a fun game for 3 years up. My grandson kinda wanted to just break all the ice once we put it all together. Once we played a few times and with patience and coaching he finally understood the premise of the game. Helpful hint. Every time you put back in box make sure to count them. Otherwise if you lose one then the ice won't stack back in very well. Oh and my grandson somehow related this game to the movie Frozen. I think because of the start of the movie where the men are breaking ice.	1
toys for tots	1
We love this game!	1
My husband and son have become quite competitive with this game. It has held up great, and my four year old loves it.	1
Excellent	1
I was highly disappointed in this. While the netting was great, there is a false advertising that there is a voucher inside to claim your larvae. Yes there is a voucher inside but you have to pay additional shipping costs above all the money already spent, just to get larvae.	-1
Play therapists use this game to teach social skills like taking turns. My 3 year old can play this game. We play it all the time along with Pop the Pig. Candyland takes too long per game with two people. This is fast and easy to set up. An adult is required to set it up since it is too tight for a typical three year old to set up.	1
my lil one loves this game	1
loved this game as a kid! purchased it for my 4 year old. My only issue is that it is too hard for him to put together on his own. Not a huge problem to have!	1
a classic that my son loves to break and I put back together.  Lots of fun!!!	1
Another great "old" game that kids love to play. If you played this years ago -  you will have the same fun. The hammers are a little on the flimsy side but otherwise good game and well made.	1
3 minutes of setup. 30 seconds of fun. I loathe when the kids pull this game out.	-1
Kids are so excited! We have been watching the caterpillars grow bigger every day.  It's amazing how fast they grow!!! It's been 4 days so they should be creating their crysalyuses transform soon! We can't wait!	1
What a blast!!! Educational, easy, and fun! My son and daughter love this and so do I!	1
My granddaughter loved this butterfly garden. I sent for the larvae early so she could have them when she received the habitat.  She is enthralled with the entire experience and it is worth every dime and more.  Highly recommend - plus she has the coupon that comes with the habitat to get another batch of larvae and repeat the experience.	1
preschool class loved this hope to use it again soon	1
Gave this to my son for his 5th birthday and he had so much fun playing it. He thought it was funny when the ice would break and make the bear fall down. And he loves breaking the ice with the hammers.	1
We love playing this game with our 4yr old! She played it with her 2yr old friend and they had a blast. Putting the ice pieces in can be hard so an older person will need to do that. Great game at a great price.	1
I don't understand the appeal, but my first grader LOVES this thing. Can't stop playing it, and it actually gets him really would up. It's cheap and they love it. What's not to like?	1
So much fun for young kids. We played this endlessly when my kids were toddlers. Very fun game that kids don't tire of easily. Easy to play and set up and a quick game when you're looking for something fast to play. Even kids a little older can play with younger siblings/friends/cousins.	1
So this game consists of a plastic table that is hollow in the inside and you place the "ice" blocks into the middle. They are all held in my friction between adjacent blocks and the pressure exerted from the tabs on the edges of the plastic table. Pretty clever if I do say so myself, wish I had thought of it. So, once the blocks are in place (which takes a little bit of time...maybe 2-3 min) you put an ice skating bear on the special block and then take turns tapping out different blocks and trying to find loose blocks that won't cause the whole thing to collapse (and dunk the bear in the lake I guess?). Overall a pretty active game that my 4.5 year old son loves playing. He doesn't really get the strategy of the game much but likes wailing away on the blocks with the little hammers that come with the game....meh at least he has picked up the concept of "turns". Overall a pretty cute game that is well made and worth the price. It's not going to be hours and hours of play time but we bring out occasionally and have a good 20 min session of fun.  I try to make my reviews engaging and useful. Please click the helpful button if you thought this review was worthwhile. Thanks!	1
My daughters can not stop playing this game. The price for this old school game was exactly as well.	1
This has been really fun. Yes there is a $5 fee to get the caterpillars. We had one arrive dead. So 4 butterflies. Then one caterpillar knocked down another chrysalis and it died. So only 3. That is how life works, so it's a good view of reality. A great activity for fun or school.	1
Family favorite for a 22 month old and 3.5 year old.	1
Great Christmas gift	1
This was a gift and my grandson loved it!!!	1
Fun game for school!	1
This tent never ceases to please. I've had one of these, or very close to it, for decades while raising children. It goes up in minutes and can be used inside the house, in the child's room even, it's not that big, but very roomy and useful. Also quite sturdy and can be used outside as well. For the price it's a miracle.	1
Little one loves it.	1
Our family loves this and gets one every summer.	1
I have not used my butterfly gardens yet, but I have high hopes that it is going to be amazing.  The negative review is because the enclosed certificate is basically useless.  I ordered 3 of these and 3 of the Ladybug farms and my certificates did not work because you are not allowed to bundle the certificates with any other products.  Ie - Maybe the certificates work if you redeem them INDIVIDUALLY with no other products, but otherwise no go.  This is a problem if you are buying more than one because you need to have them shipped 2nd day air.  Obviously, if you don't bundle the order, you'll spend more than the certificates are worth in shipping.  If you do standard lead-time, from the time you order until the time you have a hatched butterfly is about 5 to 8 weeks.  I just dropped another $150 on actual bug larvae in addition to the gardens/farms I purchased.	-1
Got for my 5 year old granddaughter. We had a lot of fun playing. There was a lot of giggling too	1
Fun and simple to play w/little ones.	1
love it	1
My 4 year old loves this game. It is also interesting for adults for a little while.	1
A classic game that my 3 yr old loves to play.  I will likely be buying the other sets offered by Hasbro for the 3-5 yr old range due to how much my son loves it.  The build of the game is a little cheap, mainly the frame.  I can see it holding up for a while, but eventually breaking under use.	1
Kid already love it just waiting for the caterpillars to come!	1
This was really neat and he caterpillar customer service was great!	1
My kids loved this so much, we bought a second one and took it to their elementary school class, so the other kids could experience it.	1
My 3.5 year old LOVES this tent! He plays with it for hours at a time almost every day since we put it together for him about a month ago. He often plays VERY rough with it, pretending it's a rocket ship and jumping on it, pushing against the walls etc etc and while I've had to adjust an odd strap or two it's remarkable how well it's holding up against his really "enthusiastic" play. I've been going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars as my son loves it so much he'd probably find a way to give it 10 stars but I just really dislike that there is no convenient way to put it away between play times, so it has to sit permenantly in the middle of his room, and it takes up a large amount of space -- for the footprint it leaves you'd think you'd at least be able to fit one very petite mom in there, and for the $50 price you'd think you could fold it up easily without having to take the whole thing apart. But these are still just my only small gripes about a tent that is WAAAAY more durable than you'd ever expect and had provided my son hours and hours of entertainment. Overall I absolutely recommend it, just make sure you're keeping in mind that this thing has to be completely taken apart to be put away at all so unless you're getting it for a specific use, like a slumber party for instance, you're going to need a large area in your home for this thing to reside! It would work best for those with a playroom that want perhaps a permanent tent set up for a play space, book nook, etc.	1
Cute tent and fairly easy to set up and take down.  Plenty of room for 2 year old, toys and grandma.	1
I gave this to my grandson and he loves the game!!!	1
purchsed as a gift for a child at a Christmas party but didn't arrive as expected, arrived late and wasn't able to give.	1
I bought this as a gift for my daughter's upcoming birthday. She asked for board games this year and since she will only be turning 6, I wanted to find games that are not too complicated and are fun. I had this game when I was a child and I loved it, so I am sure that she will too.	1
Our kid is just over 2.5 years old.  She KINDA understands the game...but she doesn't get the concept of winning.  She just gets excited when all the "ice" breaks.  But she absolutely LOVES it.  It's kind of a pain to keep putting back together after each round - so parents will grow tired of this quickly, but your kids will love it!	1
great for using in my classroom!	1
My kids seem to enjoy this.  They like catching bugs and putting them in it to watch them move around and eat.	1
All were alive at arrival!!! Good over all!!!	1
Fun.	1
What a great game! My four-year-old boy loves it. It's fast so it keeps attention while teaching strategy and how to take turns. I highly recommend it for your preschooler.	1
The kids love this game- especially my 4 year old. You have to set it up for them after each turn if they are young, but other than that it's a great game! And fast shipping	1
Loved this game as a kid	1
"Guess Who" has a lot more going for it than the ubiquitous Gameboys.  For one thing, you actually have to TALK to your opponent to play this game.  For another, you develop questioning skills in order to "one-up" your opponent next time.  Most of all, there are no levels that get beat, thus requiring purchase of yet another game cartridge!   My boys have passed many an hour on the road playing this game, and it has inspired many a creative effort on their parts to try and come out on top.  Sometimes they go for most obscure clue, others, the quickest round.  I have also used the game with students who are cognitively delayed to teach questioning, and language disabled kids to help them focus on pertinent information.  Of course, they are simply told we will be playing a game.  Heaven forbid that they might learn something!   This game has been a classic for years with good reason--it appeals to many on many levels.  I will never forget the first night our two boys were in separate rooms across the hall from each other--playing "Guess Who" through their walkie-talkies!	1
Grandson loves it	1
This game is so much fun. Just as I remember it.	1
Very fun game	1
Super cute little tent. My 1 1/2 yr old great grandson loves it and that's what really matters. I wouldn't take it camping but as a toy it is really cool. It's easy to put up and down and we've used inside and out.	1
I put it up in the bedroom and my grandchildren love it	1
Best product ever	1
For the $11 I paid for this, it has easily become one of the best gifts my small five year old received during this past Christmas. Basically, you receive a kit that includes a butterfly habitat, a small instruction manual and a voucher that you use to order your caterpillars. You then go online, enter the coupon code from your voucher at the Insect Lore website. You have to pay $5 (which makes the total cost for your butterflies about $16) for shipping to most locations in North America, but about four to eight days later, you receive a cup with five small caterpillars inside. (with the included food they need to grow)  And then, over the next ten days or so, you watch as they transform into the chrysalid stage and then move them to the habitat. About three days later, they emerge as butterflies and the look of delight on your little one's face will produce emotion on yours. After that, you feed the butterflies a sugar water diet for the next few days until you release them.  Might sound a bit corny, but it is a great learning experience for a small child.   My little guy had a great time watching them grow and develop from caterpillars to chrysalids to butterflies. Easily a five star product.	1
great product, worth the money, we had a ball watching them hatch and letting them go.	1
birthday gift..ok	1
excellent	1
Beware: this is NOT the older version of the game that is pictured in this seller's (BuyforLessUK) 2nd and 3rd photos.  (The version where you pick a card and all the peopl flip up or collapse down flat.) If you want the older version, you will be disappointed.  The version I received is the one pictured in the first photo; it has doors that open left to right and two rows of faces at the top of each board.  I loved the original version of this game as a kid; that's what I was hoping to buy here, but this was not it.  Good luck.	-1
Love this game	1
If you are familiar with the classic version of Don't Break the Ice, then you do not need to read past the first paragraph because I will just point out the differences. If you are not familiar, then you don't know what you missed... There are two main differences between this and the classic version. First, the frame comes in two pieces which makes the box much smaller for storage but makes the frame itself a bit flimsier. Still, it is nice to be able to take the thing apart. It cuts the size of the box in half for storage. The other difference is that in the past the center block was a random man staying still on the ice trying to keep his composure as giant mallets fell from the sky. Well, this has been replaced by some abomination of my childhood game playing. Now it looks like the Slush Puppy bear on skates. I suppose old ice guy drowned or something, but the knew guy has one leg in the air and does not stay put. He sometimes just falls over when you are tapping the thing. It is not the same game. It was never all that great, but this changes knocks it down a whole star. Boo.  If you have never played Don't Break the Ice, the object is to try to make a game last more than two minutes, which is unlikely. After spending several minutes putting plastic cubes of "ice" into a frame, each player takes a turn using a flimsy plastic mallet to knock out only one ice block at a time. The person who knocks down a 2x2 block of ice with some skating bear-dog-yeti thing on it is the one who loses. There are several strategies out there that are equally likely to not be all that entertaining including the bash like crazy strategy, the engineer who takes 20 minutes to take a turn strategy, and the "maybe I can make this thing float with my mind" strategy. Either way, the actual playtime on a given round is almost always shorter than the time spent setting up. My kid is able to help me set it up now, but I have to do some of the later pieces.  It is an okay game for nostalgia purposes, but if you have not played then seriously, don't start now. Pick a new game and stay away from this one. Kids, however, will love it.	1
dumb game...tap one block a few at a time fall...takes about 3 hits with the little hammer and all fall down!	-1
My boys absolutely love this game. They received it as a gift when they were 4 and a year later, it's still one of their favorite games. It's a pain to put the ice back in after they play and it's too difficult for small kids to do on their own. But, it's an easy game for small kids to play.	1
Purchased this with tunnel. It's my daughter and her friends favorite thing to do at our house	1
So far so good. My destructive kids haven't broken it yet!	1
This was very fun to watch the butterfly's grow!	1
Lots of fun! Just keep in mind if you're gifting this that they will have to pay to get the butterflies.  I think it was $5 with the certificate inside.	1
My 4 year old daughter absolutely loved every minute of this from receiving the live caterpillars and watching them squirm around in the cup for a few days, to watching them disappear into their chrysalids, and then watching them slowly emerge one at a time and flutter around happily. She would literally stare at them for hours, and she loved gently putting her finger under their feet and feeling them tickle her as they crawled around on her hand and up her arm. Releasing them was bittersweet as we had grown quite fond of them, and didn't want to say goodbye - but it was nice to see them fluttering up towards the sun, and they hung around our back yard for a while. We would see them every now and then in the yard until it got cold.  We will DEFINITELY be purchasing more caterpillars next season, and doing this again! HIGHLY recommended for toddlers, or butterfly lovers of any age.	1
Just the same as when I was a kid (20 years ago).  I worry a bit that the tabs holding the two frame pieces are going to crack over time due to assembly/disassembly of the frame to get it in/out of the box.	1
Bought this as a gift for a friends kid and he absolutely loved it. He had never seen the game before and thought it was so much fun.	1
Great game.  Wish it had a better box for storage.  The base is hard to pull apart for take down.	1
Classic game, 3 year old grandson has fun playing.	1
My 4 yo enjoys playing the game. It's a little difficult for him to get all the ice cubs together when setting it up, so I always have to help him with the last few. He has a lot of fun knocking them all down. While it is a fun game for the kids, I have to say after a couple rounds I get annoyed with putting it all back together and suggest we move on to something else ;)	1
This game is a classic.  Kids love it!  Excellent memory builder.	1
gift	1
Our family loves Guess Who?  We purchased this one NEW, rare for our household! ha!  Our preteen daughter at that time, liked the idea of this version because you can go online and print different sheets. So, this opened up many new games for our son and daughter to play.  I buy Guess Who? board games to use in the classrooms. The ideas are endless. Words, pictures, concepts can be placed on the playing pieces and how players guess is open ended, depending upon the skills being taught.	1
This is seriously the coolest thing ever!! We have grown 4 rounds of butterflies from larvae thus far.  I have 4 boys ages 2, 2, 3, and 5 and they all LOVE watching their butterflies grow and then releasing them once they're grown.  We've also given 3 of these as gifts and have been told what a great gift they are!!	1
my 3 year old loved this~ def buying again	1
This is the 2nd time I've bought this item, this time I bought 4 and gave them as Christmas gifts.  My 4 year old loves to watch the transformation and it's a wonderful way to teach her about nature.  One downside is you still need to spend an additional $5 to receive the caterpillars in the mail, It's not clear when you buy it and a way of getting more money out of you.	1
My sons got this as a Christmas gift from my mom. It's a little frustrating to put together the first time- but after you do it once it's a piece of cake to take down and put back up. More than enough room for two kiddos to lay in. Makes a great gift!  I also had my mother in law purchase a tunnel thing to go with it- as seen in my picture. Hours of fun!	1
I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter and it did not disappoint! It is well made and I was surprised at how big it is! She has more than enough room for her bed pillow, blanket, stuffed animals - it looks like a 'real' pup tent! Definitely recommend it!	1
Nice game	1
Great games for young children.	1
I used to own the old version of this game and I think the construction was a better design.  Sometimes new doesn't mean better.  Still, I like the concept of the game and it's a great game for language practice for my speech students.	1
Great game for kids and parents to play together.  No plugging it in, no batteries necessary.  a good old fashioned game.	1
this is a great version of Guess Who.  It's got several boards not just people but characters and even items to guess.  Makes it more interesting and gives more options than the normal game. This was a real hit in our house.	1
This is a very good teaching aid type game for preschoolers and my grandson still plays with it several years later	1
This game is one that all ages can play.  What great fun but would be better if it had more pages to alternate.	1
Great product, great price	1
My daughter loved watching the butterflies change but I don't like the fact that you have to pay $10+ per year to reorder the butterflies. So she has turned the butterfly garden into a toy carrier, which makes her happy.	1
These butterfly gardens are great. I've had a 100% success rate with the shipped butterfly larva. We've done this a few times and it never loses its thrill.  However, the larva gets expensive - it costs as much to buy larva as to buy the whole kit, which is annoying as these "gardens" are perfectly resusable.  I wish the larva was available at a more reasonable price. "The Butterfly Guy" gives suggestions for obtaining your own butterfly eggs free and in the wild.	1
Really cute toy for a child.	1
CUTE	1
Worked as advertised.	1
Disappointed. Lasted 11 days. Stitching in seam came apart and can no longer use	-1
Note the pictures below which show the doors lifting UP and the individual card for the mystery person --- then note the box cover shows doors opening sideways & a slide card above --- so what am I purchasing --- I chose the box that showed the old-fashioned product (doors opening up) and individual cards --- how do I know what is in the box????	-1
Point of the game is to figure out which character you opponent has drawn.  You ask questions to eliminate people.  For example is it a man or woman, do they wear glasses etc. pros:  our speech tutor recommended it for our son because you have to form questions to try and eliminate.  I like that he has to come up with a full sentence.  The kids have to use both broad questions and more specific questions. cons: Not the first game my kids would pick to play - but they will play it. The cards sometimes slip out of their slots - and it was a pain to put them all in when we first got the game.	1
I had this game as a child. Yes I found it odd that there were far more men than women, but I don't remember it being a horrid thing nor do I remember thinking "oh, women must not be as valuable". I think that's taking it a bit far, it's just a game with cartoon faces. I liked the silly beards, hats, faces etc. When we were a bit older 7+ or so we banned the gender question all together because it made the game last longer and we had to ask more specific questions, such as "does your person have long eyelashes?" or "does your person have rosey cheeks?". It was a fun game, one I remember very fondly, so of course I was excited to see this on the shelf at my local toy store. I purchased the latest version of Guess Who? for my kids. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this game. Flimsy paper pictures of the characters, cheap plastic tiles for the game board, the game board itself where all the small plastic tile with pictures go was crappy low quality plastic. The plastic tile pieces just snap on, but do NOT stay on. They pop off constantly in the middle of the game, which screws up the game if you try and put it on then three other faces fall or pop off in the process, OR they go on crooked. even when you flip the tiles down there is an issue. The row in front is too close to the row behind so when you flip a tile down from the back rows they land on or get stuck on the row in front of them...meaning you have to move the front tile up so the back tile will go down. That causes, of course, the tiles in front to pop off sometimes. I don't know why or when they changed the style of this game but it's a complete RIP OFF. The game I played as a child was well made with a thick plastic base, and tiles that were hooked WELL into the base, the tiles never bumped each other as you flipped them down, and the pictures rested securely and flat inside each tile, not bowed out and folded (after much use) in the tiles.  This game is SUCH a waste of money. I will now begin what I'm sure is a long search for an original game from 1989-1995 through collectors, eBay and other places where I might find an original. I'm so disgusted that this is the way things have gone w/toys and games these days. Cheap materials, crappy workmanship, POOR execution in design and a jacked up price-tag!	-1
My 4 and 10 year old both enjoy this game as well as my husband and myself.  Some children's games are just not enjoyable for adults but this one is more fun than many.  Easy rules.  The hardest part for young children to learn is which peple to flip down after you ask a question.  This game uses process of elimination and grouping like features such as facial hair, glasses, female/male, hair color, hat, and eye color.  Overall a fun game!  I like that there are people of light and dark skin but would be nice to show people of different cultures.	1
Awesome gift. A++++Transaction	1
My 3-year-old LOVES to play this game.	1
fun game to play with my kids...I always loved it when I was a kid	1
Too expensive. $20 bucks just to buy the screened "habitat", and then $5 to get larvae shipped to you.	-1
Awesome	1
My girls loved this. Larva came when I wanted it to. This is a great gift. I would recommend this product.	1
Good quality for indoor play. Haven't used outdoors.	1
My 2 year old grandson loves this pop up tent. He can use it inside or outside and it is a good "escape". When his sister gets a little older, I'll get one for her. It's nice to have a "private place". Can also be "carefully" used on top of bed.	1
So easy to set up and take down. My granddaughters and my cat love this tent!	1
fun	1
daugher loved it.  all 5 hatched and grew.	1
Just as described	1
They deliver the caterpillars quickly.  It is a joy to watch them grow, morph, emerge, and then fly away.  A great way to bring Science to life.	1
Cool house for butterflies !	1
My son has enjoyed this so much we have done the process twice with the butterflies. Its really worth it just to see the excitement in the childs eyes when sees his "own" butterflies for the first time.	1
Got this for my sister for her birthday. We used to play it when we were little. Even though we are in our 20's, it was a lot of fun to play. Must have if you played it as a kid or have kids!!	1
Grandson loves this game.	1
Great game with my 4 and 2 year old. It takes a while to reset it after each game, but not too long. They are patient to wait, and love playing it again. Hours of fun.	1
This was as ordered for 4 year old. Not for camping outside but easy to set up and doesn't take up too much room.	1
I remember playing this game with my best friend when we were little, so of course I had to buy it for my son!!  This game is great for little ones because it teaches them how to pay attention, look for detail, and search for clues. It's not even a hard game once you play it a time or two, and that's always great so that you don't always have to sit and read the directions every time you play the game.  The only drawback to this game, is that you have to keep up with all of the pieces - we lost one of the people pieces, and so we had to sort through the other color to find that same person to take them out of the game.  It would be nice to have a back up set of people pieces or something, but we know how to improvise, thank goodness :)	1
Plan on only using it once .. When they come out of the cocoon they are all bloody and gross.	1
fun, quick project.  We raised them in the summer so that we could release them into the wild.  This was an interesting away to watch nature develop.  My child love science and we came up with the plan to make a simple journal the changes she saw each day with words and pictures.	1
Lots of fun for the kids - they love banging out the ice cubes. The noise can get on this mom's nerves after the 6th or 7th round but then I just tell them they have to go to the basement playroom. ;-)	1
Great!!	1
The child loves it. I'm not a huge fan of the way a friend of his plays with it (crazily and violently). It ruins the happiness of owning the game.	1
Gets old fast, but the kids love it.	1
AA++	1
My daughter loves it. Perfect size. Easy assembly and breakdown. Also easy to clean.	1
LOVE this product.  Hours of fun for little ones.  Easy to assemble.	1
This was a xmas gift for my great grandson, but we just got it set up today. Easy as pie, and he loves it. Bigger than I somehow expected, which is good; room for a friend.	1
Great learning toy. You do have to order the caterpillars and pay additional shipping. (The bugs are free with the. certificate they give you, but shipping is not free. A great learning experience though. My 10 yr old granddaughter loved	1
My niece and nephew love watching butterflies grow.	1
awesome tent.  has survived lots of rough play.  very easy to put up	1
This was a gift for our almost 4 year-old; he loves it.  Indoors, it's a perfect fort or play area, and we may use it outside once the season changes. It's simple and quick to put up & take down on my own.	1
I don't know what to say here. My kids just love this game! It's so simple yet so much fun, building suspense. My little ones are knocking out the ice cubes and I'm sitting there making them nervous with my sound effects...lol. We have a blast with this game!	1
Thank you! Quick shipping and fun product for kids in therapy!	1
Its a good concept, but I don't like games that take longer to set up then they do to play. You are done playing this in less than a minute and it takes about 3 minutes to set back up.	-1
Easy to put together and the kids love it.  Small enough size that I can put it up in the living room or the bedroom so they can play - two toddlers can fit inside for pretend camp-outs.	1
My grandson loves this tent!	1
Our son loved this tent! Great quality and simple style, easy to assemble. Highly recommend!	1
Butterflies were slightly difficult to get	1
Worked so well, we had 9 successful butterfly hatching's in this and we are saving it for next year	1
I bought this product because I thought that it would be a fun and educational way to show my boys (ages 3 and 5) how a caterpillar becomes a butterfly.  The kit you purchase here comes with the butterfly garden and a pipette (feeder).  This kit does not come with the caterpillars, you have to mail away for those little guys.  There is a voucher in the kit for caterpillars you can purchase for $5.  Our caterpillars came within one week.  We only had four caterpillars in our container but each eventually became a butterfly.  The caterpillars will eat the food (already in the container that will come to you in the mail) and after 2 weeks or so, they will form cocoons at the top of the container.  You will need to (carefully) remove the top of the container and put it in the garden.  One of our cocoons actually detached from the lid during this process, we put it on a paper towel at the bottom of the butterfly garden and he was just fine - actually the first one to hatch.  After about two more weeks your butterfly's should hatch.  This was actually a pretty amazing process.  As the butterfly's get closer to hatching you can see them moving and wiggling around.  The actual hatching of the butterfly was a learning experience to me.  I didn't realize it would be so messy.  I mean, it wasn't a huge mess or anything but you will definitely need to clean out the garden if you plan to use it again.  All in all, this is a great product!  I plan to buy the caterpillars again next spring and do this project again.  To supplement this product I also bought&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/National-Geographic-Readers-Caterpillar-to-Butterfly/dp/1426309201/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">National Geographic Readers: Caterpillar to Butterfly</a>.	1
Fun homeschooling project!  We got our cup of caterpillars in the mail, 4 out of the 5 made it to chrysalides and we had 4 butterflies come out yesterday.  We will let them go tomorrow.  My kids loved watching the process and learning about metamorphosis.  Great tool.	1
Highly recommend the Butterfly Garden - 3 time Customer with Great Results - But Don't buy the Ladybug Land it's cheap looking and the Larvae arrive DEAD!	1
Overall pretty happy with this kit.  You have to  order the caterpillars online, but it is easy and they arrive quickly. The kit comes with a voucher for them so you just pay $5 shipping cost.  My kids loved doing this. They watched the butterflies everyday and were so excited to let them free.  This provided great educational opportunities and we will probably order this again on a bi-yearly basis.  I didn't keep our habitat, because it gets kind of yucky when the butterflies hatch, but if you clean it out you can just order the caterpillars from insect lore and reuse your habitat.	1
I played this game as a child and enjoyed it. I recommend this for a young age group (about 4 to 12) with adult supervision as it teaches kids deduction skills. All other (older) ages will enjoy the game the first time it is played but will be bored by about the third time.	1
Like most toys made now as opposed to when I was a child it is not a durable.  The game is still the same, and my kids have fun playing with it.  They are 4 and 6.  My 4 year old understands it with a little help and my 6 year old was able to catch on right away.  Because of their attendtion span they are only able to play about 2 or 3 times before they lose interest so the length of the game is good.	1
Perfect tent and great quality product. Sturdy.	1
Love this tent. My toddler get so much out of it. Easy to set up and tear down. Great size.	1
This tent stores so many toys and we use it for our movie nights. So much fun. It's good practice for our kids as well because we are a tent-camping family!	1
Kids love it. My 1 1/2 year old will spend all day in and out of this thing. Great little play piece for the kids.	1
Bought for a two year old who loves to crawl through the tunnel. Have not assembled the tent portion yet.	1
This is a great game.  The idea is simple and fun.  Encourage some analytical thinking for the kids.  Very affordable.  Somewhat frustrating is the initial assembly required.  It will take at least 15 to 20 minutes to finish setting up the game.  You will need to manually remove each card and insert to each individual holders.  You may also need to use additional transparent tape so they won't slide down.  Construction of the plastic is not very sturdy.	1
good game	1
My 4 year old enjoys this game. She laughs hysterically EVERY SINGLE time he falls through. It's a little loud when all the ice breaks, and there are lots of pieces to keep track of, but the belly laughs make up for it.	1
Grandson loves the game.	1
Just an ok game, it takes longer to set up than to play.	-1
I do not recommend this game and cannot understand the 4.5 star average rating.  Yes, my kids enjoy it.  However, it is so poorly put together that its just really, really annoying to play.  The plastic pieces routinely fall over, or come off entirely.  The person pictures come out quite easily unless you tape them in place, and if you tape them they may not flip properly.  It takes maybe 30-60 seconds of "set up" time to play a 2-4 minute game.  While this isn't the end of the world, I personally find it quite annoying.  Here is how the game works:  there are around 30 or 40 faces in the game.  Each player randomly picks one card from the 40.  Each player has a rack which includes cards for all the faces which are turned away from the opposing player so that only you can see the faces in your rack.  Each trait (for example gender) is split so that there is a minority (i.e. there are only 6ish female faces, and 6ish black faces, etc...) and a majority (the remaining faces -- i.e. 20+ are male, 20+ are white, etc...).  There are around 10 or so traits, all with this majority/minority trend -- gender, race, glasses, hats, bald, facial hair, etc...  Every person seems to have at least one or more minority traits (i.e. its a man, but he is bald, or wearing a hat.)  You ask a question, ie "is it a girl" and, depending on the answer, flip over the boys/girls on your rack to eliminate them, and by process of elimination, and by asking more questions eg "is the person bald" work down till there is only one person on your rack, which must be the person the opposing player picked.  Whoever gets down to one left on their rack first (i.e. figures out who the other player picked first) wins.  Getting lucky and picking the right minority trait to ask about is more useful than good logic.  I'm not overly PC or anything, but I just cant warm to a game the whole purpose of which is asking questions designed to exclude people with minority traits, so you can, by process of elimination, figure out who is left.  Moreover, the concept is so simple that I don't think the game is very educational.  The kids (even the very young) quickly learn the basic concept.  Once they learn it, there isn't any real learning left to do.  (Yes, its true an adult can use more advanced logic to pick the "best" questions, but good luck explaining that to a young kid.  Indeed, I bet there are plenty of adults that would not understand the logic behind selecting an optimal question.)  Skip it.	-1
piece of junk	-1
This is a great game. I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French. Lots of fun, easy to play, not determined by chance, teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.  Unfortunately, the new edition is very shoddily designed. The cards are flimsy, and they fall right out of their holders when they're flipped (or sometimes when they're *not* flipped).  Ultimately, the game is almost totally unplayable!  This is very disappointing to all of us. I'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game, and I'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster, I'll probably get brushed off.	-1
not sturdy, the poles broke through... ended up seeing the same on group on for half the price... didn't buy it since knew what poor quality this was, we returned it	-1
When I saw other people playing with it, I thought it was going to be tons of fun. but then when I bought it it stunk. I played it for one or two days with my brother but afterwords it's gathering dust in my closet along with Connect Four, Battleship and stuff like that. Don't get hypnotized by this toy!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!	-1
there are NO LOVE BUGS in this kit. Very disappointed in the advertising	-1
This kit was missing parts~	-1
This is pretty much my least favorite game that my children have ever owned. First of all, it is a serious pain to set up, because you really have to work at getting the "ice" to fit in there. Little kids cannot do it.  Then, they bang on the friggin thing making the worst, most annoying sound other than nails on a chalkboard and incessant whining). This sound literally goes through my bones and I have a high tolerance for kid toy sounds.  Not surprisingly, this game has mysteriously disappeared. FOREVER.	-1
The hammer is too flimsy...	-1
this is very popular with teachers, however unless you live in california, where these larva are shipped from, as soon as you release the butterflies they will die. these butterflies are not from the northern or eastern parts of america and they will not survive. yes the children get to see the life cycle of a butterfly but you raise these butterflies to just to kill them.	-1
The poles broke the very first time we set this tent up.  A definite disappointment.  Note:  if you do purchase this tent, it's larger than most kiddy play tents.  Make sure you have room.	-1
This only OK. It's a pain to assemble and the game is over pretty quick. OK as a entry into family games.	-1
I do not recommend this tent. It smells like the costumes from halloween in the 80's, it's HUGE and not well made.	-1
I got this game cause I remembered playing it when I was younger and just loved it.  So I got it for my kids.  I put all the ice in and then realized it didn't come with the big block of ice for the bear to sit on.  Still waiting for Hasbro to send us a big block.. otherwise whats the point in playing the game.	-1
Not really a lot to do for kids, would not buy it again. Would not recommend it. I was very disappointed	-1
Expensive and a little bit of a scam, with the mail in voucher for the caterpillars, PLUS $5 additional shipping charge.  Do not recommend.	-1
I bought this game after reading so many postive reviews. It is cheaply made and just no point to it unless you are a frustrated person who wants to hammer the same cube and make alot of noise.  Wish I could understand why so many reviewers liked it so much.  Someone enlighten me so I don't feel I wasted the money.	-1
Aggravation is one of those eternal classics, and is also known as Wahoo (Parchisi is another variant of the same basic concept).  Unfortunately, this edition is not.  The board is cheaply made and rather hideous to look at (I guess that's all at the expense of "being cool").  This board has been out since the 1990s, and it's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of.  The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour (purple, red, etc). The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily.  Also, this board is aimed squarely at little kids, and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.  I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s, and that board looks so much more stylish.  I wish they had that.  If you are wanting a good board, don't get this one.  There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources.  In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided.  One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife's grandma who loves Wahoo.  I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side.  The quality of these boards are great, strong, and durable.  Trust me, if you like Wahoo/Aggravation, a wooden board is definitely the way to go!  Much classier and much more appealing to adults as well as kids!	-1
This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls.  It's a classic and they're still excited to play when we bring it out, but they tire within two rounds, which only last about 30 seconds each. Left to their own, they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible, but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup, it's not really fun for anyone. There's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall, so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game. On our set, the plastic is poorly finished, so the bear doesn't stand/skate in the slot he's meant to. Perhaps it's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk. For now, PopUp Pirate is the family favorite. If you have other suggestions, please leave a comment.	-1
I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that aren't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us. My kids, ages 6 and 3, were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing. It's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids. Then, all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls. My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell. They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that's really only fun once or twice. I think we played it about four times in the past year. I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv/computer, but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play.	-1
Cheap Made n China. More suited for 4-5 year olds who don't care.	-1
There were several problems with items included in this case, which doesn't properly hold the contents. My daughter was excited to get this because she is into Spies, however her interest lasted only a day or two due to the inadequate equipment. Maybe she's a bit rough, but this was not well constructed, and wasn't owned long before it went to the trash recycle bin.	-1
This is another that the kids all want when they see the commercial.  It looks like it would be a blast. Don't bother.  It's just not fun.  It's hard for kids to get the ice cubes in right & the little hammers are junk.  With very little use, a couple of ours actually broke.  I either put this away permanently or I threw it away.  I can't remember which.  This is junky garbage.  Don't buy this.	-1
I ordered this for my classroom. Love the pop-up house and the packaging. After getting the box, I got online and ordered the caterpillars. They arrived in a timely fashion but they were very dead. I contacted Insect Lore and received a quick reply stating that the caterpillars would be sluggish upon arrival and to please wait. I knew they were dead but waited the prescribed time and contacted Insect Lore again about replacement caterpillars. I have not heard back from them after contacting the company 3 times. Sad for my classroom. We will not have enough time before school gets out to grow another set of caterpillars now.	-1
This is a trick taking card game, like spades or pinochle. The difference is that, while those games are actually fun, Rook is not. It's basically pinochle, but boring. Buy a pinochle deck or play spades with a regular deck. More versatile and more fun.	-1
We bought this for our daughter when she was younger. It was too frustrating. The ants are not made like they once were and it is near impossible to get them into the pants. We would cheat for her and pretend they went in after a long while of trying. Even we could not get them in. Plus the material is so cheesy that they break very easily. Save your money and buy a better game instead.	-1
Lowest quality playground	-1
I love Yahtzee, and for years, I had just used random 6 siders taking from other games, and printed the scorecards off the internet, but I was out shopping and saw this "classic" edition in the clearance bin for $7, and thought, "The dice look cool and maybe its time to get a "real" version.  So I bought it and took it home and we played it, and now I see why it was in the clearance bin.  The black holder for the dice, that is supposed to act as a rolling cup is rubbish.  It doesn't stand up, so someone has to be constantly holding it upright or all the dice spill out.  The dice themselves are cheap, lightweight dice that feel like you could crumble them in your bare hands, and I fully expect them to break at some point.  It does come with a full sheet Yahtzee score cards (yippee), and NO rolling tray.  Even my moms "cheap" Yahtzee game from the 90's included a really cheap rolling tray.  Hasbro has redefined CHEAP for games, a bit too cheap for my taste.  Someday I will just buy one of the Deluxe editions and be done with it.	-1
We bought this as well as the Elenco electric sets thinking it would be the same. It's cheap, the parts and wires are sharp and it's not even worth the shipping. The Elenco sets are great!	-1
This is a frustrating game as it is sold as a child's game, yet adults can barely get it to play correctly. The shoddy plastic used is thin enough to make the jumping difficult and is vexing enough to make my children refuse to play.	-1
It's too hard for a child to get the ants into the pants!	-1
I ordered this for my almost 2 year old because he is obsessed with the one at daycare with the glasses.  But the one we got had no glasses!  I feel very mislead!	-1
Impossible for both kids and adults.	-1
We received the product as described, sent in the extra money for the caterpillars, etc. They showed up about 8 business days later which was disappointing, but nonetheless they were hopeful. We followed the instructions to the letter but 4 out of the 5 butterflies died which was heartbreaking for our daughter who received this as a birthday present.	-1
Very disappointed.  I ordered catepillar larva via the website online and they NEVER came.  I am going to begin to attempt to reach the company but I wouldn't waste my time on this if I were you as I've read this has happened to several people.	-1
Received as a mess - Misaligned Frame - Had to pre-drill some of the holes our self - Should have been sold as an openboxed item - Damaged Product - Missing Assembly Hardware (several) - Not all components were still on factory bags, etc.  Experience: 1. Opened outer box. Pulled inner box out (with wagon inside). As we lifted the inner box, parts just started falling out into the outer packaging. It was then we realized the box had been previously opened and terribly re-taped as only partially closed! * See Photo  2. As we layed out the parts per the instructions, we discovered many parts were NOT in bags (previously opened). 2 Bolts and 4 Nuts and 1 Red hub cap were MISSING. * See photo of hex bolt (example), we dug up a few from our tool shed.  3. As we assembled using our own parts, we noticed the frame was shaped like a leaning rectangle. Had to hammer it with a large rubber mallet to partially re-align. * See photo. This was as close as we could get it. It was twice as far out.  4. The frame had a chip of wood missing from the corner. This was "as received", not from hammering. Maybe previous owner whacked it before returning? IDK. * See photo.  All in all, our little boy was super excited to receive a nice red wagon. At the end of the day, he was happy but what it took to get it to a usable and somewhat aligned should NOT be the consumer experience and NEVER cost this much.  If you are going to sell open box, not inventoried or an un-inspected mess -- then advertise it like that and maybe charge 80% LESS than we paid for this junk.  Not worth trying to return nor trying to explain to a young child why they have to give it back. We will keep it as our best option. Strongly recommend you search for a better product or at least a better QA department. Terrible experience.	-1
i was really disappointed in this product. my daughter wanted it for a science project. the caterpillars arrived a week late. there were 6 of them.\, only one survived to become a butterfly. there was not enough food for all of them to survive. it was not a pretty site.	-1
It arrived scratched and broken...Had to return product and buy new from Target	-1
Damaged item and box.	-1
barrel sticks	-1
The game doesn't really set up properly. Then pieces don't nestle right so the pot sits oddly and makes the game less fun.	-1
Ok game, but I ask myself why would I want a game that comes with tiny plastic beans? A poor choice if little pieces drive you nuts.	-1
The bean pot does not sit straight making the game useless since it is already tilted to one side. I have tried to get it to stay straight, but nothing works.	-1
Not like the original.  Cheaply made.	-1
I probably wouldn't buy this again The quality of the plastic isn't great and I don't think it will last long	-1
Game works pretty good but I would not consider this in good condition, it is missing beans and the stickers are all worn off, I would not call this good condition I would say fair or poor. The plastic does not support properly.	-1
Not the game I had as a child, very cheaply made :(	-1
I had expected a game even better than Scrabble, but Upwords is not!  Games fizzle out in no time due to the small board and dullness of having to change words instead of create new ones.  Unlike Scrabble, there is no real vocabulary challenge.  I don't recommend this one at all.	-1
Very Poor quality product.  Nothing like the original ventage game.  DON'T buy this game!!!!  We had to put weights on one side to balance it so the kids could play with it.  After playing with it one time, they were frustrated that it was so much work to make the balance so they could even begin.	-1
cheap made and didn't balance correctly, no matter what we did to try to get it to work.  Funny little plastic "beans" were hard to handle and didn't seem to make much difference when you added them to the pot.  It might tump over after 1 bean or not tump over at all if they all were added.  Tried to play it once, doubt it ever leaves the box again unless the grand uses it for something else.	-1
The butterfly net was fine. But, it would of been better if we actually could get the butterflies! The Insect Lore company is TERRIBLE with customer service... absolutely horrible. I tried 5 times--no joke!--to get the free caterpillars per the coupon that came in the butterly net package. And 5 times was told to leave a message for customer service--no one ever called me back. And, 5 times was disappointed and left frustrated and angry that I couldn't get anyone to filful my order. I originally ordered the caterpillars online but for some reason my order didn't go through right. So, I got a letter in the mail saying to call or mail in payment again. I wanted to call thinking it would be easiest that way and 5 times got nothing. My daughter was sad over this because she so badly wanted it. Oh, and at the final attempt, I asked the person on the phone who couldn't help me AGAIN and advised that I leave ANOTHER message for customer service that Insect Lore did a big promotional campaign and because of that couldn't handle all the calls coming in for ordering--three words for Insert Lore: Not My Problem. If you say you sell something then sell it and treat your customers right because now, they lost me as a customer forever. So, buyer beware... if you want those free caterpillars get ready for headaches. I finally gave up and returned the net.	-1
piece of junk	-1
The item arrived right on time, but it wasn't clear to me that you have to order the caterpillars separately AND you have to pay an additional $5.00 AND pay postage to send in the form.  This might turn out to be really neat,educational, durable,we don't know yet- but it should show in big print that there's additional effort and cost required.  This stuff isn't easy to explain to an exicted 5 yr old	-1
Not the fun game I remember as a kid.  The "beans" are plastic & the kettle is even cheaper plastic & tips really easily.  We can't get more than a few beans on top before it tips so it makes for some really short unchallenging games.  My 4 year old gets bored with it quickly.	-1
It did not hold my children 2 and 4 for long at all.  They played with it for 2 minutes then got bored with the game.  The beans fall over the side very easy so they got frustrated.  It could be for older children but then it would be to childish.	-1
Milton Bradly makes some of our favorite family games, but this is not one of them. It's cheap plastic, with poor fit and finish. We can't get our bean pot to balance evenly, so it starts to tip even before we put the beans on.	-1
If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you.  Pros: Idea is neat, balancing beans until the bowl tips over.  Cons: Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up. Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly. The game is too hard for children under 8, and not interesting for children over 8.  Suggestion: Buy "Don't Break the Ice" instead... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price.	-1
This is definitely not the same game I remember playing as a kid. This version is cheaply made junk. The bean pot is made of two thin plastic halves that snap together. It's supported by "hands" that are even flimsier and make the pot tilt in one direction before you even put any beans on it. Even if you try to load up the opposite side of the pot to balance it, it stays tilted and the beans all end up sliding down to that side and off the pot. My 4-year-old daughter and I tried playing it several times until we both got frustrated with it. Now it just sits boxed up in a corner of her playroom, because whenever I ask my daughter if she wants to play it she says "No, it's no fun".	-1
Like the other reviewer mentions, the lid is far too easy to remove and there's no hinge or anything to keep the lid permanently attached to the box.  Needless to say, my 15 month old is more interested in pulling off the lid than he is in sorting the blocks.  I'm hoping that I'll be able to find the lid when he gets old enough to learn how to put the lid back on and use the toy the way it was intended to be used.	-1
The CATERPILLARS are NOT included and you have to pay $5.oo to get them shipped. What a joke. The TV commercial advertises "call now and get 2 sets of caterpillars", well, you have to pay extra and WAIT for them to be shipped! VERY disappointed! We haven't played with it yet. Still waiting for the Caterpillars!	-1
pieces break, not good storage for small pieces, too difficult to follow computerized voice and instruction for kids and adults. gave it away. don't recommend.	-1
My son got this for Christmas we'd only played it a few times and the electronics stopped working which makes the game completely useless.  I wish he'd gotten the one that didn't talk, at least games that don't talk aren't "broken" and unplayable if the electrical component dies.	-1
Yes, it's great to watch caterpillars grow, but this is NOT a kit to hatch them.  The price you pay is for a pop up butterfly tent and a plastic pipette.  The caterpillars cost you an additional $5. I received this as a gift and was really disappointed I had to pay to get the caterpillars.  Buyers, beware.	-1
I wasn't expecting these to be this small. From a great deal, it appeared to me like they were very expensive. I would get a lot cheaper elsewhere!	-1
These are LITTLE cans, not regular size to the price is decieving.	-1
Tiny hard to open containers.  Was expecting bigger containers for the price.	-1
Cheap and doesn't really work well.  Instead of feeling like a quick travel Hungry Hungry Hippos game, this feels like a cheap cash-in to fool people.  Avoid this product	-1
Buyer Beware! If I had read the 1 star reviews before purchasing, I would have noticed that this "case of colors" is really a 10 pack of mini-playdoh tubs, not the full sized ones. Not a bargain, at all, but since I can't return them, well, live and learn.	-1
waaaayyy too small.. even for a travel toy.  The balls get stuck inside.. you have to shake it to release them.  Sitting in the yard sale pile!	-1
Returned it. No longer the one pictured in the photo (the pink and yellow pair). Now much flimsier and doesn't work well.	-1
This item is very small and breaks easy. Not good for travel as the small marbles go f lying all over the place.	-1
I totally agree with past comments about the head not always going up and the balls not going in. My 3 year old decided it wasn't a fun game because it was "broken".  lol - i donated it to HOPE, maybe someone else can have fun figuring it out...	-1
These are very small.  I can get more for the same price at my grocery store.	-1
I like the regular Boggle, this one just seems to be a waste of money when you can make the regular version adaptable to a younger child.  My 5 year old did not find it as a game, he was extremely bored with it.  Also, I can do this with a set of flash cars and letters.	-1
Missing some of the dice. I ordered a new game but received a used game with missing pieces. This was a Christmas gift so I cant return it.	-1
I got this thinking it would a great little toy for my toddler, but i couldn't even get the hippos to 'eat' the balls. The mechanism keeps getting jammed, the balls keep getting stuck in between the hippo and the plastic dome... i got frustrated with it so i could only imagine the melt down with my child. It does say 4 and up, but i am well over 4 and i couldn't get the toy to work. waste of money, get the real one.	-1
Can't ever go wrong with play-doh even in teeny weeny containers	-1
Kids didn't play with as much as I thought they would	-1
The play-doh itself? Of course that is great. The size however. I thought I was getting full size containers. These are small. Not the tiny Halloween sized one but small. For the price I could have got more at target.	-1
If you had asked for my opinion of this toy when we first received it, I would have given you a four star review. It loses a star right off the bat for being over-priced. This toy has three features, a squeaker button, a star that clicks when you rotate it, and a clown that pops out of the box at the end of a musical performance when you twist the handle (jack in the box). I appreciated the basic color pattern and the fact the clown doesn't have a hinged door to hide in. I used to have a nice old fashioned jack in the box that could pinch your fingers on the hinge door. So this felt like an upgrade for my littlest guy.  So where did this item lose the next three stars? About 2 months of minimal play use from my 9 month old the star stopped clicking... it turned without resistance. I figured who cares? The clown is the star of this show anyways. Then the clown decided to enter his terrible twos and refused to go to bed. Well, he refused to get back in the box. My husband attempted to fix the toy but didn't have any success. He said at least whatever broke, broke inside and thus didn't give our little one pieces to choke on. So there's that at least!  I don't think I'm nit-picking. I have 3 little ones and I have tons of cool toys that we paid less than $20 for that have worked without fail since receiving or purchasing them back in 2012 for our first child. I don't think it's unrealistic to believe a $20 jack in the box should last for a long time.... now to dig through my parents attic and find that one with the pinching hinge.	-1
I thought this was a game for 2 players but there is only one card/letter cube holder.  I guess we can play by just setting the letter cubes on the card.  My kids are good at taking turns and sharing but it would be nice if they could play at the same time.  Especially since they are preschoolers.  Also seems expensive for what it is at $13.  Disappointing for sure. We have not played yet- but at first glance- it was not what I expected at all.	-1
Child didn't get it. Mom didn't see the fun in it either. Maybe we're missing something? I'm a literature nut, the child reads quite well for her age but neither of us enjoyed this game.	-1
it is my own fault for not reading the description closer, but these are the little tiny cans. I paid around $8, and it was a total rip off compared to buying the big containers at Walmart. I'll be more careful next time.	-1
I was excited to find this toy because it uses the winding motion of a jack-in-the-box but is sized for little fingers.  LIke all the Tolo toys we have, it is bright and colorful, but we seem to have gotten a defective unit.  The little man pops up in the middle of the song ("This Old Man") instead of at the end.  Frustrating.  I notice also that our 2yo has trouble pushing the little man back down--he won't stay.  I can do it, but it takes a delicate touch, something toddlers do NOT have.  In addition, the squeaky button on the side is hard for little hands to push, and even in big hands it sometimes squeaks, sometimes not.  If it worked right it might be good, but as it is we are disappointed, and can't recommend it.	-1
Not really a true game. It's just lettered blocks and some cards. The instructions just said here are some "suggested" ways to play, make up your own version.	-1
Great game for ore schooler	-1
The package did not mention that it was a choking hazard for children under 3!!! I plan to complain to the manufacturer. Its  definitely a hazard if your child is still teething -- my 19 mo son who still likes to chew up stuff decimated a piece. I luckily fished out the red star in four pieces from his mouth before he could swallow and get into any trouble. So while I no longer give the toy to him, I plan to once he is over the chewing stage since he loved fitting the pegs back, and stacking and sorting and it definitely kept him educationally engaged. 3 stars on the durability since while he can chew it up, its an engaging toy, and my friends 3 yr olds enjoy the toy too.  Also, Lauri replaces pieces for [a nominal fee.]	-1
My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year (2010).  My son is just about 2 1/2 now.  I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills.  He loves being surprised too.  For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still can't crank the handel.  I myself find it kind of awkward to do so.  The toy is cute and hasn't broken (yet).  The star on the front turns and clicks.  My 4 month old loves when I turn it.  The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push (for me).  My two year old hasn't tried playing with the button because it's so hard to push (he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well).  So, in conclusion, because the toy is so awkward and hard (for a child) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids' toy box.	-1
Altho I love the looks of this toy (bright colors) it isn't very engaging.  For one, it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up.  I think it's a cute addition to my grandson's toy box, but as far as entertaining him...it doesn't.	-1
"Jack" doesn't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Read the review by "freckledwitch" - she has described my feelings on this "game" exactly.  It's pretty much spelling flash cards, there is no game.	-1
. . .but I just can't get excited by this game. I learned how to play "Monopoly" at the age of 5.  My eldest son learned how to play at 8.  My kids enjoy the real game.  They don't enjoy the "kids" version. Kids are brighter than most adults give them credit for.  The original game is a wonderful teaching tool on a number of levels.  I don't see the point in "dumbing down" when it is not necessary. Parents, teach your children how to play the REAL GAME.  Then, there can be some valuable family time.  The adults will too quickly get bored with this version -- and frankly, so will the kids. Don't waste your time or money.	-1
This pack may be cheaper in local stores, but on Amazon the various multipacks of Playdoh are roughly the same price per ounce, except for the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Play-Doh-Case-of-Colors/dp/B00000IWIT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Play-Doh: Case of Colors</a>, which costs about twice as much per ounce.

I like the smaller cans, because my kids are hard on Playdoh and I like to be able to open a little at a time. Hope this helps!	-1
The printing on the game board doesn't line up properly. and the cards seem to be two different sizes from two different decks. Friends complain so much we don't even play it much.	-1
Comes apart very easy	-1
If you want to spend the money on something you can use a few times, then it is ok. After opening each box, you have about two days before it dries out and gets hard. I always keep the lid on but still dried. I opened one color at a time (one in a week or so) but decided to make my own :)	-1
I should have listened to other reviewers.  This is nothing more than a set of colorful flashcards.  Don't waste money on this game.	-1
This is a nice idea for helping children to become more familiar with the alphabet and words and spelling, but there is one huge drawback. The game uses only capital letters. Children are not typically going to see EGG written, but egg. They won't see NEST, but nest. My older two children (when 4  and 2 ) used to try to match up the dice with the cards on their own (no rolling, just turning the dice to find the letters), and thought it was fun. But, it didn't translate to them recognizing the words in other contexts.  It couldn't, because the game uses all uppercase letters, whereas in real-life lowercase is used.  It also is often difficult to get the letters you need to finish the word, since there are a limited number of dice with lots of letters. You can spend a lot of time just rolling and rolling and rolling, waiting for the right letter to come out. That's frustrating for little children.  Considering the capital letter drawback, the gameplay issue, and that the game is basically heavy-duty cardboard flashcards with several dice, I would pass on this game.	-1
My husband & I love to play boggle so we were excited to find boggle jr to share with our kids.  We couldn't even finish playing one time.  This is not a game.  You don't roll the dice or play in any way.  This is a "learning" activity, but it isn't fun at all.  I am very disappointed in this.	-1
This game was not engaging.  My son did not find it interesting.  He has not asked to play with it again.  You push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself.  If you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance, try What's GNU.  It is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults.	-1
Tubs are very small, holder is cardboard and it is more money than walmart. There is really not much more to say than that. Love playdoh..	-1
Not sure if I got a bad box but the quality of these was so bad I threw them out. I have had store bought play-dough previously and it was elastic and fun and fairly clean. This boxed set was gooey and did not shape well. It just made a mess and was not the same quality at all.	-1
This is very poorly made. The bottom piece and all the shape pieces are cheap foam, and the plastic pegs don't stay in the holes very well. Nonetheless, my preschooler and toddler love it and have had loads of fun sorting the shapes and colors. It's not worth the money as far as quality, but to me it was worth the money for keeping my little ones distracted and learning at the same time!	-1
I didn't realize this was so flimsy.,  I thought it would be on a sturdy base.  The pegs do not stay in place, therefore the shapes fall off as the pegs come out of othe holes in the base.  I should have returned the item, but I didn't want to pay the return shipping and out littlel one plays with it as is.  I do not like this toy,	-1
My daughter is 18 months old and takes this toy apart every time she plays with it. She pulls the pegs out and puts them in her mouth. Then she tosses the shapes everywhere. Not exactly a sorter! Just a mess. Save your money!	-1
When I receive these and was very disappointed. It is very thin flimsy  paper and a very small pad. The only thing good about them is I could probably make copies of my own in a higher-quality card stock for when my granddaughters play this game. I would not buy this product again.	-1
It is the Monopoly money for sure. The original amounts. But the price probably just best to buy a new game, unfortunately.	-1
Sorry.... but to "Old School" eyes, it is hard to use the new and improved (not) score cards.  Every other column is shaded, but my 50+ eyesight makes the shading hard to see.  Please bring back plain, black and white.  But it really doesn't matter since my last order will last for 10 years.  :)	-1
This product arrived on time.  The package was not damaged.  However, the product inside was damaged but usable.  It is too big to send it back.	-1
There is nothing worse than a game in which the winner is often obvious in the first 10 minutes but lasts another hour and fifty minutes. If your oppoent lands on premium spaces on his first two trips around the painfully monotonous board and you do not, well, you are screwed. Monopoly enthusiasts insist it is more than just rolling the dice; important decisions are involved. Do you buy the property or not? Well, let me help you with that: If you have the money...then yes. There, decision made. I really do not see how marching your token around the same dull board in the same direction over and over and over again for what could be easily two or even more hours would qualify for anyone as fun. Some may say "you just aren't patient." Balonie. Ive played many other games that have lasted for well over two hours. The difference is that those games have more interesting and varied decisions and planning to be done. You are not the victim of dice. (Dice are not always bad. There ARE some games out there that utilize dice far better than Monopoly and do manage to tie the outcome of the dice to actual decisions in a more balanced way.) But Monopoly just does not have anywhere near the mechanic needed to justify a game taking this long. I've heard enthusiasts say it is a great way for kids to develop their math skills. Even that argument is weak because there are far better games out there that can help with those skills. I would suggest Ticket To Ride for starters. That is a game that takes about an hour, easy to learn, has some luck involved, but much more planning and decision making to keep it engaging. Saying that Monopoly is the worst game of all time may be stretching the truth a bit, but not by much.	-1
I could not believe this "deluxe" version was so poorly made. I have a previous deluxe edition and this one doesn't even come close. The tile holders on the board are so shallow and made of flimsy plastic. The tiles constantly come out and mess up the board. The board itself is smaller, the turnstile isn't attached and the overall plastic on the board is cheaply made. I am so disappointed they charge $35 for this product and it is going back.  I am getting the Onyx Edition from Barnes and Noble instead.	-1
I totally agree with every poor review on this game.  I did not check the reviews before ordering as I NEVER THOUGHT Parker would go the so very cheap route.  Tried to send them an e-mail.  It would not go through.  Have a feeling they know what we are going to say.  1 Star is too much for this product!  Poor quality (tiles do not stay in place, STICKERS for letter value, plastic is ready to crack right out of te box)  Poor customer service (site says you can send e-mail but mail does not go through).	-1
So, you want to buy Scrabble, huh?  You were playing at your Grandmas, and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable, wooden tile holders, nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board.  You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon. You ordered it, excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession. You get it in the mail, you open the box, thrilled to own Scrabble, but then.... the unthinkable!!  This ain't your Grandma's Scrabble!!  What they have done, is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it "deluxe Scrabble". PLASTIC. Everything is PLASTIC.  The tiles might be wood, I dunno I didn't bite them, but everything else is cheap, thin plastic.  Doesn't turn nice like the old version. And the biggest kicker of them all, is the board itself. Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table, they would stay put.  Now it's shallow grooves, and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they'll move easy.  You're better off buying an old one at a garage sale.	-1
Please feel free to read this review in its entirety, or save yourself some time and avoid this version of Monopoly and buy the "Monopoly - Classic" version instead.  While it is about double the price, it is the game you know and love.  The less expensive version (reviewed here) is a piece of garbage.  I regret this purchase.  If you grew up playing Monopoly, you would be much, much better off buying "classic" or a used version.  There are several major issues with this version, as well as some minor ones.  If you buy this to teach your children one of the most beloved games of your childhood and a part of Americana, you are apt to be disappointed.  The major issues involve quality and design.  The board itself no longer folds in two.  It is cut to fold into quarters and barely sits level on a table.  I do not hold out much hope it will last very long. The property cards are flimsy, made smaller than in the past, as well as being thinner.  The Chance and Community Chest cards are also of poor quality, much thinner than their predecessors, and take on color changes, now being blue/white and orange/white, instead of the familiar yellow and orange, respectively.  The money is a big concern as well.  The money is thin and there are not enough slots provided to use money in the bank during play, or to store after gameplay,  and in fact there are raised areas in the plastic money tray which prevent the money from even sitting in the spaces.  The raised areas are somewhat random and follow no logical pattern. So forget using the box/tray component for the bank during a game or storing money neatly.  The tray is essentially useless.  I have no idea what Hasbro/Parker Brothers was thinking here, and apparently neither did they.  The minor issues are some game changes: The money is different color and handed out in different amounts.  Very minor, yes, but now you have to get used to $10 being blue (used to be the $50) as well as some other color changes.  You are also starting the game with different amounts of money.  Also the Income Tax space is now a flat $200 instead of "10% or $200", and Luxury Tax is $100, no longer $75.  Again, these are minor but worth noting.  I would avoid this cheaply made version.  At the very least this should be advertised as what it is - "revamped Monopoly."	-1
We wanted to get the deluxe game thinking it was the same as the original plastic turntable scrabble...WRONG. This set is so cheaply made.  The letter holders are plastic and move around as you're rearranging your letters.  There aren't any holders on the game board so your letters fall out of their spaces pretty easily.  And the board itself is just flimsy cheap plastic.  Do yourself a favor shop ebay and look for the 70's orginal deluxe board.  That's the only way to play this game.	-1
The number of red chips is not what its supposed to be. Thought the bag of reds looked small upon opening. Counted all of them out. 50 blue, 50 green, but only 35 red. What the hell.	-1
It scars my 4 year so much he won't play it	-1
My daughter was so excited when Santa brought her this game for Christmas, but she lost interest in about 15 minutes. It takes forever to "Wake Up Daddy". Very disappointing	-1
Low quality construction. Kids have a hard time putting the pieces together and keeping the board in order while playing.	-1
I bought this one thinking it was the old version due to the picture but it is actually Hasbro's new connect four version which is definitely not as durable. Annoyed that I was misled but still love the game.	-1
I ordered the original style game and was sent the fancy new black, red, and yellow version.  It was not what the kids originally wanted, nor what I preferred.  The only reason I didn't return the item was because my children didn't want to wait for me to send this one back and get the new one.  So be aware that you may not get the original style.	-1
I am extremely disppointed in the fact that the I was not sent what was portrayed in the picture of the Connect Four Game. I was under the impression that I would be sent an older game (still new in box). Instead I received the newest version - which I could have purchased at my local Rite Aid for a lot less!!!! The newer styles just DO NOT last!! I was very much so looking forward to the exact game that I played as a child with my sisters. Feeling nostalgic & moderately sad. :(	-1
I'm very upset about what I got.  I was at a friend's house playing connect four with his kids on an original set.  I wanted to get the same thing for our kids who are old enough now to play this great game.  UNFORTUNATELY this is NOT the original game as shown in the picture!  The board is smaller but also the pieces are inset so far that you lose feel of the play.  Also, the bottom row (which is so crucial to the game play) is made of this stupid wavy thing that allows for "3 ways to play".  Listen, if I wanted 3 ways to play I'd ask for it.  I want friggin' connect four.  Why fix what isn't broken!!!	-1
This game is a fun and quick game for two, but I would only value this game at less than $10. The construction is too cheap and flimsy. The two supporting (blue) sides have holes to slide and attach to plastic tabs on the yellow game board. The tabs break easily and then the game is no longer usable. It would also be good to have extra game pieces included as some may be lost. To replace mine which had lost several game pieces and now has broken tabs, I am looking for a cheaper alternative or, even better, one that is built better.	-1
The pieces are very rough, and the marbles won't flow through the square pieces at all. The marbles can't make it through one level without getting stuck. There's also splinters everywhere on these. I usually prefer wooden toys, but this is one case I wish I'd gotten plastic as these are just too frustrating.	-1
No instructions, you have to figure out how to build. Very difficult. Big bulky pieces, not permanent structure.	-1
So horrible. Confusing to put together. Unstable. Wood splinters and can easily cause injury.	-1
This game is just Bingo with a small bit of interaction and control.  Each turn players on alternating teams play one of the 5 cards from their hand and place one of their team's tokens on the matching spot on a board and when that team gets 5 in a row they win.  Two-eyed jacks are wild and the one-eyed jacks allow you to remove one of your opponent's tokens (that's the small bit of interaction).  The jacks are the only thing that gives players any kind of control over the game and they are only 8 out of 104 cards.  So really, it's just Bingo where the team with the luckiest draws wins.	-1
Wood is rough and splintery. Holes and groves not cut correctly. Marble does not flow smoothly and gets stuck and stopped a lot because of the poorly made cuts. If you have more time then money you could probably sand each piece and drill each hole and plane each grove to fix it.	-1
It's okay for the price because it's much cheaper than the other high quality marble runs. There is no comparison to the ~$100 Hape set, if you can afford the Hape marble run then get it....it's 100x better.  This is basic older style set. Not all the pieces are smooth and there are lots of rough edges that stop the marbles. If you sand them down after you get the set then it works better.	-1
Board is small to play around a table (especThe deluxe sequence game has a larger board so you can play around a table and actually see the cards on the board. I would spend the extra $10 and get the larger board.	-1
This is our second marble run we have bought. Yes, our family is a bit obsessed.  It was rather disappointing though since the wood pieces weren't smooth which stopped the marbles. This defeats the purpose and made this a very unloved toy that has actually only been used 4-5 times since it's frustrating. Our other marble run has been used countless times and is so much fun.	-1
Hard for my 5 year old to play with. You have to line the holes up just right. I think we would have preferred a plastic version.	-1
So roughly shaped that the marbles get stuck everywhere.  Bulky, doesn't stay together at all.  Wasted purchase.	-1
This set would be good for learning development if it hadn't come with millions of splinters.  There were large shards sticking into the holes, to the point that not only was it super dangerous for kids, but also the marble wouldn't even fall through.  My husband and I spent 45 min sanding every face of every block.  After we did this, it's a pretty good set.  The design is pretty good, they just have a MAJOR quality control issue from their factory.	-1
Horribly made, some holes weren't even drilled all the way through.  Also very stinky.	-1
It's hard to use.  The kids don't play with it much because it's hard to line up correctly	-1
Damaged upon arrival. The board was damaged to where the game pieces would not stay on the board. Also the games box was not able to hold the game pieces from falling out when closed. Terrible.	-1
This game is so junky. There are 3 options on the wheel and when you land on one you have to put back either all or 2 berries. Me and my daughter played this and every single time I spun I landed on only 1 of the 3. We literally had to spin about 10 times in order to land on a berry picture. What a piece of junk. My daughter is 4 and lost interest very fast.	-1
In theory, this is a great toy and reminds me of the one I had as a child. However, I purchased it for 2 different kids and found the same issue. The string to drag it around is pretty short, and the cord which attaches the part you hold up to the base is only 2-3 inches, which means the kiddos have to actually hold the base up to their ears to pretend to use the phone. Poor design. I wouldn't buy another and ended up actually cutting that cord	-1
I was really disappointed the normal size marbles didn't' fit through the blocks. the corner ones never seemed to work right.	-1
Great game but item arrived heavily damaged and unusable.	-1
This game was way too easy for a 4 year old.  And all those tiny fruits got lost right away and you can't really play the game without having them all.  The stand for the game is really cheap and flattened out right away too.  Many better choices out there.	-1
So disappointed in this remake of a great classic toy. The eyes barely move and the cord attached to the ear piece is way too short. To hold it at your ear causes the phone to hang loose and bang around.	-1
When I got my Slinky, my friend told me that they were supposed to last for a long time. I guess she had never had one before because it broke on the first day .I was trying to make it walk (which it doesnt) and it suddenly snapped in half .You can also break by it stretching it, trying to make it walk, and tying it into knots. Though I think these ones are lame but the metal Slinkys work a lot better.  These have very bad quality. I do not recommend this for anyone .I give it 2 stars.  A 5th grader	-1
I was so excited to get this marble run for my child's fourth birthday. We already have a plastic marble run which he loves so I just knew he needed another. I looked at many types and went with this one because I thought the wood looked nice and it would hold up well. I bought it awhile before his birthday because I like to get gifts done ahead of time. His birthday came up and we gave him this present. It was by far his favorite gift to open and he coils to wait to build it. As soon as we could we started building and we kept having problems with the marble running thru the maze. I kept looking at the box and the wooden pieces to try and figure out what I was doing wrong. We Set it all up the right way with the marble going thru the hole right but it just wouldn't consistently work. The time it took me to make it so that the holes lined up perfectly and then the marble still wouldn't hardly go thru. This was extremely disappointing to my child. I went on amazon to return this product and was told that the seller will not take it back because it has been past the return time frame. I could understand if it had been a super long time but it was a couple months because I had to wait for his birthday. I have always been impressed with amazon but definitely not this time.	-1
We were so excited about this toy. It is made of excellent quality materials, but it really didn't perform as well as expected. We used shims and improved its performance some, otherwise, the marbles didn't roll well at all. I really wouldn't recommend this toy as it is now.	-1
Very cheap.  Not worth it.  Buy original.	-1
After three adults tried to construct this "fun" structure with a child everyone gave up in disgust. It does not easily build the clever ramps and chutes that are shown. It was a big disappointment and I have returned it.	-1
Product didn't hold up to a 2  and 3 year old playing with it more than once. Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this. Delivery and order went great. Just wasn't for us.	-1
I just opened this game and it says it should contain 4 colors and 10 of each color however we didn't get any of the orange.  Unfortunately I bought this when it was on sale before my child was old enough to play so I can't return it now.  Suggest you open it right away and make sure all the pieces are there.  Kind of disappointing that 4 of us can't play...Aside from that love the concept of the game.	-1
It says glow in the dark does NOT IT ALSO arrived a dark green	-1
The diameter is as large as the original slinky, but not the length. It does not have enough mass to store enough energy to make a trip down a flight of stairs. Unless you want to spend time shuffling this thing from one hand to another, and frustrating children with its inability to do much of anything, not a good pick.	-1
Very short cord from phone to receiver. I replaced the cord with a longer piece of para cord  works great now.	-1
This is not the Slinky of my youth. That was a heavy metal object that I had for years.  I purchased this for my 7 year old son. It kinked and bent badly the first time he used it. The metal is thin and this is not as large as I remember the original. Right now, I have a couple heavy books on top of this trying to salvage it, but I think it's lost cause.	-1
Although this says "Original Metal Slinky", this is small in diameter, does not "walk" down stairs, or on small stair stepped items. Kids did have fun pulling on them and such for which they are not made. If you want the real slinky that you remember as a kid, this is not it.	-1
The cord is so short that my 18 month old grand daughter got bored with it right away.  The phone receiver can be picked up but that cord is also short, of course that is probably a safety feature.  Altogether though she is not terribly impressed and the phone stays in the toy box.  Sorry.	-1
The string connecting the red telephone piece to the phone itself is like 5 inches long, and any child has to either hold the whole phone to their ear or lean down to it to "answer" it. Its cute and sturdy, though ineffective in its soul purpose.	-1
Cord is too small to be dragged and cord on phone is too small to use without it coming off the floor. Not worth buying.	-1
Not as fun as I'd hoped, & there are a million little pieces to keep track of.  My little girls enjoy it, but want to get it out on their own & then pieces get lost.	-1
she bored with it	-1
I had to return this twice because of damage either during packaging or shipping. Both times identical damage as a plastic piece was broken in half, and the part at the bottom that turns was dented in so bad that it wasn't workable.	-1
Missing cherrys (or apples) we ordered this as a Christmas gift. When the child opened it and went to play one entire set of cherrys was missing ( the blue cherry)	-1
The receiver cord is ridiculously short and it interferes with play-ability not allowing the baby to pick-up the receiver without the whole phone coming along, too - smacking them in the chin. It certainly feels like a design flaw rather than a safety thing because If they had it that way to be SAFE, they'd nix the approximately 24 inch long pull cord (which I wound-up just cutting off) instead.	-1
The cord between the base and the phone is so short, my child can't put it to his head without bashing himself with the bulky part. The tug line is also much too short. This toy is useless.	-1
This game is ok...it's very boring, and my 4 year old was over it the first time he played it.  Such a cute concept but the pieces are way too small and get lost so easily and now with my 15 month old, it's just not safe to even have it around.  I have small hands and it was hard for me to grasp the cherries.	-1
I was initially really excited to receive this for my daughter.. she opened it up on Christmas and half the pieces were missing. How disappointing.	-1
We opened this game tonight. My 3 year old got it for Christmas. Luckily, only 3 of us were playing because we did not receive any orange pieces.  My 3 year old got bored with this game after about 10 minutes. I contacted Hasbro to try to get replacement parts. If they can't send any I will be returning it to Amazon.	-1
11 mos old received as Christmas present. Now at almost 14 mos she still can't figure it out and gets frustrated when it falls out of her hands or she pushes it over too far. It came with a dent in the metal chime cylinder (we have a different pattern). I plan on adding it to the garage sale pile.	-1
Parents remember this but it doesn't make any noise or anything so its not as exciting as the rest of my sons toys.	-1
I had this game as a kid and thought I would buy it for my then 3 1/12 year old son for Christmas (2013).  The new construction of this is far inferior to the game I had 30 years ago.  As it happened, during one visit to my parents, found that they still had this game in their game closet and I took the more sturdy, 30+ year old version with me and returned this one.  My mom actually wrote on the inside of the box the year it was given to me (1981).  This game is great, but if you can get your hands on a (yikes!) vintage set, go for it.  Unfortunately this seems to be the way with all of the classic board games (Candyland, Chutes&Ladders, etc).	-1
Though this was highly recommended to me by many friends and neighbors, this was a disaster from day 1. The steering wheel would not stay in the car. There is a piece that is supposed to lock the steering wheel onto the car (through the front hood), as soon as it was put together my 10 month old went into the car, sat down, and promptly pulled the steering wheel out. That is not supposed to happen. Additionally the front hood (yellow piece) wasn't sized properly and it would get pushed into the front hood area (instead of sitting on top) making it impossible for my daughter to open it. Very disappointing.	-1
On line description of this telephone does not mach with what I received !!  there is no pulling rope or thread what so ever and the eyes are not moving at all.	-1
Lots of little tiny pieces with this.  I would not say this would work well for a 3-year-old.  A more simple set with the gears that work without adding little plastic pieces would be ideal.  I wouldn't give this to a child under 5 or 6, the pieces will just be garbage right away.	-1
The box states 55 pcs. Of the 55, 22 pcs are basically structural and not for play. And of these 22 structural pcs, 6 are extra. This game is a ripoff. Quercetti makes good quality stuff but this is a joke.	-1
the fruits in this game is way too small for a kid to play with. its sometimes frustrating. i say , there are so many other games available. leave this one out.	-1
This box came with no wheels, no seatbelt, no bolts to secure the handle. I'm super disappointed because my son played with this toy at a friend's house and he loved it. Amazon should really be careful about vendors and do more vetting and QC.	-1
The game is poor for young kids and pieces is too small which easily become a harzard things for kids.  I am not worry because my son never put stuffs into his mouth but other kids may.	-1
Child almost 3, does not hold her interest at all  The bottom puzzle like pieces come apart as the gears spin.	-1
I remember this game being much more fun when I was little.  but my son isn't that interested in it and neither am I.  I would highly recommend the sneaky snacky squirrel game over this.	-1
Was recommended by a friend.  Not interesting.  Piece of cardboard with four plastic cups and tiny plastic apples.  Boo, Hasbro.	-1
It TOO SMALL	-1
I got this because my 4-year-old loves gears.  My kids have the Playschool Busy Gears and love them.  I thought this would be a more advanced version of that for her to play with.  I don't like this toy though because it is really difficult to put together.  My daughter likes to turn the gears with the handle, but an adult always has to build it for her.  Other kids I have seen play with this toy have a lot of trouble too.  It looks cool but isn't a practical choice for a kid.  The base is really hard to put together because not all of the pieces will interlock with each other.  The pegs that hold the gears onto the base are also very hard to put on.	-1
This is a tiny slinky!! Very useless does not bounce down the stairs...could have got this for a dollar at the dollar store. I expected for the price that it was a regular sized slinky.tjis is a miniature	-1
My two boys didn't find this board game very interesting at all. The game itself is cheaply made. I find the cherries all over the house as they are so small and easy to misplace. My kids prefer chutes and ladders 10x over this one.	-1
This sad little vintage toys always seem to get tangled within a week of kids playing with them.  I had one as a child and it was very durable.  I could send it down a flight of steps and it never had a problem.  I guess cheaper materials and smaller rings make these really just a dime store trinket.  Frustrating for a child who wants it to work as it should.	-1
very cheaply made ,the cord is so short ,when he puts the phone part on his ear ,the phone hangs, I am very surprise, I always  loved fisher price, but now I have to be careful on every detail.  MARIE	-1
I read the reviews on this tiny slinky about how it doesn't last and went ahead and got some for stocking stuffers anyway. Well, the reviews were right, most of these Slinky Jr's didn't last all Christmas day. They sprung apart and couldn't be used. Maybe adults could use them just to move from hand to hand, but a child will only have it for a few hours.	-1
Item as described	-1
This is not the slinky we grew up with. This was a really cheap version that kinked within 5 minutes of coming out of the box. If you're buying a Jr. - go with the plastic brand. This is junk.	-1
Ugh. I wish I hadn't purchased this. The toy is fine as long as your kid only wants to pull it around. But the cord to the phone is way too short - to eliminate the strangulation hazard, I suppose - and it makes it impossible to use for pretend play. Every time my daughter picks up the receiver, she ends up picking up the entire phone (which is pretty heavy) and sometimes ends up swinging it around. I was sitting on the floor playing with her and took a knock to the middle of my forehead when she picked it up suddenly and turned to me so I could "answer" the phone. Had a nice goose egg there for a couple of days.  I've hidden it from her until I can sneak it out of her room and throw it away. I won't donate it to Goodwill, lest some other parent be subjected to head injury.	-1
I had HI HOpes for this one, but that enthusiasm will have to wait. I bought this for my 3 year old son's birthday, and although he was excited by it, he's not ready yet.  First, the game pieces are TINY spheres so they are very easy to lose.  A slight bump and they are rolling off the board, slipping under the buckets, or burying themselves in my carpet.  It is nice that there is one extra piece of each color, but that's all.  Second, this game would be better for kids who are already good at taking turns so they can take advantage of learning the math concepts.  My guy still struggles with the concept of taking turns for a board game, as he is used to a lot of exploration.  This game does NOT lend itself to exploration because it is too poorly constructed and tiny.  That being said, it will most definitely resurface once he knows turn taking, has developed more patience for following game rules, and has more body control to avoid knocking the board. I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Candy-Land-The-World-of-Sweets-Board-Game/dp/B004YDFG12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Candy Land - The World of Sweets Board Game</a>&nbsp;as a better starter game.  At that point, using this game to teach addition and subtraction will be lots of fun!	-1
Arrived as advertised and in good condition. Too small/short/stiff to do any cool slinky stuff that the big ones can do. It was a stocking stuffer for my 8 year old. It will end up in the trash soon (if not already) and be replaced by a full sized version that can actually be played with.	-1
I thought this product would be comparable to the version I had as a kid but it didn't quite measure up. It seems smaller in size and really is not user friendly as a phone since the cord is so short (I'm sure that's a safety precaution). It can be used as a pull toy but since it's so light it flops around a lot when little kids try to pull it. Not as good as the classic.	-1
The I phone is a phone for my generation but nit for my baby. She hardly plays with it. I should have considered the fact that she won't accept it as a phone since there is no phone like this in any house.	-1
As other reviewers have pointed out, this classic toy is just as cute as it ever was but a very simple design change ruins it.  The cord is much much too short for babies to pick up the receiver and 'chat'.  They have to lift the whole phone.  I would say this was done for safety to prevent the risk of strangulation, but the cord to pull the toy is much longer.  It's a simple thing, but it keeps this toy from being a winner.	-1
All you do is follow the storyline.  Very little to do other than that.  One time use as well.	-1
This is a good car but beware, the wheels are plastic. Pushing this thing around even on sidewalks is very loud! It was noticeably irritating to our little guy and was making my ears ring a little. We ended up doing a major hack on the wheels-- bought a different Step2 car with "whisper quiet" wheels on Craigslist and along with some nuts and bolts, replaced the wheels entirely.  Now it's a great car! Looking back we never should have bought this car.  Do yourself a favor and get one with "whisper quiet" rubber wheels instead.	-1
This was not a wise choice in particular for my son. He barely touches it and not intrigued by this toy at all. the cord is also very short to be pulling aroound	-1
I know the cord is short to avoid choking or other damage to the little one, but in this case it really makes the toy unusable to "talk" on the phone you have to have the actually base dangling in mid air, quite awkward.	-1
Does not function as a play phone. The cord is too short so you can't pretend talk without having the whole phone hanging from your face! I get it, long cord=choking hazard, but... the string for pulling is REALLY long. Isn't that a hazard? You can pull it around though.	-1
The phone cord and pull string are way too short. I understand cords have been shortened for safety reasons, but the cords are so short, it negates the usefulness of the product. I'm not even remotely impressed with the Chatter Phone.	-1
I purchased this phone as a gift for my now 1 year old.  She loved an old pull toy and grandma's house and I thought this would be a lot of fun for her.  While it looks like the old school version, it is nothing like it at all.  The components are a very cheap plastic.  The wheels are cheap so it does not pull well.  Both strings are way to short to make this playable as a phone or as a pull toy.  I would buy something different as a pull toy if that is what you are looking for.  As for a phone, the string is only a couple inches long so she can't hold it up to her ear without bringing the whole toy with it- what a waste.	-1
look for something better. this is pure junk, made in china so plastics are not safe and the cord is too short and thin enough to be unsafe anyway, also arrived with the paint already peeled off in some places!	-1
it looks cute and when one pulls it its eyes close and open. But the cord of the phone is too small. if the phone is placed on the table the receiver will not reach the child's ear until he holds the phone in his hands. It doesn't make any ringing sound or any hello or bye sound when u lift the receiver. Over all am not happy . But my son liked it however doest use it much	-1
From the item description I expected the toy to make some sounds like ringing eventually, saying "Hello" or what ever. My mistake - do not expect too much.  Also as others says: the headset cord is extreemly short. So, the only usage is drag for the other cord and look for eyes rolling. But it doesn't develop phone communication skills.  Both my kids (have twins 15mo) played just about 10mins with it.  They like phones in general (toys and real ones). But they ignore this toy.  Wasted money.	-1
The makers of this toy NEVER tested it with an actual toddler...it's evident. Although I understand the safety reason for the short blue cord to the actual handheld receiver- a child doesn't. I bought this for my grandson and he has hit himself in the head over and over. I finally just threw it away. The base is very heavy, as soon as he picked up the receiver CLONK! then the cries. I guess it was marketed to Toddlerz with a "z" not an "s" ...not sure how old those lil' critters are or what they look like but my family hated this product.	-1
I couldn't wait to buy this for our two toddlers.  Not long after I popped it open (it is quite easy to set up, takes about 5 seconds) and attached the two tunnels, my kids were happily crawling through it.  Then.......uh oh!  With normal movement, the tunnels detached easily, the kids found it cramping to sit and play together under the dome, and they became frustrated that they couldn't freely crawl from one tunnel through the dome and out the other side of the second tunnel without getting their clothing and sneakers caught on the sides or on the velcro.  My kids are petite, and still they were clumsy inside.  They gave up on it after 20 minutes and we just packed it up for return.  I read the age guidelines and figured they'd be just fine, but aside from it folding easily and storing conveniently in a carry bag, this is not the oodles of fun that it's advertised to be.  I'd recommend a play tent that does not feature attachable tunnels....they DETACH way too easily!	-1
We have used it for more than 2 months now. Getting another brand. It's just too loud on a concrete roads because of cheap plastic wheels. We still plan on using it on a non concrete like grassy area, carpeted areas etc.	-1
what matters most is that my toddler hates it . Frankly this is the first fisher price toy he refuses to play with. No battery type noise, like all contemporary toys.	-1
A lot of people that I played this with enjoyed this mystery. They liked it so much they wanted to buy another in the series. I however personally found it less fun and more work than it was worth. However, I was also hosting. The booklet instructions were somewhat cumbersome to get use to. I LOVE being dramatic and acting but the way the 'script' was written, there was less room for creativity. Basically, everyone just reads their lines and delivers them as they wish. To me, this took out a lot of the fun.  I thought that the storyline was long winded. Some of the stereotypes that were portrayed, if applied to another race, I am sure would be considered offensive. The plot didn't seem to make much sense.  For instance: There were many red herrings.  Therefore, when it became time to deduce the right answer it was hard to figure out which was a true herring and which was a true clue. One of the clues that were given was just ridiculously obvious. Everyone in our party automatically assumed that it had to be fake because there was no way the puzzle could be solved that easily and still be fun (in our prejudiced minds).  As a result, all of the solutions each of us proposed was, in my humble opinion, much more superior to the actual solution which seemed to really come out of left field.	-1
While it might be a good car for a child to ride in instead of a stroller, it was taking me too long to assemble and I returned it.	-1
This little thing is made out of plastic. A very cheap one, the wheels are toy-like, they make a lot of noise, the steering-wheel keeps falling off and I need to stop and push that piece of plastic inside the cover/compartiment. I lost the ring that holds the handle in place -- after 2 days. The seat vibrates making my son want to stand up. I guess his little rear hurts. My son is 11 mo, yet, his legs are not comfy inside, they sometimes fall on the sides. Too crowded. I wish they will rethink the whole product. I would recommend rubber wheels and doors and a more comfy bench/sitting area.	-1
I must have received someone else's game that had been sent back.  I agree with the negative comments regarding the fact that the pieces curl up and do not stick to the board.  Very disappointed.  Hardly worth sending back, since item's price was $9.99, and I'd have to pay shipping.  Note in my pic that some of the pieces are curling, and a few were already separated from the sheet.  I did not do this.  It arrived that way!	-1
As a child of the 60's I wanted to share the thrill of Colorforms with my Granddaughter.  I remember sitting for hours and dressing and redressing my colorform dolls.  Well fast forward to now, I didn't like this game at all.  She was completely bored after playing just one time. It is nothing like the old days.  It's more like someone had an idea to make a game on the fly.  Doesn't work for me and my pumpkin.	-1
colorforms do not stick	-1
not like i remembered as a kid, these didn't even stick very well.  we sure didn't use this for long.	-1
I like the idea but the plastic does not adhere to the card very well.  That is my only complaint	-1
I do daycare in my home and have for over 27 years and raised many children of my own.....they always loved Colorforms but I was disappointed with the game's "stickiness" and the children tired of it much more quickly than I had expected.  Would not recommend it for kids that are used to lots of video/electronic games....they would be bored.	-1
I purchased this game as a Christmas gift for my 2 and 4 year olds. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. The adhesive pieces were curling off of the sheets. When I removed them and tried to stick them on the faces, they wouldn't stick! We didn't even get one use out of this game and it is basically going to be in the trash, unless there is any way the manufacturer will send us new adhesive sheets. Sad to say it, but this game is not worth the money.	-1
Well I would love to write a legitimate review regarding my son's use / enjoyment of this toy but we weren't able to get past the assembly. We were terribly disappointed to discover that this requires so much assembly.  Seriously, why can't the tires come attached?  We broke one of the knobs while trying to put this thing together, which involved a step that necessitated perfect balancing of the buggy on its side, which was very difficult.  Grrr, I'm so annoyed!	-1
Was disappointed only two could play and that there wasn't any coin learning included.  Will continue to look for a better money concept game for the kids.	-1
Just played this game tonight with my husband and my in-laws. The questions are so irrelevant to 2014 it's ridiculous. I'm 30 and I could barely answer most of the questions. Then when I had a question about how Yankee Stadium got built back in what early 1900's my father-in-law got upset at me for not thinking the question was relevant enough to this day and age. All the questions for the men were female questions and they were all about things like cooking and cleaning. Which I believe men nowadays should know anyways. But all the women's questions that were male questions were about sports, fishing, and tools. Gimme a break. This game is super sexist. Steer clear!	-1
I installed this kit and it was fairly straightforward.  PROBLEMS: the kit hardware will only allow mounting around a pole and/or a hook; no hook specifications or pole specifications are given. That's for you to experiment with and hope you don't destroy the kids in the process. PROBLEMS: kit is missing parts and I will have to go to the ACE to replace. PROBLEMS: trolley rides pretty slowly - what on earth is the break-in period here. PROBLEMS: all this zinc galvaized stuff is cheap and cheaply made - the cost of the kit is a complete ripoff  SOLUTION: the Petzl Tandem Speed trolley (80.00), two wire thimbles of 3/16" (7.00), Wire Cable Clamps (7.00) Wire cable (1.00/ft) = 140.00 buys quality materials that would make any boyscout proud and it will last.	-1
would have loved the item except that amazon shipped the item missing the handle, the seat belt, and the decals - therefore, we ended up having to ship the item back to amazon at a cost of almost as much as the item was worth!  So far we have not received a credit for the item OR the shipping so we are REALLY dissatisfied customers!	-1
I thought this was a cute idea. Perhaps my baby is too young for this toy at 9 months, but she showed no interest in this toy whatsoever. After 2 weeks of ignoring this toy, I returned it to the store. The car on top never stayed there, it seemed to fall off the top way too easily. These seem cheap and are hollowed out cars that do not roll well at all when compared to the other Fisher Price cars for babies. The paint comes off easily, which seems very dangerous for babies, who put everything into there mouths! I can not recommend this toy.	-1
The plastic is bubbling off the almost brand new toy.  Anyhow it really isn't safe to give to my child at this point. (Note: Also the plastic is very sticky).	-1
Thick and knitted, not the smooth fabric that I was hoping for.  Also very thready, leaving tails that need clipping.  Am going to have to repurchase another brand so my daughter can finish her project, as these won't work. :p  Ended up finding some much better one by "made by me" brand at my local Wallyworld.	-1
for the price I paid, this was not a deal. There are not enough loops of one color to really make anything. I have the 10" loom and get the loops that fit it from Harrisville. Those are fine. I will stick with Wool Novelty CO. when getting the smaller loops. I returned these.	-1
color not as good as depicted in picture.  I really wanted the earthy colors like flax, gray, etc, but I could only find them on amazon in the 10" size, so I ordered the best color I thought in the 7".  After I already made the pot holders, I found ALL of the earth colors in the 7" that Amazon offers in the 10".  bought over $50 worth of loops 'from the other guys' because they had the right colors in the right size.	-1
This toy was a major dissapointment for us. The age guidelines are for 1-3. We got this when our daughter was 15 months old. Granted she was big for her age at 34 inches and 27 lbs, but she was still smaller than a 3 year old! Her feet were to large to fit on the side where they were suppose to. She looked like a clown riding a small bike at the circus! This toy is definately for very petite children. Either it should be made larger or the guidelines should be changed. We gave it away to her 3 month old cousin.	-1
Product received was scratched	-1
NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THE OLDER ONES. DOES NOT POP UNLESS IT IS TILTED AT A CERTAIN ANGLE. BAD PURCHASE.	-1
Really tough for a toddler to do, the recommended age range is too low, in my opinion. The pieces are all funny shapes, and it's hard to determine exactly where they go when disassembled. I am a HUGE puzzle builder, and have several thousand+ piece puzzles in my collection... but wouldn't buy this again, except maybe for an older child who is really into puzzles (I'm thinking 10+ yrs or so).	-1
I read some reviews and they compared this one with the other popcorn toy which is cheaper and similar, reviews saying this one makes sound more than the cheap one. I believed and bought this, waited a week to arrive. When I gave this to my 16 months daughter, it doesn't pop or make any sound at all! I tried on carpet, floor and outdoor.  It doesn't matter what surface,  just no sound as I expected.  Returning it, I will go to the cheaper one.	-1
Very cheap material	-1
I purchased this for my 1 year old grandson but it does not work on bare floors and he keeps getting his fingers stuck in the handle. He wants to play with it badly but it is just poorly designed. Very disappointed because this (the old style with the straight wooden handle) was mine and my own kids' favorite toy as a child.	-1
I couldn't tell from the photo but the playing board is made from cardboard. This means the holes are barely deep. The marbles don't stay in place well. It's also cheap cheap cheap.  I thought it was the metal board version. We're thinking of it as a tester. Once we know our family will play Chinese checkers often, we'll upgrade. But, had I known, I would have just ordered the more expensive metal version to begin with.	-1
The clear part came all scratched up	-1
This set is cheap cheap cheap. The board is flimsy and had to be taped together when we got it and the marbles are light and not real marbles. The game is still great but it was very frustrating for my son since every time he touched the board they all moved.  Ok who am I kidding it was frustrating for everyone involved!!!	-1
It is totally garbage. Only one color paper with several plastic ball. This is the worst game board I have seen.	-1
i bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for christmas, it is a cute game and she liked it but after playing it 2 times the outfits wouldnt stick on the people anymore. so its a waste now it just sits there and theres not alot of outfits for the girl dolls mainly blue and boyish. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	-1
did not like it	-1
I bought 3 of these for gifts for my daughter, aged 7 and 2 granddaughters, aged 3&4. Everyone of them stopped working in less than 3 months. And, these things aren't cheap anymore, just cheaply made!	-1
These are not BPA free!!!!	-1
This toy only pops if rolled on carpet, and with exerted force while pushing down and walking.  My daughter is not able to do  this even at 20 months...  When she uses this toy, she walks with it but the wheels don't roll, they just glide across the floor and therefore no popping.  This is an incredible disappointment on a classic toy that was ruined in the new design.  We are going to be returning this.  Today.	-1
I was very disappointed in this product and was going to send it back but my 4 year old grandson decided he wants to keep it because our dog's reaction to it is funny. He likes to watch how things go down the steps so I thought a slinky would be fun. It will not go down the steps nor does it roll on the wheels built into the paws. If you like a toy that lays on its side and likes to be dragged, this is the toy for you.	-1
kids just don't care for these anymore...	-1
Disappointed. I had so much fun with this toy from my childhood that I got it for my grandchild. It is really not the same.  Due to concerns of choking they have shortened the rope to make it useless (now I understand why kids don't use pull toys much any more).  Also the slinky part has been tied with a string down the center so it is stopped from stretching very much....the movement of stretching out long and then pulling up short just is not there any more.  And the back legs don't move easily so the dog does not really walk at all on a rug, and not too well on hard wood floors either......instead the top rear just collapses over the slinky.  Basically this toy is not much fun, unlike the original.	-1
Too loud, and I am not one to complain about noisy toys usually. Also, it takes some effort to make it "pop" and move forward, so my boy only developed interest for it after 1.5 yrs if age, while other push toys were exciting for him before he was 1.	-1
Great product but Omg! This is so loud! I can't believe my parents let me run around with this all day long! We were able to return it.	-1
Bought this toy for my son and the wheels don't turn so it doesn't pop.	-1
I will be giving this toy to the children of parents that I do not like. Ours disappeared one night.	-1
Was very excited about this toy for our 12 months old son but we have wooden floor. There is not enough friction on wooden floors for the wheels to spin so he was not getting any popping sound. A simple texture or thin rubber band around wheels could have taken care of it but for some reason Fisher-Price/manufacturer was not creative enough. I ended up sending it back because there were no sounds.	-1
only works on carpet.	-1
A torture device disguised as a toy. How would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell? Might as well go lick some dirty socks. I think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash. Hey, Ma, why does Slinky go down but not up? Who's the genius who found this at the scrapyard? Most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind's perverse craving for repetition and/or irritation.	-1
Falls into itself and will not stay up.  The head is top heavy and my boy gets frustrated trying to pull it and it just tips back into the slinky part.  Not well made even though it is very cute.  I love the idea of retro but this isn't worth bothering with!!	-1
Purchased as a Christmas present for my 4 year old grandson.  Very poor quality.  I think it will fall apart after a few uses.	-1
I ordered this a while back to save for a rainy day.  It's always nice to have a brand new box of crayons and I remember thoroughly enjoying the giant box of Crayola crayons I once received as a child.  I thought this box would have them arranged by color shade.  I don't remember reading the description past 120 UNIQUE colors.  Well sure enough, as others have noted, there are 3 boxes of crayons here-2 boxes of 48 and one 24.  I came back to review my order curious how much I had paid for this disappointment.  The boxes of 48 look identical on the outside.  After reading the comments that they are not the same I looked inside both.  They might have different colors but without taking them all apart and organizing them maybe not.  I still find this whole thing misleading.  I also remember seeing the box at Target after I bought it and thinking I did not get a great deal as it was 5.99 at Target.  I paid about 7.00 here at the time.  My girls are still happy to have new crayons and are cleaning up the craft table now to get started but I am disappointed at the misleading description.  I am usually happy with Crayola products.  Skip this one though!	-1
Slinky is one of those toys that feels cool when you hold it. Looks cool in the ads, but never works on any staircase you have and gets ruined quickly. This will be my last slinky purchase. Not going to waste any more money. These ones are quality. But the toy itself is more of a psychological sale rather than a cool toy. Slinky sucks. Get a "DE Kinetic Educational Spring Toy" on amazon instead. It will last and it's fun.	-1
Cheaply made. Became tangled the same day my son got it.	-1
Not original size doesnt actually climb down steps. My kids plasticine barely works and is still better	-1
Crayola makes the best crayons, don't get me wrong. This box of crayons is actually several smaller boxes of the exact same colors. I was expecting a large variety of colors instead of just a large amount of the same colors.	-1
I would give this tricycle negative stars if I could, a whole load of them. My 21-month-old (who is well within the product's specified use range of 12 months through 5 years) managed to split her chin wide open falling off this toy a few days ago. She pushed forward with her feet at the same time as she leaned forward, causing the front wheels to slide right beneath her on the hardwood floor, because they have exactly ZERO traction. For a split second, she was up in the air vertically before she came crashing down, face-first, making contact with the floor with her chin. Our trip to urgent care resulted not only in 4 stitches for her, but a mountain of anxiety and trauma for me, my husband, and our dear little girl. I simply cannot recommend strongly enough that parents stay away from this product. Unless you have wall-to-wall carpet throughout your entire home, spend the extra money on something that is a little more durable and has more traction to prevent such a horrible accident from happening to your sweet little one.	-1
got bent and tangled at the first use. Cheap and unusable.	-1
Really disappointed. The picture is very misleading this picture the toy colour is much darker,looks more playful than the actual toy. It is a rip off it doesn't worth the money.	-1
Too light weight to pop on hard floor; you have to push down really hard to get it to pop. Pops on carpet (because wheels only roll on carpet) but not great.	-1
Complete junk!  These are not made like they used to be!  Two out of three were irreparably tangled in less than a day!	-1
We've had this for several month now, but my son doesn't ride this at all. I think he doesn't like the two wheels in front that there is no room for his legs to proceed. We wasted money on this trike.	-1
would not slink	-1
Despite the name, this slinky is much smaller than the original. In fact, it's way too small to "walk" down stairs or even an incline.	-1
I remember slinky's being able to go down stairs.	-1
This ride on toy was given as a gift for my son's first birthday. My son would rather push this toy around than to sit on it and take it for a ride. He'd enjoy it if I were pushing him around but I'd have to teach him to keep his feet up or it'll hit the wheels. After minutes of pushing and my backaches, the fun is done and he just wanders off and looks for something else to play with. Also, this toy is very lightweight so when he tries to get on or off this bike without assistance,it'll tip or slide, making him lose his balance and fall. There are other toys out there that would be more exciting and less painful.	-1
My 4years old son broke it in 2 mins after we got it...	-1
I really didn't think this was a good game	-1
I'm surprised this has such good reviews.  We play lots of board games, but my kids ages 8-13 find this one boring and slow to play.  The classic board games are definitely more exciting.	-1
This shouldn't advertise itself as the "original" slinky as it's much smaller than the ones I used as a kid. It's maybe 2.5" across and too short to go down stairs. That said, it is good quality/well-made.	-1
after 3 years, all pieces are losing the paint, numbers are getting faded	-1
Not like it is advertised much smaller.	-1
Does not at all go down  any stair way anywhere	-1
This classic toy is overpriced here.  You can get it at any dept. store. Also this toy is not the best.  I have more trouble locating all the rings, that the baby throws them around everywhere.  Not the greatest toy.	-1
Was a twisted mess within just a few hours of opening. Ended up throwing away. I should have just bought one at the dollar store.	-1
Fell apart in the first week	-1
It does not work very well.  I even have trouble using this thing!	-1
Disappointing - couldn't get it to go down the stairs.	-1
These are tiny, unusable, and do not work on any stairs I have tried.  Even the classic just letting it slink from hand to hand stinks with this.  It is over as soon as you start.  All this toy will do is remind you how crappy everything is these days compared to when we were young.  (Except the internet!)  Got these for each kid.  They saw the old commercial for everyone loves a slinky on youtube when i was flipping through videos and got obsessed.  I would have been happy to pay $20 for the REAL slinky instead of this junk.	-1
Mmm.... Doesn't work. I'm a slinky lover and couldn't seem to get this one to work. Bummer	-1
It's not kids friendly at all. First, it's rather sharp that it damaged my wall. Second, it doesn't go down the stairs as the slinky is too rigid. Third, it was unusable after the boys played with it less than 24 hours. Sad.	-1
A very, very cheap knock off of the awesome original. The pieces feel cheap and light. The game "board" is cheap and light. The top never topples off no matter what you do because it's such light junk. We just play until the stacked pieces tip over. The one from when I was a kid was heavy, sturdy and the whole top would fall off. Would be one star but my 5 year old still had fun.	-1
Not as fun as I would have hoped.	-1
My son has had this toy since he was 6 months old. He's 11 months old now. He plays with all kinds of toys and enjoys them, but has never cared anything about this toy, past using the rings as chew toys.  It's a pretty boring toy.	-1
I thought I was getting a simple balancing game for our preschool daughter. Not the case. There are way too many scoring rules and it barely ever topples. We have three daughters ages 9,12 and 5 and none of them liked this game.	-1
Super-loud! Pops much more loudly than the one I have as a kid - sort of sounds like gunshots, actually. I should have comparison shopped because Amazon is 30% more expensive.	-1
We went through all the rules and played a couple times, but it didn't really keep the kids attention. They were done with it after one turn.	-1
Not the slinky i remember from my youth and that of my kids. It doesn't work or our stairs. It can't deal with their width.	-1
cheaply made	-1
The dye from the blue ring comes off, and my baby had it all over her face!  I don't care if the company says it's non-toxic, I don't want my child ingesting this dye, and you shouldn't either!  Why is this still on the market?	-1
two stars.. one for making the most annoying toy ever and another  one for making my son happy while he annoys the crap out of everyone. ;)	-1
I am highly disappointed.  Received my item today and my 4 year old and I excitedly opened the package to play, only to see the 'stem' is missing.  Steups!!!!	-1
broke the first day but before that we could not get it to "walk" down the steps.	-1
The slinky is good quality - however, these are TOO short to "walk" down wooden stairs.  I didn't try on a carpeted staircase but it seems the slinky will not reach tip to tip of the steps.  Will send these back.	-1
will not slinky down the steps,	-1
you get what you pay for... cheap plastic... but daughter was ok with it	-1
It didn't go down my stairs at all. It looked nothing like the slinky I had as a child. I didn't have issues with the size, but I remember the slinky I had would go down the stairs. Maybe my stairs are a little too high now. I would not purchase again.	-1
This is NOT the Topple I played with 20 years ago. This game is now made to be cheap and is extremely flimsy. The pieces are so junky that they do not even stack above three. I was so disappointed. Don't bother.	-1
Broke/ deformed easily. Not sure why i thought a metal slinky was a good idea.	-1
I was hoping that a simple toy like this would help me teach my 3 and 5 year old some basic physics. The colored pieces are a little smaller than the circumference of a quarter. They are made of a thin plastic and therefore, have little weight. You see very little seesawing motion when you play and the board tends to fall over more often because they bump the surface a little when placing the plastic playing piece. If the parts had some more weight and quality, it would be more fun to play. The toys I played with when I was growing up are still around, just more flimsy and lower quality. (Thanks Wal-Mart!)	-1
My daughters had no interest in this toy.  A couple of times I saw my youngest use the rings for bracelets otherwise it didn't get played with.  It was a waste of money and I would not buy this again for another child.	-1
My son was excited to get his first slinky. I was excited to show him how it walks down stairs. This slinky is nice but not big enough to walk down our hardwood stairs- dissappointing. It's a nice slinky other than that, but it didn't last long in my 3 year old's hands haha	-1
My kid loves it but everybody else hates it. Very loud for comfort. As such it sits hidden and is basically useless. Wish FP would reduce the noise level to make it more tolerable.	-1
and came with no packing slip.  Returned and then never got my money back.  It was too cheap to even pursue via phone call but I wanted to warn others.	-1
Didn't last long, became entangled had to throw away!	-1
The crap doesn't walk down stairs in single or pairs.	-1
The toy is well made, the sound passable, and the idea great.  The problem is that my son, and the other infants that we have had visit, have not played with this toy much at all.	-1
We got this for our son when he was 6 mo old.  He's now 11 mo old and still isn't very interested in playing with it....maybe he will eventually.  Right now he will take the rings off, throw them, then moves on to something else.  It's not very entertaining for him (yet?).  I really liked the price though!! We'll see what happens.	-1
Terrible. Lasted about an hour.	-1
I should have read other reviews before purchasing this item.  As other reviewers have reported, this slinky DOES NOT WALK DOWN STAIRS.  I was excited to get this for my 6 year old for Christmas so that he could have the same experience that I had as a kid watching a slinky slink down a flight of standard residential stairs.  If you're lucky, you can get this slinky to go down one or two steps before it completely compresses and just falls down the rest of the way as if you had just tossed it down. We live in a typical 2 story house with typical stairways leading upstairs to the second floor and another leading down to the basement.  We tried it on both sets of stairs. Neither worked.	-1
Great selection of colors but have to press hard to make colors show on paper. Tossed out after repeated tries	-1
This product is just so-so. Makes popping sound but that's about. Won't hold interest for long. Better spend a bit more for one of those poppers with funny heads going up and down when rolled over. A more interesting sight.	-1
i bought this to entertain my cats!  they are afraid of it. and it doesn't work on my size stairs.  So now I just place it in their toy box and they are fascinated with it.  I will keep it.	-1
Not the "original."  Narrower in width (although seemingly the same length), and wouldn't walk down ordinary-sized (carpeted) stairs.	-1
I thought the "original" Slinky would be large enough to go down stairs as mine did as a child.  WRONG!  If you actually want one that does stairs you need the now "GIANT" Slinky.	-1
Not good on 11" depth stairs. We stretched out the center of the slinky so it was usable on 11 inch treads. Still didn't work very well but was okay. Worked best on older New England house with narrow staircase.	-1
I do not think this is as big as the original slinky we had as kids.  It does not go down the stairs.  Perhaps there is a bigger one?	-1
This is the most useless and misrepresented item I have ever purchase.  It does nothing like the original Slinky.  It will not begin to walk down a stair.  It really does nothing other than let you look at it. It is not near the diameter or length as the original. I noted that the name of the product is "Poof-Slinky"  It should have been named "Spoof Slinky"  because if you buy it you will have been  "Spoofed" and someone will be laughing all the way to the bank.  Amazon should send a letter of apology to all purchasers for allowing such a deceptive item in their marking stream.	-1
This slinky is small/ too short. It does not "walk down stairs".  Total waste of money.  I do not recommend buying it.	-1
Recalling how I was mesmerized by my Slinky "walking" down our stairs as a child in the 1960's, I was really looking forward to introducing my 5 year old grandson to this classic toy.  (I purchased a "Slinky Jr." at the retail level, which was a complete waste of money... I promised my grandson I'd purchase a "REAL" Slinky, like Grandma had when she was his age.)  Finding the price seemed reasonable on Amazon, I purchased one, just received it this week, and went to give it an initial nostalgic "workout" prior to sharing what I remembered as a wonderful toy with him.  Well, it does NOT walk down stairs (despite what the instructions on the back of the box say!), and only does the initial "flip" when on the floor!  Maybe it was only $5, but I don't believe in throwing money out of the window!  What a shame that they - somehow - changed this product so that it no longer performs like the REAL "original"!  So disappointed was I in this purchase that I wanted to try to figure out what "happened" to that great old Slinky.  Even though, as the box claims, it WAS invented in 1946, the inventor died in 1974, and his wife sold it to "Poof Products", the current manufacturer, in 1998.  I don't think the inventor would be too pleased with how they've changed his product over the past few years!  I didn't bother reading reviews prior to purchasing, because of the "original" label, but now that I've read over the first few pages of these reviews, I noticed something --- as of today, 6/15/13, the 4 & 5 star ratings for the product are dated 2008 & prior (except for one reviewer who used them to keep out squirrels instead of as a toy - Slinky has long been known as a terrific squirrel deterrent for bird feeders, but this is marketed as a toy, and should perform as claimed!)... the reviews from 2011, 2012 & 2013 are all rated only 1 or 2 stars, so they DID change something, and this is NOT the "original" Slinky! How unfortunate that the company this was product was sold to (Poof) tinkered with a classic.  They should change it back, or market this as the only thing it's good for (preventing squirrels from getting at bird feeders.)	-1
This broke the first time we took it out for our child to play with.  Was very disappointed.  Would go with a plastic one over a metal one if you want kids to play with.	-1
I ordered this for my granddaughter. It arrived broken. My family took it apart and repaired it. Not built with the quality that they used to be. Now that it's working she does like it.	-1
My son asked Santa for a slinky for Christmas- we just moved into a home with stairs and he was excited to try it. Imagine our disappointment when we tried it and... nothing! It won't walk down the stairs. Very bummed...	-1
I remember Slinky in the 70s when my daughters were young. They loved playing with it, running it down slopes and stairs. This one, which I bought for my grandson aged 4, does nothing but flop back to itself and just sit there. I was very disappointed, as was he. At the price, it didn't seem worth sending back. BUT DON'T BUY IT!!!	-1
Although it says "original", it is only 2.25 inches in Diameter.  It does NOT walk down stairs or on the floor.  So basically this is just an overpriced spring, all you can do is bounce it.	-1
This is not the "original" slinky.  It is much smaller and will not walk down stairs.  To me that was always the fun part or even the point of a slinky.  This one is pretty much useless and no fun for my daughter.  Would not recommend unless you are setting it on a shelf in a box for nostalgic purposes.	-1
My son had a plastic slinky before this one. It didn't last very long. I got the metal one thinking that it would. I was mistaken. In a matter of weeks he had managed to get this so tangled up that we had to bin it. It was impossible to get it untangled. The toy has no apparent educational value and the novelty of watching it 'walk' wears off after a few times. I would not purchase another slinky no matter how he bargains!	-1
My son loves to push objects, anything and everything which is why i always wanted to buy him a push toy. This is nice except that it makes too much noise and sometimes my son gets scared of it. The noise also is a little disturbing to the ears. If your baby loves a push toy too, get something that is not noisy.	-1
I am not sure if I got a defective one or not, but the wheels would not turn without a lot of force.  I ended up returning this to Amazon.	-1
This was not platic, nor purple. Just a metal slinky. How hard is it to get something right for something so simple? Sad people have to read through the reviews to make sure they're buying what they think they're buying.	-1
mine came PINK, no good for 8 yr old grandson	-1
They are all broken inside...  Like, when I sharpen them, they just fall apart. The colored "lead" in them have all but shattered. No matter how much or how little I sharpen them, they just fall out when I try to use them after sharpening. They lasted about 15% of the length of the colored pencil before the leads started falling out.	-1
I would say buy this in the store so you can test it before buying it. I have to push down very hard to get it to pop at all. So it doesnt really work for the 1 year old it was purchased for. Very upsetting	-1
Will not go down the stairs. My 2 boys asked me what it's supposed to do. I guess I'll have to get the classic metal one to show them. It was broken in pieces within a day.	-1
The physical properties that make slinkys work are only found in metals not plastics.. Like all other products once proudly produced in the US, this is likely a piece of Chinese garbage.  It doesn't work.  Get a metal slinky and if your kid bends it tell him "Them's the breaks kid. Soon, everyone you love will be dead."	-1
Based on the fantastic reviews of this product I thought it was going to be a great hit. Wrong... the twins are terrified of this toy. They would literally startle/jump when they hear the popping noise. They have so far refused to have anything to do with it. They aren't typically timid or noise sensitive in most situations. The popping sound is very loud and sudden, so I can see how it can be anxiety provoking for a 1 year old unless it is used in a place with high background noise.  Luckily it is a cheap item so I will hold on to it in hopes that it will make a good gift for another child some day.  I will probably try to reintroduce this toy again in a few months, but seriously...  The only thing they are more frightened of is the vacuum cleaner.	-1
I received this as a gift in July 2012.  The corn popper that is currently for sale is very poorly made.  The wheels DO NOT ROLL, on either carpet or on hardwood.  I have a hard time making it pop when I am pushing it myself, exerting considerable downward force.  My one year-old daughter is a great walker but could never get this going.  She carries it around with her sometime, but I don't even think she understands what it is supposed to do.  Additionally, the older models used to have a switch on the underside that could turn off the "popping."  This switch is gone.  When I called my Mom to complain that ours didn't work, she told me to check to make sure it was in the "on" position.  When I let her know that no such switch existed she couldn't believe how much Fisher Price has cut corners to wreck a toy that used to be such a crowd-pleaser.  Don't buy this unless you find an old used one at a tag sale.	-1
I bought this for my 10 month old.  He walks very well on his own already. He was excited when he heard the popping noise as I pushed it around and showed him how it works but for some reason he can't maneuver this toy by himself very well.  Even at 11 months he's not able to do it although he walks perfectly on his own. I think it's because the handle is so narrow and the toy is light weight.  Also on hardwood floors the wheels don't grip so it doesn't pop but rather just drags across the floor.  I would take this back to the store if i could.	-1
This product arrived quickly and when I opened it the package/cardboard label was all torn. The item itself is scratched all over the dome. In particular it has two very deep scratches. I am beyond upset with this product. I'm sure it would be fabulous if it wasn't ruined	-1
The colors are very weak and you don't get much color an the page .	-1
I love this game. We've played with with friends many times. What I didn't love was that the package had been opened and used. I would have been so embarrassed had I purchased it for gift. The bag of tiles had been neatly cut open along the side of the bag. The tiles were all over in the box. It seems most games come sealed in cellophane. This game had two small adhesive circles adhering the box closed. Disappointed.	-1
Okay... This game makes you think which is great BUT it is all in the luck of the draw.  It is not the best strategy that wins. I have 12 year old triplets who were bored mid-way through the very first game we played. I don't know what I am missing here because the reviews are great. But I do not get it!!!  If you have a great mind this is not the game for you. If you are looking for something "fun" to play with your kids this is not the game for you. Honestly, I do not know who this game is for. I gave it two stars only because the "idea" of the game is imaginative.	-1
We used to play this game all the time when we were kids, and it was my favorite game.  I was so disappointed when I got this newer version a couple years ago.  They re-designed the tile rack so that your opponents can now see how many tiles you have left.  The game is no longer fun or interesting.  Boo to Rummikub! :(	-1
Not overly impressed with how well they color in the adult coloring books that I ordered.  just don't put a lot of bright color down on the page, I guess you get what you pay for. I would try a more expensive  brand next time I order.	-1
I didn't like the way these pencils colored. I color adult coloring books but these pencils made me feel like I was in kindergarten again. I prefer ohuhu pencils.	-1
My son is really into fishing and wanted a game like that so my mom brought it home for him. My mom is a preschool special education teacher and had this game at her work but didn't need it so gave it to my son. The suction cup piece is a little annoying and my son doesn't really enjoy playing it because there are so many ways to play it. He has more fun just picking them up cause the suction cup is really weak. Could be better.	-1
These arrived a few minutes ago.  The screens on both look dusty with particles showing up on the screen.  Shaking them did not get rid of them or clean the screen.  These are defective, broken, crap and I just went to return them and they are not eligible for return.  Imagine that?  Take a crap defective product and give the buyer NO recourse.  I bought TWO so I am out $25.00.  I bought these for a charity for impoverished kids who have no toys.  So, I can't give them a BROKEN toy.  So, I will throw them out.  I am very angry.	-1
I have one that I bought from a different vendor about 5 years ago. I used it just a little but and then put in in a display cabinet with some other knick knacks. I took it out today to play with it and it barely works. It had been used for maybe 10 minutes total in 5 years. The left to right control works but the top to bottom control is barely functional and either barely makes lines or doesn't work at all. As a kid I recall we had a full sized one that was virtually indestructible. Unfortunately, like many other products, the modern version looks like the original product  but is actually a cheap imported piece of junk. It is truly sad.	-1
The lead in these pencils keep breaking.  I will never buy this brand again. I am really disappointed in these pencils. I sharpen them then they break. Sharpen again...again...they break.	-1
Arrived broken	-1
Tiny! Can't really draw on it.	-1
These were purchased for use with an adult coloring book and when compared with the higher end pencils, there is no comparison. These lose and are best left to the kids.  They color, but they do not have a soft core and to make the colors vibrant, you have to press hard which distorts the picture. The colors actually went through the page of the coloring book, I pressed so hard.	-1
The box was ripped  and had broken pencils  some of them were to big to fit in the box	-1
Got this book as a gift for my son and although it's cute, he has zero interest in it. My son LOVES books and can't get enough of them but he has never liked activity books at all and this one in particular is very boring. The price tag is a joke, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I would pass on this unless your child is VERY interested in activity books (there are a couple of flaps to lift and that's pretty much it).	-1
Crayola used to be the best around.  Save yourself the money and headache and just buy the dollar store crap.  Every time we've sharpened them they break and the wood shreds around it.  In one attempt to sharpen a point we ended up with a 1 inch nub for a pencil.  Every. Single. Time.  So, thinking it was just a bad batch, bought a replacement and the same thing happened.	-1
Used it for colouring. Not as effective. Doesn't stay sharp long. Constantly having to sharpen. Glad there are lots of choices tho. But would probably prefer the mechanical ones if same quality.	-1
Several came broken	-1
Crayola! I'm ashamed of you! Warped pencils and missing a color because I got two of one color. These will work fine for backgrounds but.........Meh. I won't buy again.	-1
I ordered the one with silver and gold pencils and I got normal ones	-1
I bought 5 of these, all of them only had a few SCENTED in them, not all were SCENTED.... clearly kids were not too happy...... if you sell SCENTED markers, they should all be scented don't you agree?	-1
not what i thought it was..i was looking for the slinky part in the middle...my error when ordering..nothing wrong with the item..just not what i was looking for	-1
Ruined within days	-1
Damaged and out of it package	-1
Really small.  Item not as pictured.	-1
This is not as described it is really small and the string coming out of the dog is about 5 inches long. My short 4 year old couldn't even make it walk without walking like a hunchback. I tied a longer string but the slinky part itself is easy gets flipped and tangled up. I was hoping for a smaller version of the one from the movie what I got is something from a dollar store.	-1
I was fairly excited when I found these at my local 'more-than-a-dollar' store. I've been working on lettering with markers (Tombows and Copics all the way down to the standard Crayola markers). So here was something I'd never come across in person and I was more than willing to cough up a little cash to try these out.  Unfortunately, my enthusiasm petered out as soon as I opened them. They are definitely manufactured on the cheap and some corners were cut. (Plain white cheap-looking barrel, caps not as secure as any other Crayola marker I've tried.) Still, I hoped for the best and spent several minutes practicing with them.  Sadly, I cannot recommend these whatsoever for 'brush' lettering. I do not understand at all what makes these special, they seem flimsy to me and I'm afraid the tip of the marker will pop right off.  I vastly prefer the chubby Crayola markers for lettering and coloring. Save yourself a little money if you're into lettering (or coloring) and move right along.	-1
This toy is significantly smaller than I assumed. The picture they show with the child walking Slinky Dog is extremely misleading. It's a little more than just a pocket sized toy.	-1
I don't think they wrote very clearly. I haven't used them after the first time. I am sure they are fine for kids	-1
Not easily washed off skin. I took 2 showers and the ink is not completed off yet.  I got it from a third party seller (Dime Savings) on amazon. I am suspecting I am getting a counterfeit crayola washable marker.  https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=&isAmazonFulfilled=1&isCBA=&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&orderID=112-1546930-8759451&seller=A1VTOHBUYO8VSD&tab=&vasStoreID=  The seller got perfect ratings. So I do not know what went wrong.  It's either counterfeit or the marker itself is not so washable.  For $7 bucks, I am too lazy to do a return.  I do not recommend by this.	-1
This toy is useless.  The cord is so short you can't pull it behind you.  It is placed in a weird spot on the dogs head.  The plastic is very cheap too.  If you want to collect all the toy story toys and leave them on the self this would be fine but if your giving it to kids don't bother.	-1
These break so much that we don't even get to use them, I got them for my daughter but as soon as we sharpen them thr lead breaks off before we even use it. Very disappointing, that was all in the first week.	-1
Slinky is one of the most wanted characters from Toy Story. He is cute and unique and our 4 year old was so pleased to receive him. He stretches out and doesn't contract very well but he does complete the character set.	-1
I received this slinkly dog for my four year old daughter.  Although she loooves Toy Story I found this dog to be extremely small.  Just a little bigger than a barbie doll, in my opinion.  I have not given it to her yet for Christmas and even though I know she will love it - -my impression is that it is too small.	-1
WAY OVERPRICED for what it is. I piece of plastic with electrical conduit going thru to reinforce the handle and 35' of steel cable and plastic wheels. Way, way too much money for what it is. Have not installed it yet, considering our options.	-1
When I initially reviewed this product, my review was rejected because I critiqued the product with little emphasis on customer service.  As far as customer service goes, the company did a satisfactory job of filling the order, to include offering to refund 50% of the purchase price based on my disatisfaction with the product.  The product itself is cheaply made and is not suitable for use as a zip line.  In reality, it is supposed to be mounted perfectly horizontal and low enough so that the child's feet remain in contact with the ground.  There was virtually no metal used in it's construction.  Personally, I didn't feel comfortable allowing my 9 year old grandson using this toy.	-1
They break when you sharpen them.  If you are lucky to get a point, it breaks off.  Would not buy them again.	-1
We're chemically sensitive. This stated it had bonus stickers or something but when it arrived it had four bonus scented markers. Yuck!	-1
I would not buy these again. The tips are not of good quality and do not stay together well.	-1
Ugh.  My pencils came with the box open all all the pencils spilled out in the shipping box.  Most of the tips were broken off, and one pencil is actually missing.  This may be a good price on Amazon, but don't expect the pencils to arrive looking like they are supposed to.  I was going to put this in a Christmas stocking- definitely not going to do that.  And yes, they are impossible to sharpen without breaking the tips off constantly.  This gets two stars for the beautiful colors of the pencils and how they actually work- until they need to be sharpened.	-1
The packaging was damaged with a big hole. The pencil box was crushed and instead of receiving 50 pencils I was 2 short. Probably because they fell out. There was no interior wrap to prevent sliding all over.	-1
SEE EDIT BELOW: I bought two boxes of Crayola colored pencils. They are supposed to be sharpened, there were many that were not, and there were some that had broken leads in them. I am not sure if the other ones will have broken lead as well.  This was combined with a box of 120 Crayola Crayons which arrived with a number of tips broken off to the paper line. Sad to have a box of brand new crayons that are broken before you get a chance to use them.  Whether this is an issue from Crayola, or from Amazon, I am very disappointed. Good product? bad shipping perhaps?...  EDIT: THESE HAVE BEEN USED FOR A WHILE NOW. ABOUT 1 IN 4 PENCILS THAT ARE SHARPENED HAVE BROKEN LEAD IN THE WOOD. AFTER SHARPENING THEM THE LEAD WOBBLES IN THE WOOD. THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. I AM AN ARTIST. I AM USING A GOOD SHARPENER. I HOPE THE BOX I GAVE TO MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS. SHE WILL SHED MANY TEARS AND THINK SHE HAS DONE SOMETHING WRONG TO CAUSE THE PROBLEM. WHAT A BOTHER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.	-1
More than half of these markers are dried up. I am very disappointed. Even for the low price, I expected better from a Crayola product.	-1
Boring. I don't recommend these. My sons have hardly played with them. The old flower building set that we have is far superiod. Expensive on ebay, though.	-1
The base is not sturdy and moves while a child is trying to place the peg.	-1
well , the lead breaks A LOT when sharpening. A bit disappointed with crayola. they have really good paints, crayons etc will try other brands for coloring pencils	-1
Too difficult for my toddler to use. You have to push rather hard to get the pegs in the holes of the mat and to get them to fit on top of each other. My toddler is very frustrated because of that. We have another set of pegs that he plays with often. These are just too hard to put together.	-1
Tips were broken & markers were leaking leaving kids hands full of stains. They are nice colors and are great to color with.	-1
These color pencils are great until you sharpen them and they break all to pieces.  I had so much trouble with these pencils breaking that I called crayola and complained.  Luckily they are sending me a $12.00 coupon for more crayola.	-1
As a psychologist, I bought this as a fine motor toy for my 2-year-old. It only sustains his attention for a few minutes.	-1
nothing to it......remedial counting and colors.......not enough to do too much with. they get them out once in a while but play is short lived. I wish I had picked something else to get.	-1
Simply put, this game is boring.  The mat is flimsy and doesn't support tall towers, and that's really all you can do with this toy.  We're a family which loves toys but we all got bored of this in minutes.	-1
Please kids toys should be free of toxic fumes. I had to return because my kid also tried to taste the toxic material..	-1
These are just so-so. I bought these for my daughter over the summer and they are already drying out and not really that colorful on the paper anymore, even though I'm adamant about putting the caps on tightly after use. I would stick with the old school thick Crayola markers, as those seem to last longer.	-1
I had read a lot of good reviews on this toy before I bought one from Toys R Us two days ago.  When I opened the box, I found the "Little Tikes" on the backboard was upside down.  I rushed to Toys R Us for exchange.  My [...] daughter and a neighbor's boy were very excited.  They started playing immediately once it stands up.  But one obvious problem is that the basketball set is terribly unstable - not because the base is light, but the connection between the pole and the backboard was so bad that the backboard wobbles/shakes all the time both left & right and back & fourth.  It definitely seems can fall apart at any time.  The pole looks like made of cheap plastic and its top edge where the backboard should be snapped in was not even cut evenly.  There is a gap between the pole and the backboard that caused constant wobbling of the backboard.  Also with just a little touch the pole falls short easily. Thinking I was simply not very lucky - that was just a bad piece of a good product that many people like - I went to the store again yesterday and brought another one home.  The second one wobbles and shakes as well due to the same cause just little bit better than the first one.  I was very disappointed and dumped them both in my trunk.  Will send them all back. Meanwhile I got an advise from a friend and went to get a Fisher Price Grow to Pro basketball set in K-Mart that cost [...], only [...] extra than the Easy Score.  We set it up last night and it is very nice (we played before at my friend's house. I just didn't remember the brand name while shopped for my first one)	-1
It is fragile, one piece broke right away. I wish I had kept the box and returned it. The kids don't really play with it, is not as good as other marble runs I have seen.	-1
We were really excited to get this track for our son for christmas, he loves to play with marbles.  I did some research, and went with this one.  We are disapointed, the plastic is cheaply made, and easily breaks.  It is too hard for him to put together himself (he is 5).  My husband or I has to to it, even then it takes a lot of time and patience.  The red spinning wheels it comes with area good idea, but they don't work!  The marble gets stuck everytime.  Also, it only comes with one "exit" piece. Their must be a better quality track out there!  We found this track to be cheaply made, and very frusterating.  I would pass on this one...	-1
Seriously, this marble run is dollar store quality.  Cheap, light weight plastic... even the slighted nudge knocks the pieces out of place.  Some of the pieces just sit on top of one another, rather than "snap" together like they should.  And unlike the description and the picture on the front of the box, this set does not come with real glass marbles.  You get 10 plastic balls that are about half the size of a real marble.  They still work of course, but just the fact that they show real marbles being used adds insult to injury.  Not to mention, 45 pieces isn't enough to get creative with.  I'd recommend spending slightly more money of a better quality version with more pieces.	-1
We purchased this marble run for our 4-year old son because of his great love for wooden marble run assembly blocks, which he has been using since he was 2. While this set ia  terrific idea and certainly has a lot of educational value, it is made of very flimsy plastic and is in no way durable. Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations (which should be half the fun) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time. While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets, I regret purchasing this and certainly don't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic.	-1
This marble run game might be good for children 10 and older.  It's extremely fragile and the parts are much smaller than other marble run games I've seen.  We have a 5 and 3-year old and they lose interest quickly due to easily breaking parts and parts not fitting together well.  I would go for another game if purchasing again.  Not impressed.	-1
Despite saying it worked with all innotabs, it did not work with innotab Max.  Luckily we found the charger we misplaced.  Waste of $5	-1
Didn't work for my son's (brand new) Innotab 3S for some reason. I was able to insert the plug into the charging port just fine, but it wouldn't power up. I'm not sure if it was a faulty charger or an issue with our tablet, but I ended up returning it and (sadly) going back to batteries. Amazon was great throughout the return process as always.	-1
LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS THAT SAY TO PURCHASE A BETTER UNIVERSAL ONE!!!!!! We had one 10 years ago and I figured they must have made it better by now.....NOPE!	-1
didnt work	-1
Didn't work for my son's game even though it is listed as one this would work with.	-1
Arrived with a botched paint job - sent back and didn't use. I've liked all of the HABA items we have purchased other than this so it was disappointing.	-1
I bought this about a month ago for my 4 month old to teeth on. It's cool looking and well-made. However, out of curiosity I nibbled on it with my lips to see what it felt like to my baby, and it pinched my lip between the triangles. I really wanted to love this since it was pricey and so cute, however I don't need to aggravate my teething baby with something that's supposed to soothe her. Oh well.	-1
doesn't charge . have to keep the vetch plugged up while this is in the wall to work	-1
I guess I should've read the reviews on this before purchasing for Christmas. We hadn't needed to use it for my daughter's tablet until this past weekend on a road trip. Well that was $9 wasted. I'm glad it wasn't more expensive. We purchased this for Christmas last year so we're past the point of returning it. I will go get her an AC adapter from Wal-Mart or the BX today. I'm sure I'll have no issues with that. Hopefully the car charger I bought with this doesn't have the same issue. *sigh* I guess we'll see today.	-1
Ordered 2 of these for my kids systems- first, I THOUGHT they were chargers, which they are not. They are just power sources.  Guess thats my fault for not paying better attention.  But secondly, they barely lasted a month before they just quit powering the systems altogether.  Very disappointed.  So we are stuck just using batteries which the systems eat for breakfast. Purchase these at your own risk. Maybe you'll end up having better luck.	-1
This item does indeed work for the Innotab 1, 2, and 3, and baby. The problem with the item is that it only lasts a few months. Then it no longer powers the item it was bought for. It's perfectly useless, and you have to buy a new one. Very poorly designed if you ask me. It's for a kids toy. One that would require alot of use. Brand new name brand batteries only last less than 2 hours on these devices. So to buy one of these would be preferable if they worked for longer than a few months. Buyer beware. (though there isn't a better product to recommend as I've found other adapters don't fit into the slot)	-1
This product did not last more than three days. I tried to call and email the company to see about repair or refund but nothing!!!! Throwing money down the drain!!!! just use rechargeable batteries!	-1
I  had this for only 6 months and it stopped working, the Innotab 2 works fine with batteries but when I try to plug it in without batteries, it no longer power the innotab 2.	-1
this product is not a charger! its just an adaptor. which limits mobility, if my child wants to play somewhere else. not happy	-1
It didn't work on my Grandson's Vtech Smile Motion game. I haven't tried it on his other Vtech toys, but very disappointed it doesn't work on the Vtech Motion game.	-1
We got this AC adapter for my daughter's InnoTab because it goes through batteries like crazy! The AC adapter works great at first, but eventually stops working and we need to go get a replacement.  Too bad for Vtech, because they are spending more money on replacements of a junky product instead of making a decent product to begin with.  Right now the thing looks brand new, no tears or damage, but no matter where in the house I plug it in, it will not power up the tablet.  I'd say this one lasted about 6 months.  I think they use cheep wires inside, where you can't see if they tear.  My almost-four-year-old loves using her tablet, especially to look at before she goes to sleep, but the tablet has an auto-shut-off feature, so I don't know what's damaging the adapter; we're using it normally. I think they just sell something low-quality. Don't spend too much money on this, and keep your receipt in case it quits on you.	-1
Obviously they work, but even with mild daily abuse they do not last long. We've gone through about 3 or 4 in the last year the kids have had the innotab...	-1
I was so excited to get this for my 4 year old daughters Innotab 2 but ended up very upset.  This was a great product for about the first month then the other day it stopped working. I tried a new outlet but still nothing. I then replaced the batteries in the Innotab2 to make sure it was the game itself. The machine worked fine but the plug still didn't.  Since I only paid a few dollars for it I am not too worried about returning it and have already purchased a new charger from a different brand.  Over all, the idea of having a charger right from the same company as the Innotab is great but the product itself is a mess.	-1
This adaptor is absolutely necessary because of the battery issue with the Vtech InnoTab 2. It goes through batteries like Grant through Richmond!  The cord is way too short. I'd like to see a longer cord  to allow for SOME movement while playing with tablet when it's plugged in.	-1
I ordered this in August & am now realizing it only has a 30 day return policy.  My daughter has only been the one that has used this since my granddaughter is 4, so I know it has been handled carefully. It is now 2 months after I gave it to her & it has already quit working.  For the $30 I paid for this, I expected it to work longer than 2 months.  Not only am I EXTREMELY disappointed in this product, I am upset that the seller only has a 30 day return policy.  I would not recommend this product nor the seller with their limited return policy.	-1
Returned it for full refund from amazon. It did work for a while, then stopped. When it did work, it did as it should--save batteries on my son's innotab!  Back to searching for another adapter!	-1
The power adapter is a must for the Innotab unless you plan on buying rechargeable batteries.  Some adapters stated they were specific but it seems that all Vtec products use the same standard AC power adapter so shop around.  Buy the $10 VTEC one instead of this one.  Same thing.	-1
It's a great concept but not worth the money. Some of the tasks don't go a long way toward teaching kids the skills the task is designed to teach. It looks like it was designed in a hurry, without much thought or testing and should be marketed for considerably less money.	-1
Buttons are hard to open/close. Zip is already broken. 2 stars because my daughter still loves it but I am really disappointed	-1
Bought this for my daughter to help work with shapes and colors. Fell apart within minutes. The snaps came apart and I had to prevent my daughter from swallowing them. Had to throw it out. So sad because she loved it too.	-1
Not the one from when I was a kid. The buttons are really hard and the snaps are almost impossible to do even for an adult! The shoe string is very short to tie. I wouldn't recommend this or buy it again.	-1
This was the first gift my great nephew opened.  It was truly a hit for the afternoon.  He is 6 months old.	-1
Not happy with the quality of this book. The zipper that zips the book closed broke almost immediately after purchase. It comes apart at the bottom left corner and is impossible to get back together. My kids rarely even play with the book, but one of the snaps for the balloons completely ripped out of the fabric. I expected better quality for the price. I also never got a call back when I contacted their customer service about these issues.	-1
Nice concept but smells bad and construction looks dubious. Is this even washable?	-1
I bought this for my 2-yr-old.  Six months later, she hasn't shown too much interest in it, and I don't care for the functionality. As other reviewers noted, the buttons are very difficult even for an adult with average-sized hands to work. The belt is too small/tight to be interesting to her and too simplistic to actually each her anything about fastening a belt.  I wish it either had a style with notches or the two d-rings that need to be navigated. The zipper page does not allow for practice in starting the zipper - you know, the hard part that might require some effort and concentration on her part. I haven't figured out purpose of the clock yet. My daughter isn't ready for it yet, but the shoe-tying page might be good ... if the inherent flimsiness of a fabric book doesn't make it too difficult.	-1
Not that happy with the product.  Read the warning label before using.  It may make you think twice about using this product.  I did.	-1
I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old for Christmas.  There is nothing magnetic about either the fishing pole or the puzzle pieces.  We even tried to pick up other things such as a paperclip etc with the pole and nothing works.  I would not recommend this product at all.	-1
The stickers on the letters started to peel after a month of occasional play.  When our youngest put a piece in his mouth, the "plywood" came apart and he ate a few pieces of wood. If you have a kindergartener, this is a cute puzzle though not the best quality, if you have a younger toddler in the house, skip this puzzle.	-1
I really don't even give it 1 star. Super disappointed. Purchased march 21st 2018, gave it to our daughter as a birthday gift April 8th, its already broken April 15th. The handles are wood and already a pain to assemble well they literally cracked by the screws after a few uses. Waste of 40 bucks, better to get a real one from a garden store.	-1
One of the handles is already broke. Difficult to put together. Radio Flyer needs to fix this problem.	-1
I saw this online and thought it would be a great gift for my nephew for Christmas, and with it being an old trusted brand I thought it would be fantastic. After getting it in the mail, I took it out of the box, checked the pieces, and thought, oh this will be easy to put together. I was wrong. SO. WRONG. If you purchase this and plan on putting it together yourself, get a drink first. Not a soda. Not a beer. You will need a glass, or seven, of some very strong liquor. Also get something to keep handy that you can destroy so when you realize that no matter how hard you try, that you are NEVER GOING TO GET THIS THING PUT TOGETHER, you can destroy that item by throwing it against the wall, tearing it into pieces, or beating it against the floor. Otherwise, you might hurt someone standing near, or possibly even yourself. So if you want to get something for someone you don't like, get this wheelbarrow and have sweet dreams of what a crappy time they will have assembling it. If you plan on assembling it yourself, save your money and try putting a 1 million piece puzzle together. It will more than likely take way less time.	-1
Horrible assembly! Holes were nowhere near where they should have been. We had to drill our own holes, which ruined the paint, all chipped. We haven't even used it yet. Definitely not worth the time and frustration.	-1
Given to my grandson as a gift and it is HORRIBLE. Cute little thing but assembly was the worst! The wheel assembly and the two part handles, REALLY? I finally get past most of the assembly and the tire keeps tilting left when you attempt to get the last handle on, not to mention the whole doesn't line up properly. Finally gave up... even if I drill another hole the wheel will still lean left. The spacer for the wheel should be longer and then the wheel could possibly align properly! FRUSTRATING AND SAD! Thought getting Radio Flyer would mean quality, NOPE!	-1
Imagine being so excited to get this in the mail. Now imagine the opposite when you're trying to figure out how to put this shoddy piece of crap together. Pieces wouldn't go together on right handle. Pieces were hard to put together on the other handle too. Wish I had never bought this. Even had to put handles together. Picture of it lied. It is in fact two pieces and not one. So disappointed in this. They need to do better. Wow.	-1
This thing was so cute. Needed assembly which I expected. However the holes didn't line up and we had to drill new holes in the metal. It's still cute but now has an extra hole in the metal. Since this was a gift it was a little annoying.	-1
I was really excited giving this to my son for his 3rd birthday, however, the screws did not line up correctly, and it could never be used.  Since I spread out.purchasing his gifts over a couple of months, the return period was over by the time of his birthday.  I should have listened to the other reviewers...lesson learned.	-1
I assumed because this was Radio Flyer it would be good quality. The holes in the handle were too small making assembly a hassle. My husband had to re-drill the holes. The tire is cheap and plastic. Not what I expected.	-1
For the price, the handles should come preassembled or one continuous piece. They are difficult to line up, at best. The wheelbarrow is loved by the kiddos, but from a quality standpoint I think parents will find it lacking.	-1
Very cheap and tiny.  Not heavy metal, very thin.  My 4-year old is too tall to push this wheelbarrow comfortably.	-1
Very small. Also, the handlebars are 2 pieces of relatively thin wood that don't fit together snugly no matter how we pulled or pushed. I am afraid that they will snap anyday now. I love Radio Flyer products, and assumed that this wheelbarrow would be high quality like their other products, so I waited until Christmas Eve to assemble it and was so frustrated at the awful handlebars. I don't think this toy will last long.	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old g'son for Xmas and found when putting it together the handles were put together with wood puddy ,screws missing, had to drill the holes on one side of handle. Very disappointed!!  Hope it last a few days after it's used.	-1
Not impressed with the quality at all.  The wood striped out on a couple of the screws so now they aren't tight.  Wood handles feel as if they are going to splinter easily.	-1
I don't reommend buying this product.  The handles are impossible to install with the given materials.  The holes are too small and the screws are the wrong size and type.  Fortunately my husband has a woodshop and can take care of the problem.	-1
husband had to drill extra holes	-1
Two grandsons and one granddaughter LOVED this wheelbarrow, which was purchased to replace a 20+ year old radio flyer kid's wheelbarrow that finally wore out - on the new one the gauge of the metal is thinner, the paint wasn't applied as nicely and within 6 years it had deteriorated and begun to rust.  These issues are NOT the fault of the seller - just keep in mind, like most things manufactured now, the quality and construction is sometimes not as good as what was made previously.  If I were to buy this again I'd make sure it was kept indoors and always stored clean and dry (try to get a 5 year old to do that all the time!)	-1
This review is not fully about the actual products quality, but more that my son (3 1/2 years old) has not been playing it with it as much as I had anticipated. We bought it for xmas along with some rakes, brooms, etc for pretend play and he just does not use the wheelbarrel at all. It is a bit hard for him to balance and so he is using it now just to play car races and building legos. He is a very active, coordinated boy so it is not that he doesnt know how to use it-  I think it needs more stability, at least another wheel possibly or maybe as he gets older he may develop more of an interest.	-1
Save yourself the time and don't but this . I wish I had read the reviews . Ours was missing pieces like many other people's .	-1
Set came with 3 kings and one queen.	-1
I was pretty surprised to find that I was missing a piece considering the package was sealed.  I contacted the manufacturer but have not heard anything back yet. My daughter really wanted to learn to play chess & I'm hoping they respond soon so she can start learning. Other than that, I like that the "directions" are printed right on the pieces. Helps a lot since my daughter can't read yet.  Feb 22, 2013 - As of this writing, the company has STILL not responded to my frequent requests to replace the missing piece.  This was a total waste of money because having arrived defective, my daughter has not had an opportunity to learn the game at all. I am VERY disappointed in the manufacturer for not standing by it's product.	-1
This looked like the pieces would be solid heavy quality pieces. They are not.  They are hollow plastic.  And I should have paid attention to the picture.  The directions for the move each piece can make are on the side facing you for the black, but on the side facing the black player for the white.  Does that make sense?  The directions are on the back side of the white.  I am disappointed is the quality and common sense of the making of this chess teaching game.	-1
Really tiny. Check size on product details.	-1
Smaller than I expected!	-1
