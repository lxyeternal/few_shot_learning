I really like this little vac !! It is small and powerful. It can be used with wet spills and dry. I like the fact that its versatile. I don't like buying bags and filters, but I still really like this Shop-Vac.	1
I think my only gripe with this vac is that the cord and hose are a bit too short for me. But since it is a compact unit, it is to be expected. Functions well, and picks up wet or dry just fine.	1
Wanted a wet/dry vac that wasn't huge. Specifically purchased it for sucking the pooled oil/coolant mix after my GM car's manifold melted and mixed coolant with oil. Worked great for the purpose.  I don't really like how there's a bag inside, but Shop-Vac sells bags that goes over the motor assembly itself so that you can use it like a "normal" shop-vac.	1
Keep in mind that this is the fine cup wire brush and it won't strip tough paint or rust. Also it is not for large surface areas. However as a finishing tool it is pretty good.	1
Great for grinding latex paint off of oil based paint that didn't stick to the oil based paint and had to be removed,.	1
great product	1
Good product	1
Helps a ton to knock off surface rust prior to undercoating. Have had zero issues with it so far.	1
Excellent wire brush	1
Great product	1
well built stood last 3 jobs thus far	1
Great wire brush for my impact driver.	1
Great wire brush for impact driver.	1
This really does the job it is designed for. I use it for my cast iron skillet as needed.	1
Works well	1
A lot of work and it is better than some that I've used. Nice to be able to use it in reverse too.	1
OK	1
Exactly what I needed.	1
Exactly what I needed.	1
Works well when attaching this to my drill while working on the car.  Needed to remove some light surface rust perfectly from the engine.	1
attached it to drill and it got the job done	1
This took a beating bur worked well for taking off rust	1
Nothing fancy here, but it works and does the intended job. I recommend having this accessory on hand to remove rust and paint from metal items.	1
I use this brush along with a drill to clean the crap off the inner edge of rims whenever I'm doing tire changes. It makes it simple, fast and easy and it's fine enough that it won't take off the coating or paint when using light pressure.	1
Tried using this to get old flaking paint off of metal poles, and it just doesn't do a very good job of it.	-1
It works pretty well for tight areas and crevices. Keep in mind that this is meant for smaller areas but can be useful for narrow areas of rust pitting, paint removal, etc.	1
Used this radial wire brush extensively to clean grill parts and other items.  The is very minimal brush end ejections while the brush in spinning on the end of my drill motor.  Brush material is heavy duty enough to remove the toughest stains and old paint without damaging the piece being wire brushed.  Works best at higher rpm's on the drill motor.	1
I needed a small wheel to remove some rust from an item that is no longer made that I purchased on Ebay.  This device in my portable drill removed most of the rust very well, and it's flexibility allowed me to get into some narrow crevices.	1
Good tool	1
perfect	1
Exactly what I needed that my $120 set didn't include.	1
Worked well and quickly	1
Century taps seem to be higher quality. I check the country of manufacture and most seem to be made in Japan.  I have several Century taps and have not been disappointed.	1
9/16-18 is used for AN-6 fittings. Drill = 33/64 or 12.8 in aluminum. Carbon steel will last long term in aluminum, short term in steel.	1
Great product!!! Great price!!!!	1
ok	1
Bought this to replace a broken one from a set that I have. Just as good if not better quality.	1
Good quality.  Used for some restoration work on my old gas range.  Hard hard steel with seemingly perfect machining.  Recommended.	1
Buy this over the Vermont American brand. This is Japanese made, the Vermont American is Chinese, and the quality difference is noticeable if you were to receive both.	1
work like a charm	1
Works as advertised	1
Nice tool. It easily cut threads into my rolled steel blackstone griddle top.	1
What can I say about a tap? Should I wax poetic? LOL	1
Good pipe tap. I used plenty of cutting oil and had no issues. Very sharp and good material.	1
cuts well.  Not sure how many other projects I will use it with (threaded rain barrel holes with it).	1
Century makes great taps (and drills). I've used this one and one other size, both Century, dozens of times in mild steel. Still cuts like new. Visual inspection shows absolutely no wear or damage to the cutting edges.	1
thanks	1
Works as described.	1
Works great. Well made.	1
works great	1
works great	1
Works GREAT and way cheaper here than buying locally  - IF you can find one -  not much else to say	1
good tap, nice price.	1
Made threads in polycarbonate, used a drill press to hold the tap straight while tapping, npt threads only work in one direction, it get tighter as you go in.	1
The tap works great.  I have no complaints.  I've only used it on brass and aluminum so I cannot speak for how it works on other materials.	1
Bought these and several other colors from Microtivity for some hobby projects.  Didn't use the included resistors for my project, but the LEDs themselves are excellent!  Sturdy and durable.  The LEDs are very bright and somewhat directional, but I found the outer shell can be distressed with some fine grain sandpaper for a more diffused look if needed.	1
Purchased these to create a school bus Halloween costume.  They worked great as flashers for the bus.  The included resistors worked great with a 9 volt battery source three LEDs in series with each resistor.	1
A pile of LEDs  at a better price than that former electronics parts store.  With included dropping resistors you can do plenty of projects like warning lights on you model train layout structures.	1
love it	1
Purchased these to create a school bus Halloween costume.  They worked great as flashers for the bus.  The included resistors worked great with a 9 volt battery source with two LEDs in series with each resistor.	1

I bought these to replace the led's which burnt out way too quickly in a Fancii magnifying glass. Larger than the originals, but they /just/ fit, and are very bright.  Longevity of these may be questionable in this case, as they are running off of 3 AAA batteries in series, the 4.5v is probably what blew the originals so quickly.  But, hey, spares out the wazoo (even after replacing a few in other things), and if they pop too fast I'll just change it to a 3.6v lithium.	1
as advertised	1
Nice LED's and resistors. Fast delivery.	1
Very nice color, very bright. The resistors they come with did feel low quality, but I had no issues with them. I used most of the lights in a project, and had trouble with one of them being dim, but it's very likely that I damaged it when I was soldering. Definitely going to order more in other colors soon	1
Worked just fine.	1
Worked just fine.	1
They are LED's.. they work.	1
good	1
They match the blue in the pictures	1
Sent promptly; item is as advertised.	1
These lights work perfectly.  But the polarity of the 3v DC current is important:  They don't work at all if the positive (+) terminal is soldered to the wrong side.	1
Nice and bright, ready for use. No problems found to date.	1
In my judgement these LEDs are not quite as bright as the sales pitch specifies but they will be OK for what I have intended...	1
Arrived on time, great value.  Works as advertised.	1
Really cool, I love them. I will be buying again.	1
love it	1
muy buenos	1
These LEDs are exactly what they are advertised to be.  I received 31 LEDs in the package, one was bad. I configured the 30 LEDs to run off from a 12Vdc battery with a small solar panel keeping the battery charged. This makes a good light to work at my computer at night.  I never turn it off, it is always hooked up and I call it my forever light. I an going to build several more of these and turn off the 110V room lights for good. The LEDs are quite clear, I don't see any color or tint to them, they are clear WHITE light. I used the resistors supplied with the order.  My setup is 3 LEDs in series and one resistor hooked to 12vdc. 10 sets of these used the 30 LEDs.	1
Purchased these for future use and have since used a few.  The included resistors work fine with a 9 volt battery source.	1

If you are joining cat 5 wiring these things are a must. Be sure to push the wires all the way in so that they bottom out in the button firmly before crimping down on the button. Yea had a learning curve for the first one.	1
Great product but easy to misplace, I don't remember where I left them after using a few. Hey I am getting old, what's your excuse Be Happy! Oh you need to study the diameter (gauge) of the wire to be used with match the sizes, A chart to study in advance would be wise.	1
Does the job.	1
Great little device for a quick and easy splice of small gauged wires.  We used these "back in the day" on old style telephone wires in junction boxes.  They're easier to use with gloves on than the other splice devices.  Which comes in handy when working outside in the winter.  Just shove in the wires and squeeze the button, you're done.	1
exactly as advertised	1
These objects are way to small to handle effectively	-1
I use CAT5 wire for security cameras, and I needed to splice the CAT5 in a couple places.  These snap on connectors did a great job.  No stripping of the wire needed, just use a pliers to press the connector closed.  (I would not use these to splice CAT5 for data communications use, you should use special CAT5 splices.)	1
The nicest surprise was the packaging--something not conveyed in the product picture. Each group of 10 colored LEDs arrived in its own mini plastic zip-lock bag and each bag had a colored paper dot on it, so I'm happy to keep them in their packs until ready to use. The colors matched the bright "central stripe" found in the colored dots in the original product illustration.	1
great deal for your money	1
good leds	-1
This assortment of clear/color LEDs is just what I wanted. You get ten of each color, plus enough resistors for each. I've mainly been using these to change out the LEDs on different equipment - making it easier to tell at a glance what indicator is lit. These LEDs also seem a bit brighter that the ones I'm replacing. I'm fairly happy with my purchase, and will probably be buying more later.	1
This was a great purchase at the price I paid.  No complaints, work great on my electronic projects.	1
absolutely love these. would buy again	1
AWESOME.	1
Just fine....	1
Great LEDs and are working within the specified tolerances without any issues. I have these working in several production products and proto type projects as well and have no issues with them.	1
I received my items and they were in good shape. I will be using them for a school project for my grand son.	1
I'm always building projects and need LEDs.  This is a really nice assortment.  The water clear package provides a very focused light.  If you need a diffused light then you can sand the covering with a nail file or some sand paper.  The main reason I got these is to build light source with several wavelengths of light for a spectrograph.	1
LEDs work and it is a nice touch to include some resistors with the LEDs. Also included is a card with a helpful resistor cheat sheet.	1
I like the packaging and how they are labeled with color dots so you remember what the colors are. Nothing else.	1
As a member of a survey website that pays me, I decided it's time to spend a little reward money. So I got these!  I am modding Nerf guns and though that these would look GREAT as the "laser" on the Nightfinder and Firestrike.  I just did a little test run of the white and green colors, and they are BRIGHT!  Good job! Definitely worth it. Go buy these, you never know when you might want to tinker with something, or where you could use them!	1
These LED's are awesome!  I've had great luck using these in some projects.  Getting ready to replace the incandescent lights in my wife's van's instrument panel with these!  Great job Microtivity!	1
I was very pleased with the 6 bags of LEDs and 60 resistors that were included with this set. The bulbs are bright and the colors are very rich. Most of the resistors worked for my 7.2v application, which I used one resistor for each of the 2.9 & 3.0 forward volt bulbs, I used two Red bulbs, 1.9v, with on resistor wired in a series and that works fine at only 17ma per bulb. In the picture/description there is obviously a purple bulb, but the bag of LEDs and the card identify them as pink. It is a nice purple/fusia color. I have tested half of the bulbs from each bag, give or take, and haven't had a problem. I am using some of these in my 50mph R/C car, these have held up very well with being mounted in a flexible lexan body. It will *sometimes* flip/roll/crash.	1
I order two packs (60 total leds) about 30% were a different shade than the rest.  Only those 30% of those were "warm white" like in the image, the others were neutral white.	-1
Keeps my gums healthy.	1
Just what I wanted !!!	1
Good buy and great product	1
We've been using the Crest Pro Health toothpaste for a couple of years now, but this is the first time we've used this particular one.  It has a mild minty flavor to it. It seemed to make my mouth feel cooler afterwards more so than the other kinds we've used. It may have been my imagination, since I was paying closer attention this time, but it seemed to foam up more than the others, too.  Overall, we really like this line of toothpaste! We like the taste and our mouth feels cleaner than when we've used other kinds.	1
I have tried three Crest Pro-health toothpastes. I am pleased with all of them including this product and I like the taste and how they make my mouth feel after brushing (though I liked this this the least of the three) but I am troubled by information on each box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave all four stars because they seem to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using them. Further the information is listed on each box under an "Other information" section rather than a "warning" section but what I read seems like a warning.  The boxes state under "Other information"  that "products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth." The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  The boxes then state "this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining."  This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him.  This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.  I looked at the ingredients on all three boxes and they seem to be the same so I am not sure what makes one better at whitening and another like this one better at gum protection. The box does say this has been clinically proven to remove gingivitis in four weeks.  I have tried the Clean Mint, Fresh Clean Mint and Invigorating versions. This had the most flavor--kind of like a very strong mint flavor. The flavor lasted longer in my mouth than the other two and I found this more harsh than the other two. It is my least favorite of the three but flavor is a matter of taste so if you like stronger tasting tooth paste you probably would like this.  If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars.	1
This toothpaste has a nice minty flavor. It cleanses well and does not irritate my mouth or gums. I like that this toothpaste helps relieve and helps prevent gingivitis because that is sometimes a problem for me. I have not had any flare ups of my gingivitis while using this toothpaste.	1
I was always jealous of my cousin, Tony. Her mother bought crest. My mom made us use pepsodent. I can remember how wonderful crest tasted. Tony and I used to sneak into the bathroom at her house, squeeze the crest onto our fingers, and eat it! Like a treat!  Fast forward many many years later and I decided to give crest a try. The idea of actively removing gingivitis made the product all that much more appealing.  After ordering and receiving the crest pro-health I noticed, while reading the label, a warning that it had an ingredient that could cause staining. I researched Pro-health and staining and decided not to eat the crest anymore! Brown teeth! Stains that need removing professionally by a dentist. The reports of stringy mouth goo and tongue numbing. Now I know you can't believe everything on the internet.. but there is a lot of scary anecdotal evidence out there, and a lot of alternative products that don't use the staining fluoride found in the crest. Personally I don't choose to take the chance and find out. This is a pass for me.	-1
I've been trying a couple of these Crest Pro-Health Clinical Series toothpastes lately, and this is my favorite so far.  It's a little stronger than the others and the taste is better - more like a paste than the others, but somewhere in between a paste and a gel.  Afterward, there is a slight aftertaste as though you just washed with Hydrogen Peroxide.  I don't think that's in the ingredient list, but something similar is there.  Price note:  If you didn't notice, these "fancier" toothpastes usually come in 6 oz. tubes instead of the common 8 oz. size.  This one is different as it is 5.8 oz.  Just food for thought.	1
My periodontist was a nice guy and all but I never liked it when he said we would be together forever.  I'm willing to make that kind of commitment to children and dogs but not a periodontist.  After listening to that four times every year, I went looking for my own solutions.  I was able to turn around a periodontal problem with two things: the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste series and my perfect special&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Philips-Sonicare-R-FlexCare-Rechargeable-Sonic-Toothbrush/dp/B00A35Q0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Philips Sonicare(R) FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush</a>.  Sadly my favorite Crest pro health morning and night toothpastes have not been readily available in my area so I've been experimenting.  The invigorating mint has a good flavor to it.  I've put it in the morning slot.	1
It's aimed at fighting plaque and gingivitis, and I can't say I've noticed anything really unique or superior about this brand than other toothpastes I've tried. But it does taste minty and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.	1
I should start by saying that this "Gum Protection" toothpaste has the same active ingredient (.454% stannuous fluoride) as other Crest Pro Health toothpaste.  I am not sure what makes it particularly good for the gums.  With that said, I like the texture of this version, which is very thick and a bit gritty, similar to the fluoride paste used by my dentist.  That taste is also strangely similar to that paste, which is a pleasant clinical mint.  I prefer the Crest Complete with Scope Outlast, which keeps my breath fresh longer, but this milder mint would be better if I was brushing before a meal.  Overall, Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection toothpaste is a good product and one that I enjoy using, but not enough to go out of my way to find.	1
Succinctly, this is an effective toothpaste. Perhaps too effective since when I leave it in my mouth too long I tend to get things that feel like dead skin that may have been scoured off my cheeks or tongue. That is my one complaint with this otherwise wonderful toothpaste. It doesn't have all natural ingredients, but if that isn't a concern then this is one of the best toothpastes you can get, especially when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Crest-Pro-Health-Multiprotection-Rinse/dp/B000NKJIXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse</a>. The combination of these two products provides a wonderful clean for your teeth and mouth. Highly recommended, but use sparingly.  ~ Kort	1
This is a toothpaste with a lot of claims, but the one I was hoping for was helping with sensitivity.  Perhaps, but even on the tube it says "Do not use for sensitivity longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist."  It doesn't say like my Sensodyne to see the dentist if the problem persists for four weeks.  Nonetheless, my dentist has handed me out samples of Crest and the toothpaste has proven to be a good one.  Just don't count on it being another Sensodyne because it just plain isn't.  The active antihypersensitivity ingredient, potassium nitrate, isn't listed.  It does make the claim that it will help reverse gingivitis in four weeks, but regular brushing and flossing should accomplish that with most any toothpaste.  The taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one, but I didn't really care for it as it's strong.  It's a quite a bit heavier mint taste than the "regular" Crest.  If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off.  I do appreciate products that aren't set to expire a month after purchase.  Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don't need or want large quantities.

I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.  I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you're rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it's worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I'm getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.  Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I'm miserable.  Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!  Procter & Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I'm not sure why a company would think it's OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that's just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.  And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don't think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I've permanently damaged my gums.  I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.  These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you'll see.	-1

worked great for sealing an old fish tank, sealing some outside fasteners as well as a few other projects.. i'll definitely be purchasing some more of this stuff.	1
Convenient packaging for smaller workshop projects, excellent physical properties. Acetoxy cure, so it has this vinegar smell and can be slightly corrosive - but that aside, it's a fast-curing, tough, thixotropic silicone adhesive that sticks extremely well in comparison to your average hardware store product - and I've been coming back to it for many years.	1
Works very well!	1
Used this in sealing up my brew kettle and many other food grade kitchen equipment in my micro brewery and it is simly the best. It can handle the heat and flexible. I will use this product for the rest of my life. Great buy!  Osceola Brewing Co.	1
Holds load pretty good. I used 2 pieces about 1.5 inch each to mount big framed picture on the wall. My son used it to organize his guitar pedals (he used to use Velcro before that).	1
THIS VELCO LIKE ITS HEAVY DUTY COUSIN IS AWSOME. BEST THIN VELCO I'VE USED. OPEN CLOSED HUNDREDS OF TIMES. AND I'VE TRYED MANY. WELL WORTH THE MONEY IN 10 FOOT ROLLS .BEST PRICE ON AMOZON.THE STRENGHT IS 2nd  to none.	1
The bracket works well, but I feel like I'm going to bend it when replacing the filter. I wish it was a little more stable, but it works well and just have to make sure I support it when replacing the filter.	1
Nice mounting bracket. Seems fairly sturdy.	1
Good bracket for light-weight filter housings.  If using on heavy filter housings one should probably use a bottom support too.	1
Bracket is made very well and included everything for installation however what I failed to see in the advertisement is that this is for the really big filter housings not the standard size units found on many RO units	1
Great wrench for the Pentek filter, but will not work on other brands	1
This is a must have for #10 big blue filter housings.  This makes screwing and unscrewing these filters housings a breeze.  The plastic is not cheap and flimsy, it is very hard and sturdy plastic.  I would recommend to anyone that is going to buy #10 Big Blue Filter Housings.	1
Very good tool to use with water filter	1
Good!	1
It's flexible a little, seems inexpensive mold injected material, we' see	1
It works.  If you have a Big Blue just buy one of these.  I have 3 BB inline and I bought one to service all 3.  It hangs on a hook near the filters.	1
I bought these for the Big blue Pentek filters I bought and they are a perfect fit. You should hand tighten the housing but it still often requires the wrench to remove. Without it you'd have to use giant channel locks to loosen the housing and that would damage it. A must if you buy the Big blue filter cartridge. Pentek is a good product and you can count on them to perform for many years,	1
goog product	1
Bought 2 as my Big Blue was really stuck. Work well. Good service quick delivery.	1
great	1
I'm going to give this a 5 star, due to quality, but do research before you order a wrench for your pentek filters.  I thought I did, but later found out that the wrench was too big for my filter.  If it would have fit, I would have been pleased.  I returned this and ordered the correct one.  I needed the SW-2 for my filters.	1
Item was as described.	1
excellent value, buy one if you need it	1
Fits my Pentek 150469 filter housing perfectly. Nice solid fit in the lugs. Use the wrench to unscrew the housing. I only use my hands to tighten the filter so it won't be stuck to tightly later.	1
HELPS KEEP NUTS FROM VIBRATING OFF MACHINERY WHILE RUNNING.	1
Does what it's supposed to.	1
Does the job.	1
Highly recommended if you are a mechanic or work on anything than may vibrate loose.	1
As advertised.	1
Great stuff for gun maintenance and repair.	1
This is such a great Tape Art Kit. My daughter and I have had a lot of fun creating things and trying all the different pieces out. The kit comes with LOTS of supplies and provides hours of fun. One of the best things about it is that the tape strips are pre-cut and make it very easy for young artists to use.	1
I'm a big fan of 3m's films for tape art. While they can be pricey, a little used in the right way can add a lot to the look of a duct tape bag or fashion accessory.  This selection has some of my favorite products in it, and they are nicely laid out in a molded plastic box. One of the negatives is that the box is pretty big for the amount of tape that comes with the kit. There are refills for a lot of the products available if you look for them, so the box can be reused.  One of my favorites is in here- the Scotch safety glow tape. It's got a gorgeous laminated glossy finish and handles weather well. I'm glad refills are available for this, and in the same size to fit the box because a roll of this bright glow tape is expensive. Plus the paper backing makes it work well for cutting shapes.  Radiant Light Film is the same opalescent effect you see on some upscale perfume boxes and other packaging, instead of being laminated to a box- it's made into a tape. It's gorgeous.  The metallic tapes are truly metallic, and I'll be buying more of those in the future for some of the projects my son works on.  The rest of the tapes, labels and things in the case are more ordinary, but it's still a good way to see how they can be used in your own projects.  All the tapes on paper backings can be used with a die cutter and small dies. That's helpful if you want to make perfect glow stars or something like that for a project.  It's a nice set, but mostly as a way to try out things you haven't tried before in tape crafting. For someone who is just starting out, I'd recommend getting a few rolls of duct tape and some hook and loop sticky back fasteners like Velcro instead.	1
I got this as I've been looking to test conditional use for various types of tapes that were available in this kit for some projects. This kit provided me with the tapes I was interested in at an amount that is appropriate to be able to test without having to buy standard amounts of multiple tapes that would cost a much higher value.  I also had some pleasant surprises in the case for other tapes that actually fit my uses better and even for uses that I hadn't considered before. Certainly a helpful kit but it does seem a bit limited in amounts of each tape to test for all conditions but it does present me with a much better working knowledge but I seem to want more of each to gain a full understanding as to if it will meet my needs for each project.  Still a rather good buy but could be better, in my opinion.	1
This Art Tape Kit is a lot of fun for the budding artist that wants to try something other than paints and pencils.  My kids had a blast creating tape crowns and tiaras, tape animals, and artfully repairing a hole in a lunch bag.  The tape is fairly sticky  more so than masking tape, but not as adherent as duct tape. The variety in this kit is surprising. It has everything from wide, bright strips, to different sized colorful dots.  Some are matte, some metallic. At any rate, there are lots of choices.  As with any art kit my kids get hold of, I wish there was more included. The box is great for storage, but we didn't need it. They used everything in a day, although thats not unusual for them. They get very excited about such things. They fully enjoyed this kit. The only thing that would have made it better for them is if there was a craft booklet of suggestions they could create. They did fine with their imaginations though and I have some beautiful tape adorning my walls.	1
This idea is fantastic,  small amounts of different types of tape as a go to kit when you need to solve a problem.  The cost is a concern but these specialty tapes are costly (for example the glow tape is 74 bucks for 5 yards, which works out to five dollars a foot and the 3M Wire Management Tapes SJ3000 is about a dollar a foot).  You are still paying more per foot for these, but you do get a wide assortment to choose from in order to solve your problem.  You can test them out to see what works. There are several different kits available.  My biggest issue is with the storage space.  Space is very tight in dorm rooms and this box has a lot of wasted empty space in it, along with not very great instructions.  The materials could be stored in something one third the size and should be labeled in some way that stays with the product (maybe in small plastic bags) if they are removable.  Dorms get touchy about you damaging the wall surfaces.  So I think this is a excellent idea, it just needs some refinement.	1
I'm disappointed in this kit. The big box is impressive, but when you open it up, you get mostly empty space. As you can see in the photos, you do get small quantities of several different types of tapes. Small quantities of tapes are hard to find in stores, which is a plus, but these products are so inexpensive to manufacture, why didn't they just give you bigger quantities? They could have tripled the quantities and still fit them in the box and still made a healthy profit. I could see selling this sampler kit for $5 in simpler packaging, but $35 is ridiculous .	-1
I really thought this would be a cool and useful item for a college student by the description. What arrived was something that I would consider a sample pack that might be given away as a promotion. I thought I was being to harsh with my first thought, so I showed it to my resident college student. She took one look at it and said, "Seriously?!!!"  So who is this marketed to? It seems like something a parent would send to their first year college student to brighten up his/her dorm room, but like many items marketed to that sect, this one is probably also going to be a disappointment and tossed aside and forgotten about.  I give it two stars because it contains tape and Command strips, so it is useful. But...	-1
One of the best Colloidal Silver gel products available anywhere. FDA approved, 55 PPM (parts per million), antimicrobial. Water soluble, anti staining, and if applied and allowed to air dry without covering, provides a clear / non-shiny protective small wound covering. Works excellent as an under bandage anti-bacterial. This product has replaced and provides better protection than the greasy neo-what-ever ointments we previously used. Package says: Lasts up to 3 days, kills bacteria, fungus, and yeast. I even used it to heal a very irritated gum in my mouth with gauze backing. Odorless / tasteless / non-stinging. Wish they sold this in larger tubes. I always buy extra to give to family & friends. We have this in our travel case. Even my MD was impressed & is OK with it. Do you own research; Colloidal Silver works.	1
I keep ordering it!!!	1
It clears my cracked lip corners quickly.  Good stuff!	1
Cheaper to  buy several . Silver is 55ppm content. Good for rashes and fungal irritations of the groin and other skin fungi and bacteria. Used it for a leg wound for my visiting nurse to heal an open sore. If you buy this pack of three, you are almost getting one tube free compared to buying three at the single tube price. A savings of $4.65	1
Small tube but safer than using antibiotic ointment all the time. Curad makes better products than J&J to use. Seems to heal things just fine including fungal rashes on toes or groin and cheaper than prescription ointments.	1
Have reordered this products more then once..must like it.	1
helps with my wound...to a point....	1
for whatever it's worth, this stuff cleared the cracked corners of my lips almost overnight - and they have stayed un-cracked!	1
Really nice for certain superficial scratches or minor cuts and rashes. When this doesn't work I still use Neosporem but this is a nice product. It is too expensive to buy at drug stores so Buying several at a time through Amazon throug Medline is the best way to buy this product. I don't know why it is so expensive?	1
I gave this 4 stars because it works as designed; the picture is clear, the scope is bendy, etc.  However in terms of utility I'd only rate it at about 2 stars. I bought this because I wanted to look inside my walls for some pipes and didn't really want to have to cut out a piece and patch it.  This tool isn't really any use for that, because once you insert it in the wall you can only see in one direction: straight ahead in a radius of a couple of inches. If you want to look left/right/up/down you're out of luck, because there's no way to articulate the camera on the end.  I suppose you could try making a hook-shape and wiggling the camera in that way and then rotate around...but even if you were successful in this dubious venture you'd again be totally out of luck if you happen to have insulation in your walls (which I do).  I'm hopeful I can find a use for this tool at some point but I'm disappointed that I can't use it for what I wanted. That's not the tool's fault (thus the 4 stars) but if I had had a better sense of its limitations I certainly would've held onto my money.	1
You can not believe how much you will use one of these things until you own one! Being able to see things in impossible places really makes my job easier.	1
It work very good, the image look fine, 100% recomended	1
Works like a charm with my MAC!	1
I had hoped that I could use this camera to just snap a shot of whatever I was looking at though the eyepiece, but as far as I can tell there is no way to set this camera so that it sees what you see - you must reframe, rezoom, and refocus everything you want to take a photo.  Also, most other USB microscope cameras I have use simply show up as a standard webcam when connected to a computer. This is nice because it does not need any drivers or software and you can do handy things like show the microscope view to someone over Skype. Unfortunately this camera need drivers and seems to only work with the specified software which is not that great.	-1
Exactly as described; quick delivery!	1
Despite what they say this ONLY works with Windows PCs.  The software for Mac and Linux is worthless.  Even if you can make it work it lacks 90% of the features of the PC version.	-1
This camera is not UVC-compatible. That is, it will not function as a generic camera device under most operating systems. It needs proprietary software/drivers to function, and they do not exist for Linux.  It also is very demanding for what it is. I was hoping that I could make a 1 photo/second time-lapse video on my old laptop (P4 1.8Ghz) but the laptop was too slow to keep up. My main computer ran a version of Linux, so it wasn't really possible to use it for time-lapse.  The image quality is poor. AmScope also makes DSLR->Eyepiece adapters. While they still have poor optics, they are much better than this camera. The lens used has a ton of chromatic aberration, which basically adds a sort of discolored halo to everything.  It also has no lens caps or anything like that. If you want the lenses covered while it is not in use, you must put it away in its product box, which is cumbersome. Maybe I want to keep it out but not damage the lens.  I will say one positive, however: It is well-machined and feels sturdy. The electronics and sensor hardware may not be terrible, but whatever quality is there is ruined by the awful lens.  Update:  So I've run into another problem with this camera. It *seems* like they intend for it to be flexible, since it includes both a Twain and Directshow driver, but there is a slight problem with both. The Twain driver always brings up a dialog and cannot be used silently. The directshow driver's problem is that it always defaults to auto-exposure. If you want to write a script that takes photos, for example, the camera will default to auto-exposure, and different image captures will have different exposure values, somehow even if the light source is constant.  This is a deal breaker for me. I need consistent exposure across photos. The viewer program that comes with it is fine and can do a standard 'time lapse' function with manual exposure, but I need something much more complex and there is no apparent way to make it work properly outside of the viewer program.  Keep in mind that the twain and directshow features are not actually very useful...	-1
Great camera, takes terrific images. I was surprised and delighted by the software - it's a great hobbyist application and could probably be used in a professional lab. Supports multiple cams, calibration for sizing, watermarks, video and image overlay. All sorts of color correction and exposure control, merging layers...and a lot more than I haven't had time to learn. I am really impressed with AmScope (I have a number of their products and they are all pretty damn awesome.	1
Nice camera but what is it with AmScope and lack of documentation? I had to find a youtube video showing how to attach the camera to the trinocular port rather than the eyepiece, otherwise it would have taken me hours to determine I didn't need any of the adapter rings. But it does work well and take clear pictures. Whomever said that blood cells were indistinguishable, you might be missing something or don't have the lense situated in the right spot. I didn't have a problem with clarity even at 100x. I am taking off one star not for the lack of instructions but for the lacking MacOS software (no video, just stills, although I knew that from an earlier post).	1
I have been using a variety of cameras for many years now and have had varied degrees of satisfaction. My reference is to use a 12M Pentax which gives great resolution but can be not as flexible as I wanted.  This unit provides high quality stills and video. The quality and presentation is first rate with exceptionally good resolution.  I have also used this for video collection which I found exception when I prepare videos for histology presentations,  The software is generally quite good and my only concern is that the software sets off warnings in Windows 7.  This is definitely one of the easiest and best I have used side from my Pentax. My only concern would be proper color capture since I will analyze pigment diffusion and need some reasonable color standard.	1
These are not the wimpy hook clips I would use on a printed circuit board these are heavy duty clips that are great for old radios with point to point wiring. These are going to first be used to evaluate the resistors in a 1954 Zenith Trans-Oceanic L600 radio. They have a nice long reach so you can get into where that part is. Great Quality.from Extech a company that some call the "Fluke" of China. I have used their test equipment for over 20 years.	1
It's about time a test equipement manufacturer did something this sensical.  I don't know how many times I've tested circuts looking for a reversed neutral on the line (most often with knob & tube) and needed to plug one of my test leads into an extension cord running to a "known neutral-ground source".  But as you might imagine, that's a very finicky setup that tends to lose its connection easily.  No more!  These Extech probe tips are roughly the same thickness and length as standard test probes.  However their blade width is about 5mm with a small detent area to catch and hold the internal prong connections.  These are oustanding for testing outlets or using outlets to get a voltage reference.  These are just a pair of probes (no leads.)  They have a 4mm male banana jack on the rear of each, so you will need a pair of 4mm male banana leads to 4mm male banana leades to run them to your DMM.  I'm using the Fluke TL224's howevr I know Extech makes a pair of leads that are considerably less expensive.	1
These are nice probes that complement the Extech TL809 lead set. In fact, my principal complaint with the TL809 lead set is that it doesn't contain such probes. Instead, it has probes with flared ends that will have limited utility in tight spaces.  The TL743 are great for such situations but have their own limitation. There is only an inch of clearance between circular disk guards and the end of the tips, so other leads may be required for deeper explorations. Longer tips would have been preferred.  The probes have very sharp ends.  Presumably, this is for piercing insulation.  They are sharp enough to pierce skin also, so be careful.  It is nice that Extech included small caps that will protect the conductive surfaces and preserve the sharp points.	1
I have used this product several times now and it has only once not held a vacuum seal and I had to reseal it.  It seems to be a good product so far.  I can't say for the longevity, but so far, so good!  As long as it continues to hold up, I would buy it again.	1
I really iike this rug and it looks well made.	1
Very nice floor mat.	1
Pros: - Reasonably priced - Size is a full 24x36, listing measurements are accurate (often size statements are wrong or exaggerated) - Tuft is very soft and has not shed a single fiber over the first few weeks of use - Doesn't slip at all on our hardwood floor  Cons: - Made in comm't China	1
This mat arrived very well put together with no loose threads or rubber imperfections.  It has held up great so far with collecting snow and water without leaking underneath.  While it does not get super-heavy traffic abuse, I see no damage to the surface after a winters use.	1
Looks nice and does a great job of keeping my hardwood floors free from outside dirt and debris.	1
We use this in our mud room - it is just the right size. The doggie door is in this room, and this mat gets lots of the water and mess off their feet.  It is easy to hose-off., But, we use it in indoors, and normally vacuum it, if it is dry.  You need a lot of suction power to get everything out, but my old Dyson does the trick using the wand.	1
Great	1
Price somewhat high but quality is good.  I've bought several of these in different sizes to use on the stained concrete floor of our house.  The rubber edge on some doesn't quite lay flat so I trim it back.  The mat is comfortable to walk and stand on barefoot.	1
Great Item	1
These have been sitting in the sun and rain since they arrived and are holding up well thus far. They swept off well with a regular broom and have retained their color - thus far!	1
Very well made and sturdy but the rubber edges are wavy which makes it look strange but it is very functional and should last a long time and I can live with the wavy edges for now at least.	1
purchased to protect my concrete driveway from oil drips and it works wonderfully for that. Good construction and lays flat. Doesn't look like garbage after getting its fair amount of drips and sitting in the sun. The backing is nice and doesn't let leaks seep through. Id imagine this would hold up well for an entry mat as well.	1
This mat is for HARD floors and works perfectly on them. It will slide around on carpet.	1
love the rags....they catch all the chips from my shop before i enter the office....	1
I have several of these in various sizes and placed in various areas around the house.  I have a stained concrete floor.  These are perfect for my use.  These mats look good, are durable and are comfortable to walk on in bare feet.	1
Perfect for my hallway. Lays flat and secure immediately and hope it will catch all the dirt and wetness during winter.	1
Works great	1
Entrance mat dark brown size 4' X 8', using mat in laundry room, in front for washer and dryer as well as back door entrance, high traffic area. Exactly what I was looking for, no grooves, vacuums up easily. Would not hesitate to roll up mat and shampoo on patio if required. Does not leave footprints only downside is dark brown color, lint shows up. Just vacuum threads, backyard grass cutting clean up quite easy, very pleased with the size, weight and quality of this mat. No problems with edges curling, the mat was delivered flat the box was not stood up on end which may cause curling on some rugs.	1
Good size for getting grit and grime off of shoes to help protect new flooring (luxury vinyl tile - has same "suggestions" for minimizing scratches by getting shoes cleaned off, or going in stocking feet or slippers.  Good quality.	1
great quality so far for heavy usage in a commercial building	1
Good tool. Easy identification the bolt and nuts so metric (ISO) and imperial (SAE) UNC or UNF.  Negative, lacks thread Pitch Gauge	1
Not a whole lot to say about these.  They are exactly as described and I found no defects in any of the washers.  Shipping was fast and the price is reasonable.	1
These are good quality washers. No complaints at all! I bought the worng size the first time, so look before you buy!	1
Item exactly as advertised	1
They're washers... consistent thickness and size. What I expected.	1
Great, high quality washers. Their ID, OD and thickness size were consistent and accurate. Great price for the product as well!	1
they do their job	1
Very good quality flat washers.  The plating is very durable, the edges are very fine, and the quality of the steel seems to be very good.  These have worked out very well in all of our applications.	1
Got these items to have when needed. Always good to have these along with other sizes in the shop when you need some for different projects. Always try to keep extras on- hand.	1
These are thick good quality washers and the zink coating seems to be well done.	1
Every time I need a washer for some project I'm working on...it seems I always either have just enough or one or two short of having enough....lol. Like to keep these.."of different sizes"...on hand for those times. Descent quality for what I need.	1
Live close enough to ocean to get salt spray. These work well outdoors, don't corrode like galvanized. Very useful size.	1
I purchased this flask to use in a halloween costume. I filled it up with glowstick fluid for my mad scientist costume. The flask performed extremely well. I was a little worried if i were to drop it that it would break and spill the neon dye everywhere, but this flask was of extremely high quality and performed beautifully!	1
Just what I expected. Packed well.	1
product as described.	1
Works well for mixing up a mini wort for proofing my yeast.	1
I love my 250mL flask. It is heavy duty and has thus far survived dry heat sterilization and wet heat (pressure cooking) sterilization techniques.	1
This is a nice heavy duty 50mL pyrex flask. I use it primarily for cell culturing of my brewing yeast.	1
I remember my 7th grade teacher using these flasks in a couple of experiment for my science class.  I needed a couple of flask and I picked these up not knowing what the other venders had to offer and not knowing what their quality. (I guess you stick with what you know).  when they showed up I was surprised to see that they were not less than what I remembered. Very sturdy.	1
I love my 125mL flask. This is a nice heavy duty flask that I used for dry heat sterilization until I could raise the money for a 23q pressure cooker.	1
Pyrex makes they're beakers slightly thicker then most so they are stronger which is idea for my purposes.  They take longer to heat and chill but strength is want I'm looking for and these r perfect.  I will and I do buy these all the time.	1
quality piece of equipment.	1
I have purchased a lot of lab glassware for home brewing use.  Many of those items were cheap Chinese factory culls, and the quality was poor.  You get what you pay for.  But this flask arrived in pristine condition.  No scratches, nicks or bubbles in the glass.  I won't feel reluctant to apply heat to this flask.  Definitely worth it to invest a little more in Pyrex-brand glassware.	1
Great quality, the real deal.	1
works perfectly for yeast starters	1
Wow, having a 2 liter flask really makes a difference!  I'd recently gotten a stirplate and it seemed to be struggling with the 1 liter flask I had.  Got this baby and boy did the yeast starter take off.  The stirplate was quieter, running on a lower speed;  and my starter was FOAMY!  This was well worth a little investment to update an old, smaller piece.	1
Great Flash. I use mine mix aniline dyes for woodworking.	1
This is a great quality, easy to clean, durable flask that I have heated to boiling temperatures, and then suddenly dunk into an ice bath without any problems. I use this to contain my yeast starters, both for boiling the dry malt extract in filtered water, which I then chill to safe temperatures and place on a stir-plate with great results. I highly recommend this for anyone in need of a good Erlenmeyer flask.	1
Flask from Scientific Equipment of Houston is real Pyrex.  The only thing I noticed is that it's 2L to the top lip, which is smaller than the non-Pyrex borosilicate flask that I'm replacing because it cracked from thermal shock.  Only time will tell if it's more durable.	1
What I got was Pyrex and it did not come broken	1
What is there to say...it's a Pyrex brand. I've purchased other brands in the past and have always been disappointed, so I purchase only Pyrex when every possible. Yes, they're more expensive, but worth it, to me.	1
Works well. a bit tricky to get my stir bar not to fling out to the side. Is Pyrex.	1
Does what I purchased it to do.	1
Very high quality!	1
Arrived in great shape.  I use mine to grow yeast cultures for brewing.	1
perfect products	1
I felt bad using our lab glassware for my starters so I decided to purchase my own Erlenmeyer flask. I was a bit worried not to receive an original Pyrex flask as others pointed out. However, I was lucky and mine is the real deal. I have already used it for my starter once and it went through the autoclave twice. The opening is not as narrow as it sounds and there's little risk spilling stuff when either pouring wort and yeast in or out. Grab one now and don't forget the stir bar!	1
nice	1
Thank you	1
Perfect for bringing a yeast colony to life.  Perfect for picking up and giving everything a good swirl to mix them up and bring them to life!  If you brew you will love the 1 litre I have 2 smaller flasks and this bigger one is the poop!	1
NO PROBLEMS	1
Thank you for the availability and keeping the cost.	1
Solid and with a strong neck. I use it for yeast cultures.	1
great product	1
good	1
Heavy duty!	1
This is an excellent product IMO.	1
Does what I purchased it to do.	1
Arrived in great shape.  I use mine to grow yeast cultures for brewing.	1
Nice flask with easily legible graduations. It is Corning, so the wall thickness is consistent from top to bottom. Sits perfectly flat on the stirring unit.	1
Item delivered on time, was as described	1
product as described.	1
I bought this to use for yeast starters in my home brewing activities.  The flask is nice, thick glass.  It seems well made and has stood up to several yeast starter cultures already.  I bought it to replace a similar flask that cracked when it fell on its side on the kitchen counter (it didn't even fall that hard...so I was really disappointed).  I think the other flask was an inferior brand, so this time I decided to go with a good genuine Pyrex one.  So far, I'm very happy with it.  It's a good size and works well.  I've used it successfully with a magnetic stirrer, too, despite its thickness.	1
Very nice flask.  Will be used a lot.  May consider other source if need several.	1
exactly what I was expecting.	1
This flask is perfect for my intended use (yeast starter). It does what it says it does. Basic, heavy-duty, Erlenmeyer flask. Great.	1
good quality, and heavy duty. I use it for yeast propagation and it works well. I also use these in my work for bacterial cultivation and they are nice for that too.	1
Not much to say about this product, it is your typically lab grade flask.  Good quality pyrex.  Does what you'd expect.	1
Works great. Save the equipment I work on.	1
This is a nice kit. I didn't notice the front third is actually a pocket, but my workstation is a little smaller so I have my pockets dangling off the side for easy storage of a multi-meter or the anti-static straps when not in use. Brilliant.  Pros:  -Durable. I was initially concerned about the build quality because there are so many poor options out there, but I can easily see this lasting years. The mat is a good-quality material appropriate for a shop, the snap fasteners for the cords are solid, and the alligator clips are good. The only cheap bit is the plastic on the anti-static bracelet, but that's an easy replacement down the line.  -Long cables of just the right weight. Sturdy but flexible, exactly the length you need to work on the mat and plenty of feed to reach a ground. Perfect.  -Pockets. As mentioned, the front third are actually pockets that also mean that portion of the mat is double padded, bonus.  Cons:  -None.  Highly recommended. Get one today, and cut that risk of frying your electronic repairs.	1
Great product well made and works well.	1
Now I don't have to have a HUGE roll-up mat for electronic house calls or working on sensitive upgrades.	1
So far so good.  I used it to build a few computers and they work.	1
Does everything it's advertised to do and does it in spades. Absolutely the best all around grease I've ever used. But be prepared if you ever use it, it REALLY stinks. Worth it, though!	1
I have yet to really test this product in actual use, but I can say two of the three containers give me issues in my grease gun. I went to the local hardware store and purchased some marine grease.,There were no issues, so I know it was not the gun. I probably paid about the same amount or a little bit more at my local hardware store, so I guess the price is okay. This is a synthetic, so it's along the lines of Mobil one and so forth to produce. I can say is a real bugger to get off your hands, which is what I would expect from a waterproof grease. So, hopefully this will do the job, but they could improve their containers to prevent them from leaking. I made a big mess out of my grease gun	-1
Great grease for your boat trailer bearings.  Keeps things rolling along.	1
GREAT FOR FARM / SEMI / BOATS	1
Well, I have no way to tell what is in this grease, but reviews seem good and I used it in my ball joints and seems to be working fine so far. I will post a follow up later on.	1
Used primarily on boat trailer wheel bearings, and boat steering linkages. Seems to be tacky enough to stay in place. Also, decided to try on mower deck wheel bushings, as attempting to use Superlube grease, was not acceptable. Continue to find uses for this like sliders on doors and the quick disconnect fittings for water hoses. Stayed on after getting wet- impressive. Good clean up and smell does not linger or is overwhelming.	1
As advertised	1
It a good grease for sure but it has a retarded opening for the top. I mean wtf why not a pull clip on it. Other than that it looks and smells like normal grease. I don't know who thinks grease smells like an air freshener.	1
I upgraded the firmware to the BenF firmware out there (one reviewer here linked to it, otherwise some Google-fu will get you there). It should be noted that the latest BenF firmware didn't work-- after uploading I was left with a white screen. Luckily it was just as easy to change the firmware a second time. I found an earlier version of the BenF firmware, uploaded it and had zero issues. This is a great little tool with reasonable battery life and good features. It's great for the hobbyist that needs to see more information on their projects than a multimeter can offer.	1
Will return	-1
Arrived on time, works as advertised.  I only test line power, clocks, oscillators, timers and generators from 0-400 Hz.  Will suit most needs for industrial, automotive and power and generation equipment. A great supplement or portable alternative to your bench equipment or as a cheap interim alternative while you are researching and saving for a bench type oscilloscope and the price is right.  I was surprised how easy it is to set up and use.  Good for beginners and project board enthusiasts.	1
A single channel battery operated pocket O-scope?  I was skeptical.  But the reviews said this thing is the trick on the average guy's test bench.  You do need to upgrade the firmware, but if you have need for this scope, you have the skills to do the upgrade.  For a single-channel unit, this scope is pretty sweet.  Where were these things back in the 70's?	1
For a hobbiest this is a great little box. It is perfect for computer hardware tinkering. Great form factor too.  But the software that comes installed is purely awful! There is a savior, though.  Search for "BenF DSO201" and download and install that instead.  It may take a little wrangling but there is a lot of discussion available on how to do it.  Once you're done the scope works extremely well.  The Micro SD card can be used to save screen shots, scope traces (as XML so you could post-process them if you are inclined), and profiles.  Saving profiles is nice so you can get back to the settings you like.  And after saving one once you can rename them to something meaningful for future use.  All in all, I'm happy with the scope.  I just wish it had come with the BenF software in the first place!	1
The USB connector on mine only made intermittent contact, so there was no opportunity to upgrade the firmware, which was difficult to track down. The target upgrade pages cited in the manual don't seem to exist. The buttons listed to one side, appearing and feeling as though they had been slightly crushed. The manual was printed in fuzzy 4-point type, and is written in truly appallingly translated English ... almost a self-parody. The whole thing is being returned.  All that aside,  it functions, if a bit obscurely. I'm sure if you're an oscope whiz it would be easier. I got it to brush up, explore further, and work on some projects. I wound up ordering the multi-channel unit ... at least if that works ok I'll get better mileage from it.  As titled ... I think I was just unlucky with mine.	-1
They are what they say they are, plain and simple. The lids fit and they hold jello shots	1
It's hard to get too excited about a portion cup.  We use them for samplers in a commercial setting.  These are fine and there's not a thing wrong with them, so 4 stars is a fair rating because I do like them.  It's also easier to get an occasional sleeve of them here on Amazon than to find them locally or order a case from Sysco or a paper supply house.	1
I recently had surgery and had to limit my intake to 2oz at a time. These were perfect. I was able to portion out a large can of soup into several small portions without having to waste anything.  They held liquids, solids, I even used them as pill carriers for a while and they were remarkably strong and held up well throughout the day in my purse.	1
Great size for jello shots. I made rainbow jello shots for a pool party.	1
I use these cups for lots of different projects. Lids snap on tight. Great for mixing model paint, small parts, collection of screws ect.	1
these are surprisingly descent cups. the lids snap on nice and tight too. they do not however handle heat well, i had protein powder in a couple of them and the lids deformed and popped off when i left them on my car dash (it was 73 degrees F outside that day though it was sunny). still, great cups, just need to remember not to leave them in the hot car.	1
I use these cups for mycology work and am very happy with them. For the record, the ones I got are absolutely 100% NUMBER 5 plastic.	1
bought these for organizing small parts and fasteners. love using these before permanently placing them in bins or using them in cabinet drawers for keeping items from sliding under separators/dividers... and... you can write on them easily for future identification... forget the Jello... it's bad for you anyway... lol... this is a much better use for them.	1
Like it. Work as advertised.	1
I got these to pack smaller items in my lunches and for picnics with the kids. So far the cups have held salad dressing, nuts, seeds, guacamole, dill dressing and small candies and I've had no problems with leaking or a cracking. They stack well and can be tucked into a purse also if you want to fill them with a nuts for a snack.	1
Perfect for a small snack for my 18 month old grandson.	1
Perfect size for Jello shots, and the lids make storage and transport a breeze.  Only downside is that the Jello doesn't release from the cups easily.	1
Got these to pack salad dressing for my salads every day.  They work great and save me having to portion my dressings.	1
2 oz Plastic Jello Shot Cups with Lids- 125ct I use them for portion cups.  Works great.	1
perfect for shots!	1
Super glue good.  Reliable.	1
A+ as advertised and doesnt dry up in tube.  I love it	1
Loctite has been my go-to glue for a long time. It will stick almost anything to anything. The only negative is that it will also stick your fingers together or to anything that you are working with. So, you have to be careful about how you use it. On the plus side, the narrow nozzle makes it possible to place the glue precisely where you want it. My latest effort has been to repair a belt buckle. We will have to see how well the Locite holds for long-term use, but so far, I am happy with the results.	1
What's to say?	1
Takes time to dry, wouldnt buy again.	-1
stickey	1
Been using a LOCTITE product for over 50 years!  Excellent brand name recognition and believe that this newer product will measure up!	1
Excellent	1
It's good stuff. I use it to hold my life together.	1
great stuff	1
Works fine, and the top is great - unscrew it and ready to use, no mess.	1
it's super glue	1
I have used this to glue everything and bought two more.  Lasts a long time.	1
I have purchased multiple brands of superglue in the past... The problem is always the same with all the brands.  I use it the first time and then I can not utilize it again!  The "cover" or "top" when replaced after the initial use becomes "superglued" to the vial/container.  Try and force it open and I habe superglue everywhere including the skin............This is the first superglue I have purchased that I have utilized more than once.  I can cover the vial with the covering, comeback, remove the covering with ease and utilize again and again.... Upto this point, I was accustomed to using superglue once and throwing away.  Who knew??  Great product	1
Awesome.  Cannot beat the price or delivery time.	1
works	1
Nice strong glue, easy to use.	1
Good price.  No issues.	1
This is hands down the best super glue you can buy in my opinion. i buy these constantly because of the bottle and the cap. They work flawlessly to seal the glue and rip it open when you twist it off. I have used Kraazy Glue and Gorilla Glue varieties and they don't compare. For instance- I tried Gorilla Glue's Super Glue last week and after the first use the bottle had completely solidified. LocTite is it for me from here on out. Just buy it and see. The bottle will literally last you till the last drop is used.	1
it works.  more surprisingly, the bottle tip hasn't sealed itself shut yet.	1
a lot of different applications and it has not disappointed me yet	1
very good glue	1
Really Nice	1
This stuff works great	1
This is the best super glue I have ever used.	1
Does what it's intended for. Definitely better than other super glues.	1
Good product, low price, shipped quickly.	1
You may say simple things for simple ppl, but I love the way this bottle's cap screws on and unscrews, it's half a rotation and tightens up nicely. Bottle is ready to go, didn't need to cut the tip of the bottle to open it.	1
Good Item	1
This product I will be purchacing again and again and aagain and again and again. Its excellent. When you tip the bottle the glue falls right out  very slowly so your project will not get ruined. Get this its worth it. Just read the instructions first and don't touch with fingers, its powerful this  glue.	1
love this stuff. It works on all but some oily feeling plastics..	1
It's Loctite and it's Cyanocrylate. A bit 'wattery' in the sense that it's not very viscous and flows quickly compared to the other gel types they have. Although that doesn't seem to affect the performance of the glue.  From what I've researched, this is your best bang for your buck on the cheap side of things. Especially if you have Prime.	1
this is probably the best super glue. I bought a second one. Works well and you can even put lid back on and use it again and again without it setting up as hard as a rock	1
Fine	1
GREAT PRODUCT-LITTLE PRICY	1
Good	1
Works Well	1
good	1
Super	1
Super big container.  Fixes kids toys, broken finger nails, etc.  Handy to have around.  Doesn't dry out or block the spout if the lid is put on correctly.	1
Tried different CA super glue like Zap from the hobby store. This seems to stick better to wood, some plastics, coated paper, and cure faster. We do a lot of paper, cardboard, wood, plastic model building and crafts. The best I've used. You can accelerate it with Zip Kicker or even just plain baking soda powder sprinkled on lightly. One thing I like about the bottle is that you can unscrew the top and push the clogged up glue out from either side with a paper clip wire. Very important, because your tip will eventually get clogged, believe me, and this way you can restore it pretty well. Eventually the plastic tip gets worn down but by that time the glue is about gone anyway. I suggest not using the cap at all unless you are transporting it or putting it away for a long time. The cap seems to clog more when the cap is attached often. We just get a little box to put it in so it can't fall over or leak, and store a couple lengths of thin wire in the box as well for reaming out the tip. I still use 5 min epoxy, 2 hr epoxy, Lexel, hot glue, wood glue for other purposes, like where I need a lot of glue, or it needs to be flexible. Super glue is not for everything. But for where I need super glue, this is now all we use. I go through a bottle every couple weeks, easily. I usually have 2-3 bottles going at once.	1
I use this for glueing 3d printed parts.  Pla and petg stop far stock within seconds with 0 residue or color!	1
Had heard of a process to repair plastic parts with mixture of super glue sprinkled with baking soda.  OMG it worked.  dried hard as concrete and the gel was easy to apply, still a bit runny on application but lots better than the liquid.	1
great product and price	1
This is the best crazy glue I've used. Sticks with little effort.	1
A+++, will buy again from he seller	1
ok	1
Works great.	1
Not sure how  you can go wrong with basic super-glue - but I am here. I have two polished stainless steel surfaces that I want to glue together. The glue NEVER hardens - or at least I gave up after 4-5 minutes of waiting. "Superglue" has always hardened within a few seconds in the past, but this product doesn't seem to do that (nor could I find instructions on the bottle of how long to wait).	-1
Very weak bonding	-1
This is a great glue. I've used it to glue an eyeglass arm back to an old pair of glasses. Works great. Highly recommended.	1
dries faster than gorilla super glue	1
I use this for all kinds of little things around the house. It works and the cap makes for less mess.	1
Just as described and shipped quickly.	1
Good.	1
This is high quality glue. It worked great for me, I especially like the precise application tip. That makes the small jobs easy to do without a lot of mess.	1
Great. Used it once. Worked perfectly. Don't know if it will last but who cares for that price.	1
Everyone wants to glue something when you have it. Works well.	1
good stuff.	1
Of all of the 'super glue' products I have tried, this is the easiest to use and most reliable.	1
Very stick super glue. It glues everything even your fingers if your not watching.	1
Superglue.	1
Product does what it was intended for and good quality.	1
I always keep a bottle at the ready. A million uses.	1
Very good quality	1
works great	1
Works great!  I used it to bond plastic together.	1
Very strong, better than super glue	1
Superglue like others I have used - dependable, tidy, closable bottle, a fair amount.	1
Best super glue I have ever bought.  The bottle design keeps it from clogging itself too.  Very nice.	1
Don't live without it.	1
great stuff -- get some	1
Killer bottle, excellent glue.	1
great	1
great	1
Best superglue ever!!	1
works very well, hasn't dried yet.	1
Two surfaces became one and are now "Lock-Tite"! My only fear with this amazing chemical is misaligning 2pieces and having to live with the jeers. 'Course I could run some on both of her lips and learn to love the silence....	1
Great product fast delivery.	1
it works just as well as any other super glue. I was surprised at how easy it was to open the bottle. Not a good thing to have in reach of kids because it was effortless.	1
Tightly locks.	1
Best super glue I ever bought. The bigger size is perfect, I use  a lot of super glue.	1
This super glue really works.  It also seals up well for storage.	1
Is what it says, use it, love it buy it	1
I bought two bottles.  One works great. The other I have to use to pair of pliers to open every time and the nozzle gets plugged?  Nice, medium viscosity glue with good working/cure time.	1
Used this glue before, works like it is supposed to, and better than having to run to the store.	1
it's super glue. get it?	1
Great "Add on" item that you always need!	1
I had a real hard time trying to unattach my fingers, EXCELLENT product works quickly and drys fast.	1
This is one of my go-to glues when I need just a standard liquid glue that dries fast and works reasonably well.  The Loctite Professional is a great Super Glue. It is quite strong, it dries quickly (and almost clearly), it is reasonably priced relatively to the quantity per-tube, the applicator/cap system works very well, and it does a good job at bonding to most any surface provided it is cleaned before application. That makes a great general purpose glue to have around the house given there are thousands of uses for this glue.  As this is general glue, it's NOT a good choice for applications needing high-strength, the ability to withstand significant shock, or seeing very extreme temperature fluctuations. For such purposes, I generally use a steel epoxy such as JB Weld (as much as I like Loctite's Super Glue and Threadlockers, I do not like their epoxy at all).	1
Instant adhesive - works with most surfaces except metal!	1
With my hobbies I've tried many brands of ca glue including some very expensive boutique brands (don't waste your money). Most super glues have the same problems -- takes too long to bond, doesn't hold for long, the cap glues itself on, the cap plugs with super glue, the glue hardens in the container ... I've thrown away more ca glue than I've ever used.  Loctite Pro is the real deal and performs exactly how you'd expect a super glue to perform. I've used it on a variety of materials and it actually does bond in a few seconds. I've left the lid off, left it tipped over (lid on), left it outside, left it in freezing temps, in super hot summer temps and through all that the lid has never glued itself on, the applicator has never plugged, and the glue hasn't hardened inside the container. And one last thing -- I've never glued my fingers together because the container or applicator leaked. This is awesome stuff.	1
This is heads and tails above your standard "super glue" ... it even works on plastic eyeglass frames.  And this bottle just goes on and on, making it worth the price.	1
Excellent glue, I use it everything from wood, plastic, metal car parts. Every one should have some of the glue on hand for emergencies.	1
easy to use, holds fast and fast...Recommend keeping this around....You never know when you might need...Doest dry up in the bottle...	1
This product is a great, fast drying, strong super glue.  It has a long tip for precision application and a cap for storage.	1
fantastic product. I have none to add to this original developers of the first Super Glue(crazy glue). German quality=satisfaction guaranteed, plus its reusable bottle state of the art itself ;)	1
Over the years I've tried many different "super glues", the Loctite has always seemed to hold the best with fewest issues.  I needed to glue the soles of several Nike jogging shoes - they just don't make them the same anymore.  The Loctite worked perfectly, all the spots of pulling apart tread seemed to hold well within a few minutes. The Loctite goes on very thin without squeezing the bottle so be careful of runs.  Cyanoacrylate. For Metal, Wood, Leather, Rubber, Paper, Ceramic, and Plastics. Claims to work on even "hard to bond acidic surfaces." States not for Styrofoam, foam, foam rubber, polyethylene, nor polypropylene.  Per the instructions, press parts together 15-30 seconds. Try not to disturb at least 10 minutes and a full cure is had in 24 hours.  NOTE: The package states if fingers are glued to use cooking oil and gently rock or peel the fingers apart - DO NOT PULL - as presumably this could rip the skin.  Loctite Products Customer Service is 800-624-7767. Made in Ireland for Henkel Corporation.	1
It arrived today via the USPS, in a plastic bag, plus each container was in it's OEM packing The seemed good and I immediately sealed up one of those painful skin cracks	1
These paper towels feel like 1 ply.  They do not even compare to Bounty.  And of course these are the same price as the larger, thicker paper towels I purchased on Amazon for 8 years. I would much rather pay a little more for the better quality towels.  I  am just plain sick and tired of the lower quality merchandise that has swept through our country in the past decade.  These are a waste of time and money and I am very disappointed. I will never purchase these again.	-1
We have a very active home with friends and family using our blacksmith metalshop, garage, and our barn full of horses. I don't want to use our fancy guest towels and have them ruined, and a roll of paper towels always ends up wet on the bottom or finger prints all over the top.  I do not want to drill into any walls for a dispenser or roll holder so I use a top load attractive sheet holder for these such as this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Z35CQ8 These are very sturdy but yet absorbent and comfortable.  Not crinkly and hard and like out of a gas station.  They have a lovely design imprinted into the towel as well.  Very happy!	1
Good amount for the price. Effective.	1
very good very fast thank you	1
What is there to say?  They're nice paper towels, and it's extremely convenient to order from Amazon.	1
GOOD	1
These towels work very well for me in both the kitchen as well as the work shop. When needed, I will order these again	1
Almost zero lint "shed" from these paper towels.  I utilize these towels for cleaning glass and mirrors or anywhere I do not desire the deposition of lint particles.	1
Excellent	1
Since trying to find other paper towels, I have now upgraded to four stars this product as most other products shred and fall apart with bear usage. After using most of the competition, this is the best product I found to keep by my sink.	1
These are narrower than my machine. I have other C-folds from other companies and will use them instead.	-1
Nothing much to say we use this dispenser system on our porch for convenience of cleanup.  Nothing fancy about them.  They do the job.	1
performs as expected	1
Excellent-highly recommend seller A+	1
As described!	1
Good hand paper towel	1
Great deal	1
Great value, and great towels.	1
good price and quality, subscription-ordering cheaper and easier than driving to the local warehouse store.	1
Works good for our warehouse needs, have purchased these a few times. Easy choice for restroom dispenser	1
Great price and quick shipping	1
They work and they are cheap. Use them for cleaning and they don't fall apart.	1
Good price on an efficient product.  Much cheaper than paper towels.  Free shipping with Prime.  This is a good deal.	1
Great value and each box lasts me almost 2 months. I reorder these all the time. I also bought a dispenser and now I never have to deal with tearing off to many towels ever again. One towel at a time saves waste and is so convenient whet one hand is occupied or both hands are soiled. You never have 15 towels unroll when try to rip one off.	1
Georgia Pacific calls these "Premium" paper towels. If these are premium I would sure hate to see what they would call every day or standard. They are great for checking the oil in your car.	-1
What can i say about paper towel.....? Its good. It dries your hand. It cleans and pick up the spillage...whatever else you read...hmmm...its just paper towel..you cannot go wrong! Great price and great quality...	1
good bargain	1
Good buy when you consider how much rolls of paper towels are now and how much waste there is in a roll of towels. When your family pulls on a roll of paper towels and they get more than they need. When you have the dispenser that goes with these it's awesome. One towel is all you get when you pull these out of the dispenser. Good buy.	1
What we needed	1
Fantastic! Exactly what we needed! Quickly shipped, as described. Will buy again!	1
Works perfectly with the Bobrick B-262 dispenser sold by Amazon. A decent and affordable towel for use in a comnercial setting. They are a little thin so we are tending to pull two of them to dry our hands, the reason for the one star deduction.	1
Perfect for kitchen use. These pull down the next towel everytime. The 23000 will need to be plucked out. These are good quality and will save a ton of money vs store bought paper towel rolls. The baby can not run down the hall with these.	1
working good	1
These towels are more absorbent than others we have used. They fit our dispensers better since they seem to be slightly larger. We have purchased these both from Costco.com and on Amazon.com depending on who had the least expensive pricing at the time we order. We do recommend these.	1
Paper absorbs well and has a great feel to it.  Doesn't feel like sand paper.  Two sheets does very well after washing hands for completely drying your hands.  Bought this for a restroom in a cigar shop.  Now I'm getting a second one for my garage.  It is great paper towels and the dispenser for it is inexpensive and works great too.  No complaints from the ladies either.  they were affraid it was going to be like sandpaper.  they said coodo's on the towels.  Most places have rolls of sandpaper.  Hapy ladies, husbands get to come back more often!!	1
Very good deal. Softer than I thought they might be and more absorbent than I thought as well. I actually like them better than your standard paper towel rolls, much less lint than other paper towels when used for cleaning.	1
How old is that small ASA CO dot detector?  Would you notice it had turned darker if you already had a heavy dose of CO in your system?  How could you even tell if it is working, anyway?  Would you ever see it change if flying at night?  This handy sensor is a powerful tool that sports a real-time digital readout and audio/visual alarms if CO levels get too high.  It has a good battery life and is an indispensable tool for safe GA (general aviation) flight.	1
Pretty neat device. It's easy to use, the countdown to shut it off is good to prevent it from accidentally being powered down. It seems to be accurate. One feature they should advertise more prominently is that this will operate non-stop on the battery for 2-4 years. It uses a CR123 battery which is only a few bucks to replace, so you might as well just leave it on all the time.	1
Top quality product. Sensorcon customer support is excellent. Personal thank you to Calen D.	1
My husband starts many of his conversations with me by saying "On the last episode I saw of 'Monsters Inside of Me',".... and him telling me about buying this detector started out that way too. He saw an episode where there was a married couple who were chronically ill for years before finding out it was due to a small carbon monoxide leak that their "normal" carbon monoxide detector bought at a local hardware store wasn't detecting. So now we have this and we keep it in the basement so we can check on our gas appliances now and then and keep his mind at ease. Being able to see the actual number reading instead of relying on the potential amount of carbon monoxide leaking to be enough to set off a standard alarm is a very nice feature to have. We just moved into a new (but older) house and will be glad to have this tool to add to our arsenal when we start needing to use the furnace this winter and want to make sure everything is in perfect working order. We have only had this for a couple of days so far, so I can't speak to it's longevity but I will update this if it stops working at any point.  Also verified it actually detects CO by putting it in the stream of the car exhaust, causing it to go nuts rather quickly. This doesn't definitively confirm that it can detect the lowest of the low CO amounts that it was purchased for, but I am not equipped to do such tests. Can't find the aerosol cans filled with low PPM CO like I'd like to.	1
A little pricey, but works well	1
I needed this contactor for a project I built from scratch.  It runs the 5500 watt heating element for my beer keg boiler.  I use an adjustable SSR to control the heating element power but the SSR only controls one leg of the hot power, when I shut it off there was still power to the other leg. So I used this contactor wired in to the control for the SSR.  Now when I shut the SSR down, this contactor shuts down all power to the heating element.  Which is good because I am boiling wort, which is liquid, and I am not a big fan of energized liquid, having been shocked a few times over the years.  Not that much fun.	1
Powered up contactor  using ac power cord and jumper clips for testing , contactor closed smartly, ohms reading across closed contacts, using Fluke  87 V  multimeter  .2ohms, think I am going to be very happy with this contactor as a remote switch for my Harbor Freight  dust collector.	1
Good!!!	1
as described	1
Works great, and the contacts appear to be silver plated, thus extending their operating life	1
Works great. Very low current drain. Does not heat up with prolonged use. Easy to wire.	1
Checked against three other gauges for accuracy at 10 psi the gauge read 17. Consistent error made me remove needle and reset it to zero, but haven't checked it again. When received the faceplate mounting screws were loose and one of them was laying in the bottom of the plastic lens. Plastic housing, internal bourbon(sp) tube appeared to be OK but I wouldn't purchase another from this Zen-Tek manufacturer.	-1
it's ok	1
Very nice display.  Large numbers are visible from a distance.	1
Made so cheap. I bought two and they feel apart in my hand.	-1
A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT THAT WORKS GOOD.	1
works as listed	1
it works	1
used to replace cuircut board and works good. way cheaper than instore	1
Does the job. Good price.	1
Works great and easy to use.	1
hey finally a good supply in this tube and it works great	1
Awesome product, price and quality!	1
Review update. This is not the same as the old white junk as I originally thought, I jumped to conclusions. This stuff actually works great and is what I use for 90% of my work. I still use the Silver for items that are known to have overheating problems (PS3, xbox 360, laptops from the "Vista era", etc) but for the most part I use this stuff on most of the computers that come in and I do not have any issues with it at all and it saves me money. This is a reason I try to keep things for a while before I write a review on it but I did not do that this time and actually forgot about it until the comment.	1
The product itself is basically very good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Basically the packaging I received was the syringe in a ziplock back inside a large padded envelope - and the tip of the syringe arrived broken. I managed to use it for the projects I needed it for, but I wish the syringe would still be intact.	-1
Received a Cuisinart CWC-1200 wine fridge from a relative because it stopped working.  Used this when replacing the peltier in the fridge.  Product worked as expected. I received quite a bit more than I needed for my project.	1
If you do any rework involving BGA chips ex:Xbox,PS3 or laptop mother boards,This is the best thermal grease period. Heat transfer is excellent.	1
This thing is huuuuuge! I though it was the regular sized thermal paste tube, but when I got it, It was a giant syringe full of artic silver thermal compound. I haven't used it yet on my CPU, but I already know that artic silver is an excellent thermal compound. Just wanted to leave some feedback about the tube size	1
This syringe should allow you to install a good number of processors for the money. There's not much else included with the product, but if you go to the manufacturer's website, there are detailed instructions for this particular product based on each and every type of CPU. They explain how to apply it, how much to apply, and what the heat transfer properties are. This particular compound has a break in period and does best with cycles of on and off to allow it to heat up and cool down before you get optimal heat transfer. From the start, the thermal transfer was pretty good. As time goes by, I'll continue to monitor the processor's temperature. If what the manufacturer says is true, I expect the processor temperature to go down over the next few days to several weeks under similar loads. If not, I'll update this review to reflect that.	1
I have tried all sorts of other products on the market. Some barely work, but comparing this product to the next best thing (my opinion and tests) the result is that using this product greatly increases the efficiency of the heat transfer and for the types of server product my small business creates, it reduces the CPU temperature by 2 to 8 Degrees Centigrade compared to the next best thing and does not deteriorate with time.  You only use this stuff once. Yes it is expensive, in fact probably the most expensive on the market, but compared to a $450 CPU it is peanuts so if you want great performance and long life from your CPU, use the best. I never use anything else.	1
Worked fine. No issues. The tube is nice for controlled application without being messy like those that come in small plastic bags.	1
Solidly constructed, easy to mount.  Ball swivel allows for decent range of adjustment.  Bought two to help my wife navigate through a tight space into our garage.  Just now installed so can speak to long term durability.  Initially I don't see how they could fall apart or the glass shatter without some kind of climate extreme or vandalism.  I would recommend adding a second lock washer so that you have one on each side of the metal bracket.  Mirror comes with just one.	1
Glare isn't too bad on these and it really provides a clear picture of what's around the corner.	1
This mirror is exactly what I needed to gauge how far we were pulling in to our home garage.  In order to install it at the desired angle, I did need to bend the mounting arm a bit.  Fortunately, the metal is thick enough to be sturdy while still being a bit bendable. We're very happy with the quality and finish of this mirror.	1
I tried putting across the street so we could get out of our blind driveway without getting slammed. It isn't nearly big enough for that distance. To be useful, the mirror would have tone twice the size. Just one of those ideas that didn't pan out.	-1
for homeschoolers....if you home school make sure you have the right supplies for your children! It makes all the difference!	1
Exactly what I needed for flower vase inserts!	1
The covers don't fit, but if you don't need covers - e.g., for performing urine strip tests - they're fine.	1
I was using these for sample gathering with 8-10 year olds. Perfect for that task. They are water tight, easy to seal, and have a reasonable wall thickness.	1
nice quality	1
Works fine for our little man's science experiment.	1
Used these for mixing some watercolor cakes. No leaks, they worked just fine. Would also be cute at halloween with jello shots	1
I did not have high expectation when I ordered these. It seemed like a bargain for four of them. I have used Colgate toothbrushes before but none that made me a fan to buy it again.  I use a Sonic Care daily but sometimes when I am tired I like to use just a standard toothbrush. When I opened these I was shocked at how well they felt in my hand. They are very thin in the handle area. I have rather small hands and they fit perfectly. Some toothbrushes are too thick and I have a hard time holding them. Besides feeling good in my hands it also brushes very well. I have been using mine nightly for over a month now. The first one still looks unused. Sometimes though instead of replacing the toothbrush I might put it in the top shelf of the dishwasher to get it clean.  Very happy with this toothbrush, I love the feel of it in my hand and it cleans my teeth very well. I don't think I will run out anytime soon but if I do I have three more as backups. They are also handy if you have a guest dropping by.	1
I am a prolific toothbrush buyer. One word why: Grandchildren. How they can lose so many is beyond my imagination, but they do. Plus I'm always sending toothbrushes home with them. I liked that these came in a four pack. the full head is nice for brushing both adult teeth and the littler children's teeth. I found the medium bristles to be just right. Not too hard for my aging gums and the kids young gums, but not too soft that you feel like the toothbrush didn't do its job.	1
I have a Sonicare at home, but I have these toothbrushes for my office. They are very inexpensive yet, they are very good toothbrushes. They are a good value, as they don't cost a lot, but they are still very good and higher quality.  They have a nice well designed grip that holds well, even with wet hands.  These are full size heads and comfortable to brush with as well. I keep a few of these in the guest bath as well.  The medium stiffness is right for me and my teeth and $7 is a years supply. For a manual toothbrush, you can't go wrong with these.	1
"So Brain, what are we going to do tonight?"  "Well, Pinky, we're going to take over the world with cheap toothbrushes. You see, the world's economy is actually based on three things, the price of an egg, the price of a chicken, and the cost of a toothbrush. If we can disrupt the currency by injecting the market with the best toothbrushes at the cheapest prices, we can swoop in and control the whole economy."  "Egad Brain, that sounds so devious, but how will get people to buy the cheap toothbrushes? If they don't cost much, won't people just think they're bad toothbrushes?"  "Why yes, Pinky, that could be a problem--a problem that is no match for my superior intellect. We will simply put them out under the Colgate brand name, a brand everyone trusts. And we'll actually make them wonderful toothbrushes. They'll cost about a dollar each in a multi-pack. Everyone will buy them up, nobody will buy expensive toothbrushes with silly features, and the whole nation will fall right into my hands! Bwa-ha-ha-ha, Bwaaa-ha!"  "Zorts Brain, you're so smart!"	1
This is a really good value for a set of four toothbrushes. I liked the toothbrush just fine, they seem to work just as well as any other (save for a Sonicare or other electric toothbrush). I have a smaller mouth and found the size to be just right. These toothbrushes are very basic, no frills, but the price is so very good that I can't not recommend them.  My favorite manual toothbrush was a rubber gum massaging addition on the back of the brush head, and I really like that addition. These brushes are very basic, but they do the job just fine and what a great value!	1
My prior Oreck died when our house got flooded last year. It was about 10 years old and still going strong. I did a fair amount of research, and tested some of the Dyson vacuums and a couple of other brands. But, at the end of the day I still think a bagged vacuum cleaner has better suction (and keeps your house cleaner) than the bagless models. I also like that I can service the Oreck at my house because its design is very straight-forward and simple. For example, cleaning out the interior tube every year or so will make a big difference, as will getting all the hair off the beater brush.  It is really light, it lays down flat so cleaning under things is easy, and it has a long and durable extension cord. It is a quality product, and Oreck has always provided us with good customer service.	1
My wife loves it! Need I say more!	1
As described.	1
The light weight and small footprint for easy storage were what first attracted me, but it's the cleaning power that really won me over. This machine has gobs of vacuuming power!  This even cleans the short-pile industrial carpet in our workshop. That "carpet" seems to trap debris like no other, but this Oreck does the job well. I'm now a convert to bagged vacuum cleaners. Our last 3 uprights were bagless, didn't clean very well, and weighed a ton. I'm glad I switched! Note: I bought this at Amazon because of the lenient return policy. I just wasn't sure of my purchase decision, and wanted the ability to return the machine. No way is this going back to Amazon. I love it!	1
Works as expected	1
I've tried this on two PCs, one windows XP and one Vista, and neither worked.  The cd that came with the camera was blank, and there were no instructions for downloading the required software.  A few hours searching for drivers was not much help.  On my vista machine I was able to use it briefly, before the video degraded and it stopped working entirely.  This is a very generic, no name piece of flea market equipment, and I could not find any manufacturer name, or other piece of identifying information. If it had worked, that would be fine for my purposes, but the hassle is not worth it. I will be attempting to return and then spend a few more $ for a better product.	-1
GREAT PRODUCT. CHEAPEST ONLINE	1
I have only used this to look behind walls thus far, but it has done it's job to my expectations. The image quality is not superb, but it is very good for the price. I had a little trouble at first finding software to simply view the feed on my laptop screen, but found some free webcam applications that worked pretty well. It works well as shipped, but can be customized to your needs through "modifications" (ex: make it bendable like stiff copper wire, add mirrors, etc).  Notes: * Light has a dimmer wheel, but only seems to have a few levels of brightness. Not an issue for my use case. * Light works well when the camera is near the object you are viewing, but is not bright enough when trying to look further ahead. This causes me to "lose track" of where my camera is behind the wall periodically, but is only an annoyance. * The wire doesn't want to be straight (it's shipped coiled and is not a "bendy" type wire), so it was difficult to pass it straight behind a wall. I pulled apart a wire coat hanger and attached it to the end to solve this one.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would purchase again. It's not as good as a $150 inspection camera, but the price is right. :)	1
This is an awesome tool for the price, particularly if you have a laptop you can use it in conjuction with. It's cheap enough you don't have to worry about damaging it or loosing it yet very versatile. Mostly I've used it to diagnose drain issues but if you're imaginative you can find many other uses. Don't forget about the adjustable LED control, its so small its easy to miss but really allows you to get a good picture.  Try using this with some different programs, VLC, RsCap, etc...until you find one that works well with it.	1
A surprisingly crisp clear picture. I had no problems with glare from its LEDs on the plastic camera cap. However based on another review I popped the cap off and prefer the picture without it. The camera is not a low light camera but with LEDs on I could read very small text on my other wise impossible to read computers labels/chips, an unexpected use but so handy it is something I will use from time to time.  First thing I had to do is mark  "camera top" so I could aim it.  The camera drivers are standard and work with my video/time laps computer program. No drivers to load.  The small program that comes with the camera has full screen monitoring but its manual capture option  was to klunky for me. Still it is useful software to monitor if you do not have something better.  My intended use for this camera is poked through a sump pump cover so I can see if water is rising to close to ground levels without opening the heavy covers.  I used an extremely expensive (and very accident prone) version of this device at work and except for a fish to move it around this device can do about the same thing for many thousands less. However it can only go 15 ft unless you modify its USB end, that is bulky and has the light control on it.  I bought 2 so I guess I recommend it, but I'm not sure what I would recommend it for??	1
While I haven't had the opportunity to use it in a "real" activity, my testing of the camera demonstrated that it will be a invaluable asset to my toolbox.  Can't beat the price.	1
It connects to laptops or desktops running windows and linux. My only regret is that I got the shorter version that was 15-16 feet. It does work great as advertised. After some use it turns out the lens is cheap plastic and breaks easily. However it did last a while, so only one star lost.	1
This is an amazing device. I lost my power bank in the headliner of my minivan (don't ask). It's dark up there and there's not much space. I simply put this camera up there and I could see as far as the next obstruction. Lighting is very good. Clarity is excellent.  The endoscope comes with a mini CD, but I didn't use it. My Windows netbook doesn't have a CD drive, but any camera software will do.  I do wish the cable had some stiffness. It's like a limp rope. If I need the camera to go anywhere but down, I need to attach it to something stiff. Except for the short endoscopes, I think they're all like this, so maybe that's just an impractical wish.  I never did find my power bank. It must be stuck in some crevice, but at least now I know it's not anywhere within easy reach.	1
It's clearly not the $2000 endoscope they put down your throat, and it's sort of hard to control and adjust, but when you absolutely have to get a look at something that you ordinarily wouldn't be able to - this is the trick.  I was able to fish it into my A/C in my truck to get a look at the evaporator coil - pretty cool....  I'm sure I'll get lots of use out of this in the future :)  Makes a semi decent web cam too :)	1
Product is as described. Connected Win 7 installed it with no cd.  The camera is large. The cable is soft. The brightness adjust does little. Picture is very low res. Does not look waterproof, and not willing to try.  Oh, and the cd was blank.  Would not buy another.	-1
I wanted this thing so that I could see down inside my engine in several places. Video quality is so poor, that even looking at a label for a part number is difficult. Any dark colored surfaces, even with full brightness of the L.E.D.'s is impossible to see as well from any distance of more than 1/2 inch away (very out of focus at this distance). Bright 'sunny-day' daylight is needed to see things well with this camera, and in a tight, semi-dark spot, its useless. Also the end with the camera is as big as a persons thumb. Ironically, the camera inside is no bigger that the nice thin cable, but the brass piece is just too big for its own good. I use this thing now as a 'Backing-up' camera on my truck for fun sometimes, or to look under my couch at the house, but other than that, its useless.	-1
The focus lens is for very close objects to the camera. Hard to see things a few inches away. Still does the job though!	1
I needed a way to look inside a hole on the front of an engine still mounted in the car.  I couldn't get my head in between the engine and the radiator to do it.  I tried mirrors, digital cameras and cell phones all to no avail.  There are very pricey inspection cameras available from makers like Dewalt and Milwaukee, but I hated to spend $200 for something that I would only use occasionally.  I found this camera on Amazon and it worked perfectly for what I wanted.  Read the other reviews and you will learn that if you take your time with it and don't get in a hurry, it will work well.  The included software program worked well on my old Windows XP netbook and on my Windows 7 laptop.  For $25 this deal can not be beat.  I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.	1
Very nice digital calipers. I have an old vernier caliper (that requires you to divide things by 128) that didn't get used much. Cannot believe how much I use this tool now. It looks and feels well made and there's no question in my mind about its accuracy - highly repeatable results. I like the fact that merely moving the thumbwheel turns on the display, even though there's an on/off switch. Zeroing the unit is simple and believe it or not, the thumbwheel movement/sensitivity is able to deliver 0.0005" resolution. Comes with a sturdy plastic case and a clever depth stand which has it's own little pouch. The carved foam placeholder inside the case even has a spot for an extra battery (an extra wasn't included). I think this will be around for a long time and will get more than its fair share of use. There are other units that cost 4-5 times more than this. Cannot understand what could be worth that (other than a factory-certified calibration, I guess) for shop/household use. Would highly recommend.	1
These are not Mitutoyos, but then again they are only half the price of Mitutoyos. Perfectly acceptable quality for general home shop work, and not junk. Comes with a very nice case and a depth-measuring bracket thingie.	1
I have a 16 year old digital caliper that is starting to show it's age and sometimes won't respond. I have so far purchased 3 different digital calipers to try and come close to my original no name calipers. All have disappointed in multiple ways such as quality of build, accuracy, ease of use and overall functionality.  I ordered this pair based on the reviews and I must say that so far it's better than my original that cost me $125.00 some 16 years ago.  Some notable items include the tightness of it, zero slop in the fit and as anybody knows this is important for accuracy. It rolls back and forth smoothly, also a plus for accuracy. And the buttons are not a soft contact like say a TV remote, they have a tactile click when you press them. And the screen is larger (bigger than my old one) and very clear and easy to read (at least until I get a chance to scratch it up a bit).  It comes with a nice case but for my use it will rarely be in it. If you keep your's in the case you will see the hinge is real with a metal pin (not hinged plastic) and the latches slide to lock it closed (again not hinged plastic). The hinged plastic stuff always breaks after a few dozen uses.  It takes the larger CR2032 battery which means I should be good for a year without changing it.  The one thing I am not super happy about is the lock knob (to hold the caliper in a fixed position) is short and a bit hard to twist tight (digs into fingers a bit). My old one was more than twice the height and easy to tighten. I do use this feature a lot so if I can't get used to it I may have to fix that (luckily I have a 3D printer that will help).  Also the depth gauge is a small hardened pin while my old one had a very robust rectangular rod that was very thick and never bent even with all my abuse. I am not sure the thin pin will fare as well but only time will tell.  Overall, if you are not after a $100+ to $300+ Starrett or Mitutoyo then this one is a no brainer.  I will update this review if I find any shortcomings in the future but for now, I am a happy camper.	1
buttons are solid clicking buttons not rubber squishy buttons. The depth pin is .060 and round which is the only reason I bought these to begin with. The depth bracket is solid and locks very well. Overall it's worth the money. My only complaint is that the manual tick marts are little ovals and not anything that might actually be useful. I'm nit-picking but to me it's something that I can use to assure me that my caliper is measuring properly.	1
Been using for a couple weeks.  Set zero exactly once.  Always returns properly. Happy with the tool.  Only minor gripe is the case.  Doesn't hold the caliper securely.	1
This is the purest orange oil you can buy. It has so many uses that I will probably have to buy more soon. Thank you for making it so affordable.	1
good product quick delivery	1
Just got this. Seems like a quality product,  and at a very competitive price. The company also seems to be very service oriented.  They filled the order quickly & got it to me several days ahead of the estimated delivery date. Well done!	1
I purchased this product for dissolving HIPS plastic, and I can say it accomplishes the task.  While some people find the citrus scent pleasant, I feel it smells like inexpensive cleaner after a while.	1
We use d-Limonene as the active ingredient in home made flea spray for our dogs.  It's very safe and does as good of a job as pesticide.  You can dose as often as needed with little to no side affects and no toxicity to dogs.  It is not safe for cats who can't digest it if ingested.  But for dogs ITS THE BOMB!   We also use it as a general purpose cleaner degreaser where its also the best.	1
Since we cannot deal with shipping packaging or delivery times here, let me say only don't be in a rush as I was.  I had a pure tung oil project I needed to get done.  BUT, when I pay for an gallon, I expect a gallon--not 3-1/2 quarts--or less.  It was obvious!!  Look at the side of your bottle.  Each quart line is 2-1/2 inches.  It was, maybe, an inch over the 3 qt. line.  And, this is the place where the jug starts to narrow.  At more than $40/gal. (with shipping), I expect to get what I paid for!	-1
CLP just like you used to keep in your butt stock, only a larger bottle. If you served (and cleaned a weapon) then your familiar with this stuff. Works as advertised and preserves your rifle to last.	1
I love this cleaning oil. It real doe the job!	1
Use this all the time and its a very good cleaner and lubricant.  I have had no issues with this product at all.	1
good stuff - no smell - works great:  1. heavily swab your bore 2. let sit while you clean other parts 3. quick brush 4. swab bore multiple times until clean and dry 5. wipe down cylinders, slide, etc. with a saturated patch 6. dry with rag 7. back in the range bag or holster done!  a little bottle will last a long time and you won't catch h-e-double-hockey-sticks from the wife unit like you would if you were using Hoppes	1
Great for rubber gaskets	1
Saw this being used on my favorite You tube gun channel and tried it.  It works better than Hops 9 and until I found BALLISTOL MULIT PURPOSE CLEANER AND LUBE, I used it all the time. Now i use Ballistol as it is less expensive and comes in a hand pump container so you don't waste the liquid in the can when the gas leaks or runs out.  Both do a great job cleaning my firearms.	1
satisfied	1
works fine on all my guns.	1
IS an awesome product...i.e. NOT my 1st can. Discovered by a chance try, that it also works well on cookware bottoms (only) hat have been directly placed on hot coals while camping ! It makes sense, as the coals residue is carbon (for the most part) , like the residue in your gun barrel !	1
CLP always worked when I was in the military, and it still works great. I bought this for my range bag cleaning kit. Its small size makes it easy to carry around without taking up a lot of space. I keep it in a zipper stype plastic bag with my boresnakes and it makes the perfect traveling cleaning kit.	1
Great for my guns.	1
After hearing about CLP on Tom Gresham's show and reading positive online reviews, I ordered it and have been using it for about a year.  As far as basic quality is concerned, it meets a number of Federal standards, and is often requested by individual military users. It has adequate viscosity to remain where it is applied, leaves a thin, barely damp film and is easy to remove when necessary.  It is far less aromatic than other cleaners, solvents and lubes, making it "in the house friendly". Cleaning interior bolt/receiver/trigger parts can be done by applying CLP, brushing deposits if necessary, let sit and wipe clean. For cleaning the gun bore, I use a Boresnake dry, then run patches with CLP through the barrel till they pass thru clean  (number of passes depend on ammo cleanliness and number of rounds fired).  I usually shoot 50-100 rounds per gun per trip to the range, so higher usage may require additional attention	1
Great one stop shop to clean and lubricate your guns. Any seasoned shooter would say the same thing.	1
I hace always used this to clean all my guns. Works very well.	1
great cleaner Lubricant for any Machine	1
CLP is highly rated for use for cleaning AND lubing guns and usually costs more than what this cost me on Amazon.  Ive got no complaints.	1
I've been using this stuff primarily on guns and bicycles for decades. One container goes a very long way, especially if you use a precision oiler such as the Gaunt Industries HYPO-350 available here on Amazon. A superb value.	1
Good stuff! The best!  I do a lot of target shooting and this small can fits nicely in a small case.	1
Just a good job	1
Good product.	1
I had to do a brake job on a friends car and picked this up at the last minute.  I was out of the brand I have used for years.  It worked very well.  The bolts that wouldn't budge came right off after spraying them down and waiting a few minutes.  It also did a great job in cleaning up the calipers and brackets.  With 80,000 miles on the car, the brakes looked brand new when I finished.  I had to show my work off when she came back to get her car.	1
Great	1
C'mon, don't limit yourself to just cleaning guns......this stuff is awesome at lubricating and protecting bike chains, scooters, skateboards and other recreational toys!!!  I've been using it for months without detrimental results.  Chains stay cleaner alot longer.......luv this stuff!!!!  Highly Recommended!!!	1
I use this where I need more lubrication as with door locks and where I cannot get grease to the surfaces I want to lubricate. I prefer wD40 for simple rust and corrosion and other products for areas that have rusted together. What I like about the Break-Free lubricant is its viscosity that allows it to flow into areas while not being too thin to provide much in the way of lubrication (as with WD40.	1
Great Product	1
I've been out of the country and upon arrival back home yesterday, I opened this and found I received LP, not CLP.  Now, Amazon KNOWS that they are shipping the wrong product but they won't refund because of the time between ordered and wanting to return is more than a couple weeks.  That's just plain bull.  Amazon is not doing themselves any favors or winning customers when they deliberately deceive the buyer and ship something other than what they ordered, then when received, deny the full refund to make their mistake right.  Not only that, Amazon adds insult to injury;  the price has dropped more than 20% since I ordered on March 24th.  Bad form Amazon.  Bad form.	-1
ok if the magent was stronger on the pennsylvania roads it bounces off like crazy	-1
This wheel claims to have a 1200 lb rating, but as soon as I began to move a trailer, with the wheel on a smooth board on level ground, the rivet that holds the cylinder to the wheel frame (and allows rotation) bent and the wheel began to collapse.  Very poorly made and not adequate for a normal 600 lb tongue weight.	-1
The product looks great.  It is strong and sturdy.  The only problem is that it doesn't really fit a 2" jack tube.  It's about 1/16" too small on the inside diameter of it's sleeve tube.  It's unusable for what I bought it for.	-1
This is the bearing. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01731LGGU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Not sure if it's the rod or the bearings. I wish they were just sold together.	-1
So far out of spec. that it is useless. The ends are flared. Doesn't even hold bad spec for more than an inch or 2. Good for poking someone, but that is about it. Looks like it is rolled. It is bar stock.	-1
This is suppose to be 5mm and it is way way way out of tolerance. It will not even fit on a 625zz bearing which is what I need it to do. It is more like 6mm. Useless to me.	-1
I am extremely disappointed. According to product information this should have been no greater than 8.0005mm. Mine came in with spots that measured as much as 8.1mm. Totally worthless as a shaft for a  LM8UU linear bearing. In fact trying to get it in was a little stiff. I thought that i just needs a little oil. Nope it actually damaged my bearings. I was going to use these as a temporary shaft since they are 5x cheaper than a linear motion shaft but now not only can't i use them for that but i have to buy new bearings too.  As a final note i found a nick in one of the three rods i ordered. Needless to say i won't be buying these again in the perceivable fututre.	-1
I tried to use one and it only blunted the tip and did not dig in until a hole lot of force.  By that time the hole was too big.  Since I only tried once I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it one extra star.	-1
This stuff is trash. Not sure what everyone else got but mine was so dry rotted to the point they broke off in the hole. After using all of them and got 4 out of 10 to take I was able to break the abs plastic plate off with the slightest of easy. Not trusting this crap to mount anything. Like a few other said I had to rebuy more of them from a hardware store and they worked fine. But these have been laying out in the sun way to long or there 50years old lol. Buy at your own risk.	-1
I purchased these at a local store not amazon. One set worked OK, but one set failed completely.  One of the bolts won't screw into the anchor at all, and another broke off inside the wall while trying to screw it in. I guess I got a defective pack, but be aware that this could happen and purchase more than you need. As it is, I'm stuck trying to figure out how to remove the plastic anchor on the bolts that failed so I can replace them.  I would love to use a regular screw in the stud, but we have a "resilient channel" for soundproofing between apartments and metal studs, meaning I can't screw into the studs without compromising the soundproofing.	-1
Cheaply made plastic.  Not a regular hardware store anchor,  To cheaply made	-1

Does not make clean cuts.  I have similar drill bits bought at local store that do much better.  Not sure what the issue is, may be the rake angle?  Anyway too expensive to return.  Keeping it for rough work.	-1

This  item needs to be redesigned.  it purpose is good but the. lighting blinds you	-1
The cart itself is sturdy and strong, but the wheels are absolutely terrible. They hardly roll, and more like skid across the ground. They left black tracks all over my floors, no matter how much I tried to clean them before use. There's also a seam in the middle of each hard wheel that I suppose should be sanded down if you want to avoid further damage to your floors... I like that the top is grippy and large and has handles, but the wheels make it absolutely not worth it - not to mention the terrible smell that needed cleaning and airing out for two days before my (failed) usage.  I almost gave it two stars because the top isn't terrible, but since the wheels make it unusable for me... I feel nothing but negativity toward it. Maybe it'd work for someone who is okay with the wheels sliding instead of rolling, and who is using it on a floor that physically can't be damaged, but for me... :(	-1
Was expecting rubber wheels or wheels that would not make that much noise. Boy, this guy is noisy when it rolls. It's also very sensitive, any little touch and it will veer out of path. The tray itself is very good though, I like the anti-skid material. But the wheels are killing this product that has great potential.	-1
Trashcan is nice and sturdy but they forgot to send a lid!!! Not real usable without a lid.	-1
This is a 20 Gallon pail. It fits under my counter in the kitchen which is your standard table height. I use 30 gallon garbage bags which are perfect for this size pail. NO Venting channels to allow air to flow into the garbage can making liners easier to lift out of the trash can. As a result, when you pull the full garbage bag out of this pail, it creates a vacuum and the bags are difficult to pull out of the pail. Dumb design. Rubbermaid has venting channels. NO Integrated cinches that allow bags to be attached to handles so that the bag doesn't fall into the pail. My Rubbermaid pail has these two features. Not enough thought was given in the design of this pail. I'm no engineer but there are only TWO things to know about when making a plastic pail. VENTING CHANNELS and a place to ATTACH the bag to the handles so the bag doesn't fall into the pail. Could have been a great pail. DOES NOT COME WITH LID. Don't forget that when ordering if you do decide to go with this pail. Next time, I'll check for venting channels and a place to attach the bags to the handle like my Rubbermaid.	-1

Dowel joinery offers two key features. (1) Registration so edges of adjoining sections align, and (2) Strengthens the joinery PROVIDED the dowels are a firm fit.  To use 1/2" dowels, one uses a 1/2" drill bit.  The 1/2" drill bit makes a 0.500 +/- 0.002 diameter hole (assuming a proper jig is being used and a reasonably good drill bit).  THESE DOWELS are on AVERAGE 0.486 inch.  Therefore, registration can be in error by as much as 0.007" on average and as far as strength goes, these dowels will be floating in glue rather than being affixed firmly to wood WITH Glue.  Too sloppy of a fit!  They are slotted so no allowance for glue squeeze out is necessary.  The ridges on the flutes form the firm fit to the hole ID while the grooves provide channels for glue to flow and form good bond between dowel and wood.  THESE DOWELS ARE TERRIBLE.  If you can turn the wood upside down and the dowel can fall out of the hole, its a bad thing!!!  Be Warned!!!	-1

You definitely get what you pay for with these interdental cleaners. They are extremely flimsy and bend very easily while trying to insert them between your teeth. Be prepared to use a minimum of two GUM Soft Picks, and sometimes three or four at each cleaning. The silicone bristles are also very soft and I have my doubts about their cleaning efficacy, other than pushing out a particle from between your teeth. Basically, you're probably better better off using a wooden toothpick. I've gone back to using a GUM Proxabrush with replaceable brushes that last me approximately 2 weeks before needing to be replaced. The proxabrush is also a heckovalot easier to reach your rear teeth.	-1
tried this based on the reviews, here.  was not impressed.  could have been a fake or a lower-grade version.  returned it (also tried the absolute igaging.  also not impressed!)  I guess I am just not seeing the value of the so-called mid-priced china brands, here.  either go full high-end or go full low-end.  the mid-end is just not worth its price.	-1
Didnt stick to plastic or ceramic..	-1
Stay away from velcro, it won't remain in place and falls off easily	-1
Sticks to almost all surfaces.  Except cardboard.  Seriously?  And, I don't mean that it "rips" the cardboard.  I mean that the glue does not hold to the cardboard very well.  I am an oil painter, and I store my paintings in cardboard shipping boxes, and need to keep them closed until they dry or sell, so they stay dust free.  I need to be able to open them to take a painting out to varnish, or if it sells.  I have an inventory system and use labels on the boxes, and have been just folding them shut (they lay flat), but thought using velcro was going to be genius.  Not.  The side with the most trouble is the soft side.  Some even pulled away without opening the box.  I am now looking for rivets, or may try stapling the Velcro on.	-1

This is NOT a 72MHz bandwidth scope. It is rated at 72Msps or 72 mega samples per second. Seeed Studios, the original designers, themselves apologized for mistakenly calling it 72MHz bandwidth, but even now still won't commit to the actual bandwidth. In addition, if this is hardwave version 2.72 (the latest version), then many of the 3rd party firmwares don't work correctly with it, at this time.  I gave this only 1 star because it is NOT a "72MHz analog bandwidth" scope. As a 4.4MHz scope, I would give it 4 stars. I'd leave off the last star because of the rotten documentation, nonstandard connectors, crappy sine wave on the built-in function generator, and difficulty in figuring out how to update the firmware.  An analog signal like a sine wave requires -at- -least- 8 samples per cycle, which puts this at about 4.5MHz with all four channels going.  This is born out by the antialiasing filters on U17 and U18 on the two analog channels which have a -3dB cutoff of about 4.4MHz. That goes for -everyone's- DSO203.  - Update - A reviewer at Electronic Design News Magazine measured a DSO Quad at only about a 3MHz bandwidth. I would also like to point out that I observed the bandwidth changing when the sensitivity is changed, causing the appearance of a wave near the bandwidth limit to change shape, sometimes drastically.  [...]  It is important to know that channels 3 and 4 are digital only. I think they accept CMOS 5V logic levels. In addition, the wrong TVS protection diodes sourced for the two digital channels, limiting the bandwidth on them to about 1MHz max. For reasonable accuracy on a digital signal, that means they are only useful to about 100kHz. This is only on channels 3 and 4.  The documentation is on SainSmart's website and is pretty good. You'll need an unpacker that supports RAR files.  As a really small ~4MHz portable oscilloscope, this is not completely horrible. It has a built-in signal generator (10Hz to 8MHz) and it can fit in your laptop bag or in a briefcase. This is an open source design, so there are a lot of custom updates to the firmware out there. The internal function generator is used to adjust x10 probe compensation, the capacitors are under the battery. You'll need a stable adjustable voltage reference source with a decent DMM to do the "self" calibration, up to 60V.  Unfortunately, the signal generator is really only useful for the roughest of purposes. The square wave is fine if you need it for 3.3V circuits, as it is only 3V. The sine, sawtooth, and triangle waves are horrible. They have 15 very visible, large steps, clearly only 4 bits of information. In addition, there is no level control.  This uses something called an MCX connector. It is a small push-in connector that relies on the springiness of the metal to hold it in place. A bad thing for something like a scope probe that is going to get moved around a lot. I had problems with intermittent connections. Wouldn't it have been better to use a more readily available, more reliable connector like an SMA? Small enough not to increase the size of the scope, but it screws on so it is nice and secure.  For $100 more, you can get a Hantek DSO5072P and have true 70MHz bandwidth with 1Gsps and easier to find BNC probes. It is quite a bit larger which means a nice 7" screen, but not so portable.  I don't trust SainSmart to know proper ESD procedures, due to past experiences and emailed conversations. So if they are buying this ready-made and slapping their name on it, probably not a problem, but if they actually build it, good luck.	-1
This is NOT a 72MHz bandwidth scope. It is rated at 72Msps or 72 mega samples per second, but it is really two 36Msps ADC channels. That is shared between the active channels, so if you have all four channels running, it is down to only 18Msps.  I gave this only 1 star because it is NOT a "72MHz analog bandwidth" scope. As a 4.4MHz scope, I would give it 4 stars.

I had this for less than one day and decided it just wasn't appropriate for any realistic testing I would do with it.  The calibration changes depending on if you're running on batteries or the charger, the connectors are non-standard as far as test equipment goes, and the controls are too hard to use when you're trying to get something done.  I ordered an OWON benchtop 'scope and have been very happy with it.	-1
Suction sucks.  Not really much good.	-1
I put these to their first serous test and was disappointed.  Securing a flash suppressor to the barrel of a rifle, these would grip the barrel securely only by applying the greatest of force.  Then afterward one of the magnets on each of the jaws had come loose, remaining stuck to the steel of the vise.	-1
seems to be a decent jaw material, but like most of these I've tried, very weak magnets--get knocked out of your vise very easily--a true PITA Why can't any of the vise jaw pad makers get decent magnets for their stuff?	-1
These soft jaws need to be more durable, and they need better magnates!  They seem to always be falling out of the vice when you need them to be there.  Spend more $$, get the better ones!	-1
As Stated before Resolve is the worst product for cleaning carpets.	-1
I'm really dis a pointed with this with this cleaning system. I used to buy the Resolve cans of high traffic carpet cleaner and use my own brush. I thought it would easier which it is the only problem is it only covers 50 sq.ft. I used up a can in no time so I decided to go back to using my carpet brush. It works better for me the carpets came out very clean. Don't get me wrong the Resolve cans by themselves cleans the carpets very well. Do yourself a favor just but the three pack of Resolve carpet cleaner cans and a brush and handle. The other way it will cost you a lot of money using this system.	-1
Updated review...9/5/2016..... Sadly the stains I THOUGHT had been removed.... reappeared...  I gave 2 stars for the scrub brush.  Keeps you off your hands and knees... but the stain remover foam is worthless.  *dissappointed*	-1
I did everything it said, and after a double vacuum (with two different Vacuum Machines) I saw very little cleaning to any of the heavily soiled carpet areas aro0und my home.  Only slightly lightened the heaviest marks on high traffic areas in my home.	-1
The product description says the Flange Diameter is 2-3/16".  Not true; the flange diameter is really 2-13/16".  Guess what: I REALLY need 2-3/16" flange diameter.  Wonder what it's going to cost me to send these back!!  Update:  At least 3 folks have commented that the O.D. as stated in the ad is not correct. As of 8 Sep 2013, the ad still has not been corrected!  I would rate the vendor 1-star, for irresponsibility!	-1
Product isn't as advertised.  I received a green one, which wasn't even an option at buy time.	-1
Total junk. The loops are too big for screwdrivers because the drivers flop around once you put them in there. Further, I tried to bend the top loops to a slightly upward angle, and it instantly snapped off with very little pressure. In 50 years of woodworking and tool usage I've come to know that products like this are absolutely unacceptable if you know what you're doing. Do not buy.	-1

Hard to beat for the price, they do all that they should and crimp well.  I would buy more without a second thought.  ***UPDATE 02/2018***  I posted this a couple years ago, I just compared the new ones I just ordered to the old and WOW, nothing even close to the same size, gauge metal inside or quality.  These are just the cheapest China thing you can buy anyplace.  The reviews are all based on what the produce was not what it is and as such I'm dropping from 5 to 1 star.	-1

Backing does not release like it should.  You'll spend a lot of time peeling ripped paper.  Would not buy again.	-1
This was a waste of my money, I own a 2002 jaguar x type and after placing all tires on the dolly's and having them on a concrete floor myself and 2 adults could not budge the jaguar but maybe 6 inches struggling. It's obvious the casters are too small. Poor quality in the casters I do not recommend this dolly set unless you own a VW bug or similar in size. Shame on Merrick Machine Company for wasting mechanics and customers time.	-1
to thin	-1
These shredded really quickly for "Heavy Duty". If I wouldn't have bought them direct from Amazon I would have thought they were fake. I know how to use a grinder, and these were used on a thin gauge of steel to just do some trimming. I barely finished maybe one minute worth of work before it ripped apart. Second one, same story. I'd suggest trying one before you get a whole pack like I did. Maybe I just got a bad batch.  I did note the production date as a user mentioned, and it was fresh inventory.	-1
This is not low loss cable.  The transmit power was so degraded, that having the antenna gain was moot.  I also bought two of these so I know it was not just a bad cable.  If you are seriously looking to improve your signal strength, use a thicker, and shorter cable.	-1
Returned, Has terrible signal loss. not work the money, or you get what you pay for. Worked better with just the antenna without the extension. look it up it is a RG-174 Cable. althought it is well made.	-1
This cable attenuated the signal from my wifi antenna connection. Having the antenna alone is great but using this cable the power output and speed drops. Do not buy this!	-1
You would think that Anhydrous Alcohol would clean without leaving behind a film. If Windex have the cutting power of this on soldering paste, I would use that instead because the no film finish.	-1
This came from China to the US so it took a while to arrive.  I was under the impression this metal melts in your hand but it didn't. I put the container in pretty hot water and it became a liquid. Took it out of the water and left it at room temperature all day. It stayed a liquid all day. I put it in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning it was still a liquid. I put it in the freezer and finally it went back to a solid state. It doesn't melt at hand temperature or at 90 deg as I've read before ordering nor does it revert to solid at 42 deg in the refrigerator. Disappointed and a waste of money.	-1
Doesnt work at all. Got 2 of them and no signal was output.	-1
This gave me a lung infection.	-1
I probably own a half dozen or more 6" calipers similar to this one, but none of them have both a fractional scale and a decimal scale right on the dial, both of which I need in my woodworking shop. I'm fairly careful with all my tools so I was surprised when it just quit working after only a years use in my shop. Since I was beyond Amazons return period, I made several attempts to contact Hartville tool, who were distributing this item at the time, to see if they would replace this item, with no response. I think I'm going to try the combination caliper that Lee Valley tool sells next, since I can always rely on them selling only quality tools and I prefer the decimal scale to be on the outer rim of the dial, which this one isn't. It makes for a more accurate read.	-1
Its not reliable  !	-1
Here's some news for may users here: " There are 3500 different types of steel" [...]  These items, based upon reviews, are what we in the engineering industry call: 'crap'	-1
The instructions are poor, and sometimes in error.  And while you get a mini-DVD with the software on it, there is absolutely NO mention of the software in the enclosed printed instruction manual!!???  No mention of the form the data is logged in, etc etc. Worse yet, your slot type DVD drives won't read these mini-DVDs.  While there is a "software download" link on the Amprobe website they, of course, don't offer a download of the software for this device!!  The link in the review appears to only get you 32 bit software for the cable, and it is NOT the full software suite from Amprobe.  When you DO finally find a DVD reader for the enclosed mini DVD  you do find there is a significant amount of software on it, including some parts of LabView. AND, of course, the manual for the software is there, so unless you have a miniDVD reader, don't think about ordering this device.  You won't be able to use it.  Software is a little cumbersome install and there is NO support for Win8, but it least it appears to run well under Win8.  If you don't understand how the traditional Win7 functions map onto Win8 (and they do for the most part) you will have challenges with this software. Once you DO get it installed, the software is not too bad.  Allow at LEAST two hours to figure all this out.  To make this unit read accurately you have to calibrate and use the T/C offset function.  Some people have commented the specification was in error, and had too large a tolerance, but they are not  correct.  The K thermocouples supplied can have an offset of 2C at room temperature out of the box and STILL be in spec.  Out of the box without calibration my unit read ice water as 34F.  If you supply this unit with A/C power it gives no indication of whether it is on battery or using the A/C, but the "APO" (auto power off) disappears in the display.  But, of course, no where in the instructions do they tell you this.  This device cries out for a "reset" button but does not have one.	-1
This is a nice simple unit but disappointing accuracy. You can calibrate it by using a known temperature source and adjusting the reading. First I put it in ice water and adjusted to read 32F. But then I put it in boiling water and it read quite low, 206F. So I adjusted that to 212F, but now it reads too high on room temperature or ice. Instruments like these are supposed to have good electronics and be properly calibrated at the factory. This one - nah.  I may have been sent an already returned product by error - not only inaccurate but also it was missing the thermocouples and the manual also. A rare Amazon fail. Sent it back.	-1
I have had this for two days and I already miss my Neeto Botvac. This thing is so loud, takes forever and doesn't do near the job my Towanda did. That's what I named her because she got it done. I have to call this one Twiggy because of her work. Very unsatisfied:(	-1
Just took them forever to send me one , if you plan on getting one anytime soon Dont hold your breath	-1
One time use....VERY PRICEY!	-1
After a week my teeth weren't white. After 2 weeks I wondered if I kind of noticed a difference but there is definitely no definite whitening action.  Which is too bad because I really suffered using this toothpaste. I don't know if burning like fire is supposed to make me feel like it is working. But this is just burns. My lips hurt. My mouth hurts. My tongue is not speaking to me. There is a point where mint goes from "refreshing" to "chemical weapon". I think Colgate missed that line.  If you are an actor and need to cry for a role, I suggest this toothpaste. But if you like your mouth find something else.	-1
The 7.0 pH calibration solution actually had a pH level of 7.5! This obviously threw off my pH meter and is of absolutely no value. After it failed to properly calibrate my hand handheld meter I brought this product to our Chem Lab at work and tested it against our professionally calibrated PH meter. It had a PH Level of 7.5. To reiterate: it is junk.	-1
Not worth the $$$ It is just some liquid with certain alkaline level. Way over priced.	-1
When mixed, this stuff has the thickness of peanut butter.  It won't brush on at all.  The only way to spread it was with a spatula.  As a result, wetting out cloth was difficult.  Wetting out mat was near on impossible.  When it cured it was tough stuff, but IMHO it wasn't worth the effort.	-1
I give this high quality product a FIVE STAR RATING.  The items I've bought from this company are fine quality, well packaged, at a good price.  The low rating is for AMAZON-  RE  the product:  HOW are you going to use it?  And, do you REALLY know what you're buying?  I was planning to make a 12" round sieve.  For my purpose (sieving dry powdered clay) it would have worked IF I had bought the right product.  RE  Amazon's poor descriptions of technical items:  After I saw that I had ordered the wrong item, I called two companies that market sieves.  They said "You need to consider the thickness of the wire (which affects the durability for your use, and the size of the openings), the size of the openings per square inch, and the amount of openings per square inch.  Then there's the "Sieve Number"...  OK, so now, I'll just call Amazon's supplier, so I can buy the correct item next time.  Amazon said "Call our company 'Small Parts', they sell this."  But 'Small Parts' DOES NOT SELL THIS ITEM, THUS, THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION.  Yes Amazon, I know that selling many items means knowing the details of those items, BUT YOUR DESCRIPTIONS ARE OFTEN INADEQUATE.  Time is Money! I'm bringing you business, this should be a very simple matter to put more details in your "Product Descriptions."  YOU are the MARKET for your suppliers: you can simply demand that THEY list a TRUE & FULL DESCRIPTION.  This is not hard.  I'VE HAD TO CALL YOU NUMEROUS TIMES TRYING TO GET MORE DETAILED INFORMATION on the technical things I buy. YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE DO A GOOD JOB, BUT YOU DO NOT SUPPLY THEM ENOUGH INFORMATION YOUR CUSTOMERS MIGHT NEED.  Do you know the word COMPETITION?  How about the term MARKET SHARE?	-1
I received this unit about 6 months ago as a gift and used several times since then.  I found the meter readings to be highly variable with poor repeatability. I would take several readings one after another and would get differences of up to 0.4. Sometimes readings would be wildly off. I found that I needed to recalibrate in between every reading, even with a time lapse of just a few minutes.  Recalibration is an awkward task. The display is on the front of the meter, the switch is on the top and the tiny calibration screw is on the rear. Since the switch is spring loaded, i.e. you have to slide and hold to get a reading, the calibration becomes a 3 handed effort.  I never had any confidence in the readings I got from this meter and it quit working after 6 months.  I cannot recommend this meter and will be looking for something different for my needs (measuring mash pH).	-1

Had to send back, nothing magnetic about it at all.  I couldn't get anything to stick to it.	-1
I wanted to use this magnet sheet to store spice tins on my cabinet door. See the photo for Two problems were experienced.  1. The magnetic strength varied all over the sheet. Some of the tins stuck well, and others did not and fell off, even when closing the door slowly.  2. The sheet started peeling away from the cabinet. I prepped it by cleaning it so there was no waxy coating, and it still peeled.	-1
Extremely weak!  If you are thinking of doing anything with this that would utilize the magnetic part of this material, forget it.  But, Robert in Indiana, you say, it *is* just a sheet of magnetic material!  What use is it then?  Exactly.  I would return it but I cut it to try it out.  Lesson learned.  It would not even stick to the fridge enough to take the curve out of it, even after lots of cajoling and flattening, I needed some STRONG fridge magnets to hold it to the fridge enough to flatten it.  I bought it to make a cover for the vent above our stove when it is not being used, but it is absolutely hopeless for this application.  I realize it is for making fridge picture magnets and not what I wanted to use it for, but I kind of doubt whether it would hold itself against the fridge even with such a light load.  Waste of money.	-1
Even though it is described on the container that it comes in, don't use it on a vehicle.  I just now completed a 20 mile trip with this attached and when I got to my destination (NEVER EXCEEDING 55MPH) it was gone. I didn't see it peel off nor did I hear it.  I just hope that I didn't hurt anyone after it flew off.	-1
After taking three weeks (shipped directly from overseas) to receive these non-sterile pipettes, I am disappointed.  They measure 6" long and are much larger than I anticipated.  I was going to use these for essential oils, but being non-sterile I cannot use these for that purpose.	-1
These could be better. The measurements are hard to read and everything measured does not always squeeze out. Just a weak product.	-1
I'd be very careful with wiring this thing up for anything with significant load.  I've just had 2 ordered for a project involving commercial motorized door locks running off 24VDC.  I got them in my hands today.  First, the wire that comes off of it was missing some set screws from the factory, so I could not use the terminal.  OK, no biggie, I can use crimp connectors or whatnot.  But then I got looking at the wire lead itself.  It is no bigger than 22AWG.  So I got out my screwdriver and pulled up the terminal strip itself to see what was connecting everything.  The wire connecting each terminal is no bigger than 24AWG.  I based this off of solid core network cable.  Since I was going to use this in a commercial environment, I soldered in a reinforcing backbone of 18AWG wire which I know will beef it up a bit.  If I had known I would need to do this, I would have looked elsewhere for something properly build and rated for more draw.  The product is a bit misleading in that the terminals themselves are of a type designed for much more load, but the actual construction limits its usability.	-1
I will never buy again from this seller - Micca Distributor.  They do not operate their business with integrity and they have no concern for their customers.  They are unresponsive and dishonest.  The one star is for Amazon for making this right and giving me a refund.  OK, on to the product.  There is NO reason to buy this product.  It is cheap, inferior quality.  The supplied toskink cable that comes with the FiiO is a throw-away.  Better to spend another $10-$20 and get a decent cable.  Thanks to another reviewer, I ordered the Orei and did a side-by-side comparison.  The Orei produces exponentially superior sound quality.  Using the Orei with an Apple TV streaming from my iTunes library, it works fine for whole house audio distribution of background music.  Let's be honest - Neither is an audiophile level DAC.  If you want that, think about spending hundreds, not $30.  I haven't tried the Geffen, which is a good company, but the reviews are worse at twice the price.  Do yourself a favor - Don't make my mistake - Don't buy this product.	-1
Does not pick up well at all, and I hate the basket, it is so filthy.  I don't know why people like having to empty a basket full fo nastiness.  You breathe in all kinds of mites & bacteria.  I will never buy antother bagless, and as I said it juswt does not pick up well at all.  I gave it to a neighbor and she does not like it either.	-1
there is no instructions on how to put this heavy vacuum cleaner together ... I will have to pay a handyman to put it together for me. I thought it would be lightweight to haul up and down my spiral staircase , the parts are all very heavy	-1
Pros: came with all the attachments I wanted, including an excellent one for wood/bare floors; good suction that's adjustable; roller on/off option; bagless; reusable HEPA filter, well made, long cord.  Cons: this machine is very heavy, and when using it in the fully assembled mode with the carpet brush, it's too tall to go more than 2-3 inches under any furniture; cord not retractable (I know--picky, picky).  I like the lift-off option for versatility. However, the unit is heavy to carry around and the hose is in an inconvenient location when vacuuming in that mode. I am 5'6", and it's almost too tall for me; a shorter person might not be able to manage it.  With time I'll get more familiar with all the release buttons. I have two high pile shag area rugs which it cleaned very well. However, even with the suction adjusted to the lowest setting, it required two hands and a lot of effort to push around on those rugs. It's fine on my larger low/no pile area rugs, but I have to stand on the smaller ones to keep them from being moved around during vacuuming, and the corners tend to be sucked up.  Overall, I think the pros and cons are even. For me this is fine, but it's not my ideal vacuum, which is out there somewhere.  UPDATE 4/17: I'm done with this hulk. I find it very inconvenient to switch between floor and rug, and using this on rugs is like pushing a wheelbarrow full of concrete blocks. $200 down the drain.	-1
The o-rings seem to be decent quality, as is the box.  However, there are no labels or paperwork with the product; not even a brand name of any sort.  These kits usually come with a size chart, located on the top lid, inside, or both.  Sometimes you need a specific replacement size when making a repair.  There is no help here for that.  Trial and error can often work, but not always.  They save a penny or two and make this kit a lot less useful.  Don't recommend.	-1
The fitting leaks in the middle, not at the fittings that connect it to the rest of the piping.  Kind of defeats the purpose!  Luckily the leak is small and when the season is over I will throw the thing out or request to send it back as defective.	-1

I ship around 35-50 packages daily, sometimes even more. As a one man shop I have to find packaging items that can save me time, money, and grief. The quality control of these rolls is extremely bad. Some rolls I have had are good, meaning the tape "flows" off of the reel with ease and others it takes effort to pull the tape off the roll by hand on my tape gun. Sometimes on the "harder to release" rolls, the adhesive seems to 'lift' off of the tape as well. Some boxes I have to tape with two rounds of tape, very time consuming and this tape isn't cheap either.  I've used 3m (great but expensive) and I've used Metronic 2.0 Mil Thick 2 Inch x 110yd tape (thin but great to work with) along with this brand. This is my 2nd foray, as I've read all the reviews but this is the last time I'll be using this garbage. The metronic and 3m are more expensive but in the long run, the cost savings are not worth it.	-1
Update: I added one more star (from 1-star) as the adhesive gets stickier than some other brands at room temperature.  I purchased this because the description says "...features high-performance, all-season adhesive for excellent holding power during extreme hot or cold temperatures...". Well, I disagree! Now I have 6 extra rolls of mediocre holding power. Will see if I can return these.	-1
the bending strength of the plastic carrier is higher than the strength of the adhesive.  Every place I taped around a 90 degree edge yesterday, they tape has already come off.  It is only good for packing boxes...NOTHING else..  I will have to re-do several hours of work I did yesterday.	-1
I can only imagine how many boxes I taped with this came un-taped before delivery.  Usually I tape them and ship them, but I had a few boxes I taped and left overnight.  When I came back the next day, ALL the tape had come unglued and the box flaps were open.  The tape seems sticky, but it lets loose in very short order.  DO NOT buy this tape!	-1
PRO - thick tape and 1 day shipping through Amazon Prime (my main reason for purchasing) CON - Agree with the other buyer and it's not comparable to Scotch.  The adhesive on this tape is not sticky enough and I had some of it lifting off both boxes and kraft envelopes.  Going out to Costco to get some Scotch brand to use on shipping boxes.	-1
I was specifically looking for something to help secure nails and screws when they're put into place.  This came up as a suggestion, and it didn't say that it needed a caulking gun.  On the package, it says NOTHING about using it for nails, screws, or other fasteners.  I'm quite disappointed.  I'm vacillating between returning it or getting a caulking gun and using it when the need comes up, but it's not what it was suggested for, and that disappoints me.  I'm sure, knowing that it's a Loctite product, that it will adhere very well on the kinds of jobs for which it was designed, but I'm annoyed that it came up as a product to use to help anchor nails and screws (yes, I know what a screw anchor is, and this job does not call for it).	-1
Does not always dry clear and adhesion is hit or miss. I've used quite a bit of this Loctite Power Grab and had mixed results. So much so that I would not recommend it. It also seems to dry white and not clear most of the time. I have used it on all types of materials and surfaces and can't get specific on which materials is works best on because I've used on the same material more than once and it worked great once but not the next time.	-1
I didn't have the problem with the banana connectors that some others have posted, however the negative wire lead simply fell off it's probe connection within a week of using these.	-1
Very cheap construction. Get broken soon.	-1
not rubber - hard plastic	-1
The parts of the hinge that are undamaged look great, perfect for my project. However, the packaging was pitiful. Two 4' flimsy boxes taped end-to-end. No paper inside, nothing to stiffen the box. It should have been in a heavy cardboard tube. The box had a couple of soft spots, and when I pulled the hinge out, it was bent severely in several places. The price was right, the quality seems good, but if I order an 8' hinge, I expect to be able to use 8' of it.	-1
It works, but it's messy and not re-usable. I was much happier after switching to a home brew etchant consisting of Hydrochloric Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide. Read this Instructable, it will change your entire outlook on etchants. http://www.instructables.com/id/Stop-using-Ferric-Chloride-etchant!--A-better-etc/?ALLSTEPS	-1
The rope is nothing special. It'll do the job I need it to do. However, what really ticked me off is that the manufacturer makes a point of emphasizing "USA" in the product description ("Rope King USA"), which might suggest to some that its manufactured in the USA. I'm the fool who failed to spend the extra time necessary to learn that it's not made in the USA. It wasn't until I received the item that I figured out the answer to that question. Says it on the part of the label not pictured in the product description  Made in China.  I've run in to the problem before. Although this particular purchase was intended for hardware use, this is the same type of rope my dog loves to play tug with. Just the sight of this got his tail wagging, but I had to say no. I won't give him rope from China. In the past, I've spent an untold number of hours searching pet websites for rope tug toys made in the USA, but no luck. I just don't get it.  I don't understand why it's so difficult to find rope made in the USA  My preference for rope made in the USA isn't political, rather it's a health concern. Manufacturers in China have given the world too many reasons not to trust them. One need only read the daily newspaper.	-1
Unacceptably high number of dud wires due to poor crimping; who/whatever was crimping these did a sloppy job.	-1
The cables work great but they have a very funny odor coming out of the package that lingers for a while (Couple weeks).  It reminds me of a harsh plastic smell that isn't quite cured or is sitting out in the sun.  The connectivity of the cables works good for breadboarding but the smell is almost too much.	-1
Too small for my breadboards' holes. I now make my own jumpers out of 20 ga. wire	-1
No good.  The leads on these do not fit any breadboard I've ever worked with....Not unless I want to use brute force to get them into it.  Too late for me to return the item now....Wish I had opened them up earlier so I'd have saved myself from the hassle of these pieces of junk.....Anyone want these?  $4 shipping, and they're yours.....I don't want them.	-1
They are not very good or the price.  Expect dead cables, some with housing separation, and minimum resistance of 0.8 ohms, and more in the range of 1-10 ohms (v.v. these are resistors!!!).  The very first first wire out of the pack was dead, and initially threw me as I had to troubleshoot a circuit.  The resistance showed up as I was troubleshooting ADC fluctuations.  These wires are probably OK for powering LED's [when pretested], but not much more.	-1
did not hold firmly in my breadboard	-1
They work well but the pin ends are a little flimsy and bend easily. Also the pin has a coating not allowing good contact. Lots of them though.. This review is being updated going down to 2 stars from my original 3 stars.	-1
These jumpers are not the same thickness (gauge) as those from other kits. These smaller diameter pins will fit into the breadboard and female connectors, but they do not lock in place, and sometime they loose connection.  I do not recommend these for Arduino or other projects.	-1
It is cheap, poorly made, doesn't track straight, and is a very poor substitute for a real vise. The price point is right for the quality but don't expect much, even if you take it apart and clean it up, it is still a cheap, marginally functional vise.	-1
I understand you get what you pay for and that I was not buying a professional machine shop style clamp but... I really don't like this thing. Yes, it has it uses but there are some major flaws.  I should have heeded the negative reviews before purchasing it.  Positives: 1) You can clamp the thing down and move your work piece anywhere in two dimensions in its range of motion  Negatives: 1) There is an extreme amount of slop on every movement.  When you reverse a direction on one of the directional screws you have to turn the screws 10 degrees before any linear movement occurs - this is for the clamp and the x & y axes. Forget QUICK 'precision' movements. Doesn't happen.  2) As you move the work piece in the x & y directions the body of the clamp tilts left/right and up/down. It moves around. Again, forget quick 'precision' movements.  3) The clamping jaws move side to side and up/down when you clamp something down. Again forget any type of precision.  4) The actual handle part of one of the rotary handles actually fell off. Immediately, it wasn't welded in place at all, the other one was... This is a big pain because as you move back and forth along that axis as you are working a piece you have to put the handle back in over and over again.  5) The gauges do not correlate to anything because there is so much slop in each of the turns; they have no value what so ever.  6) The set screws are garbage  7) The machined bearing surfaces are hardly machined  Overall, this thing is junk. I have used it many times. It has served its purpose but not very well. I have to admit, I expected more.	-1
This emergency switch, like it's 220-volt sibling, is perfect for safety because it refuses to let electricity flow through it.  The green button does not have a detante and thus will not stay in the 'on' position.	-1
Well, maybe excepting the people who actually build boat anchors... for all I know they're in the same factory.  Hoo-boy.  After reading all the reviews, realizing that yes, this was probably assembled by some unfortunate future organ donor in a Laogai in mainland China, I took a chance and ordered one.  It arrived in short order, short two handles.  Looked promising though so I contacted Amazon to pick it up and go ahead and send me another which they got to me the next day.  Due to various work commitments it was a few days until I could unbox, degrease, disassemble/lube and reassemble to actually use it and in the process, having already spent about an hour doing the little bit of detail described, I discovered not only was the lower threaded rod BENT making it very difficult to bring the top half more than halfway across, one of the bolt handle BOLT threads were so badly damaged the retaining nut wouldn't thread on.  This is going back tomorrow.  I don't need another boat anchor.  Should've known better.  Am about to pull the trigger on a Grizzly G0704.  Buy once cry once.	-1
While I could use another one of these, I will not be buying it. The price went up after I got the first one. While it is a nice option it is not a must have. ****update**** This thing stopped working after 6 months. The magnetic part would not function. Had to go back to my original switch. Recently got another one from another manufacturer and it is NON magnetic. Mechanical is the way to go !	-1
Failed after a few uses.  Burned out I think.  I connected my vacuum and miter saw to it at the same time.  Clearly it lacks the amp capacity to power both, which is absurd for a piece of shop equipment.  Neither is a huge piece of gear- small shop vac and a 10" miter saw.  It constantly tripped off and needed to be unplugged and re-set.  After that happened a few times, it stopped working.  Will return for refund and spend a few more dollars for a reliable piece of gear.	-1
Prompt shipping. I have only used a few of the larger pieces from this selection, but the ones I did use did not shrink well at all. I had a problem with two of them blistering and I wound up putting a different brand over it to keep it from splitting all the way.	-1
This was a gift.  I think it works well.	-1
You must be very careful these cover slip break too easy. Other than that they are an okay product to purchase.	-1
After a month of waiting my four wash bottles arrived. All four leak when squeezed, water seeps from the threads. No way to get the cap tighter, very frustrating.  For a few more dollars I got good bottles delivered in four days. Shop elsewhere!	-1
Look terrible and of a very cheap construction and material.	-1
I purchase the none treated to use in my garden as plant markers. I use a sharpie to label. Well I can't blame sharpie because it works. However these do not hold the permanent marker ink more than one rainfall.	-1
awful quality...arrived damaged, cracked broken in like 6 places though it was bubble wrapped...hmmm????!!!	-1
Looks nice, but the rack doesn't lock into the frame.  Tubes can be jettisoned from the rack if it collapses/	-1
Product was not as listed. Was not 10 ml and will not fit a rack made for 10 ml tubes as advertised. Had to get another set of tubes in order to get back on track. If correct sizing is important and 10 ml is required these are not what you're looking for.	-1
Very bad product. Don't even know where to start. Cure time is supposed to be several minutes, but in real life the very surface of clue dries in about 10-15 seconds and good luck with bonding if you do something large where you need more than 10 seconds to apply. Smells crazy toxic, do not recommend breathing this even once. On top of all which is already bad, it loses about 80-90% of volume when dried completely, this is a huge problem in many applications. Instead of solid glue area it turns into two flimsy films. I am not sure who designed this and what they were thinking, and also not sure who reviews this with five stars... My friend is using the thinnest version and he said it is "ok", but this #16 is garbage. Do not buy.	-1
The one we received was junk.  The latches wouldn't even begin to latch onto the canister.  Quality seems very low.  Adding insult to injury, if you elect to send it back, you have to pay the return shipping yourself, up front.  We did get a "partial refund" - overall, we lost about $10 on the deal just to receive a defective vacuum.  I do not recommend.	-1
This is a nice looking Ash Vac, but unfortunately the performance is lacking.  The first time I used it, after about 3 minutes it overheated and shut down.  The suction was fairly low powered, barely sucking ash.  After awhile, it reset and turned back on and I was able to finish cleaning out my pellet stove.  The second time I used it, I guess I didn't wait long enough and there were some hot coals, which burnt up the outer filter and also burnt the inner filter, while the suction did improve greatly, it didn't take long before it was clogged.  Once again after about 3 minutes it overheated again and shut itself off.  I can't really use it anymore as a ash vacuum and it doesn't suck enough to use as a shop vac, so Im not sure what to do with it other than throw it away.  Unfortunately I bought it in preparation of winter cleaning of the pellet stove, so by the time I used it, it was too late to return it.  Waste of money.	-1
Only used it ONCE. To clean up SMALL pieces of scrap wood in front of wood stove. Ran the vacuum for about 5 minutes, Total. Noticed the air coming from the exhaust was rather Warm. The Red "Bag is Full" indicator was dull red. Shut off the the vacuum. The TOTAL stuff picked up amounted to LESS THAN ONE HALF CUP of saw dust equivalent. DON'T even think of using this for a shop vac or any other Real vacuum need. The input port access, where the hose enters the canister, inside the canister is BLOCKED by the filter bag. The input port is directed to the side against the filter bag, instead of down towards the bottom where the dirt is supposed to go. The canister to hose connector is shaped to fit the circumference of the canister, so you can't rotate it to fix the problem.	-1
After purchasing and receiving this assortment of leds, I needed to determine which leds were which color, as they were all packaged together in one sticky ended clear bag.  This order showed resistors, but my order did not come with resistors.  I spent 30 minutes checking leds for color and was kind of put out with this order and just put them away for later.  Two stars for now and after using the tested leds, I found the leds are inclined to fail easily.  If you power one without a resistor, which were not included, or reversed +/- they will fail instantly.  Way too sensitive for my use and money.  Wish I hadn't ordered these!	-1
Here's what i got, a little over 100 1/4 watt resistors.  200 ohms, all good.  Lights i received, 20 blue, 20 orange, 10 white, 10 purple, 10 red, 10 green.  Product is decent quality, but all bags were not labeled as in the picture, they had hand written labels in chinese meaning i had to test every bulb.  disappointing.	-1
Junk!	-1
ordered sept. 26 it took almost 2 months to get. Came with no resistors, not all colors and way less then 80	-1
Order well packaged but the brightness of most of the colors were low compaired to my present syock. One draw back I should have noticed (my bad) is the word clear. There is little or no diffusion and even loking directly at the led output is low. All tested ok and I will use them.	-1
Colors were okay, resistors included were only 1 value, I was expecting an assortment for each color. Being the voltages differ for each color. Ships from somewhere in Asia, so if you need these now think again. You'd have to convince me to buy again.	-1
Bad.	-1
I ordered the 1/4 by mistake, wanted the 1/2.	-1
I only got this because it was listed as "frequently bought together" with the gel caps I purchased. I thought this would be really helpful in filling the caps but either end is too big for what I wanted. I thought the "spoon end" (as they call it on the product page) was a bit more rounded. It's not. Basically, I'd return this if it was worth the trouble but, seeing what I paid for it, it's less worrisome to just figure out something else to use it for. Really disappointed, though. They should show a photo of the item next to the opening of a gel cap (since they paired it in suggestions). because they didn't, I will.	-1
arrived broken, broken glass, led didn't work, and rust, worst buy on amazon to date	-1
This thing fell apart just from looking at it and the glass broke. I never had a chance to use it.	-1
The sales pitch stated "Food Grade Silicone". Deep in the very fine print on the tube it states that it is ok for "incidental contact" and no where does the manufacturer state "Food Grade". So, it looks like we got sold a bill of goods on this one.	-1
It spiderwebbed all over and clouded up when i put liquor in it. It leaks all over.	-1
The label is plastered right on the plastic tube - you peel it off and you're left with a layer of adhesive you can't see through.  I sent it back.	-1
Broke in half the first time I used it.	-1
I got this to replace my last hydrometer which I dropped. Checked its calibration in distilled water at 68F. Mine is off as it reads 1.002. No big deal. The other issue I have is that is is not correctly centered and always slopes slightly in the sample jar. I summary I am looking for a better one. I guess you get what you pay for. Overall a usable hydrometer but one that does not provide the accuracy I need. I was surprised to see it is calibrated at 68F and not 60F like my last hydrometer and my refractometer.	-1
I ordered 1 bag of 12 and only received 11 in bag...	-1
I lost a lot of liquid using this thing. It works.  I can say that much.  It just doesn't work well.  No matter what adjustments I make to this bottle filler, I can't seem to stop it from foaming up at the top of the filler.  It was also prone to spraying liquid out of the top of the filler, which was not fun to clean up. The included hose, intended to minimize the foaming, didn't do anything.  The foam filled up the hose and the seal around the connector was so poor the foam and spray still came out from the top of the unit.  It does automatically fill bottles, though.  When it got full enough, the flow slowed and eventually stopped.  So, it works. Just not well.	-1
Bought this to bottle some wine.  Wound up tossing it out.  It really doesn't work well.  The instructions are horrible and the device itself leaks like crazy.  Luckily I tested it out with regular tap water first, otherwise red wine would have gotten all over the house!	-1
Larger ring was bent, had to heat and straighten. If you don't have a tourch don't buy.	-1
If you are the sort of person whose feelings are easily hurt by things in life that make you feel like you are intellectually under-par, don't buy this product.  Just the reviews alone sound like from a parallel universe, where every adult automatically understands why electric motors work -- like brushing their teeth -- and kids and you are the only ones who do not, and must be trained.  I see the same sort of teaching is still alive and well that I had in high school -- I got straight-As in honors Geometry, Algebra 3/Trigonometry, Chemistry, Physics and Math Analysis, but I didn't understand a thing, because the teachers left out the things I needed to know first -- like we do not know why an electromagnetic field forms around an electric current -- it just does.  I'm down with that. I just needed to be informed that I was not the only one who did not know, for no one knows. It's all in a black box called "Nature." Physicists can cloak their ignorance by calling it "a fundamental force of the universe," i.e., "It's just there -- we don't know why."  Kids who can't get to first base in a subject because the opening statement is missing are told they don't have brains or "aptitude."  The instructions for this kit do some serious blathering, I presume about theory, if I could understand them. These instructions make sure to show you the formula for electromagnetic force (see graphic), they tell you that a drawing showing electromagnetism coming is really about electromagnetism going, and that a drawing of electromagnetism going is really electromagnetism coming, and that clockwise is counterclockwise, and counterclockwise is clockwise (see graphic). They show some doodles and say that one of the doodles is a magnet, but it is not labeled, and if it is there, it looks like any other doodle. Magnets can come in any shape or size. No doubt the drawing of this magnet is what an expert would recognize, but I thought this kit was for rank beginners. Draw a horseshoe, if you're not gong to label it. Then take a course in technical drawing or common sense.  So I skipped over to what looked like getting to the point. There were some ambiguous and sketchy instructions for constructing the contraption. Being a dummy, I had to look up several words.  So I ignored the beginning prose, looked up the words, then seemed to have the contraption built that the drawings in the constructions showed, which were not clear.  Then, for a final insult, the entire endeavor crashed and burned into my absolute failure with the following death sentence, the last instruction:  "6. Apply power by attaching 3 to 6 volt DC to the binding post."  No one said anything about any power. Where is it? Fews ads boast so much about including "all parts for assembly" as the ad for this product. All shoppers know the warning "Batteries not included." Wouldn't this ad have said that power is not included if it were not? Therefore, I'm still looking among the parts for this legendary power source. Furthermore, if you parse the term "electric motor," it could be understood to read that it creates power to drive an electric motor. How would beginners know that is called "a generator?" Where does it say that this whole contraption is not, in fact, the "3 to 6 volt DC" itself?  What's a binding post? The instructions won't tell you. I looked it up, and there was nothing like that on my "finished" motor.  The outfit that put me through this wringer -- and no doubt I am the only one who "just does not get it" -- is called American Educational Products.  In the immortal words of Jack Black (School of Rock), "Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, teach P.E." So perhaps the point of this kit is the exercise I got putting it together.	-1
Returned - not much here.	-1
Updating review: No, it too is coming undone from the sun heat. We had a 97F degrees yesterday; and the transponder had fallen off the windshield. Also, I had used it to glue a magnet to the inside of a plastic lid of my tool box; the inside is very smooth and I cleaned it with Isopropyl alcohol; the magnet held a measuring square; But, after a while, the magnet too kept on falling from the tape. It's not very high bonding for these uses anyway. Original review: It's working very good so far. I didn't like the fact that it was not very neatly and tightly coiled. The coiled tape looks as though it was hand coiled and done so rather poorly as there are a lot of places in the coils with air gaps between the layers. I'm sure these places will lose adhesion strength sooner than the air tight places. But, It's boarder line acceptable wrapping/coiling. The adhesion is excellent. I had a problem with the sticky hook and loop strips I was given with the express lane transponder. The heat from the sun on hot days, would cause the strips to separate from the plastic backing. I tried a few other product, but with the same results. These did the trick.	-1
Bought it for cooking purpose, but I don't think it is. Powdery.	-1
This is a toss up. Some are good and some were not (excessive itching and hand skin damage due to allergies to plastic chemicals).  However, they are economical and worth the try if you need a non-rubber based disposable gloves and you are too sensitive to skin allergens.	-1
These are the worst gloves I've ever used.  They rip easily and make your hands sweat badly.  When I take them off and try to put them on again in a few seconds, the moisture makes it impossible to do so.  These are absolute garbage in my opinion.	-1
These gloves are a small..they fit my hand like a large...way to big	-1
I tried to use this file to sharpen self feed wood boring bits and it didn't cut very well, actually the bit dulled the file. Maybe I need a diamond file for self feed bits, but this file isn't hard enough to cut that steel.	-1

I bought these from Pep Boys because they had a 25% off sale and the "16,000 pound" models were $44 with tax. I picked them up locally. I did a lot of research on various ramps but looked at the smaller Rhino ramp reviews on Amazon, not the reviews for the larger "16,000 pound" set. The photos supplied by some Amazon customers of the Rhino ramps basically collapsing under load have me strongly considering returning them before I ever use them.  The stated "16,000 pound" load rating is very deceptive. On the bottom of each ramp, the following weight ratings are stamped: "Do Not Exceed Rated Capacity of 4,000 pounds each, 8,000 pounds per pair or 16,000 pounds gross vehicle weight" They are NOT rated for 16,000 pounds each or as a pair. I attached a photo of these ratings and the made in USA data but they might be hard to read.  The ramps are made in the USA and I saw some chatter about filling the ramps with poly foam to stiffen them up and stabilize them I think Rhino Ramps should be doing that, not forcing customers to do after market modifications to avoid injury. More to come when I decide whether or not to keep these particular ramps.  I'm looking at Race Ramps RR-56-2 ramps but they are a LOT more money - like $200 even with the 15% coupon. But given a choice between spending another $160 for ramps or getting maimed or killed by flimsy ramps really isn't a choice.  7/12/16 update - I took these back to Pep Boys and got a refund. They would not fit under 2 of my 3 cars because they are too steep and too short to accommodate the lower front ends. Add in the potential for the "smash factor" and I won't miss these ramps. They might be OK for a lawn tractor or an ATV but I'm not putting a 5300 pound truck on them. I ordered 66 inch all aluminum ramps.	-1
these were alot less stable than they say,  folded under weight.	-1
These are flawed and make some claims on the label that are far from true. 12000 bs capacity actually means 3000 lbs per ramp, the idea being that the vehicle weight is split exactly 25% on each tire while it's on the ramps at an incline, which is not realistic. "Stronger than steel" they are surely  not. They do fine if you try getting a 4x4 or a FWD on them, if you have  RWD car they just slide out on concrete, there is barely any padding on the bottom. The heaviest vehicle I used these one was 5300lbs and the ramps started bulging out and bending, temperature was around 105 so that might have been the factor.	-1
These things are awful... The damaged my Camaro after they slid out from under it when I was driving up them... They were then too damaged to use anymore... A waste of money and time...	-1
I've own both the original and the new style nesting Rhino ramps.  Since they move on concrete, the originals were easily drive over, given the very low lip at the end of the ramps.  Yes, I drove over the originals and took a chunk out of the ends, as the ramps landed on the rocker panel "pinch weld."  I sold the originals and bought the new style ones, hoping they would be better.  THEY ARE NOT!  The end of the ramp split as they are nested after two or three uses.  The right wheel spun on my 2003 Toyota Corolla had melted the surface of one ramp.  THE RACE PAMPS, at three tomes of price of these are PERFECT.  I dumped these and purchase them, instead.  All of the ratings are 5 star on Amazon.  Basically, this in one time that you get what you pay for.	-1
I bought these thinking they could hold a 5000lb truck. Drove up truck gently and they collapsed. May be good for small cars or something. 16,000lbs is false advertisement and is going to kill someone. They did take it back and I was refunded.	-1
They look nice, are light weight, stack nicely, are wide and inexpensive and all that. But backing up on them with my 9740lbd truck squeezed them to death! They are NOT 16,000 lbd! More like 6-7kk lbd tops 3.3.5 tons, at which weight rating I would give it a 5 star for they built, price, and weight. Also be carefult to NOT use it on an uneven surfaces like camping site etc...	-1
These ramps will safely hold about 2500 pounds at best. I have an International Prostar that the front axle weighs 11,996 lbs fully fueled, and these things buckled and broke before even getting 1/2 up the ramps.	-1
Over-priced plastic junk. These ramps are a safety hazard! Purchased brand new and first time with a Ford Fiesta they worked good. Second time using, drove my Ford Ranger on them and they Both structurally failed with supporting plastic underneath cracking and allowing the truck to collapse to the Ground. I've used another brand of plastic ramps for 7 straight years to change oil in my Ranger and they have never cracked to this day. Buyer Beware!	-1
These are stable and easy to drive up on, but they don't raise the vehicle far enough.  The low clearance makes it hard to get your tools into place and you can't extend your arms  enough to get leverage on your wrenches.  Wish I had read the dimensions before buying these.	-1
I had to throw away almost a full bottle of this because it dried up and could not be used anymore. I put the cap on the way that it was supposed to be put on and it still dried up, like a raisin. I hate throwing things away, and this was no exception. We all know that a bottle of super glue is going to be used more than once - why cant they make glue bottles with better caps? Frustrating for sure! Especially because you normally don't know that it dried up until you have a "broken item gluing emergency" on your hands, this is exactly what I was faced with, and had to go out and purchase more glue. Not too happy about that,,,,especially since I had only used the glue one time prior.	-1
This is not for beer wort as advertised. It's for salinity, not Brix. I would like to return it, but just realized recently why my OG levels were all off the scale. If you got one that came with Brix, consider yourself lucky.  I'm not sure why, but the refractometer that was sent to me does not have SG Wort, nor % Brix. Mine measures Salinity, and shows what looks like a specific gravity of 1.000-1.070 something that shows a measured scale of 0-100 that I don't know what has any correlation to beer wort. This is not what I ordered, and now I'm trying to return it. Be careful, if you get one for salinity, wort measurements will be of the scale.	-1
I calibrated this item to 1.000 and it still reads high. Both the water and beer being at room Temp this unit reads the beer much higher then a Hydrometer.	-1
Miss labeled on the case - what I really got was a refractometer for Salinity - great if I had salt water aquarium... but I don't ... I make beer!!!	-1
If anyone knows of some generic 2x4  pads to replace these, please let all of us know!  The Compex snap contacts SUCK, but everyone already knows that.	-1
This is an absurd price. You can find generic pads elsewhere considering you are willing to hammer out the divet in the metal snap on the cable side. There are plenty of online guides showing how to get past compex's proprietary greed. You can get generic pads for 4-8 X less.	-1
didn;t work for me, had to return	-1
Only switches AC voltage. Wish that was clarified in the title of product instead of the jumbled mess they call a description.	-1
Maybe it's just this unit, but I relied on it, and ended up with a loss of time and materials because of it's inaccuracy.  The attached vid is just a simple example of it's failure.  It does even more bizarre things on my table saw!  I've had to go back and re-saw a dozen shelves so they can be glued up properly.  doing so makes a tear out problem for the edge tape and trying to prevent that caused me to ruin two shelves.  This device failure has cost me several hours of labor and overall dimensions failure.	-1
From the outside in ... The packaging was attractive and consistent with other products sold by iGaging (makes no difference but shows the company takes some pride in their products). Inside the retail box was a sturdy white cardboard box that contained the inclinometer, a nice storage pouch, the instructions, a 9V battery, and a tiny screwdriver. I expected the AccuRemote to be made of plastic but it's actually a cast metal, possibly zinc, quite sturdy and heavier than expected. The battery compartment is accessed by removing four dinky Phillips screws that jump to the magnets as you pull them out, an unintended but welcome feature as they would be super easy to lose and very difficult to find. The dinky screws + battery cover are too 1970's for me, there are better ways to cover a battery but including the screwdriver was a nice touch.  The inclinometer was easy to use, I didn't bother with instructions. I spent awhile measuring angles everywhere then going around checking the machines in my shop. I tried testing for accuracy the same way you would test a level, by flipping it 180 degrees, but got inconsistent results. According to this, after setting my table saw blade with an engineer square, I was 0.20 of a degree out. So pretty close but if this thing is accurate then it's nice to get that extra precision especially when cutting miters or segments for turning. My miter saw was dead on perpendicular, as I believed. My band saw was off .5 degree which I already suspected.  It turned out, the case of the device is not square to the bottom on all sides. So if you zero the device then turn it on it's side, it should read 90 degrees. The left side consistently read 90 degrees, the right side consistently read 89.70 degrees. Since I have a right tilt saw and would be using the bottom and right sides most often, being off by .30 degrees would just be annoying. I was also bothered that rotating the device 180 degrees does not give the same or reciprocal reading. And I had issues with precision (repeatability) especially when the daytime temperature was under 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So I sent the inclinometer back to Amazon. Based on the many reviews of this and similar products like the Wixey, I believe much of it is luck of the draw whether you get an instrument that is accurate and precise. So I wouldn't say iGaging makes poor instruments, just that digital inclinometers in this price range suffer poor quality control. The summary is I can not recommend for or against the product.	-1
Received my level a few days ago. Opened the box and it looks like a nice unit. Would not power on. No big deal, let me put a fresh battery in it. Powered up and I thought all was good. Counters are level and the readout shows 0.00 so I was happy. Turned it off and replaced it into the little carry case. The next day I resumed working on the project I needed the level for.. when I tried to power it up.. Nothing. The display flashed then "Err" and after a few seconds it went off. Pulled the battery and replaced with a new one. Same thing. "Err" So.. I got about 2 minutes use out of it. Will return it for a new one.	-1
I put this in a Tupperware to dry some already dry but slightly  damp items...and came back the next day, the items seemed MORE damp then when i put them in there. This does not work....sending it back for a refund.	-1
After using these for a while, the beads in the window turned black (not green). Put it through several recharge cycles, but the color never changed back.  I opened the box because I thought maybe the window had discolored, but it was still clear and the beads were black.  No amount of baking would change the color.  Will need to look for another solution.	-1
It last very little, or perhaps it ha a very little drying capacity. To regenerate it, it's long, very long process. The casing is of a very poor construction and low quality material.	-1
Since I purchased both this and the Eva-Dry I will use this review to compare the two. This pales in comparison to the Eva-Dry E-333. If money or space is super tight maybe this is a good option but otherwise the Eva-Dry is superior in every way except that it takes up more space (it's about 6"x6"x1.5").  Reasons:  It holds 100g of silica gel  It has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hours  It has a hanger attachment  The window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the color  The construction is much better - This one was almost separating at the edges and pink fluid was leeching out of the sides onto a paper towel once it was full	-1
Used once more than month ago, my eye lids still swollen! Bad product be aware!	-1
MY BAD, i ordered the wrong part.. 1/4" is not a standard.. know the size.. For me it was refrigerator water line.. different completely	-1
This did not fit the poly pipe I have.  It is undersized and required 2 hose clamps to get it even close.  If I'd found a replacement I'd have returned these...as it is they do work but you'll need extra strong hose clamps and heat for the pipe...not acceptable!	-1
They show it in the photo and add it in the description but no washer included. You can't use this without the washer.	-1
Comes as two separate pieces and did not have seal ring,	-1
Arrived missing the rubber gasket that is pictured and needed.	-1
NO RUBBER GASKER:  Seller shipped this item without the red rubber gasket.  I returned it and requested a replacement.  Seller shipped this item without the red rubber gasket AGAIN.  LOOSE FIT: Barb fit VERY loosely in a 3/4" garden hose.  Hose clamp required to prevent leaking.  Watts products have much better fit.	-1
The locking interferes with regular usage (you start pressing against the locking mechanism instead of the object as the tips flex).  Also, there's a sharp point that pokes through a hole in the opposite limb. Every time you accidentally engage the lock (see above), the point will stab you right in the pad of your thumb. I don't get it, it's like it was designed to stab you.	-1
Ordered wrong thing that' why I gave it two stars.	-1
30% of the LED's fail with in a few hours of use at 20 ma. 2 of the bags only had 10 LED's. I bought these in the past it is not the same LED anymore. Cheap Chinese LED.	-1
I tried to re-caulk the bathtub and it was hard to work and when it dries it is very soft and not stable.  I was hoping that it would work well but I can not recommend this product.	-1
I ordered the 2000ml erlenmeyer flask to use for a yeast starter. It arrived well-packed and unbroken (which is good!), but on closer inspection it looked like it has been used.  There were numerous scratches in the glass and areas of some kind of stuck-on debris on the inside and outside.  I had to scrub it down with a bottle brush and warm OxiClean solution to get out the crud.  The bottom of the flask is not very flat and it wobbles when you set it on a flat surface.  Wish I had spent a bit more $$ for the Pyrex brand flask.	-1
Item arrived with cracks and bubbles in the glass. There were also a strange series of brown rings "rubbed" into the surface of the flask that would not wash off. I can deal with the bubbles, and maybe the rings, but the cracks I cannot. I needed the flask for a project and will now have to make due some other way.  I have several other Karter Scientific flasks, all of which suffer from bubbles in the glass. Not a big deal to me since I am not applying direct heat, but might matter for others.  I am returning the item and may try to order another one, we shall see.	-1
I wanted to upgrade to a larger, 3L flask for making larger yeast starters for home brewing.  The flask arrived in fair condition, unbroken.  However, with numerous scratches and a couple bubbles in the glass, I'm going to assume that these flasks are factory culls from China, sold at discount prices.  I tested the flask with some water on my stir plate and found that the raised shape of the bottom prevented the spin bar from staying in place.  It took only a few seconds before the spin bar was thrown to the side.  Regardless of what speed I set the stir plate, the bar would quickly fling off the center.  That makes it unusable for use on a stir plate.  The flask is being relegated to other tasks, such as mixing ingredients.  But due to all the scratches and bubbles, I am hesitant to attempt heating anything in it.  I really don't want to be showered with glass shards.  In the end, a rather expensive bottle.  I will spend the extra $$$ and buy Pyrex or Kimax brand in the future.	-1
Very light duty - breaks easily like double thickness lightbulb glass.  not recommended for children or real lab work. came broken in undamaged box.	-1
Cheap junk. The glass is too breakable to use safely. I would not recommend, especially since the producer packs them in a thin, cheap box, with only one paper sheet between each beaker, which are nestled together. Recipe for broken disaster. I got (or didn't get, actually) what I paid for.	-1
Very light duty - breaks easily like double thickness lightbulb glass.  not recommended for children or real lab work.	-1
This item arrived quickly... but upon opening found it to be packaged in a hand taped box, and within a 'jiffy' type bag crudely stretched over the beaker for protection. A small part number/bar code label on the box unceremoniously described the item as new.  Closer inspection revealed a series of surface scratches up around the interior mouth area; as if it had previously been stacked together with other objects.  This item also wasn't exceptionally 'clean', as one would expect to find a new factory packaged item.  Don't know for sure, but was definitely left with the strong impression that this item was previously returned and/or otherwise not factory direct.  I would have never bought it had I known... and probably should return it, but my time is worth more that the effort required to do so... and now have a 500ml pencil holder.  Buyer beware.	-1
one came broken	-1
medium sylinder is broken and I cut my finger and knee from the broken cylinder. I am busy and I have to return, I don't like returning process myself:(	-1
Lines were all but gone, and glass had burnt spots. Look elsewhere.	-1
what garbage, ground glass fitting was barely ground. tip was broken, even the bulb had to be installed	-1
The dropper mechanism is non-functional, and the "ground" glass interface is not tight enough to stop evaporative loss. I also believe the glass to be improperly annealed based on breakage from other items shipped to me.	-1
Ordered two of these and both showed up broken. Packaging was undamaged - so my best guess is that the glass was improperly annealed.	-1
This reagent bottle is very cheap and should NOT be used for dangerous chemicals.  On the other hand, it has an old apothecary look if you were making a nice display for something like a bathroom.  The glass has bubbles and the stopper really doesn't seal well.  If you need a real reagent bottle, you will have to pay for a Kimax or something like that.	-1
The digital function of mine didn't work out of the box, I have to rely on the ruler markings. Made of kinda lightweight plastic, it bends easily so I'm not confident that it will stay accurate over the years. It's a cheap option, if you only want to use if for one project, it's viable.	-1
Per the  review, it was top in the same category product and purchased without hesitation and it made me  return it at the end. Even no chance to use it due to too much tight screw at the battery box. To unscrew I bought the micro driver but it was just another waste of money! I purchased the other item from iGaging instead. Very disappointed....	-1
1 week and all rusty	-1
I didn't even know counterfeit tape was a thing, but apparently I got some. The tab that's on the end of the roll to indicate where to begin pulling up was printed with the word "koptan". I'm assuming they meant it to read "Kapton", and can't imagine a reputable dealer would make that mistake.  The tape I got adheres pretty poorly, but luckily there is not a lot of movement where I have it, so it is staying in place. It is very easy to peel off though. It's just not worth the effort to return it given what I paid for it.  I'm sure most of the tape sold here is above board and good quality, but buyer beware. It can happen to anyone.	-1
I don't know much about kapton tape.  It doesn't adhere for anything... But is that the way its supposed to go?  I dunno.. but if you are looking for it to stick... it don't	-1
Not very adhesive. This tape will handle high temperatures, but don't expect it to stay in place for long.	-1
Very bad stuff as it doesn't stay stuck for very long.  Doesn't burn, even with a soldering iron to it, but the sticky is just horrible all the way to the end of the roll.  Put it on your heated bed and in a week it will start peeling away in spots.	-1
Original Review: LED uses less power than incandescent versions. If not tightly closed, it can flicker a bit, so only 4 stars.  Revision: After very mild field use (Standby as an EMT), the top cap came unglued and popped off. Luckily I found the spring in my pocket and super glued it and the cap back on. It's functional, but the LED in the tip of the unit is not stationary and can move around. Because of that, sometimes it is very dim until moved the LED is moved a mm or so, then it goes back to full brightness again. I like LED vs. Incandescent, but this is a poorly made product and should be avoided.	-1
makes me want to curse. this thing does not work reliably, turns itself off depending on angle.	-1
Ordered 2 sheets and both were extremely warped and unusable. So I ordered 2 replacement sheets and they are also warped. Small Parts belongs to Amazon, but seems to have NO QUALITY CONTROL !!!???	-1
Button doesn't work well and the light flickers like crazy. Difficult to hold button in just the right spot to get the light to stay on consistently.	-1

Made my own gaskets to fix leaks on my car.  worked great.  --update--  Originally this worked great, was easy to cut and shape.  But I've used it to make a gasket for a small piece on my car and the rubber becomes hard and brittle and fails after only 6-9 months.  I would not recommend this for use on a car that sits outside all day.	-1
These are great except someone decided to staple tags to these?  Gaskets with tiny holes in them are not good........	-1
Don't use this for gas. I purchased it to make gas can gaskets and it swells up when exposed to gas.	-1
Eh. At first I thought they were really neat. But they just keep falling off in spite of very careful application. Would not buy again. I will try another seller.	-1
The earlier reviewer was right, this is most definitely NOT 1/2 NPT threaded.  I AM an engineer, I DO know the difference.  It appears to be 21mm x 2mm straight thread.  A nut is provided, so it is clearly meant to be a bulkhead fitting.  A 1/2 NPT fitting can be forced on about three turns.  After that the torque required is so high that the valve's body is likely to break.  For low pressure, using a lot of teflon paste sealant, it might do, but I'd expect leaks at anything over about 10 psi.  (Typical pressure in a home system is 40 psi. and I've lived in one place where it was 115.)  I'll make it work, but if you don't have the proper 1/2 NPT die to rethread the thing, DO NOT BUY IT.	-1
Too small for some uses. I needed one that would let the water drop farther before turning on. This was only about 1 inch.	-1
What the heck would make them put a left-hand thread on the outer part and right hand threads on the inner part - when you mount it on the tank then torque into the inner fitting it undoes the outer threads.  Also it is kind of bulky making it so you can't mount it close to a wall in the tank.	-1
Plastic is brittle, and snaps when tightening the nut to compress the rubber washer.  While using 12" channel locks to cinch down the washer - (no more than 10 to 20 ft lbs), the nut snapped, forcing me to replace the entire fitting.	-1
Leaked horribly. I ended up with water everywhere in my truck after connecting these to a floorboard water tank.	-1

It was not as SENSITIVE as some declare. Mine may be defective, but sending it back after not picking up emanations from my largest transformers. It does detect radiation from common wiring and motors, but not the giants ... most puzzling.	-1
I bought this for Ghost Hunting and for that purpose it sucks, I tested it with the Ghost Meter a Gauss Meter and Mel Meter, whenever we got activity on our cams or DVR or audio, and the other meters went off, never once did thing detect anything, it's useless for Ghost Investigating, get a Rem Device they are 10x better than EMF Meters for detection.  DO NOT LISTEN TO ANY OF THE GOOD REVIEWS HERE, THOSE PEOPLE ARE EITHER PAID OR WORKING FOR PEOPLE THAT MAKE THESE, THEY DO NOT WORK, THEY ARE CRAP, DO NOT BUY THEM, I WOULD NOT GIVE 2 DOLLARS FOR ONE, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, IF YOU WANT A GHOST HUNTING EMF METER, GET A MEL METER, OR A REM DEVICE, DON'T WASTE IT ON THIS THING, IT'S CHINESE JUNK AND DONT ANYONE POST ANYMORE QUESTIONS ON HOW TO USE THEM OR GET THEM TO WORK, THEY WON'T THEY COME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS, DONT BUY PLAIN AND SIMPLE LISTEN TO ME.	-1
This gadget is not sensitive enough to be of  value.  I operate an observatory that takes geophysical measurements so I am accustomed to taking measurements of various kinds.  I have investigated the observatory thoroughly with very expensive equipment costing more than $2000 so I know where the "gremlins" are, and how bad they are.  I also work with a group that educates people on the health hazards of smart meters, so I was looking for a low cost product to recommend to people that can provide valid information about their home environments.  I tested this device against the pre measured  known areas in the observatory.  For household wiring, known "dirty electricity" areas, there was no response.  For a nearby cell phone tower, no response.  For a cell telephone on standby as well as initiating a call, no response.  Twelve inches from a running 1500 W microwave oven, no response.  The only reading that registered was about 18" from a running motor in an air purifier.  The reading went to 0 farther away.  By comparison other measurements show that biologically active intensities exist for a six foot radius around the air purifier.  This device is not sensitive enough in frequency response or sensitivity to be of value to detect possibly biologically active signals and protect people.  There are other inexpensive devices such as the iMeshbean that work much better.  I'm returning this one.	-1
I ended up getting one, like previous reviewers, with a rattling screw inside and when I shook it this nice shiny M3 screw fell out.  I decided I am not even going to plug it up and just send it back for fear of a fire or something.  Basically this is a piece of junk so BEWARE!!	-1
The box and packaging arrived undamaged, but there were multiple loose screws rattling around inside the case and the circuit board was loose in the frame.  I never turned it on because of the likely short circuit.	-1
use two and threw the rest in the trash, these so called "sanding drums" are made of plastic, they melted on the mandrels.	-1
the inserts are slipping while sanding which is not ideal when you work on detailed stuff as it leaved black marks on the wood if the sanding paper slid off	-1
Junk.  Couldn't get the sandpaper to tighten up, seem incorrectly sized.  Paper blew apart when I used it on my existing mandrels.	-1
You don't get what you pay for. I paid for 45 sanding drums and 6 drum mandrels. So far of the six drums I've tried six have failed. I have usable sanding drums (used) that came with my first moto-tool that I bought in the 1960's. Dremel sanding drums at $0.50 each would be a better buy than these drums $0.05 each. The might work on a low speed drill/tool but not on a single speed Dremel - etc..	-1
I am not impressed with these.  I can not get the smaller bands to fit onto the drums for anything.  I end up destroying the bands before getting them to fit.  The larger bands and drums do work together, they just don't last as long as other brands.  Two starts because I was able to make use of some of the bands, and can use other bands with the drums so it wasn't a total waste of money.  Not worth the money in my opinion.	-1
Does adjust making threading a nightmare.	-1
Would not thread properly, I had to buy a different one from another seller that worked correctly.	-1
Quality on this product has really gone downhill, they appear to be 2nds! Numbers and lines on cylinders is hit or miss, some are solid and full color, some are blotchy.  One of the boxes included in the shipment was shipped badly damaged knowingly, as there was no damage on the outside of the main box that would have accounted for the internal damage.  We are very disappointed in this product as we have been using them for years. We would not recommend this this product.	-1
POS. Packaging wasn't sealed. I used the blue spring which was supposed to be good for 150-200. It went off at 75 and 125 while filling the tank. Moved the screw back and forth and allowed me to go up to 150. This thing seems totally unreliable and you have know idea what psi will make it trigger. I used for 2 days until the new one arrived.	-1
The finish looks more like cheap chrome than stainless.  More so since I am adding a cabinet door to the existing stainless hinges.  This hinge is also built so poorly so that when it is half open, the barrels pull away from opposite members and bind the opening action.  Since I never used piano hinges that bind like this, I am not sure what will happen once this is screwed into the door and the cabinet.  Probably same bind or maybe even worse, since the flat parts can't adjust.	-1
refurbished item that worked for about three weeks before it quit working never pays to buy refurbished junk	-1
Used for 1 month and it started saying something about "cannot see pathway", please push button. Or something like that. It was trying  to start again, then stop. I had this unit for 30 days when this error started to occur. I called Amazon and they issued me a refund thank goodness. I have owned 3 Neato's, the first model worked well for years. But this XV-21, is a bad.	-1
I posted a "5" in my review right after buying this product, and was happy to do so. I'm changing it to a "1".  This is why.  I ordered this product December 14, 2014 for my brother and mother. It quit working December 2015, but my brother did not tell me it wasn't working.  By the time all the craziness of Christmas slowed down and I was able to take time to look back to see when I ordered the vacuum, I found out the vacuum was out of warranty as of January 5.  Today is January 7. The LCD screen is blank and it won't work.  I tried an online chat but no one responds when I click on "chat."  I am VERY disappointed in Neato.  I have a Neato, too -- actually I have two, models XV-15.  My Neatos are having problems too and will no longer work, either.  I haven't looked back to be sure but they're less than a year-and-half old if I remember right.  I had to replace the batteries in both of them at about 6 months, not a small expense but I liked it so much I decided I'd just do it and pretend it was the price of an inexpensive housekeeper.  When the Neato works -- it is a really great vacuum. I was so impressed when I got mine that I bought another plus one for my brother and another for myself in our two-story home. I told everyone I knew about how wonderful the Neato was.  I know of two people who bought a Neato, too, based simply on my enthusiastic recommendation.  Now I regret my endorsement.  One of my Neatos has now quit, too.  Because I didn't know my brother's Neato was no longer working, I thought it might be a fluke.  I bought another.  The replacement didn't work, either,, right out of the box. I called customer support who was no help at all.  They did give me permission to send it back and sent a replacement, in good time. That one isn't working either from the first charge.  I used to be a thoroughly enthusiastic evangelist on behalf of Neato, even showing people how wonderful it was when they came to visit. But I'm so disappointed now in how long the Neato lasts, how long the batteries last, and the problems I've had that I will again tell people about my experience -- but this time the free advertisement will not be good.  I hate being taken advantage of and think the company is taking advantage of people when they don't fix known issues and service is not a priority when there are problems..  I will let my experience be known in order to protect other people from my experience. I believe I have ample experience to post a qualified negative review -- I'm talking about five vacuums, counting the two that came and didn't work at all. (and yes, I know how to set it up and properly charge, etc.!)  Bottom line?  The Neato vacuum does a WONDERFUL job --  when it's actually working.  But the online help, the phone service, and the reliability of the vacuum stinks, big time.  I really liked my Neato. Very much.  But now my advice to others is AVOID THIS VACUUM.  If the above mentioned problems are ever resolved by the company, I'd happily become a customer again.  But I don't know how I'll ever know, since I won't risk another purchase. The trust is gone and I've come to believe the company doesn't care or it would fix the problems (do an internet search for customer reviews if you want to verify my comment about on-going problems).  Again, sad to say, don't make this purchase. I truly believe you'll regret your purchase, if your experience is like mine and so many others who have posted in customer reviews..	-1
I received this Neato from Amazon because my Vaccum broke three times . I am disabled so I can not use a regional Vaccum I have a pet I Vaccum everyday . I bought two Neato Vaccum but this will be the last one. After the year warranty even thou you have a history of having problems they will not help you. When they work they are great when they send you a replacement they are refurbished ones I had ones out of the box not work. I put up with them not docking stopping with a error clear my path I am very disappointed. I have had a regular Vaccum last 10 years these last three months.	-1
Ive read all about lg, irobot, etc... but upon recommendation went with this one, for it's $150 discounted price. Well, Upon opening I noticed that the device does not come with a remote control. an extra brush, a black plastic band and the charger station is all that's included next to the ample quickstart guide. no technical specs, no usermanual. the charger station is a flimsy plastic box, with a standard mickey mouse ear cable plug  adapter. It took me a while to find how the base works, but the unit always said nattery error 0002. So I had to go I nline to figure out you had to turn on the switch inside the dust bin. After charging for 10 minutes, with battery green, I set the unit to clean the house. It's definitely not seeking the most optimized route for cleaning, and makes surprisingly quite some noise, almost like a regular vacuum. the problems started later, when it needed my constant attention. It would get stuck under chairs, stop cleaning, and beep for rescue. It doesn't see dark brown furniture, and constantly bump into it.  And on my black and white patterned carpet it constantly gets lost, beep, and thinks it's surrounded by objects (there's nothing but a clean, patterned carpet).  It's like a baby needing constant attention. On top of that, half of my house is tiled. On the tiled part, it doesn't pick ip all dirt. Little pieces of paper, the size of confetti, often don't get picked up. But smaller pieces like dust, and nuts and crumbs do get picked up.  It doesn't work for me, I will return it and get an irobot!	-1
This cleaner has a vacuum in it that is easily twice as strong as Roomba's. It actually cleans the floor.  It doesn't cover the floor as efficiently as a Roomba in that it may miss some places.  It also doesn't have a side brush that gets right up against the wall.  A very missed item.  I have to sweep along the walls every so often to get the dirt out into the room so the Neato will pick it up. This is an update: Date is 12/15/14  Ive had this Neato XV-21 for some time now, bought it in Jan of 2013. Used it twice a week in a home of low pile and tile flooring of about 2000 sq. ft. living space. No undue wear and tear in the least.  I loved it when it worked.  Total, I have been through no less than 3 Neato's.  The two extra were sent by the company to me for problems with the units that they could not fix.  The problems are varied: Not being able to find its charging base, a wheel is stuck when it isn't, A new charging unit came in non-working order, battery error 0002 several times and the thing won't budge, does a cleaning cycle and doesn't go back out from its base to finish the job, batteries had to be replaces early, doesn't make it back to its charging base before the battery dies, gets lost,  now the latest thing is "open my dustbin and turn the switch to ON".  This advice on its liitle screen is not working the unit it totally dead.  Neato will not take it back even though I have almost been in constant communication with them during all these problems.  Which by the way have gone away from time to time, but usually for no longer than a couple of weeks.  So Im out in the cold.  If I were to do it over again I would not consider a Neato product.  They simply are not made well.  They do clean the best when they are working however.	-1
Sun faded in only a few weeks... almost all white signs now, very poor	-1

Tried using it to fasten a handle with a protruding steel screw to an angle grinder with a worn out aluminum receiving thread. It didn't work. I then used a liquid epoxy and that did the trick.	-1
Would not fix/hold together a broken piece for a stove burner grate . Attempted to repair it twice... Very Disappointed!	-1
The overall look and quality of the product is good. The inside dimensions published are off. When snapped shut, the I.D. or inside diameter is 3.5mm. I got a 10 pack and I measured them all just to make sure they were all the same size. They were. I purchased them to fit on a .195"(4.9mm) O.D. outside diameter cable and the cable clip broke the jacket when they were snapped on.	-1
When the package arrived I opened it and found the inner plastic bag was black with dust.  On pouring it out what I found was lots of bits of Magnet dust and chunks of the original Ferrite core.  Not even one out of the 10 was intact.  I had to swap magnets from good ones to make 3 complete units.  I took pictures but Amazon no longer lets people upload product pictures.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE!  They don't even bother to snap shut the plastic cases before shipping, so the ferrite cores drop out and then break up against each other. They are shipped in a flimsy envelope so there is no way they will survive. I bought a ten pack of the 5mm and the 9mm and they both arrived in the same condition.	-1
Flimsy, barely conducts electricity	-1
Clips lead plastic is too slippery. Need to hands to collapse the alligator clips. Material should be changed to have more friction.  Please replace mine when improvements are made.	-1
I purchased the roll. Rolls only have backing on one side. The adhesive glue is slightly squished outside the roll during manufacturing or storage, which results in the sides of the adhesive clinging to the edges during unrolling, making it unusable where flatness and even application are required.  I would not buy the roll again, as both rolls had the same defect. I might consider sheets if they had backing on both sides.	-1

Difficult to separate backing tape from reflective tape.  Not reflective in dark.	-1
I dunno how this stuff got 5 star reviews from anyone. It's annoying to use, having a paper/plastic backing you need to peel off, it's stiff and doesn't conform well to curves. It definitely would not last long on textiles as some other reviewer suggested (maybe we got different versions?). All that isn't so far out of the realm of normal though for prismatic tape; what really irked me is that it's really not that reflective. I find it no more visible in the dark with artificial lighting than regular white vinyl tape (which is cheaper, easier, and sticks better).	-1
How cheap this is.  Not cut very well.  Why do I have to trim it my self.  Junk	-1
Will not stick to metal bicycle parts!	-1
No bonding of product to center core = complete mess upon opening over-pack. Larger sizes may be fine, but anything of smaller size is a roll of the dice.	-1
Cheap, not very reflective...	-1
Not very reflective. you cant even see it at night next to the yellow or red until you are right on top of it. I would not buy this again.	-1
bottle leak , every  one i got	-1
I rarely give anything one star, but these bottles have been so terrible I find myself having no choice.  These bottles were to be used for oils that I wanted to keep on my dresser top to use at night for rubbing on painful areas of my body.  I have another re-purposed oil dropper bottle that has worked well, but I wanted to make other formulations to have handy.  I have had nothing but problems with these. I have found that they leak constantly.  Even standing on the table top, if I use them, I find my hands full of oil when I put the cap back on.  They are not moved around or anything.  Next time I use them, they somehow get oil everywhere.  It is a mess.  I made the mistake of grabbing a couple to take with me on an overnight.  I thought if I put them in plastic bags and kept them upright during transport, they would at least be okay to take with me on a short overnight.  I sure was WRONG.  When I opened up the bags, despite them being upright the entire time of transport (a matter of a half hour), the bags were LOADED with oil.  I am talking about a teaspoon of oil in each bag.  I don't know HOW they could do this.  It is a mystery to me.  None of the other bottles I had with me did this.  It makes no sense.  I don't know why these bottles leak like this.  I have been using this style of dropper bottle for many years and I have NEVER had anything so awful happen with them ever.  As soon as I can find others, I will replace these.  For now, they are all I have.  One star for this.  I really am frustrated with these.	-1

tops bottom out be 4 sealing, all of these bottles leak badly, TOTAL RIP OFF !!!!!    I would like to install in the manufactures area where the sun doesn't shine 4 making such a terrible product !!!   I lost 4 ounces of Liquid at 35$ an ounce ( that were returns after making a large mess in a display case, had 2 give them an extra bottle 2 make it ok.( 1 0z.), & 2 at 30$ oz ( from bottle transfers, i caught b 4 shipping ) !  so that was at a cost of $175 (5 oz) + $60 (2 oz) +s + 20 labels + 62 bottle seals, replacement bottles (/ tops that seal well ) 1.25 $ ea. ( no more cheap 1s 4 me). so ths cost $235 + $87.50 (4 bottles 70xs)=s $322.50 out of pocket + 4 hours of my time + $10.00 in labels (20).   SO IF U HAVE TIME + MONEY TO WASTE LET ME RECCOMEND THIS BOTTLE COMPANY !!!!!	-1
These are junk	-1
Nice device for some basic hobby work.  But there is no way to adjust the loupes for a sterioscopic focus.  Still have to close one eye. You'd be much better off saving up for a good optivisor with different lenses.	-1
This is such a strange device.  It provides good magnification, equivalent to a loupe.  But, you need to have the subject material very close to the lens, about 1 inch.  At these distances, stereoscopic vision does not exist - each eye is seeing a different part of the object.  It is pretty heavy, so even as just a hands free loupe holder, it's not very useful.  The light is somewhat helpful.	-1
to see anything it has to be within 1 inch of the lens	-1
Pile of garbage.  Focal distance is unusably short, like one inch away.  What are you going to work on at one inch from your face.  The manufacturing quality is awful, the whole thing is just junk.  Buy something else instead.	-1
These are way too sensitive for general use.  Leave these to a clock maker.	-1
poor quality and hard to use	-1
Dont waste your money. these are crap period! comes with no batteries slide off your face. and you have to hold what ever you are working on right up to the lens. Very hard to work on anything by that.	-1
Dont waste you money ...and poorly package you pay cheap ..you get nasty.. Will we ever learn ..of course not	-1
I DON'T LIKE WRITING NEGATIVE REVIEWS BUT, THIS IS THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE THROUGH AMAZON; ALL I CAN SAY IS SOMETIMES I'M HIGHLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT SOME OF THE REVIEWS; IN THIS CASE, IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE THEM A STAR I WOULDN'T HAVE; I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE SELLER; UPDATE TO FOLLOW...  I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL MAGNIFIERS AND LOUPES THROUGH AMAZON AND THOUGHT THIS TO BE A GREAT CONCEPT; I MIGHT AS WELL PUT WHATEVER I WANT TO VIEW RIGHT ON MY EYEBALL; THIS IS HOW BAD THESE ARE; VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND I DO DEAL WITH CERTAIN CHINESE COMPANIES... COVEAT EMPTOR= LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!  THIS IS AN UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: AMAZON CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND WITHIN 3 DAYS THEY GRACIOUSLY REFUNDED MY MONEY; THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE (JOANNE) IS WONDERFUL; I MADE SOME SUGGESTIONS TO THE COMPANY AND IF THEY CAN IMPROVE ON THE CURRENT MODEL, THESE WILL SELL LIKE HOT CAKES,.	-1
Very poor quality. Was not impressed at all. All plastic, not adjustable focus, just crappy plastic junk in my opinion.	-1
I bought this toothpaste thinking it would be safer for me and my kids. Nowhere in the description does it give any indication that it might be unsafe. I ordered 7 tubes. They arrived and I read the label. Contains trace amounts of lead, not recommended for children or pregnant women. Since I am pregnant, this product is absolutley useless for my family. A little heads up would have been nice!	-1
This toothpaste is like brushing with water, it does not foam up at all like others would and it does not leave my teeth feeling clean. I'll use what I have but I will not be buying it again. I've used better organic toothpastes.	-1
Me and my wife didn't like this stuff, It made my teeth sensitive, and it has a california warning for trace amounts of lead. We used it a few times and threw it out.	-1
Tried but did not care for this item! Exactly as advertised. This item is just as pictured.arrived promptly and in good condition.	-1
Mine quit same day it arrived....laser beam just quit.	-1
I have purchased more than a half a dozen of these devices for my compressed air lines.  Even though my pressure is set at 110 PSI, I have had two of these that fail.  I have had to remove them and return.  Good value but poor quality control.  I now buy from a different manufacturer.	-1
Save your money and go find a commercial landscape supply and get an adapter with a longer barbed section.  Getting this to seal up with heavy poly pipe(200 psi rating-very thick wall) was a pain in the rear end.  Not impressed.  I didn't want plastic at the bottom of that trench(4' deep) so I ordered these.  I hope I don't have to dig it up later because it's leaking.	-1
Laser light stopped working after 9 uses.  Now I don't know if it is correct or not or if it is calculating the temp where I want !  Works well After I put in a new battery.  The battery that comes with it is IN the handle. Wasn't until I swapped out for a new battery that I found out that the one supplied is shrink wrapped before they put it in.  VERY TIGHTLY SHRINK WRAPPED. Hope this lasts	-1
Apparently my wife and I are zombies. Both our temperatures taken at our stomachs, after lifting  a shirt, measured 85 Fahrenheit. I got the same temperature when I measured exposed arms and face, but I  wanted to make sure the cooler room was not interfering. Had it been a couple degrees off I would keep it, but 13 degrees? I even tried it again the next day to make sure that shipping extremes had disappeared. No help.	-1
Sellers use smoke and distortion about product accuracy in the listing. Poor accuracy in the device.  Listing hides understanding by reporting accuracy as "+/- 2%". Correct units would be plus or minus degrees Fahrenheit or Centigrade.  At their website the misinformation continues, reports this same %, as either plus or minus 2 degrees F OR C, which are completely different. I think what their sales people mean is that the true temperature when the device reads 100C is somewhere between 98-102C.  This would translate to the Fahrenheit scale as 212F, or 100C, so if the device measures 212F, the true temperature is somewhere between 208.4F to 215.6F  This implies that the accuracy of the device gets worse as the temperature increases?  OK for ball park measurements, but if your food needs to be at 180F, you need to measure at 184F to be sure, because of device accuracy.	-1
Mine must have been defective.  The 9v Battery which was not included would not fit on the terminal.  I have to open one side more, then when I was finally able to open and then had to close as best I could with needle nose pliers, the unit, even though was off would continue to overheat and draw all of teh battery power.  I ordered a different brand (was a green one) and worked out of the box.	-1
This isn't the most accurate, especially when it changes its readings just by flipping the handle 180 degrees. I understand it's inexpensive, but I would hope for some more consistency. If anything this gives you a baseline as long as you always hold the handle the same direction and you are the same distance from the same place you are reading from. I would say it's also about 10 degrees off. If you want something a little more accurate and consistent, spend the extra dough and get something better.	-1
Bought this for the kitchen, because non-stick pans fail if overheated. I just tested this against a lab thermometer, and at 315F it reads 257F. No wonder my pans kept dying even while using this tool.	-1
I just opened. Can is only 1/2 full!!!! I feel like I got ripped off!  I would not recommend buying this as either they use a big can fill it half full or it is intend to make you think you got full measure. If this is a mistake I would like a replacement. If not intended, they have QC problems. NOT HAPPY.  Great product but got only 1/2 of what I purchased.	-1
Does not work, poorly made.	-1
The plastic Spherical joints on the mount are very stiff and difficult to accurately position for rear  viewing on a minivan dash.  Trying out the mirror in the vehicle with taping down the base was not effective.  To adjust the mirror, I followed a suggestion in the comments to slightly lub. the joints. This loosened up the joints but now it wouldn't hold position!  In handling the assy. the spherical socket fingers cracked and fell off!  The assy. is now useless.  The variation in plastic molding of the spherical connection parts probably creates a tolerance problem in some assemblies! Some work some break!  I don't recommend this design for application to a vehicle.	-1
The KA3005D looks good in the pictures, has nice feature set, small footprint and low price, a perfect bench power supply for my home lab. However in reality it feels low quality, has noisy fan (which gets even worse when you increase the load) and once in a while, when I turn it on it makes a loud rush current 'wamp' sound that doesn't instill confidence.  I decided to return it and look for a used agilent/hp power supply on a large auction site. It will cost a little bit more, it will have less features, but will be of high quality and will last for years.  Edit: returning this product does not go Amazon low cost prepaid shipping and it costed me $28 to return it, in addition to the original $10 shipping. Downgrading from 'I don't like it' to 'I hate it'.	-1
Purchased April 16th, and it's now June 4th and nothing has shown up. Tracked with no. provided and China Post shows no information.	-1
Being a hvac tech I go thru certain tools rather quickly and thought (knowing better) I would get this meter to save so money when I need measurements to be accurate I can't trust this because the measurement jumps around and both probes in the same location are up to 4 degrees off	-1
I don't know if this refractometer works or not as I haven't tried it .I am seriously considering returning it because it came with the fastening clasp missing. (And yes ,I searched the box .It is not in there.)This could not have been a mistake because the lid won't go completely down without it. The refractometer may be just fine but if the case won't close it won't be for long and I shouldn't have to use a rubber band to hold it shut because it is supposed to be brand new. So I can't recommend this seller because of the damaged case .	-1
I got this for homebrewing but found out that it was only in Brix when I received although the description stated it had OG readings also. I had to return this but that was easy enough. I got this one instead.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GG0TDK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_21	-1
The bozos who designed this thing burned the EXACT SAME SERIAL NUMBER into every single unit.  They all report NT2009101400.  This means that if you control two or more via USB, there is no reliable way to be 100% sure which supply you're sending commands to.  Very dangerous if you've got two voltages on your test board, and the lower input can't tolerate the higher voltage.  Only workaround is to buy a USB-serial adapter, which jacks the price up by another $9.	-1
Low quality tool holders. The "E" style holder wasn't machined correctly and caused a great deal of chatter and broken inserts while doing light facing cuts. Problematic especially when using more expensive inserts. The other tool holders seem fine for the limited time I used them. I am upgrading toolholders to better quality at the current time. You are better off spending your money elsewhere as these are a crap shoot at best.	-1
The plastic smells absolutely awful.	-1
This came with a Nasty fingerprint which can't be removed. How hard can it be to wear gloves folks? Don't bother with this one.	-1
I bought this to place on my mailbox stand that is made of wood. I placed it up at night and the next morning and was on the ground. I was hoping to save the sticker but it was stuck together and would not open.  It is a very cheap sticker, nothing more. I would not buy or recommend to anyone.	-1
Wanted to use this as a mortar to connect some firebricks to the inside of a stone block firepit.  Firepit looks a lot like the one on the package label.  This is not that sticky once mixed and I would select something else if I needed to do this again.  Also, the bucket arrived in a very busted up cardboard box and the bucket was only about half full.  Bucket is really hard to open and I ended up just prying it off with a screw driver.  Not that happy with my experience with this product.  Dries fast.	-1
My wife never has high blood pressure and this says she does. It is over 15 mmHg off on readings and that is a serious issue.  I went to my Dr to have it checked and verified this device is not accurate for reading blood pressure.  You are mostly paying for the bag (That mine ripped the first time the velcro was undone on the side. Which is not a big deal, but I wanted to measure my blood pressure and this doesn't work!.) I have tried contacting customer service about a possible faulty measuring 'Sphygmomanometer' and to get a replacement.  They never contacted me back and that has been over a week now. I am definately going to return this product and report to Amazon.com customer service and satisfaction because this item is not up to PRIME standards and is falsely rated.  Proceed with extreme Caution!  They are selling product in violation of ToS by adding a disclaimer that says:  "Important information Legal Disclaimer Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product. Please see our full disclaimer below."  ****Basically they are saying they can send you whatever they want and don't read or look at any of the pictures or product information***  Did not receive correct device I ordered and was not properly calibrated.  There is no 0 on device to even have it calibrated.  You can't calibrate it at 20mmHg without have another accurate device.  I expect a full refund and will be sending this inaccurate item back if I don't have from you and contacting Amazon.com about your "legal disclaimer" which violates Seller account policy and constitutes as fraudulent item being sold.  There is also a leak somewhere because Air is always flowing out with tubes connected properly and have had a Doctor examine this device for accuracy and it has failed on all 4 tests preformed by a professional. Doctor and R.N at our primary care physician. It reads my blood pressure at 162/78 which is ridiculous.  Get what you pay for.  Also stethoscope did preform as expected.  I could hear everything fine and my heart beat as expected, but the Cuff is cheaply made and leaking after the 3rd or 4th use.	-1
Says solid rubber - but it is hollow and under the weight of a heavy trailer on a hill, I doubt it would work properly.  I'm 200 lbs and with my foot pushing down on it, it deflects.  False advertising for them to call it "solid" when the rubber is only about 1" thick.	-1
I do not like this toothbrush in any way. It is cheaply designed, with an uncomfortable grip, sparse bristles that do not clean, and a joke of a gimmick with its useless, rubber polishing flaps.  This toothbrush only provides an awkward, unsatisfactory brushing experience that leave teeth yearning for a different brush. I cannot stand this toothbrush.	-1
missing set screws in some locations	-1
Do not waste your money, this test regular water and alkaline water and there is no difference at all, anything that is wet there is no difference	-1
pure junk I can't believe it's sold on Amozon  Buy something else not this.	-1
Ugh. Bought these to use on the fly. Horrible. You dip it and no color change. Unless you are extremely off. LIke 14 or 2.	-1
Hard to open and use. Gross pH measurements only - somewhat difficult to match color, as you have to go by the HUE, not the opaqueness of the color on the strip.	-1
I ADMIT THE  TAPE IS DUCK. THE NFL LOGO IS WHAT YOU PAID FOR, THE AMOUNT OF TAPE IS WHAT PISSED ME OFF. NOT WORTH IT TO ME.  LIVE N LEARN.	-1
I did not receive the same product as what is pictured here, but so be it. What really frosts my jaw with this toothbrush is that I only get 5 or 6 brushings out of it before the battery runs out of gas and needs to be recharged. I bought this product because Braun is supposed to be a highly acclaimed German engineering & manufacturing company. They really disappointed me with this product.	-1
This idiotic device is designed to stop for a moment every 30 seconds.  That drives me crazy, and you can't turn that feature off.  Never again! I eventually stopped using it and now only take it with me when I travel. Maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll forget it in a hotel bathroom.	-1
cheap ass plastic...did not last under low use	-1
Too hard and sharp.  I felt worried to use it, even on a 5 year-old because one wrong move... they flinch on you and the tip will pop right into their eardrum.  All of the tips are too pointy, it's like they designed them to go all the way to the eardrum.  With correct optics, you shouldn't have to go that deep.  Wish I would have sent this back before my return period was up.	-1
I can barely see anything through the small viewing window.  I didn't realize it was going to be such a small window to view through.  If I had to do over again, I would order the larger viewing window and skip the curettes, never ended up using those at all.  I bought to use for our newborn to check her ears.  It was so hard to tell what I was looking at through the small window I didn't know how far I was in and may have accidentally hit the babies eardrum because she started screaming pretty loud.  I'm a technician and work with tools for a living including boroscopes so I thought it would be a cinch to look in the babies ear, it definitely was not using this tool. It may work for an adult in a pinch as the ear canal is bigger and easier to see but not for a baby or small child.  I don't use it anymore out of fear of sticking it in too far on accident because I can't see very well through the tiny window.  Also, it gets dark the further you go in the ear the light isn't bright enough to see the ear drum well.  Looks cheaply made maybe $1 to manufacture.	-1
This was suppose to fit 1/2 inch id but it was Way too small It probably fit tubes that are 3/8 inch id. I brought 3 bags of these fittings for my 1/2 id irrigation tubing. The bags did state od 1/2 inch but they do not fit. I have returned them. I rate it 2 stars.	-1
Very light duty - breaks easily like double thickness lightbulb glass.  not recommended for children or real lab work.	-1
Sent them back because right on the jar it says they are "approximate" measurements.  What good is that?	-1
My door will not close with it on. I returned the product	-1
The water pic is fine but the sonic tooth brush is horrible. I've used Philips Sonicare and still use/have a Wellness Ora Care sonic toothbrush. Both work well. That said I wanted a water flosser but didn't want to have two appliances to plug in and taking up space so I bought this Waterpic Ortho Care with the Sonic brush built into one unit.  The water flosser works well but the sonic toothbrush not so much. The toothbrush has two settings, Low and High. The low setting doesn't feel like it's doing much of anything. If I touch the bristles with my finger on the low setting the hardly move. On the high setting it feels like a jackhammer in my mouth. It's way too harsh and uncomfortable compared to my other two Sonic toothbrushes. I called Waterpic about it. They said they have other models that may work better. Unfortunately,  I think Waterpik makes a great water flosser but not Sonic toothbrushes. I don't want to send this back to Amazon but dang, I so wanted this to work. :/	-1
I have 3 of these and love them. Use once a day. However, I bought one for my brother late December and was happy that he got it, but he just visited me and saw mine and told me he didn't get the toothbrush??? So I just learned and am going to "try" to rectify the situation.	-1
This unit was awesome for the first 10 months or so. Now every so often the toothbrush turns on by itself, or the button won't work without a struggle. It is annoying hearing it kick on randomly, and have to go turn it off. The machine works fine! It is the tooth brush that causes trouble. If there is a model without the brush, I would get that - and then get a sonicare for your brush.	-1
I have an old old Colgate Via-jet 7500 that I have used for 20 years.  I encouraged my daughter to buy a water pic. She got the Waterpic WP900 with the pic and toothbrush. Well, she gave it up shortly after getting it and I inherited it.  So I put my trusty Colgate machine away and tried the Waterpic. I was also eager to try the fancy electric toothbrush. However I got no brushes with my unit. When I went to purchase brushes I was turned of by the ridiculous price. As a matter of course,  I boycott any company and product that I consider to be price gouging. Once I began to use the machine I found it to be very flimsy and light. Touch it wrong and all the bits fall off on the floor including the top, tool compartment, and wand. I had to remove all these bits. The machine's performance is no better than my old unit and the base and motor compartment is also light weight and prone to tumbling. When all is said and done, I prefer my old unit and have switched back to using it. If a product is flimsy and jiggly, it is not nice to use. For a device costing this much I would expect more robust build quality and reasonably priced accessories.	-1
trash!! hate it!!! - super crazy loud !!!!	-1
It's a good product, while it lasts. The brush battery died after two years and two months of use. You guessed it, two year warranty, and they weren't willing to do anything besides a $5 rebate (!) in compensation. Two year warranty or not, that is not long enough for a cordless brush.	-1
I purchased this about 10 months ago... the toothbrush no longer hold a charge long enough for me to brush my teeth.  The toothbrush is now really useless.  The water pik and tank is still workable.  But the toothbrush is truly useless.  I cannot find a replacement for the Waterpik toothbrush.  That being the case... I do not recommend this item to purchase.  I am now going to throw it out and get an Oral B circular electric toothbrush.  l am sorry to lose this as it was a waste of $$$$.  It was a good toothbrush while it lasted, but I don't see 10 months reliable to qualify this item as a GOOD product.  I don't see why Waterpik does not offer a replacement toothbrushes? There is NO way to replace a battery.  I opened it up and looked inside... and found no battery.  It was just all electrical connections.  I consider a company who manufactures products that become useless in a short time... and DOES NOT OFFER REPLACEMENTS to be unethical and not a reputable company.  I will never purchase from them again@	-1
Worked well for about a year and a half then started clogging and theres no way of cleaning the internal parts of the Jets or on off button. Really cheaply made. .	-1
I had an oral b floss action brush before and it did such a better job of keeping my teeth plaque free for the whole day. By the end of the day my teeth feel gross using this toothbrush. This just vibrates and doesn't spin or move. I am just commenting on the toothbrush and not on the waterpik. Can I return a used item?	-1
Crap super thin and bar code WILL NOT come off!!! Pisses me off and on top of it "NO RETURNS ON THIS ITEM"!!!	-1
RIPPED  IN THE FIRST WIND , & I SECURED IT VERY WELL ,  PLASTIC JUST DISINTEGRATED , have to pay more  and get  a metal sign  next time .	-1
Cheapest bit of trash. Paper thin with zero rigidity. Totally unable to stand on its own without being glued to something else. Even more comedic was the no peal UPC sticker adhered to the front corner of each sign-over another UPC sticker. Anyone with a third grade education would have known to apply it to the back if at all. Totally worthless to anyone.	-1
Junk, large UPC code posted in one corner that is not shown in picture, Has large seller's inventory sticker stuck on the front which is very difficult to take off. (takes sign printing with it) They are very flimsy so I glued them to a harder service and the glue ate through the sign in several places to further damage the sign.	-1
Drippers in these bottles only pick up about 1/4 full liquid while using with e-liq. Drippers seem like very low quality.	-1
This is a vibrating toothbrush that is almost totally useless. I can't believe Panasonic has their name on it.	-1
I use a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush on a daily basis, but wanted something more portable for travel.  I had hoped this battery-powered toothbrush would be a good stand-in, but it is no better than manual brushing.  What a disappointment.  I wish I could have read the Panasonic operating instructions before actually getting it.  Step five says it all, "Brush by moving the toothbrush in the same way as when you brush by hand."  The real test is putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush and turning it on...outside your mouth.  Users will not see any toothpaste or toothbrush motion--just a buzzy sound.  Now try that with any Philips electric toothbrush--active bristle motion and toothpaste flying in all directions.  I'm confident Philips electric toothbrushes help with good oral hygiene.  My mouth feels clean after each use and dental check-ups have never been better.  You can get that same clean feeling with this Panasonic electric toothbrush too, but only if you brush well by hand.  Save yourself some money, and instead buy a dollar store toothbrush and travel cap.  It will do just as good a job.	-1
Does not work well as a conduction gel. Dries too fast. Sticky too.	-1
Ordered this with my slendertone ab belt on recommendation of a reviewer. It made the pads gukky. I only used it 1 time.	-1
$15 too much for shipping. no sale. Amazon, shame on you for allowing high shipping rates.	-1
Not one out of four work.  No quality control, none were even tested. This is the case with so many items from china. No response from vendor or from amazon.	-1
The coating on these is hard plastic and does not crimp easily.  Also the metal doesn't run the full length of the plastic sleeve.  You have very little area for crimping your wires in.	-1
not described correctly, waiting for a response from seller	-1
These connectors are sub quality, would not buy again, very disappointed, the insulators come off when you try to unplug them . Poor quality	-1
suck don't stay together	-1
Very expensive for a very small amount of material you receive. I would consider other brands first. The stuff about Cobalt, not sure if it is true since I have used them for over ten years.	-1
this product is started messing up big time .you know these products only started out good and then something goes wrong like they're not made to last this thing is all over the place	-1
Not initially happy.  Meter arrived in a timely manner (prime), good shape, well packed, but the 'sponge' in the cap was bone dry.  It may work, I don't know.  I got 6 drops of wetting agent out of the supplied pack which is NOT enough to wet the sponge. So I still can't use it, I have to buy the "electrode storage solution", wait for it to show up, then soak the probe before I can use it.  HMD Company should at least provide enough solution to wet the sponge for at least the first use!!!  And the FUNNY thing is, the instructions says, "Excess solution can be poured out" - THAT made me laugh!!	-1
Since I first got this ph tester I have had trouble.  The calibration keeps changing.  My grow is technical and requires accurate ph  readings for proper nutrition absorption. I have a friend who has one of these and he has similar problems.  Currently when I calibrate it, the pen is 7 points over the calibration solution.  I bought another solution to see if it was a bad bottle of ph 7.  No, it is this pen.  It started to climb the more I used it, now reaching 77 on a calibration, so I have to add 7 to each reading to be sure it is what I want.  This same company make a ppm pen and it has lost its ability to demonstrate accurate pp.'s.  I guess this is just a scab outfit among the many these days.  I am switching to " Blue Labs" products as I have been told by a number of growers that they are tried and true.	-1
Can't say I was happy with this unit.  It came NOT WORKING, with the LCD screen compromised and half black, and so much interior corrosion that the battery prong came off in my hand.....Obviously used and returned.  My last time I'll buy my meter on line...	-1
does not include the pouch for the soap	-1
I bought this to go with my new shop sink.  I also bought the gallon of liquid soap shown on Amazon that is a suggested co-purchase.  I guess I did not look at the reviews because it can not be used with the suggested soap or just any liquid soap.  Furthermore I could not get it to open.  Now that I found out I won't be using it that doesn't matter whether I can open it or not.  I don't see any reason to purchase any device or product based upon the ink jet cartridge system.  It also doesn't appear that well constructed so it probably wouldn't hold up to moderate use.  I would suggest another soap dispenser.  It took longer to fabricate the sink cabinet so I did not get around to installing the soap dispenser until it was too late to return.  I fault Amazon and the supplier for not providing information on how this product must be used.  There is no excuse for omitting critical information from the displayed product literature nor suggesting soap that can't be used in the device.	-1

These things are tiny compared to the 1-1/4 inch hooks I bought at the big box stores.  Someone needs a new tape measure and it isn't me.	-1
Sorry but not impressed with this stuff, let it get tacky like the directions state, put together and held in place just in case for 2 minutes. Withing a few minutes my feather lite drink holders were falling on the floor. Had to use screws. It might be a fine sealant but certainly useless as glue. Perhaps I was using it for an application it was not intended for. I didn't think so.	-1
I've been through 2 of these signs and the ink being used is NOT UV ray resistant. They fade very quickly to blank white rectangles. At the previous price of $5 each, it was worth the minor  Irritation of reattaching the sign with four screws. Now, tho I see the PRICE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED - seller seems to be trying to take advantage of hurricane victims, IMHO.	-1
Got mine today, unpacked, and the lower spindle barely moved. Untightened all the friction screws, almost soaked it in oil and it got slightly better, but the spindle clearly is not straight and without using the complete handle, the lower spindle does not turn freely at all. The upper one is fine.  Overall it looks "O.K.", for almost $100 I would have expected a better quality and maybe even something like a quality control before the product gets shipped out.  To me, this looks overpriced and probably not any better than the Chinese $30 vises. Let's see if the replacement is any better.	-1
Piece of junk.  That's the best way to put it.  I wrote a separate review of the 5 inch version of this clamp so I won't go into detail about this one.  I decided to give this one a try, thinking that the smaller size (and about half the weight of the 5 inch version) might just make this vise usable--WRONG!  Very poorly machined and the cross action slide is very tight.  Even after disassembling and oiling well with 3 in 1, I could not use the cross action turn knob with my hand holding only the round knob--you have to put your hand across the entire knob and leverage the entire knob in order to turn it.  Everything on this vise is just very poorly machined.	-1
Returned it.  The guide shaft goes through the center of the clamp where you'd hit if with your drill bit.  Poor design.	-1
Too small for the RG8X Coax.  Get the 7mm it's the perfect size.	-1
This does NOT bond all or even most plastics. It may work well for you, but do some research before trusting this product blindly.	-1
Not really 5 min epoxy. I have used the gray jb quick weld and that sets up in about 5 min. This stuff took more like 15 min before it did not have to be held in place. I had given this  2 stars. After the second use, I now give it 1 star. After an hour and it still will not hold parts in place.	-1
The tube that I got had different amounts of product.  The epoxy never set and remained soft when attempting to repair a nylon connector, even when parts were mixed equally.  It fixed the cracked refrigerator shelf, but did not stand up to any pressure when weight was applied, breaking.  The tube dried up after careful wiping between uses and became jammed.  If you need a light tan / white color for your plastic repair, this may be the only alternative. It only works on hard plastics.  I got excellent strength and bonding results on soft and hard plastic with the J-B Weld Steel Reinforced Epoxy product, although it dries with a dark gray color.	-1

Although advertised as setting to a hard permanent bond, this epoxy never dried hard enough for my use.  I tried to reattach a refrigerator ice door hinge that broke apart.  The hinge was part of a housing that was pre-molded and cannot be replaced.  Even after two attempts and ample time to harden and set, the best I got was a rubbery consistency.  It was also easy to peel off.  I wasted a lot of time trying to get this epoxy to work.  I can only see its use on toys or figurines that do not require tensile strength be exerted on them.  I'm using J-B Weld's polyurethane version (Plastic Bonder) and after one hour it has set to a rock hard bond...	-1

The software that came with the Hantek loaded flawlessly.  However, that was the end of the flawlessness.  The device displayed the square wave calibrator waveform well but the probes supplied with the unit could not be calibrated.  When I attempted to display a 60 Hz, 30 VAC PtoP wave form it displayed a distorted square wave.  I looked through the documentation to see if I was overloading the device's input parameters but I couldn't find anything referencing input limitations.  The documentation provided with the device, even the on-line manual was woefully inadequate.  I have been in the electronics industry for over forty (40) years and I may have erred in my attmpts to operate the o'scope but if that's the case it should have been obvious when I referred to the manual.  Perhaps I am dense or even stupid but I would not recommend this o'scope to a friend.	-1
While the switch itself seems to be of good quality, I think that the Amazon listing could be a little misleading especially for non-EE customers (most of us).  The title lists that max current as is 20A and it is but it looks to me, and I am no expert so could be wrong, that this only applies to certain types of loads.  The information is actually in the product description in this cryptic string: Ue : 660V;Ith : 20A Le : AC-15 4A/5AAC-3 5.5AAC-2 7.5AAC-4 1.5A The AC-15, AC-3 and AC-4 codes appear to tell you the maximum current for specific "utilization categories".  With literally hours of research, what I believe this means is that the highest load for the blower motor I want to use this on (AC-3 Squirrel cage motor), the maximum current rating is 5.5 amps, a far cry from the 20 amp maximum rating.  Again, I am a novice so I could be misunderstanding what I have read but my 1/2 HP motor uses 9 amps at maximum speed (12-13 amps to start) so this might not be the right switch to use for blower motor control.  If they are going to list an item on a retail site like Amazon, they should really decipher the codes designed for electrical engineers to help prevent the rest of us from using this in an application it is not designed for.  At a minimum, they should provide links to the data sheet which I cannot find anywhere on the internet.  The only application that I have been able to find this described for on other websites is switching between lines for an ammeter.  So unless you know how to interpret the technical specs, find a product that is designed for your specific application.	-1

Absolutely filthy when they arrived. They aren't all the same size by as much as a 16th of an inch (with variations on both i.d. and o.d. numbers). I sorted through them and found four that met my needs, cleaned them up, and tossed the rest.	-1

I mean literally! The unit started smoking near the trigger area as soon as a battery was installed without having been turned on. The smoke stopped and I was able to measure temperatures on 3 surfaces, but then the upper trigger area got hot to touch (gradually got hotter after 2 min of non-use) which forced me to remove the battery for safety. The next morning, the unit didn't turn on at all. The company obviously dropped the ball on QA. Returning the unit.	-1

I used to be a pipefitter and Blue Monster teflon tape from Millrose is top shelf schtuff as far as teflon tape goes. But this marketer, Plumbers Outpost, will cost you 450% MORE than purchasing this same exact roll of Teflon next time you're at the big box hardware store that has a name 5 letters long, and looks like a blue box with a blue roof on top.	-1
It took me about 30 seconds to determine that the one I just received was junk. No software CD included as advertised first of all and secondly, the switch wouldn't move. I did plug it in an USD socket and my 'puter recognized that a new piece of hardware was plugged in but that's all. Maybe if the manufacturer had at least included the software, I may have been able to do a work around. I'll see if I can find a decent though a different brand. Back to AMAZON for a refund	-1

I received the tape today and I immediately noticed it was way too thin to be 2.7mils so I measured it with a high precision micrometer and it's 1.1 mils. Even the original product description on the 3M site says 1.4mils (Attached screenshots). The thickness is NOT 2.7mil as stated so it's false advertising. I even paid same day delivery because I needed it badly. I'm so disappointed.	-1

This filament is a very bad quality. I tried 3 different filaments from this brand and they all are very bad in every term. I used two other filaments in the past and they are both much better, not even comparable to this one. One good thing in this one, is that it does not smell bad as ABS usually does. But it makes me wonder whether it is ABS at all or not.  If you want an advice, I recommend Hatchbox filament, it prints beautifully, this filament is a junk, not a real ABS I believe, but some mixture. For those of you who will think I work for Hatchbox, no I am not, you can open my review profile and see how old it is and how many different reviews are in there and none of them are related to this niche :) I recommend Hatchbox sincerely, I only bought this one, because hatchbox was out of stock that week. I filed a return for this one and replaced with black ABS from hatchbox. By the way, SainSmart TPU is horrible quality. I had their PVA too, but can not really comment on it, because I had adhesion issues big time, but that may be related to my own error. I do not have much experience with PVA printing.	-1
Bought three spools, two white and a black. The black jammed half way through the roll, diameter of filament is inconsistent. Was sent a feedback form around the same time of the jam, when I went to leave a negative review I was prompted to contact customer support - well they didn't bother getting back to he so here you go. Nothing worse than a filament that ruins a six hour print job, will never buy again.	-1
First, I will say that this is the first and only PLA filament I have ever tried, so I do not know if it is specifically this PLA or just PLA in general that is horrible. I've printed hundreds of hours in ABS for almost a year now and not a single clog or jam. I've tried over a dozen prints with this PLA in the last couple of weeks, and all have failed because the nozzle would eventually jam. After each jam I would adjust the temperature and speed settings trying to find a combination that worked. Prints would usually start out looking great, but the nozzle would jam on every single one. Most jams would be easily dislodged, but currently I have one that I can not remove. I am to the point that I am most likely going to have to purchase a new $100 extruder for my printer. I will never use PLA in my printer again.  In all fairness, I will say that I have used this SainSmart brand in ABS and have never had a problem and will continue to use their brand of ABS if I ever get my printer working again. I will never use this or any brand of PLA again though. I wanted to try it because I've heard it doesn't warp/shrink as bad as ABS, but if all PLA is as prone to jamming as this spool was, it is not worth the hassle.	-1
My batch was extremely bad, inconsistent density a lot of bubbles), brittle (breaks much easier than any other PLA filament I have used. I haven't had any luck using it, it is in the dumpster now.	-1
I purchased yellow and red as my guinea pigs, I usually use ABS ( and can't get back to it fast enough). Not sure whether I'm just used to ABS or what, but I had nothing but trouble trying to get decent, even layers with this stuff. I use SAIN ABS and haven't had issues, other than tight windings in some earlier spools, but this stuff was ornery from the start. Some layers needed more heat, some farther in the print needed much less heat, because they were sinking into the prior layers. HATED PLA after three different tries on three different print attempts. Sorry, but that's how it went with me, and I had hoped for a different outcome. I lost two different hot end nozzle holders with fractures that happened due to curling prints. It actually was comical. We had a contest to see what would happen next; a broken holder, a melted layer, prints lifting when PLA isn't supposed to lift. Fan was on from layer two on. I have two rolls of unopened other colors I will be either selling or pounding into paste with a sledge hammer. Probably the latter. ABS is where it's at, as long as you're into ABS slurry to glue it down. Elmer's glue on PLA is a waste of time, as is PLA. Like I wrote; sorry, but that's how it went with me.	-1
Not recommended. I bought this filament to try something different since I usually buy HATCHBOX. To begin with the spool isn't very big and the filament tends to unwind around it causing you to have to monitor. But more importantly, I had multiple extruder clogs-- rare for my printer-- and pretty regular "curling" during bigger, longer builds. Some splitting in when printing big pieces. While one roll may not be indicative of the whole filament line, it'll be a long time before I venture into Sainsmart again.	-1
I believe that DeWalt thinks this tool works.  But it doesn't.  At least not well.  I say this because they sent it to be semi-professionally reviewed after it already had some bad reviews, and there is a tutorial built into the software reiterating all the should-be-common-sense techniques for proper use.  But following all that to a T still yields frustrating results.  I know my house as well as if I built it from scratch.  I have lots of tools by DeWalt, Bosch, and other companies.  I also have an open mind and patience.  I read the manual and I want this tool to work.  But my results have been dismal.  First - plaster and lathe.  They say that since it may be difficult to properly detect things behind plaster, you should look for ferrous metal and you can figure that that is where the studs are.  Unfortunately, ferrous metal shows up constantly, much more often than it should if it were picking up just nail heads.  And it shows up on the screen as vertical bars when scanning horizontally; this makes it very difficult to imagine it might just be a nail head (and let me reiterate that most of the time it shows metal, it is actually a false positive).  It also shows PVC constantly - and there are only three instances of PVC pipe in my walls, so these are all false positives as well.  Is it possible that the electrical cable sheaths (or other cable sheathing) is showing up as PVC?  What about the dielectric in coax cable?  Even if that explains PVC, it doesn't explain all the supposed ferrous metal.  Even if it those two were correct, why doesn't it ever pick up the non-ferrous copper run constantly in my house in the form of electrical and telecom cables?  It does often pick up live electric, although not precisely.  Sometimes, it has live electric where it shouldn't be and it's not usually dead-on.  Admittedly, 90% of my testing has been with plaster and lathe.  So let me absolutely not recommend it for those applications.  But I also tested it in a few other circumstances:  Plaster and lathe directly over bricks shows constant instances of PVC, metal, and even live electric.  I'd feel a lot better if it showed nothing like it should.  However, if you run it over a wood door with nothing on the other side, it does show nothing there, which is one plus.  Drywall over plywood is probably worse than plaster and lathe, but that is to be expected according to the manual.  I had similar experiences with both drywall and tile directly on drywall (not my design):  better, but still not consistent or trustworthy.  It keeps showing ferrous metal too often, and not enough non-ferrous metal.  No consistency with stud finding, although I'd still use it (averaging four or five passes) to guess at stud finding before just making random holes in the walls or ceilings.  I have a traditional stud finder I bought for about forty dollars in the past (and that was a fairly expensive one).  My experince with this radar scanner is extremely similar - I use it but basically don't trust it and still end up putting holes at the wrong places anyway.  This makes me wonder if this actually uses a different technology or not.  The only difference is that this one is a lot more disappointing considering the price.  Does the Bosch version (that looks about the same for twice as much money) actually work?  I have no idea.  And to back this all up, even if it did detect things properly, it only shows straight bars on the screen when it detects something, so it's not like you're getting a true map.  If it worked and then on top of that had multiple sensors to show vertical, horizontal, bends, and curves, that would be what I expect when I have a little LCD screen to look at.  Actually, even if it works, it doesn't need a screen - it just needs a row of LEDs to tell me what is behind the walls.  I do like the ergonomics of the tool.  I like the handle, the rollers, and the indent for making pencil markings on walls.  I like the case and the rechargeable battery that can be used with other tools.  I really want to love this tool, but in reality it's just taking up space in my workshop and - although I'm sure I'll get it out and try it again - I don't think it will ever actually be of any use to me.  I think it goes without saying that I can't recommend this tool.	-1
I am a fan of DEWALT tools. They generally work well and last a long time. I thought this DEWALT scanner would be a really neat thing to add to the tools I already have.  As with all DEWALT tools, this scanner is well-built, has a durable case, stores easily and has a great rechargeable battery. As far as execution goes though, this tool just doesnt do the job. At first, I thought, Wow, this scanner is finding some really great stuff in the walls. But then it fails to find studs, studs that I know are there, studs that I screw into. I don't feel this tool is reliable enough for me to trust. I don't know if its finding phantom things in the walls, but I do know that it misses obvious stuff like two by fours. If it had more consistent and accurate readings, it would certainly be a great tool.	-1
When the scanner is occasionally correct, I can't get it to repeat the same reading. It's readings are all over the place. I scanned remodeled areas of our home where I knew what was in the walls. Running firmly against new drywall it read, "lost contact with surface". It wouldn't recognize a live wire between a junction box and an outlet. With repeated scanning it finally showed something there, but showed a PVC pipe instead. I had similar experiences every where I used the scanner. There's no way I would rely on this scanners accuracy to access a wall or make repairs  I phoned the number on the box to ask a De Walt technician if there was some secret to the scanners accuracy. He said ~ > This (DCT418S1) is the first and only scanner De Walt has released. > There have been complaints of it's lack of accuracy ~ it's been discontinued. > A factory service center wouldn't likely be able to help with this scanners issues. > De Walt is revamping the scanner and intends to announce approx July 2014 the release of a new model. > It's unclear at this time, if the announcement will state the availability to be in 2014 or 2015. > The battery for this scanner will likely fit the new model. (DCB120 current price approx $28.00) > De Walt ~ Stanley ~ Boshstick ~  Black & Decker are all made by the same company. > Products are built for three categories of use, homeowner ~ tradesman (weekend warrior) & industrial.  The on/off button needs held in a couple seconds to come on. The battery is particular to this unit, so it doesn't fit any of my other DeWalt tools. The tool has a 3 year warranty ~ the battery is two years. The booklet is in English ~ French and Spanish  I like the overall design, and the 3 1/2" color screen is very nice. If the scanner worked it would be a very useful tool, not only for contractors, but also for DIY (do-it-yourself) projects.	-1
With all of the false readings being reported, you've got to wonder if this thing is either clairvoyantly looking back in time at long gone houses, or else it's actually one of the worst-marketed but most brilliant-designed planning tools ever.  "No, you don't have conduit there, but I'm telling you...you should add some."  Inconsistent readings are maybe just a sign that it's changing its mind about your best home improvement upgrade.  "Wait...wait...now I see - an indoor spa!  Yes, you'll definitely need live wires here."  Seriously, though.  With all of the reviews from people that have scanned walls that they _know_ what's behind them and gotten bad results, how is anyone supposed to trust this thing?  I've scanned walls that I don't know what's there, and the display is pretty cool - but I don't know if it's right.  My two-star review is based in part on that, but I can say from my own experience that it missed or incorrectly classified a stud in a wall that I know is there (because I installed wall plates on either side of it) every time.  It's 0% for stuff that I know exists, so I'm not going to believe that it's nailing everything else.  So, positive marks for being lightweight and having a nice case, and the display is nice and graphical.  Huge negative marks for accuracy, and a bit of a negative against Dewalt for not putting a screen protector on the unit for shipping - like other people, mine showed up a little scratched from other items in the case.  All of that said, I was torn on what rating to give this, though.  I scanned myself three times, and every time it displayed that I'm a stud.  False readings or not...Five Stars.  Alright, maybe not five stars.  But it was still a good pick-me-up.  :D	-1
Like other reviewers.... lots of areas that it read improperly.  not sure if the unit is a lemon, or the area I used it was causing interference...Dewalt is a solid company, hard to imagine them producing a product that does not deliver...will try it again soon...	-1
I wanted to give this product a higher rating for a couple of reasons.  One, it is very easy to use and has good build quality, and two, because of reason #1 I was hoping that all of the other one-star reviewers had somehow missed something and that this scanner really does detect the hidden items that it claims it will detect.  The scanner comes in a nice box.  The battery pack is easy to connect and even with the battery it is lightweight, yet seems sturdy. The instructions are easy to understand, and it's also an easy scanner to operate and comprehend what the display is indicating is behind the wall.  Unfortunately, the findings can't be trusted.  It's really easy to run the scanner across the wall then drag it back to see what it says is behind the wall, but often when repeating a scan of the same area it does not detect the same items.  It is inconsistent.  Also, it detects items that are not there, as well as fails to detect items that are there.  Because you need to find out what is behind a wall, a product such as this has to be accurate and trustworthy. Based on the inconsistent results I obtained, I can't trust the scanner to reliably tell me what materials are behind that wall, and within a close enough tolerance for accurate location. Without being able to do this, the scanner is pretty much useless.  I was hoping it would work because it is so easy to use.  However, I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers and give it a low rating.  It's not practical to use this scanner because its reliability is suspect.  It's like a politician - it tells you all kinds of stuff but you can't believe it. At least the scanner doesn't have any selfish or ulterior motive like a politician does, though.	-1
I am a huge fan of Dewalt products, and I honestly could not wait to get my hands on this scanner. My first run looked very promising - it was intuitive to use, the display was clean, and the tool felt solidly constructed. Unfortunately, the problems started soon after - it would change its mind on re-scanning the same area, and totally began to make stuff up, when I tested it on a half-finished area.  Avoid if possible.  ~A_E~	-1
I can echo what everyone else has been saying, avoid this device. I just don't understand how they could produce something like this and put it out there when it is so obviously broken. Like many others here I have read over everything, tried resetting it, tired again and again and always get different results. Sometimes it would get stuck on saying it didn't have contact with the wall when it most certainly did. Moving to another wall made of a different material made no difference. I would have to reset it to get it to stop saying that. I tried it on drywall, plaster, wood paneling, and all gave different results each time when multiple passes were made over the same area. It would detect pipes where we knew there were none. It would detect wires where we knew there were none. It has a confidence meter but with such random results over what I tested it on how could I ever trust it?	-1
EPIC FAIL. My unit arrived with tiny dings and scratches in the view screen. It sometimes seems to detect wooden studs with about 50% accuracy, but electric wires keep slithering around from place to place in my walls, and PVC and steel pipes appear mysteriously out of nowhere.  I think it is safe to say that at least a million bucks just got flushed down the toilet at DeWalt. It is mind-boggling and downright scary that circumstances could exist where so many of these units could somehow sneak through multiple layers of R&D testing and production quality control to get into the hands of not only normal customers, but us Vine reviewers as well. I'm having second thoughts about volunteering for that Mars mission now.	-1
When I first tried this scanner I thought Wow! The miracles of modern science.  It was right on, but it was all downhill from there. I re-read the manual, watched the videos, re-set the scanner to factory default.    I built the wall so I know exactly what is behind it. Each scan was different. One scan showed PVC pipes which I finally realized was actually a mirror on the other side of the wall in the other room.  Live wires showed up where there were none.  Yes, I touched the wall in case there was static electricity.  There is a re-set button on the back. Big woop!  Just the S.O.S.  It isn't identified.  If you look on the back of the unit, where the warning label is, there is a circle by the French words certaines identifier.  You use something like a straightened paper clip to stick in this hole to re-set the scanner. That didn't get me much. The scanner started reading no contact with wall although all wheels were right on the wall where they had been for many scans before. I-800-4-DeWalt techs were unable to help. They referred  me to a number for manufacturer, repair, parts. THEY only had the manual not an actual scanner to look at. (sighwiping away tears of frustration).  Great idea but worthless if it doesn't work.  There is no way I would drill in to a wall with MY confidence meter pegging at zero.	-1
I have a half-finished counter-height wall that is the perfect "test wall" for this device.  It is finished on one side, and the beams are exposed on the other side (no drywall yet on one side).  Each time I ran the scanner across the wall, it would show phantom wood beams or conduits between the studs where none exist.  Often, it would show really fat wood beams which are actually thin 2x4s.  The instruction manual says to scan really slow to improve the accuracy, but if you scan slow then the device will complain and tell you to scan above the minimum speed.  I wonder if this really uses a RADAR sensor, or whether the "RADAR" terminology is only for marketing and it just contains a mix of conventional sensors.  Whatever the case, DeWalt must have released this product on the market by accident because it doesn't work.  The other reviews appear to be right on.	-1
I received this scanner today just in time to hang some shelves for my wife. In short, this does not work at all. Not at all. Thinking the problem was me, I reread the directions twice including the troubleshooting section. Then I set up an experiment. I put blue tape on the wall marking location and item this "radar" scanner found. I did three separate scans of the wall following horizontal routes at least two feet away from each other. Not once did any of the wooden studs it found line up. The worst scan had three studs about 4 inches apart and then a gap of about 4 feet where it found nothing was behind the wall. I then took my cheap stud finder and it found that none of the studs the radar device found matched what the stud finder did. A couple of test holes and a tape measure proved the stud finder was spot on and the radar scanner was completely wrong every time. This is a wall with nothing in it but wooden studs. Unfortunately it showed all kinds of stuff in there. Maybe it's confusing sheetrock screws with metal? Maybe the pine studs are not detectable depending on their density? I don't know. I do know, however, that this device was a complete failure and is not ready to be sold.  At first I thought my device was at fault. Then I read it seems everyone who purchased one of these is having the same difficulty. All my other portable tools are Dewalt and I'm generally very loyal to the brand. I owned one drill for 12 years that just broke last month. So I've always been impressed with their reliability. But I'm confused why something like this was ever manufactured.	-1
The ball stopped reinflating so I couldn't use it.  It died after the return period.	-1

how do people like these? they fog up immediately. unwearable.	-1
Fog up really badly on light-duty use	-1

I've used almost every kind of lubricant there is and this is not one of the better ones. I have other dry lubricants that work significantly better and are less money. I tried this on some cabinet door hinges and no difference. I sprayed those same hinges with silicone and all quiet. Maybe I am just using it on the wrong stuff but it says right on the can "ideal for use on; hinges".	-1

I'm sorry, but why is everyone so happy about this? It's $8 for an LDR (Light dependent resistor) Is it the pretty oversized container it comes in? Because below is a link for a 20 pack for the same price.  http://www.amazon.com/20PCS-Photoresistor-GL5537-Resistors-Light-Dependen/dp/B008QVE9BG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391809965&sr=8-1&keywords=light+dependent+resistor	-1
Returned for refund. Screen resolution poor. Contrast poor (adjusts backlight only). Screen washed out in daylight - can't see much outside. One of the 4 LEDs not as bright as the other 3 so in dark areas have to be right on top of object. Even then, images somewhat fuzzy.  Bought Autel instead, which is much - much better as to clarity, resolution, & brightness; plus it'll record.	-1

Good enough for some things, but somewhat annoying limitations.  Cons: *  Difficult to twist the rigid cable so that the camera image is horizontal (it doesn't stay that way even if you're successful).  The orientation button selects between 4 viewing choices:  Wonky angle, inverted wonky angle, mirrored wonky angle, mirrored inverted wonky angle. *  Poor viewing angle, claimed 36 degrees. *  Display resolution is low, grainy, and has video noise/lines.  Worse than any cell-phone camera. *  Color is washed out, almost black & white (there is no color adjustment, but there is a contrast button and LED brightness button). *  LEDs are not bright enough to see very far at highest setting (specs claim 0.5 meters but that presumes you're looking at a white object). *  No support for saving a snapshot to a memory card. *  Does not come with a case.  Ships in a plastic blister-pack which I always find annoying to open.  Pros: *  Low price. *  Works with 4 rechargeable NiMH AA batteries.	-1
Very high quality product except for one flaw:  The speculum falls off during use.  It "screws"' onto the device (kind of) but not in a sincere or secure way. My wife is an RN, and even she could not use the device without the speculum falling off. Who wants a problematic device?  I ordered this based in large part on the reviews, but there is no way this device is usable in the real-world.  Could be a defective unit, but the design of the method of attachment just seems wrong.  A simple threaded end (like on so many other products) would solve this problem.  I have requested a return to Amazon and will order a different product.	-1
I posted a picture in the customer images section showing the light against skin from this otoscope compared to my LED flashlight.  The light from the otoscope has a blue tint and the colors appear flatter (lower apparent CRI - Color Rendition Index) compared to the LED flashlight.  With the flashlight, the skin looks normal and with the otoscope it looks cold and pale.  The LED bulbs with the higher CRI are newer and more expensive, so the manufacturer has slightly older LED bulb technology in this otoscope.  This is significant because it is harder to make out subtle signs of conditions if the colors are not as vibrant.  Other reviewers noticed the same blue LED tint, for example the previous review here from Kenneth S. Raper, MD where he writes "Also the LED is blue-ish instead of white. Very much like the first generation of 'white' LED string Christmas lights that had a blue tint. This makes eardrums and mucous membranes look odd. It makes it difficult to tell how red a throat is, or if an eardrum is a little red or not. Normal pink mucosa (in a blue-ish light) has a slight purple-ish hue. This is really the only disappointment with the product, but it is significant. I expected a white light."  I wanted to like this product because the price is good, but I'm returning this for a different brand with a halogen bulb for more accurate color.  The product package says "Designed in Texas and manufactured exclusively for Innovative Innovations Inc. in China."  Update: after I posted this review, the manufacturer posted messages trying to attack me on a personal level simply because I didn't like the blue LED.  Then I went through other 1, 2, star reviews and found the same rude behavior from the manufacturer in the follow-up comments to legitimate reviews from doctors and nurses.  A quick web search reveals that this company has highly aggressive marketing tactics for low quality Chinese medical knockoffs, with an F rating from the Better Business Bureau.  Some useful information on the Amazon Customer Discussion forums:  - "Always read the negative reviews. Many fraudsters will post hundreds of positive reviews, but the truth can be hidden in that one genuine negative review thread."  - "Always check the time frame of the reviews. Were the majority of positive reviews written over the course of a very short period of time? This is a red flag."  - "Compare the number of reviews with similar, well-known products. If, for example, an unknown company is selling vitamins with more reviews than Centrum or One-a-Day, this is certainly a red flag."	-1
Was in a spot where sun could hit it and the writing seems to now be there forever.  Will not erase.  A real bummer.	-1
I can't give a good rating because I can call the switches because when you push it it doesn't click on or off it just pushes Mr. Tyler	-1
Not a good product sometimes u can get away with being cheap not here. I ended up paying $65 for a indicol and it was well worth it. This one u pretty much need a vise grips to tighten. The indicol can easily by hand. It seems to be the slringy washers that make the difference	-1
Very thick Nitrile gloves! I thought I would like the thicker ones and I'd go through less. But in the end the gloves either tore or chemicals weakened them just the same as the thinner nitrile gloves.  Not really worth the extra $ for the extra mil thickness...	-1
I usually wear medium size, but some reviews mentioned these were a little tight.  I ordered the large size to make sure they would fit.  According to the size chart printed on the box, the medium size should fit my hands, but even the large size is too small for my hands.  I tried to exchange them with x-large or xx-large, but my return windows has expired and now I have a full box that I cannot use.	-1
